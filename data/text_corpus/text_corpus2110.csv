10550,vegetable growers in europe are continually under increasing pressure to optimize irrigation and nutrient management this results from the widespread effects of climate change and of competition from other sectors for water and increasing societal pressure to reduce nutrient contamination of water bodies the widespread and growing adoption of drip irrigation and fertigation provides vegetable growers with the technical infrastructure for greatly improved irrigation and nutrient management however quantitative decisions to achieve optimal irrigation and nutrient management and increasingly of the two together require complex decision making numerous factors regarding climate soil characteristics field infrastructure and crop characteristics need to be considered decision support systems dsss and simulation models are tools that process large and diverse amounts of information to provide irrigation and nutrient recommendations that are specific to individual crops and sites commonly dsss incorporate simulation models which enables site and crop specific assessment and the possibility for dynamic responses to fluctuations in climate etc there is an on going trend for web based dsss that can access on line data bases such as of climate and soil data and that users consult with smartphone apps this article firstly reviews several general aspects regarding the use of dsss models in commercial vegetable production such as how to enhance their user friendliness subsequently it describes dsss models that have been developed or are being used to assist with irrigation or nutrient management or both of vegetable crops the most relevant aspects of these dsss models are highlighted in addition to dsss models for practical on farm management the use of dsss models for scenario analysis to demonstrate theoretical case studies to policy makers growers and advisors is discussed a focus throughout is on how to make these products attractive and effective to potential users the geographical focus is on europe however particularly relevant cases from elsewhere are also considered with the current state of information and communication technology ict and considering the inevitable future developments dsss can provide vegetable growers with effective and user friendly tools to assist them to optimize irrigation and nutrient management keywords dss internet of things digitalization vegetable production nitrogen sustainable production 1 introduction intensive vegetable production systems in europe require appreciable inputs of nitrogen n and commonly of irrigation to ensure high and profitable levels of production with on going climate change there is an increasing requirement for irrigation of vegetable crops in temperate climatic regions e g in northwest europe where previously irrigation was not required there is increasing competition between different economic sectors for the limited supplies of fresh water throughout europe this is particularly strong in southern europe where there is strong competition with the tourist domestic and industrial sectors for the limited fresh water supply gallardo et al 2013 in these drier regions there is often a diminishing supply of good quality water suitable for irrigation this is a consequence of issues such as aquifer depletion intrusion of sea water and soil and aquifer salinization consequently vegetable growers are under increasing pressure to manage irrigation water as efficiently as possible cahn and johnson 2017 fereres et al 2003 vegetable growers are also under increasing pressure to use n fertilizer inputs as efficiently as possible vegetable crops are particularly susceptible to having low n uptake efficiencies i e the percentage of applied fertilizer n that is recovered by the crop thompson et al 2017 soto et al 2015 gallardo et al 2020 low n uptake efficiencies are generally associated with n losses to the environment and subsequent negative environmental impacts certain general characteristics of vegetable cropping contribute to the low n uptake efficiencies these being shallow rooting wide row spacing and the short growing cycle of many species thompson et al 2017 given the general tendency to apply excessive n to ensure that n is not limiting production appreciable losses of n to the environment commonly occur thompson et al 2007 given that irrigation is also generally applied in excess appreciable nitrate no3 leaching loss commonly occurs in vegetable production consequently intensive vegetable production is often associated with no3 contamination of underlying aquifers and with eutrophication of adjacent surface water bodies ramos et al 2002 in europe many areas with intensive vegetable production have been declared to be nitrate vulnerable zones nvz in accordance with the eu nitrate directive anonymous 1991 in nvzs vegetable growers and other farmers are required to improve n and irrigation management in order to reduce regional no3 leaching loss thompson et al 2020 additionally consumers are increasingly demanding vegetable products be produced with minimal negative environmental impacts appreciable reduction of no3 leaching requires improvements in both irrigation and n management thompson et al 2017 this issue numerous quantitative decisions have to be regularly made throughout a crop to achieve appreciably improved irrigation and nutrient management commonly each requires complex decision making with the on going adoption of fertigation irrigation and nutrient management are increasingly combined for optimal irrigation and nutrient management generally numerous factors regarding climate soil and crop characteristics and field infrastructure need to be considered decision support systems dsss are tools that can process large and diverse amounts of information to provide irrigation and nutrient recommendations for vegetable production commonly these dsss incorporate simulation models which enables site and crop specific assessment and the possibility for dynamic responses to fluctuations in climate etc this article firstly reviews several general aspects of dsss used or intended for use in commercial vegetable production secondly it describes dsss developed or in use to assist with irrigation or nutrient management or both of vegetable crops throughout the article a major focus is the identification of features and characteristics that enhance the effectiveness practicality ease of use and adoption of these dsss in the context of commercial vegetable farming 2 models and decision support systems general considerations 2 1 definition of models and decision support systems a simulation model is a mathematical representation of a system in the context of this article we refer to a crop simulation model as a representation of a given crop that grows in a particular soil and climate in crop models the system the real crop is separated into components e g crop soil and climate and major processes are characterized using mathematical equations models can be used for research applications for scenario analysis or for crop management complex mechanistic models are used in research as a way to aggregate knowledge or to supplement costly field experimentations another application of models is to demonstrate to farmers or policy makers the impact of management practices on a crop or the environment a decision support system dss is a computer based information system that supports decision making activities typically providing recommendations an effective dss is an interactive software package that can assist farmers advisors or administrators to make decisions that require the synthesis of numerous and diverse data generally dsss incorporate one or more simulation models that enable the preparation of recommendations that consider crop and site specific factors such as climate planting dates soil types characteristics of irrigation system etc dsss commonly are software packages that include one or more simulation models and communication tools to manage inputs and outputs among systems for data acquisition there may be connection with a specific web services e g satellite imagery real time forecast and retrospective climate data soil data crop characteristics and b sensors providing real time data e g climate soil moisture model based dsss with sensors or tools allows users to verify the model prediction and to refine recommendations nutrient management dsss can also include sub models for nutrient recommendation schemes thompson et al 2017 tei et al this issue and can consider data from approaches used for crop and soil monitoring padilla et al 2020 2 2 the complexity issue an important issue when developing models and model based dsss for practical crop management is the level of complexity of the simulation models increasing complexity generally enhances the accuracy of simulation however it can reduce the likelihood of adoption by increasing data entry requirements traditionally there has been perceived to be a trade off between the accuracy of a dss or simulation model and its practicality this is because growers and advisors have very limited time and are unwilling to spend much time when using a dss consequently these potential users require simple easy to use interfaces and a reduced number of manual data inputs recent developments in accessing data from on line databases climate data soils data and from sensors e g climate soil plant are means by which models can retain complexity and accuracy while maintaining limited manual data input by users simulation models that are integrated into dsss must either a be relatively simple with a small number of relatively available inputs or b be simple to use but with the capacity obtain inputs from on line data bases and from sensors to achieve the higher level of complexity required to enhance the accuracy of simulation 2 3 calibration and validation to ensure the accuracy of simulations by stand alone simulation models or those that are components of dsss calibration and validation of the simulation model for the crop species and cropping conditions are required calibration is required to adjust model coefficients to the specific characteristics of the crop species and growing conditions validation verifies the performance of the calibrated model against measured values validation should be carried out with data sets different from that used for calibration and from a different location ideally once the validated models have been incorporated into the dsss they should be i evaluated under the commercial field conditions for which were designed for and ii compared to local growers practices to assess their benefit e g water and or fertilizer saving economic return mirás avalos et al 2019 2 4 temporal context when using dsss models for irrigation and or fertilizer management the dsss models can be used either to a prepare a plan for irrigation and or fertilization before a crop b prepare recommendations in real time during crop growth or c prepare recommendations for the short term future the temporal nature of dss model operation depends on the type of climate data supplied to the model climate data drives many of the simulations of crop and soil processes historical climate data i e long term average data can be used for the preparation of plans for an entire crop prior to planting the crop for management in real time climate data measured in real time on the farm or obtained from climate network services are used these calculations are actually retrospective often for the most recent several days because they are based on restoring a water deficit that has accumulated since the previous irrigation for recommendations for the short term future forecast weather data can be used to estimate management requirements e g irrigation volume nutrient amounts for a subsequent period of several days the use of historical climate data is suitable in conditions were there is limited inter annual variability such as inside mediterranean greenhouses gallardo et al 2013 2 5 computing environment stand alone or web based systems decision support systems dsss can be either stand alone systems where the program is installed directly on the computing device e g computer smart phone and tablet or web based programs that can be consulted wherever there is an internet connection through a smartphone tablet etc the use of computer technology either in stand alone or web based modes enables numerous and frequent calculations to be made various inputs to be considered the use of stored data records for field and of databases and record keeping web based programs have practical advantages over stand alone programs users can access information from different handheld devices directly in the field and by different users from the same enterprise both stand alone and web based dsss that use real time data require that data be input from sensors and or data bases on a regular or continuous basis the current generation of dsss for assisting with irrigation and nutrient management of crops are increasingly web based with access from computers tablets or smartphones they commonly have automatic retrieval of climate data from on line data bases or climate stations they also can be used to work with remotely sensed data and geographical information systems giss where required acutis et al 2010 smartphone apps are a very effective method to access web based dsss and are now commonly used smartphones are always with the user and commonly the signal of the phone network enables continuous accessibility in the field and other locations with smartphone apps users can be immediately notified of issues requiring attention 2 6 static and dynamic approaches two broad modelling approaches are used for simulation models that are incorporated into dss they are either static in that standard conditions are assumed such as expected yield and average climatic conditions or they are dynamic in that they respond quickly to real time or forecast conditions static approaches require less input data because growth and yield are assumed data bases of long term average climatic data can also be incorporated into the dss so that there is no requirement to input climate data dynamic models simulate growth and production in the context of actual cropping conditions and have the capacity to respond to fluctuations in actual climatic conditions the use of long term average climatic data considerably simplifies the process of data entry however with the rapid developments in information and communication technology ict it is feasible to automatically enter real time and forecast climate data e g from 5 to 7 day forecasts where high frequency nutrient application is employed e g with fertigation drip irrigation this enables n fertilizer planning for weekly periods to be based on real time and forecast climate conditions it also enables adjustment of previous provisional plans based on long term average climatic data dsss that provide output used subsequently for manually programming irrigation and or nutrient application are based on static models while dsss used for automatic control are based on dynamic models 3 models and dsss for irrigation scheduling in vegetables 3 1 general approaches to irrigation scheduling to assist with the determination of the timing and volumes of irrigation of vegetable crops two main approaches are generally used a the water balance method based on estimation of crop evapotranspiration etc and b soil moisture or plant sensors the use of sensors to assess plant water status for irrigation scheduling of vegetable crops has been investigated gallardo et al 2006a b fernández 2014 but there has been very little implementation in commercial production the use of soil moisture sensors for assisting with irrigation scheduling of vegetable crops was reviewed by thompson and gallardo 2003 gallardo et al 2013 de pascale et al 2017 and incrocci et al 2020 in the present article the major focus will be on dsss for irrigation scheduling is of vegetable crops based on the water balance method the water balance is a standard and well established method for irrigation scheduling is allen et al 1998 it estimates irrigation volumes and informs when to irrigate i e irrigation frequency it is easy to use and generally has little cost there is some uncertainty with its recommendations resulting from errors associated with the estimation of its various components using this approach irrigation volumes are etc minus effective rainfall both since the previous irrigation additional irrigation should be applied to consider irrigation application efficiency and the salinity of irrigation water rhoades and loveday 1990 to effectively use the water balance method good estimates of etc are an important requirement 3 2 estimation of crop evapotranspiration the fao56 approach allen et al 1998 is the most established method to determine etc in this approach etc is estimated as the product of a reference evapotranspiration eto derived from local climatic data and b the crop coefficient kc using general or locally derived values allen et al 1998 reference evapotranspiration can be estimated using fao recommended equations e g fao 56 penman monteith allen et al 1998 or using other equations doorenbos and pruitt 1977 calibrated for specific conditions e g fernández et al 2010 to determine kc values two approaches have been proposed by the fao56 allen et al 1998 1 the single coefficient approach that considers soil evaporation and plant transpiration together in a single coefficient and 2 the dual coefficient approach that separately calculates two coefficients one for each of these two components of etc the dual approach is more accurate for daily estimation of etc and is recommended for frequently irrigated vegetable crops allen et al 1998 in vegetable crops with slow initial growth rates such as lettuce kc values are strongly influenced by soil evaporation for these crops models that separately calculate soil evaporation and plant transpiration are recommended cahn and johnson 2017 several dual coefficient models have been developed for vegetable crops gallardo et al 1996 johnson et al 2016 mirás avalos et al 2019 in using the standard fao56 methodology for both the single and dual crop coefficient approaches three constant kc values are used one for each of three different fixed length crop stages allen et al 1998 the use of fixed kc values for fixed length periods is not well suited to vegetable crops because of appreciable variation in planting dates and crop growing period in response to market prices weather conditions cropping cycles and farm management considerations the effects of different cropping dates on kc values are apparent in the very different seasonal evolution of measured kc values for winter and spring planted greenhouse melon crops in fig 1 models have been developed to calculate kc values to deal with the variability of vegetable cropping cycles kc is generally strongly related to crop growth grattan et al 1998 which is strongly influenced by thermal time orgaz et al 2005 developed two simple kc models based on thermal time for greenhouse vegetable crops one for pruned and the other for unpruned crops gallardo et al 1996 developed a kc model for open field lettuce that calculated transpiration from ground cover ground cover was estimated from eto using an empirical model gallardo et al 1996 eto was available from a network of climate stations cimis in california in other studies crop coefficient has been modelled using leaf area index lai measured in situ with a hand held ceptometer as an input baille et al 1994 the requirement for measured lai or measured crop cover data is a major practical limitation as these require time consuming measurements a recent alternative is the use of remote sensing aerial or satellite to obtain normalized difference vegetation index ndvi values to estimate crop canopy cover courault et al 2005 neale et al 2005 which in turn can be used to estimate kc pardossi and incrocci 2011 the eto equations and kc models that enable calculation of etc require climate data the type of climate data determines the nature of the estimation of etc and any subsequent irrigation recommendations etc estimation and irrigation recommendations can be either 1 for the short term future e g in the next few days based on anticipated climate data or 2 immediate based on recent retrospective climatic data anticipated climate data is either historical climatic data average of long term climatic data or forecast climate data e g gavilán et al 2015 historical climate data can be used where climate conditions are particularly stable such as in mediterranean greenhouses bonachela et al 2006 the use of historical climate data has the advantage that an irrigation schedule for the whole crop can be prepared before the crop forecast climate data can be readily used for open field crops in contrast for greenhouse crops there are challenges to model estimate future climatic considerations inside an individual greenhouse from forecast data an approach to use forecast climate data for greenhouses was developed by gavilán et al 2015 immediate recommendations for the day in question can be developed from recent retrospective climate data collected on site or from a nearby climate station this recent retrospective approach has been referred to as using real time data bonachela et al 2006 because it uses measured data regional public services providing irrigation recommendations have been established using this retrospective approach users select the nearest climate station from the local network examples are the cimis network in california http www cimis water ca gov fawn in florida https fawn ifas ufl edu estaciones agroclimáticas of the junta de andalucía in spain https www juntadeandalucia es agriculturaypesca ifapa ria servlet frontcontroller alternatively on farm climate stations are an increasingly affordable option users should be aware that they must be correctly sited and maintained given the mathematically complexity of calculating a etc which involves equations models to calculate both eto and kc and b the water balance computer and spreadsheets programs have been developed since the 1980s to facilitate these calculations these programs incorporate models required to estimate etc calculate the water balance and estimate additional irrigation required to deal with irrigation application efficiency and the salinity of irrigation water the use of computer technology enables numerous and frequent calculations to be made various inputs to be considered access to on line databases e g climate or soil data use of stored data records for a given field and record keeping by incorporating the models into dsss e g software or apps the dss outputs can be used to manually schedule irrigation or can be connected directly to irrigation controllers to automatically activate and stop irrigation additionally sensors measuring soil water or crop water status can provide input data where considered appropriate the use of soil moisture sensors in combination with the water balance method within a dss could be useful to verify etc and water balance calculations 3 3 dsss for managing irrigation in open field vegetable crops this section will consider dsss that were developed for or include vegetable crops the focus will be primarily on european dsss therefore most dsss that have been developed specifically for other types of crops and that have been developed elsewhere will be overlooked some of those of notable relevance will be referred to numerous dsss for irrigation scheduling of field crops including vegetables have been developed by extension services universities research centers and other institutions services involved in management of water resources particularly in the usa in the usa numerous dsss have been developed for individual states or regions e g california and washington state cahn and johnson 2017 additionally dsss have been developed by smaller irrigation districts to provide a service to their member farmers e g montoro et al 2011 and by private advisory companies for either international or local use e g hidrosoph at http www hidrosoph com en index html wise irrisystem at https wiseagrotecnologia com many dsss have been developed within individual publicly financed projects of limited funding and duration unfortunately many of these dsss have effectively disappeared within several years of being produced broken links in internet because of the lack of continuity in funding or motivation the capacities and technical sophistication of dsss for irrigation scheduling has increased rapidly in recent decades in parallel with the development of ict the first dsss in the 1980s and early 1990s were simple spreadsheets or stand alone programs operated on personal computers several early spreadsheet dsss developed for regional application in the usa calculated crop water requirements and irrigation frequency using the water balance cahn and johnson 2017 they required users to obtain eto data from elsewhere and manually enter it into the dss this requirements discouraged use of these dsss in commercial farms one well known and established dss for irrigation scheduling is cropwat smith 1992 http www fao org land water databases and software cropwat en developed by fao to calculate crop water requirements of numerous crop species including vegetables for different management conditions cropwat is often used as an educational tool to teach the principles of irrigation scheduling and for demonstration or planning purposes rather than as field tool for farmers aquacrop steduto et al 2009 is a crop growth model also developed by fao which simulates yield response to water supply in addition to irrigation management it can be used as an educational and benchmarking tool and for scenario analysis for cereal and other field crops including vegetables li et al 2018 in europe a number of dsss for irrigation scheduling of outdoor vegetable crops are available some of which have appreciable numbers of users in italy irrinet mannini et al 2013 climate adapt 2020 is a web service operated by the cer a consortium of irrigation administrators in the emilia romagna region irrinet provides irrigation advice for crops of several vegetable species using the water balance it provides users with irrigation scheduling advice through a web interface sms messages and a tablet app the irrigation advisor dss mirás avalos 2019 which is based on weather forecasts and is able to separately determine soil evaporation and crop transpiration has been recently developed for vegetable crops in the mediterranean coast of spain it has been successfully evaluated in commercial farms in germany the gesenheim irrigation scheduling gs was developed for sprinkler irrigation management of about 27 vegetable crops in central europe olberz et al 2018 this was initially developed as a spreadsheet program a web based version with smartphone app access called gshen is being finalized as of april 2020 in the web based version kc values are calculated from cumulative temperature and eto using the fao56 penman monteith equation with climate data input from the german weather service the most relevant dsss for assisting with irrigation management of vegetable crops open field and greenhouse discussed in this article are presented in table 1 given the large number of dsss available the listed dsss were selected using the criteria of i relatively recent dsss that are currently in use or have high scientific relevance ii dsss with practical application iii being innovative iv being used in europe or are particularly relevant and v detailed descriptions are available 3 4 dsss for irrigation scheduling of greenhouse grown vegetable crops different types of models have been developed for irrigation management of greenhouse grown vegetable crops the type of model complexity and characteristics vary according to the growing media soil or soilless and the level of technology of the greenhouse the required accuracy and time scale for estimation of etc depends on the growing media for soilless crops a very high degree of accuracy and a small time scale e g every minute are required because irrigation is applied on a scale of hours minutes and substrates generally have very small retention of crop available water in soilless crops these models must dynamically respond to short term changes in climate conditions for soil grown crops given the irrigation intervals and greater holding capacity of soils a relatively lower level of accuracy is acceptable generally with soilless crops irrigation is automatic and dynamic models are integrated with the irrigation controllers generally these models calculate accumulated transpiration since the previous irrigation once the calculated accumulated volume of transpiration reaches a threshold value irrigation is automatically initiated the fixed irrigation volume considers additionally a drainage fraction to control root zone salinity in soil grown crops automatic irrigation is uncommon at least currently in mediterranean greenhouses current practice for soil grown crops in mediterranean greenhouses is the use of static models using historical climate incorporated into dsss to provide plans of irrigation that can be formulated when the crop is planted models for greenhouses with heating have to consider night time transpiration that can be an important component of etc in some crops such as cucumber de graaf and van den ende 1981 also the use of screens shading thermal can affect the accurate simulation of etc thompson et al 2015 the models available for irrigation scheduling in greenhouses can be classified into three broad categories 1 simple models based on radiation 2 models based on the energy balance and 3 models that adapt the standard fao56 methodology allen et al 1998 originally developed for outdoor crops to greenhouse grown crops a common characteristic of these three categories of models is that crop water requirements are calculated as the product of two components 1 a climate component that considers the effect of the atmosphere on crop water demand and 2 a crop component that considers how the characteristics of the crop size morphology leaf area etc modify the atmospheric demand for water in some models such as those based on the energy balance these two components are combined in one equation while in models based on the fao56 approach these two components are calculated separately radiation models are based on the high correlation between etc and solar radiation villèle de 1972 generally the input data for these models are solar radiation outside the greenhouse and the transmissivity of the greenhouse roof one of the first models to estimate etc of greenhouse vegetable crops was the radiation model developed by villèle de 1972 for dutch greenhouses it calculates etc from external solar radiation roof transmissivity crop coefficient values and empirical coefficients this model has been used with irrigation controllers however the model of villèle was found to be inadequate for calculations of etc for short periods as required for soilless crops and where active climate control was used bakker 1991 de graaf and van den ende 1981 subsequently developed a simple radiation based crop model for dutch greenhouses with climate control that calculates etc from external solar radiation the difference in temperature between the heating pipes and the greenhouse air and the size of the plants currently for soilless cropping in dutch greenhouses solar radiation equations such as de graaf and van den ende 1981 are used to steer irrigation management but they are supplemented by the use of drainage fractions and weighing scales w voogt wageningen university ad research the netherlands this is discussed in detail by van der salm et al 2020 energy balance models are theoretically the best models to calculate short term rates of etc because of their high precision however they are relatively complex and require measures of i climatic parameters such as radiation and vapor pressure deficit vpd ii crop parameters such as lai which are difficult to obtain and iii foliar and aerodynamic conductance values an example is the model of baille et al 1994 which is a simplification of the penman monteith and has had appreciable use in research however it requires accurate estimation of lai which is a major limitation for practical use medrano and alonso 2007 the fao56 approach has been successfully applied to soil grown crops in low to medium technology plastic greenhouses in the mediterranean region where irrigation is normally applied every 1 4 days various equations to estimate eto in these conditions were evaluated by fernández et al 2010 2011 and reviewed by gallardo et al 2013 incrocci et al 2020 describes in detail the use of the fao 56 approach in greenhouses the prho dss fernández et al 2009 has been developed to calculate daily crop irrigation requirements for the major vegetable crops in almeria spain based on calculation of etc as the product of eto estimated with the almeria radiation equation fernández et al 2010 and kc values estimated by the models described by orgaz et al 2005 historical daily climate data are used for the calculation of daily eto and kc values alternatively real time climatic data can be used a windows version of this dss in spanish is freely available at fundación cajamar 2020 prho dss considers the effect of whitewashing used for greenhouse cooling irrigation requirements consider irrigation water salinity and the application uniformity of irrigation the vegsyst dss is another windows operated dss that calculates irrigation requirements for greenhouse grown vegetable crops in southeast se spain it is described in section 5 3 5 use of dsss for irrigation scheduling in combination with soil and plant sensors model based dsss can be combined with soil and plant sensors to verify model calculations and to adjust the calculations to consider current crop and soil conditions the waterbee system http waterbee da iris cat smart irrigation and water management system recommends irrigation management based on crop modelling combined with soil water content measurements by sensors the irrix dss is a web application developed by irta in catalonia spain casadesús et al 2012 for automatic irrigation scheduling of fruit trees using a water balance to estimate the irrigation requirements and soil water sensors to correct the prediction of the model ground truth and to subsequently recalculate the schedule fig 2 irrix dss can operate autonomously throughout a cropping season casadesús et al 2012 irrix dss has been successfully adapted to greenhouse vegetable crops m d fernández personal communication the hydro tech todorovic et al 2016 is a cloud based application for automatic real time irrigation scheduling based on the water balance the fao56 approach for the estimation of etc using real time or forecast weather is combined with continuous soil water content monitoring and remote control of the water supply network the hydro tech system was tested in commercial farms resulting in 5 20 reductions of applied water todorovic et al 2016 currently this system is promoted by the company blueleaf www blueleaf it 3 6 use of dsss for irrigation scheduling in combination with remote sensing model based dsss can integrate remote sensing images to improve the estimation of crop parameters involved in the calculation of kc values the aquater software is a complex dss based on a simulation model for irrigation scheduling of several species including tomato in semi arid mediterranean areas acutis et al 2010 remote sensing images were used to improve the simulation of lai and therefore of the calculation of etc additionally model based dsss can be integrated with a geographical information system gis to apply the dss on a large scale acutis et al 2010 with the gis it is possible to map the data input and outputs and display soil climate and crop data the spanish dss irrigation advisor ramirez cuesta et al 2018 has the capacity to use satellite images to determine the crop ground cover from measurements of a vegetation index e g ndvi and is implemented in a gis system in australia the irrisat car et al 2012 is a weather based irrigation management technology that uses remote sensing to provide site specific crop water management recommendations across large spatial areas figaro flexible and precision irrigation platform to improve farm scale water productivity http www figaro irrigation net outputs the figaro platform en is a precision agriculture dss based on remote sensing soil sensor measurements and the aquacrop model that enables water and energy savings while maintaining or increasing production 3 7 adoption of dsss for irrigation scheduling a number of examples of widespread use by farmers of individual dsss for irrigation scheduling demonstrates their potential for substantially improvement of irrigation management on a large scale irrinet is used on 16 000 farms mannini et al 2013 leib and elliott 2000 reported that wise a dss for irrigation scheduling in washington state provided recommendations for 120 000 ha of crops per year cropmanage described in section 5 cahn et al 2014 has 1500 registered active farms on the central californian coast and provided 1500 2300 monthly recommendations during the period february to september 2019 m cahn university of california davis personal communication while technically not a dss the iss itap centralized irrigation scheduling service uses a very similar approach to provide recommendations in albacete central spain montoro et al 2011 it is operated by a government agency and provides recommendations to growers by email and sms in 2005 it was being used on 33 500 ha and its use was associated with an appreciable improvement in irrigation practice montoro et al 2011 in all of these successful cases a public or private service provided or provides on going technical support however many dsss produced for irrigation scheduling have had little use on commercial farms the likelihood of adoption can be increased by considering dissemination training and technical support when developing the dss hochman and carberry 2011 developing technical and dissemination plans within a framework combining advisors farmers researchers and software engineers will enhance the possibilities of adoption hochman and carberry 2011 activities to inform and train farmers and to provide support particularly during the first months of use are required to facilitate adoption by farmers barriers to adoption of dsss for irrigation scheduling are limited interest of farmers to reduce water use and the effort required relative to the perceived benefits there appears to be a general reluctance of vegetable growers particularly older growers to adopt new ict based approaches and to change their established procedures regarding decision making for irrigation and nutrient management in summary barriers to the wider adoption by commercial vegetable growers of dsss for irrigation scheduling techniques are i the time required to use the programs ii the practical difficulties associated with the use of software iii the common lack of effective procedures to train and support growers iv the lack of on going technical support and v that growers are reluctant to take what they perceive as a risk with high value crops that are sensitive to crop water stress gallardo et al 2013 cahn and johnson 2017 4 models and dsss to optimize nutrient management this section will deal mostly with n because of its agronomic and environmental importance where other nutrients are dealt with by particular dsss model they will be specifically referred to there are two major general approaches with which simulation models and dsss are used to assist with crop nutrient management namely 1 calculation of fertilizer requirements for individual crops thompson et al 2017 and 2 for scenario analysis to demonstrate the effects of different nutrient management practices on crop response and nutrient losses a third emerging approach is of dsss to interpret crop or soil monitoring measurements e g proximal sensors soil analyses sap analyses incrocci et al 2017 thompson et al 2017 padilla et al 2020 as with irrigation management ddss to assist with nutrient management of diverse crops have available since the late 1980s as modified spread sheets or stand alone computer programs both operated on personal computers thompson et al 1997 a listing of the principal dsss for assisting with nutrient management of vegetable crops reviewed in this article is presented in table 2 4 1 general considerations generally practical dsss for the calculation of crop and site specific fertilizer requirements for individual crops contain relatively simple simulation models with few inputs the information required for those inputs is generally readily available to growers and advisors such dsss have relatively few parameters that require calibration for a particular combination of species site and cropping system examples of practical dsss with these characteristics are cropmanage cahn et al 2014 and vegsyst dss gallardo et al 2014 models used for scenario analysis are generally appreciably more complex with more inputs and parameters e g eu rotate n rahn et al 2010 scenario analysis models are very useful for demonstration purposes but are too complex for practical crop management generally both practical and scenario analysis dsss use daily time steps for the determination of crop n requirements models and dsss generally calculate n balances thompson et al 2017 tei et al this issue and estimate many of the components of the n balance e g crop n uptake mineralized n n losses some n budget components e g n mineralization rates and n losses may be estimated using simple factors relatively simple equations or models total loss can be estimated based on the efficiency of n use e g in vegsyst dss the n efficiency term is the percentage of n sources that is recovered by the crop thompson et al 2017 in more complex models the different n loss processes are individually simulated with sub models that require numerous inputs however estimating individual n loss pathways is complex and composite n loss terms or n efficiency factors are commonly used doing so appreciably reduces the number of dss model inputs a general n efficiency factor can be applied to all n sources or individual n efficiency factors can be applied to each n source considered by the dsss model thompson et al 2017 to model crop n uptake the most commonly used approach is to simulate both crop dry matter production and the n content of the crop the product of the two being the crop n uptake crop n content is often estimated using n dilution curves greenwood et al 1990 the n dilution curves may be for a the critical n content cnc versus dry matter production cnc is the minimum crop n content at which dry matter production is not n limited greenwood et al 1990 or b crop n content of a well fertilized crop where some luxury n uptake occurs other approaches to calculate crop n uptake have been based on expected yield which is an input parameter or more mechanistic models that consider n uptake by roots incrocci et al 2017 different levels of mathematical complexity have been used in these models and dsss the more complex models e g eu rotate n rahn et al 2010 simulate numerous crop and soil processes such as dry matter production crop n uptake yield etc root growth and distribution root n uptake and various components of the soil n and water dynamics and specific n losses gescon is another dss where root growth is modelled and n soil dynamics are simulated elia and conversa 2015 elia et al 2020a b in contrast more practical models and dsss such as the vegsyst dss gallardo et al 2014 simulate a small number of processes related to crop growth n uptake and etc this avoids the complexity associated with modelling root growth soil water dynamics soil n transformations and n losses the alternatives to modelling numerous processes are the use of relatively simplified equations fixed coefficients such as n efficiency terms and a strong focus on the most relevant processes related to n use and demand the more complex models dsss that simulate soil n dynamics commonly have components that simulate etc and soil water dynamics because soil n and water dynamics are closely linked 4 2 models and dsss for practical nutrient management several dsss based on simulation models have been developed in europe to assist with n fertilization of

in europe and cropmanage cahn et al 2014 from california 4 3 models and dsss for scenarios analysis of nutrient management many of the simulation models developed to evaluate the effects of crop nutrient management on production and nutrient loss to the environment are complex scientific models their use has generally been restricted to scientific studies where they are used to aggregate knowledge or to conduct scenario analysis scenario analysis commonly takes two forms being either a demonstration of management consequences to stakeholders or b as an alternative to costly experimental field trials with multiple treatments generally these models simulate n and water dynamics in the crop soil system numerous such models have been developed such as epic williams et al 1984 stics brisson et al 2003 cropsyst stöckle et al 2003 and the dssat group of models jones et al 2003 these models are large and complex with numerous inputs they were generally developed for cereal crops there have been a small number of adaptations to simulate n dynamics in vegetable crops e g cavero et al 1998 rinaldi et al 2007 onofri et al 2009 while they may have appreciable scientific value their practical use value for n management of commercial vegetable crops is limited the comprehensive eu rotate n model rahn et al 2010 was developed to assist with optimal n

calibrated and validated eu rotate n with open field drip irrigated lettuce and escarole and used it in combination with the kns system thompson et al 2017 to optimize n management of lettuce combined use of eu rotate n and the kns system suggested that the n fertilizer could be reduced by 57 compared with local grower practice while maintaining yield suárez rey et al 2016 additionally simulations

fertilizer recommendations cropsyst is an established suite of programs that can analyze production and environmental management at different temporal and spatial scales stockle et al 2003 most studies have been conducted with cereals there has been little work with vegetable crops two exceptions have been giménez et al 2016 with garlic and suárez rey et al 2016 with leafy vegetables giménez et al 2016 evaluated n fertilization strategies with a garlic crop in southern spain suárez rey et al 2016 reported that the inability of cropsyst to consider drip irrigation and fertigation was a major limitation for using it with vegetable crops 4 4 dsss to assist with interpretation of monitoring data the green fert dss incrocci et al 2017 was developed at the university of pisa to assist

software in italian can be freely obtained at http www cespevi it softunipi greenfert html green fert contains a database for interpretation of the aqueous extracts see padilla et al 2020 users can modify the database according to their personal experience it is anticipated that with increasing use of different monitoring techniques to assist in n fertilization padilla et al 2020 that more dsss to assist with interpretation of these data will be produced in the near to intermediate future 4 5 adoption of dsss for nutrient management it is difficult to measure the use of dsss for nutrient management in commercial farming nevertheless it is clear that programs such as azofert n expert cropmanage and gescon are being used to provide nutrient recommendations for numerous commercial farms in the united kingdom planet has been used by many commercial farmers and advisors and there have been thousands of downloads of the smartphone versions of the rb209 fertiliser manual since its release in 2017 5 models and dsss for combined irrigation and nutrient management given that fertigation is being increasingly used with vegetable production a number of recent simulation models and dsss consider both nutrients mostly n and irrigation in the form of practical dsss they provide crop specific recommendations for irrigation and n fertilizer the comprehensive scenario analysis models such as eu rotate n see section 4 3 simulate both n and water dynamics in the crop soil system however these models are not suitable as practical crop management tools and have been described in some detail in section 4 3 the models dsss to be considered here are veg syst dss gescon and fertirrigere from europe and cropmanage from california table 3 the vegsyst dss based on the vegsyst simulation

using such data at the beginning of a crop vegsyst dss can prepare a plan of daily recommended irrigation volume and n concentration for practical purposes the recommended n concentration is also averaged over four weeks to reduce the number of adjustments to the composition of the fertigation solution a stand alone windows version of vegsyst dss in either english or spanish and an explanatory manual are available at http www ual es gruposinv nitrogeno vegsyst dss shtml the vegsyst model has been adapted to open field vegetable crops such as lettuce spinach and processing tomato giménez et al 2019 and a dss for these crops is currently being developed vegsyst dss was used as part of a prescriptive corrective management package granados et al 2013 thompson et al 2017 which appreciably reduced n fertilizer use and substantially reduced no3 leaching from a greenhouse pepper crop compared to conventional local management magán et al 2019 the gescon dss has been recently developed at the university of foggia italy to help improve n management of fertigated open field vegetable crops elia and conversa 2015 currently it has been calibrated for open field tomato conversa et al 2015

by 46 on average with no notable effects on fruit production and quality a pardossi university of pisa personal communication cropmanage is a web based dss for irrigation and nutrient management developed for cool season vegetables in california cahn et al 2014 https cropmanage ucanr edu the vegetable crops currently supported include lettuce broccoli cabbage cauliflower spinach processing tomato and bell pepper the irrigation scheduling algorithm uses real time reference evapotranspiration data from the californian cimis climate station network http cimis water ca gov it uses a dual

minimum optimal soil threshold for each species cahn and johnson 2017 the n fertilizer algorithm generates recommendations based on crop n uptake current soil no3 status and estimated soil n mineralization in on farm experimental trials the use of this software reduced n fertilizer inputs by 30 with respect to the fertilizer practice of growers cahn and johnson 2017 this dss is supported by the university of california cooperative extension service periodically hands on workshops are organised to teach growers how to use the dss and to encourage its adoption 6 conclusions the complexity of decision making in modern intensive vegetable production requires the combined assessment of numerous factors and considerations in the unique context of an individual vegetable crop dsss commonly incorporating simulation models can assist vegetable growers to make these site and crop specific decisions numerous dsss have been developed in recent decades to assist with improving irrigation and nutrient management of vegetable crops the technical sophistication of these dsss has rapidly evolved with the rapid development of ict from simple spreadsheets requiring appreciable manual data entry to smart phone apps that access web based programs that can automatically obtain climate and other data from various on line data bases a feature of the evolving technical sophistication is an appreciable increase in their user friendliness and attractiveness to users while there have been some success stories numerous dsss have had little on going adoption as practical tools reasons for this include the complexity of earlier computer operated spread sheets and programs large manual data entry requirements limited on going funding to maintain the dsss and insufficient training and technical support for users the previously mentioned recent developments in ict combined with internet of things technologies appreciably facilitate the use of dsss additionally the capacity to use forecast climate data enables accurate forward planning for the next week or so with the current general emphasis on the digitalization of modern agriculture there is currently considerable interest in the use of dsss to assist with irrigation and nutrient management smartphone apps provide a means whereby growers will have immediate access to dss generated information and in a form that they accustomed to dealing with however any dsss in whatever format must be based on sound agronomic science any incorporated simulation models should be properly calibrated and validated for the conditions of use considerable care should be taken to ensure that they are easy to use and attractive to would be users that the outputs are readily usable that the dss will be maintained for numerous years and that training and technical support will be continually available to assist users references ramírez cuesta et al 2018 and tei et al 2020 declaration of

10550,vegetable growers in europe are continually under increasing pressure to optimize irrigation and nutrient management this results from the widespread effects of climate change and of competition from other sectors for water and increasing societal pressure to reduce nutrient contamination of water bodies the widespread and growing adoption of drip irrigation and fertigation provides vegetable growers with the technical infrastructure for greatly improved irrigation and nutrient management however quantitative decisions to achieve optimal irrigation and nutrient management and increasingly of the two together require complex decision making numerous factors regarding climate soil characteristics field infrastructure and crop characteristics need to be considered decision support systems dsss and simulation models are tools that process large and diverse amounts of information to provide irrigation and nutrient recommendations that are specific to individual crops and sites commonly dsss incorporate simulation models which enables site and crop specific assessment and the possibility for dynamic responses to fluctuations in climate etc there is an on going trend for web based dsss that can access on line data bases such as of climate and soil data and that users consult with smartphone apps this article firstly reviews several general aspects regarding the use of dsss models in commercial vegetable production such as how to enhance their user friendliness subsequently it describes dsss models that have been developed or are being used to assist with irrigation or nutrient management or both of vegetable crops the most relevant aspects of these dsss models are highlighted in addition to dsss models for practical on farm management the use of dsss models for scenario analysis to demonstrate theoretical case studies to policy makers growers and advisors is discussed a focus throughout is on how to make these products attractive and effective to potential users the geographical focus is on europe however particularly relevant cases from elsewhere are also considered with the current state of information and communication technology ict and considering the inevitable future developments dsss can provide vegetable growers with effective and user friendly tools to assist them to optimize irrigation and nutrient management keywords dss internet of things digitalization vegetable production nitrogen sustainable production 1 introduction intensive vegetable production systems in europe require appreciable inputs of nitrogen n and commonly of irrigation to ensure high and profitable levels of production with on going climate change there is an increasing requirement for irrigation of vegetable crops in temperate climatic regions e g in northwest europe where previously irrigation was not required there is increasing competition between different economic sectors for the limited supplies of fresh water throughout europe this is particularly strong in southern europe where there is strong competition with the tourist domestic and industrial sectors for the limited fresh water supply gallardo et al 2013 in these drier regions there is often a diminishing supply of good quality water suitable for irrigation this is a consequence of issues such as aquifer depletion intrusion of sea water and soil and aquifer salinization consequently vegetable growers are under increasing pressure to manage irrigation water as efficiently as possible cahn and johnson 2017 fereres et al 2003 vegetable growers are also under increasing pressure to use n fertilizer inputs as efficiently as possible vegetable crops are particularly susceptible to having low n uptake efficiencies i e the percentage of applied fertilizer n that is recovered by the crop thompson et al 2017 soto et al 2015 gallardo et al 2020 low n uptake efficiencies are generally associated with n losses to the environment and subsequent negative environmental impacts certain general characteristics of vegetable cropping contribute to the low n uptake efficiencies these being shallow rooting wide row spacing and the short growing cycle of many species thompson et al 2017 given the general tendency to apply excessive n to ensure that n is not limiting production appreciable losses of n to the environment commonly occur thompson et al 2007 given that irrigation is also generally applied in excess appreciable nitrate no3 leaching loss commonly occurs in vegetable production consequently intensive vegetable production is often associated with no3 contamination of underlying aquifers and with eutrophication of adjacent surface water bodies ramos et al 2002 in europe many areas with intensive vegetable production have been declared to be nitrate vulnerable zones nvz in accordance with the eu nitrate directive anonymous 1991 in nvzs vegetable growers and other farmers are required to improve n and irrigation management in order to reduce regional no3 leaching loss thompson et al 2020 additionally consumers are increasingly demanding vegetable products be produced with minimal negative environmental impacts appreciable reduction of no3 leaching requires improvements in both irrigation and n management thompson et al 2017 this issue numerous quantitative decisions have to be regularly made throughout a crop to achieve appreciably improved irrigation and nutrient management commonly each requires complex decision making with the on going adoption of fertigation irrigation and nutrient management are increasingly combined for optimal irrigation and nutrient management generally numerous factors regarding climate soil and crop characteristics and field infrastructure need to be considered decision support systems dsss are tools that can process large and diverse amounts of information to provide irrigation and nutrient recommendations for vegetable production commonly these dsss incorporate simulation models which enables site and crop specific assessment and the possibility for dynamic responses to fluctuations in climate etc this article firstly reviews several general aspects of dsss used or intended for use in commercial vegetable production secondly it describes dsss developed or in use to assist with irrigation or nutrient management or both of vegetable crops throughout the article a major focus is the identification of features and characteristics that enhance the effectiveness practicality ease of use and adoption of these dsss in the context of commercial vegetable farming 2 models and decision support systems general considerations 2 1 definition of models and decision support systems a simulation model is a mathematical representation of a system in the context of this article we refer to a crop simulation model as a representation of a given crop that grows in a particular soil and climate in crop models the system the real crop is separated into components e g crop soil and climate and major processes are characterized using mathematical equations models can be used for research applications for scenario analysis or for crop management complex mechanistic models are used in research as a way to aggregate knowledge or to supplement costly field experimentations another application of models is to demonstrate to farmers or policy makers the impact of management practices on a crop or the environment a decision support system dss is a computer based information system that supports decision making activities typically providing recommendations an effective dss is an interactive software package that can assist farmers advisors or administrators to make decisions that require the synthesis of numerous and diverse data generally dsss incorporate one or more simulation models that enable the preparation of recommendations that consider crop and site specific factors such as climate planting dates soil types characteristics of irrigation system etc dsss commonly are software packages that include one or more simulation models and communication tools to manage inputs and outputs among systems for data acquisition there may be connection with a specific web services e g satellite imagery real time forecast and retrospective climate data soil data crop characteristics and b sensors providing real time data e g climate soil moisture model based dsss with sensors or tools allows users to verify the model prediction and to refine recommendations nutrient management dsss can also include sub models for nutrient recommendation schemes thompson et al 2017 tei et al this issue and can consider data from approaches used for crop and soil monitoring padilla et al 2020 2 2 the complexity issue an important issue when developing models and model based dsss for practical crop management is the level of complexity of the simulation models increasing complexity generally enhances the accuracy of simulation however it can reduce the likelihood of adoption by increasing data entry requirements traditionally there has been perceived to be a trade off between the accuracy of a dss or simulation model and its practicality this is because growers and advisors have very limited time and are unwilling to spend much time when using a dss consequently these potential users require simple easy to use interfaces and a reduced number of manual data inputs recent developments in accessing data from on line databases climate data soils data and from sensors e g climate soil plant are means by which models can retain complexity and accuracy while maintaining limited manual data input by users simulation models that are integrated into dsss must either a be relatively simple with a small number of relatively available inputs or b be simple to use but with the capacity obtain inputs from on line data bases and from sensors to achieve the higher level of complexity required to enhance the accuracy of simulation 2 3 calibration and validation to ensure the accuracy of simulations by stand alone simulation models or those that are components of dsss calibration and validation of the simulation model for the crop species and cropping conditions are required calibration is required to adjust model coefficients to the specific characteristics of the crop species and growing conditions validation verifies the performance of the calibrated model against measured values validation should be carried out with data sets different from that used for calibration and from a different location ideally once the validated models have been incorporated into the dsss they should be i evaluated under the commercial field conditions for which were designed for and ii compared to local growers practices to assess their benefit e g water and or fertilizer saving economic return mirás avalos et al 2019 2 4 temporal context when using dsss models for irrigation and or fertilizer management the dsss models can be used either to a prepare a plan for irrigation and or fertilization before a crop b prepare recommendations in real time during crop growth or c prepare recommendations for the short term future the temporal nature of dss model operation depends on the type of climate data supplied to the model climate data drives many of the simulations of crop and soil processes historical climate data i e long term average data can be used for the preparation of plans for an entire crop prior to planting the crop for management in real time climate data measured in real time on the farm or obtained from climate network services are used these calculations are actually retrospective often for the most recent several days because they are based on restoring a water deficit that has accumulated since the previous irrigation for recommendations for the short term future forecast weather data can be used to estimate management requirements e g irrigation volume nutrient amounts for a subsequent period of several days the use of historical climate data is suitable in conditions were there is limited inter annual variability such as inside mediterranean greenhouses gallardo et al 2013 2 5 computing environment stand alone or web based systems decision support systems dsss can be either stand alone systems where the program is installed directly on the computing device e g computer smart phone and tablet or web based programs that can be consulted wherever there is an internet connection through a smartphone tablet etc the use of computer technology either in stand alone or web based modes enables numerous and frequent calculations to be made various inputs to be considered the use of stored data records for field and of databases and record keeping web based programs have practical advantages over stand alone programs users can access information from different handheld devices directly in the field and by different users from the same enterprise both stand alone and web based dsss that use real time data require that data be input from sensors and or data bases on a regular or continuous basis the current generation of dsss for assisting with irrigation and nutrient management of crops are increasingly web based with access from computers tablets or smartphones they commonly have automatic retrieval of climate data from on line data bases or climate stations they also can be used to work with remotely sensed data and geographical information systems giss where required acutis et al 2010 smartphone apps are a very effective method to access web based dsss and are now commonly used smartphones are always with the user and commonly the signal of the phone network enables continuous accessibility in the field and other locations with smartphone apps users can be immediately notified of issues requiring attention 2 6 static and dynamic approaches two broad modelling approaches are used for simulation models that are incorporated into dss they are either static in that standard conditions are assumed such as expected yield and average climatic conditions or they are dynamic in that they respond quickly to real time or forecast conditions static approaches require less input data because growth and yield are assumed data bases of long term average climatic data can also be incorporated into the dss so that there is no requirement to input climate data dynamic models simulate growth and production in the context of actual cropping conditions and have the capacity to respond to fluctuations in actual climatic conditions the use of long term average climatic data considerably simplifies the process of data entry however with the rapid developments in information and communication technology ict it is feasible to automatically enter real time and forecast climate data e g from 5 to 7 day forecasts where high frequency nutrient application is employed e g with fertigation drip irrigation this enables n fertilizer planning for weekly periods to be based on real time and forecast climate conditions it also enables adjustment of previous provisional plans based on long term average climatic data dsss that provide output used subsequently for manually programming irrigation and or nutrient application are based on static models while dsss used for automatic control are based on dynamic models 3 models and dsss for irrigation scheduling in vegetables 3 1 general approaches to irrigation scheduling to assist with the determination of the timing and volumes of irrigation of vegetable crops two main approaches are generally used a the water balance method based on estimation of crop evapotranspiration etc and b soil moisture or plant sensors the use of sensors to assess plant water status for irrigation scheduling of vegetable crops has been investigated gallardo et al 2006a b fernández 2014 but there has been very little implementation in commercial production the use of soil moisture sensors for assisting with irrigation scheduling of vegetable crops was reviewed by thompson and gallardo 2003 gallardo et al 2013 de pascale et al 2017 and incrocci et al 2020 in the present article the major focus will be on dsss for irrigation scheduling is of vegetable crops based on the water balance method the water balance is a standard and well established method for irrigation scheduling is allen et al 1998 it estimates irrigation volumes and informs when to irrigate i e irrigation frequency it is easy to use and generally has little cost there is some uncertainty with its recommendations resulting from errors associated with the estimation of its various components using this approach irrigation volumes are etc minus effective rainfall both since the previous irrigation additional irrigation should be applied to consider irrigation application efficiency and the salinity of irrigation water rhoades and loveday 1990 to effectively use the water balance method good estimates of etc are an important requirement 3 2 estimation of crop evapotranspiration the fao56 approach allen et al 1998 is the most established method to determine etc in this approach etc is estimated as the product of a reference evapotranspiration eto derived from local climatic data and b the crop coefficient kc using general or locally derived values allen et al 1998 reference evapotranspiration can be estimated using fao recommended equations e g fao 56 penman monteith allen et al 1998 or using other equations doorenbos and pruitt 1977 calibrated for specific conditions e g fernández et al 2010 to determine kc values two approaches have been proposed by the fao56 allen et al 1998 1 the single coefficient approach that considers soil evaporation and plant transpiration together in a single coefficient and 2 the dual coefficient approach that separately calculates two coefficients one for each of these two components of etc the dual approach is more accurate for daily estimation of etc and is recommended for frequently irrigated vegetable crops allen et al 1998 in vegetable crops with slow initial growth rates such as lettuce kc values are strongly influenced by soil evaporation for these crops models that separately calculate soil evaporation and plant transpiration are recommended cahn and johnson 2017 several dual coefficient models have been developed for vegetable crops gallardo et al 1996 johnson et al 2016 mirás avalos et al 2019 in using the standard fao56 methodology for both the single and dual crop coefficient approaches three constant kc values are used one for each of three different fixed length crop stages allen et al 1998 the use of fixed kc values for fixed length periods is not well suited to vegetable crops because of appreciable variation in planting dates and crop growing period in response to market prices weather conditions cropping cycles and farm management considerations the effects of different cropping dates on kc values are apparent in the very different seasonal evolution of measured kc values for winter and spring planted greenhouse melon crops in fig 1 models have been developed to calculate kc values to deal with the variability of vegetable cropping cycles kc is generally strongly related to crop growth grattan et al 1998 which is strongly influenced by thermal time orgaz et al 2005 developed two simple kc models based on thermal time for greenhouse vegetable crops one for pruned and the other for unpruned crops gallardo et al 1996 developed a kc model for open field lettuce that calculated transpiration from ground cover ground cover was estimated from eto using an empirical model gallardo et al 1996 eto was available from a network of climate stations cimis in california in other studies crop coefficient has been modelled using leaf area index lai measured in situ with a hand held ceptometer as an input baille et al 1994 the requirement for measured lai or measured crop cover data is a major practical limitation as these require time consuming measurements a recent alternative is the use of remote sensing aerial or satellite to obtain normalized difference vegetation index ndvi values to estimate crop canopy cover courault et al 2005 neale et al 2005 which in turn can be used to estimate kc pardossi and incrocci 2011 the eto equations and kc models that enable calculation of etc require climate data the type of climate data determines the nature of the estimation of etc and any subsequent irrigation recommendations etc estimation and irrigation recommendations can be either 1 for the short term future e g in the next few days based on anticipated climate data or 2 immediate based on recent retrospective climatic data anticipated climate data is either historical climatic data average of long term climatic data or forecast climate data e g gavilán et al 2015 historical climate data can be used where climate conditions are particularly stable such as in mediterranean greenhouses bonachela et al 2006 the use of historical climate data has the advantage that an irrigation schedule for the whole crop can be prepared before the crop forecast climate data can be readily used for open field crops in contrast for greenhouse crops there are challenges to model estimate future climatic considerations inside an individual greenhouse from forecast data an approach to use forecast climate data for greenhouses was developed by gavilán et al 2015 immediate recommendations for the day in question can be developed from recent retrospective climate data collected on site or from a nearby climate station this recent retrospective approach has been referred to as using real time data bonachela et al 2006 because it uses measured data regional public services providing irrigation recommendations have been established using this retrospective approach users select the nearest climate station from the local network examples are the cimis network in california http www cimis water ca gov fawn in florida https fawn ifas ufl edu estaciones agroclimáticas of the junta de andalucía in spain https www juntadeandalucia es agriculturaypesca ifapa ria servlet frontcontroller alternatively on farm climate stations are an increasingly affordable option users should be aware that they must be correctly sited and maintained given the mathematically complexity of calculating a etc which involves equations models to calculate both eto and kc and b the water balance computer and spreadsheets programs have been developed since the 1980s to facilitate these calculations these programs incorporate models required to estimate etc calculate the water balance and estimate additional irrigation required to deal with irrigation application efficiency and the salinity of irrigation water the use of computer technology enables numerous and frequent calculations to be made various inputs to be considered access to on line databases e g climate or soil data use of stored data records for a given field and record keeping by incorporating the models into dsss e g software or apps the dss outputs can be used to manually schedule irrigation or can be connected directly to irrigation controllers to automatically activate and stop irrigation additionally sensors measuring soil water or crop water status can provide input data where considered appropriate the use of soil moisture sensors in combination with the water balance method within a dss could be useful to verify etc and water balance calculations 3 3 dsss for managing irrigation in open field vegetable crops this section will consider dsss that were developed for or include vegetable crops the focus will be primarily on european dsss therefore most dsss that have been developed specifically for other types of crops and that have been developed elsewhere will be overlooked some of those of notable relevance will be referred to numerous dsss for irrigation scheduling of field crops including vegetables have been developed by extension services universities research centers and other institutions services involved in management of water resources particularly in the usa in the usa numerous dsss have been developed for individual states or regions e g california and washington state cahn and johnson 2017 additionally dsss have been developed by smaller irrigation districts to provide a service to their member farmers e g montoro et al 2011 and by private advisory companies for either international or local use e g hidrosoph at http www hidrosoph com en index html wise irrisystem at https wiseagrotecnologia com many dsss have been developed within individual publicly financed projects of limited funding and duration unfortunately many of these dsss have effectively disappeared within several years of being produced broken links in internet because of the lack of continuity in funding or motivation the capacities and technical sophistication of dsss for irrigation scheduling has increased rapidly in recent decades in parallel with the development of ict the first dsss in the 1980s and early 1990s were simple spreadsheets or stand alone programs operated on personal computers several early spreadsheet dsss developed for regional application in the usa calculated crop water requirements and irrigation frequency using the water balance cahn and johnson 2017 they required users to obtain eto data from elsewhere and manually enter it into the dss this requirements discouraged use of these dsss in commercial farms one well known and established dss for irrigation scheduling is cropwat smith 1992 http www fao org land water databases and software cropwat en developed by fao to calculate crop water requirements of numerous crop species including vegetables for different management conditions cropwat is often used as an educational tool to teach the principles of irrigation scheduling and for demonstration or planning purposes rather than as field tool for farmers aquacrop steduto et al 2009 is a crop growth model also developed by fao which simulates yield response to water supply in addition to irrigation management it can be used as an educational and benchmarking tool and for scenario analysis for cereal and other field crops including vegetables li et al 2018 in europe a number of dsss for irrigation scheduling of outdoor vegetable crops are available some of which have appreciable numbers of users in italy irrinet mannini et al 2013 climate adapt 2020 is a web service operated by the cer a consortium of irrigation administrators in the emilia romagna region irrinet provides irrigation advice for crops of several vegetable species using the water balance it provides users with irrigation scheduling advice through a web interface sms messages and a tablet app the irrigation advisor dss mirás avalos 2019 which is based on weather forecasts and is able to separately determine soil evaporation and crop transpiration has been recently developed for vegetable crops in the mediterranean coast of spain it has been successfully evaluated in commercial farms in germany the gesenheim irrigation scheduling gs was developed for sprinkler irrigation management of about 27 vegetable crops in central europe olberz et al 2018 this was initially developed as a spreadsheet program a web based version with smartphone app access called gshen is being finalized as of april 2020 in the web based version kc values are calculated from cumulative temperature and eto using the fao56 penman monteith equation with climate data input from the german weather service the most relevant dsss for assisting with irrigation management of vegetable crops open field and greenhouse discussed in this article are presented in table 1 given the large number of dsss available the listed dsss were selected using the criteria of i relatively recent dsss that are currently in use or have high scientific relevance ii dsss with practical application iii being innovative iv being used in europe or are particularly relevant and v detailed descriptions are available 3 4 dsss for irrigation scheduling of greenhouse grown vegetable crops different types of models have been developed for irrigation management of greenhouse grown vegetable crops the type of model complexity and characteristics vary according to the growing media soil or soilless and the level of technology of the greenhouse the required accuracy and time scale for estimation of etc depends on the growing media for soilless crops a very high degree of accuracy and a small time scale e g every minute are required because irrigation is applied on a scale of hours minutes and substrates generally have very small retention of crop available water in soilless crops these models must dynamically respond to short term changes in climate conditions for soil grown crops given the irrigation intervals and greater holding capacity of soils a relatively lower level of accuracy is acceptable generally with soilless crops irrigation is automatic and dynamic models are integrated with the irrigation controllers generally these models calculate accumulated transpiration since the previous irrigation once the calculated accumulated volume of transpiration reaches a threshold value irrigation is automatically initiated the fixed irrigation volume considers additionally a drainage fraction to control root zone salinity in soil grown crops automatic irrigation is uncommon at least currently in mediterranean greenhouses current practice for soil grown crops in mediterranean greenhouses is the use of static models using historical climate incorporated into dsss to provide plans of irrigation that can be formulated when the crop is planted models for greenhouses with heating have to consider night time transpiration that can be an important component of etc in some crops such as cucumber de graaf and van den ende 1981 also the use of screens shading thermal can affect the accurate simulation of etc thompson et al 2015 the models available for irrigation scheduling in greenhouses can be classified into three broad categories 1 simple models based on radiation 2 models based on the energy balance and 3 models that adapt the standard fao56 methodology allen et al 1998 originally developed for outdoor crops to greenhouse grown crops a common characteristic of these three categories of models is that crop water requirements are calculated as the product of two components 1 a climate component that considers the effect of the atmosphere on crop water demand and 2 a crop component that considers how the characteristics of the crop size morphology leaf area etc modify the atmospheric demand for water in some models such as those based on the energy balance these two components are combined in one equation while in models based on the fao56 approach these two components are calculated separately radiation models are based on the high correlation between etc and solar radiation villèle de 1972 generally the input data for these models are solar radiation outside the greenhouse and the transmissivity of the greenhouse roof one of the first models to estimate etc of greenhouse vegetable crops was the radiation model developed by villèle de 1972 for dutch greenhouses it calculates etc from external solar radiation roof transmissivity crop coefficient values and empirical coefficients this model has been used with irrigation controllers however the model of villèle was found to be inadequate for calculations of etc for short periods as required for soilless crops and where active climate control was used bakker 1991 de graaf and van den ende 1981 subsequently developed a simple radiation based crop model for dutch greenhouses with climate control that calculates etc from external solar radiation the difference in temperature between the heating pipes and the greenhouse air and the size of the plants currently for soilless cropping in dutch greenhouses solar radiation equations such as de graaf and van den ende 1981 are used to steer irrigation management but they are supplemented by the use of drainage fractions and weighing scales w voogt wageningen university ad research the netherlands this is discussed in detail by van der salm et al 2020 energy balance models are theoretically the best models to calculate short term rates of etc because of their high precision however they are relatively complex and require measures of i climatic parameters such as radiation and vapor pressure deficit vpd ii crop parameters such as lai which are difficult to obtain and iii foliar and aerodynamic conductance values an example is the model of baille et al 1994 which is a simplification of the penman monteith and has had appreciable use in research however it requires accurate estimation of lai which is a major limitation for practical use medrano and alonso 2007 the fao56 approach has been successfully applied to soil grown crops in low to medium technology plastic greenhouses in the mediterranean region where irrigation is normally applied every 1 4 days various equations to estimate eto in these conditions were evaluated by fernández et al 2010 2011 and reviewed by gallardo et al 2013 incrocci et al 2020 describes in detail the use of the fao 56 approach in greenhouses the prho dss fernández et al 2009 has been developed to calculate daily crop irrigation requirements for the major vegetable crops in almeria spain based on calculation of etc as the product of eto estimated with the almeria radiation equation fernández et al 2010 and kc values estimated by the models described by orgaz et al 2005 historical daily climate data are used for the calculation of daily eto and kc values alternatively real time climatic data can be used a windows version of this dss in spanish is freely available at fundación cajamar 2020 prho dss considers the effect of whitewashing used for greenhouse cooling irrigation requirements consider irrigation water salinity and the application uniformity of irrigation the vegsyst dss is another windows operated dss that calculates irrigation requirements for greenhouse grown vegetable crops in southeast se spain it is described in section 5 3 5 use of dsss for irrigation scheduling in combination with soil and plant sensors model based dsss can be combined with soil and plant sensors to verify model calculations and to adjust the calculations to consider current crop and soil conditions the waterbee system http waterbee da iris cat smart irrigation and water management system recommends irrigation management based on crop modelling combined with soil water content measurements by sensors the irrix dss is a web application developed by irta in catalonia spain casadesús et al 2012 for automatic irrigation scheduling of fruit trees using a water balance to estimate the irrigation requirements and soil water sensors to correct the prediction of the model ground truth and to subsequently recalculate the schedule fig 2 irrix dss can operate autonomously throughout a cropping season casadesús et al 2012 irrix dss has been successfully adapted to greenhouse vegetable crops m d fernández personal communication the hydro tech todorovic et al 2016 is a cloud based application for automatic real time irrigation scheduling based on the water balance the fao56 approach for the estimation of etc using real time or forecast weather is combined with continuous soil water content monitoring and remote control of the water supply network the hydro tech system was tested in commercial farms resulting in 5 20 reductions of applied water todorovic et al 2016 currently this system is promoted by the company blueleaf www blueleaf it 3 6 use of dsss for irrigation scheduling in combination with remote sensing model based dsss can integrate remote sensing images to improve the estimation of crop parameters involved in the calculation of kc values the aquater software is a complex dss based on a simulation model for irrigation scheduling of several species including tomato in semi arid mediterranean areas acutis et al 2010 remote sensing images were used to improve the simulation of lai and therefore of the calculation of etc additionally model based dsss can be integrated with a geographical information system gis to apply the dss on a large scale acutis et al 2010 with the gis it is possible to map the data input and outputs and display soil climate and crop data the spanish dss irrigation advisor ramirez cuesta et al 2018 has the capacity to use satellite images to determine the crop ground cover from measurements of a vegetation index e g ndvi and is implemented in a gis system in australia the irrisat car et al 2012 is a weather based irrigation management technology that uses remote sensing to provide site specific crop water management recommendations across large spatial areas figaro flexible and precision irrigation platform to improve farm scale water productivity http www figaro irrigation net outputs the figaro platform en is a precision agriculture dss based on remote sensing soil sensor measurements and the aquacrop model that enables water and energy savings while maintaining or increasing production 3 7 adoption of dsss for irrigation scheduling a number of examples of widespread use by farmers of individual dsss for irrigation scheduling demonstrates their potential for substantially improvement of irrigation management on a large scale irrinet is used on 16 000 farms mannini et al 2013 leib and elliott 2000 reported that wise a dss for irrigation scheduling in washington state provided recommendations for 120 000 ha of crops per year cropmanage described in section 5 cahn et al 2014 has 1500 registered active farms on the central californian coast and provided 1500 2300 monthly recommendations during the period february to september 2019 m cahn university of california davis personal communication while technically not a dss the iss itap centralized irrigation scheduling service uses a very similar approach to provide recommendations in albacete central spain montoro et al 2011 it is operated by a government agency and provides recommendations to growers by email and sms in 2005 it was being used on 33 500 ha and its use was associated with an appreciable improvement in irrigation practice montoro et al 2011 in all of these successful cases a public or private service provided or provides on going technical support however many dsss produced for irrigation scheduling have had little use on commercial farms the likelihood of adoption can be increased by considering dissemination training and technical support when developing the dss hochman and carberry 2011 developing technical and dissemination plans within a framework combining advisors farmers researchers and software engineers will enhance the possibilities of adoption hochman and carberry 2011 activities to inform and train farmers and to provide support particularly during the first months of use are required to facilitate adoption by farmers barriers to adoption of dsss for irrigation scheduling are limited interest of farmers to reduce water use and the effort required relative to the perceived benefits there appears to be a general reluctance of vegetable growers particularly older growers to adopt new ict based approaches and to change their established procedures regarding decision making for irrigation and nutrient management in summary barriers to the wider adoption by commercial vegetable growers of dsss for irrigation scheduling techniques are i the time required to use the programs ii the practical difficulties associated with the use of software iii the common lack of effective procedures to train and support growers iv the lack of on going technical support and v that growers are reluctant to take what they perceive as a risk with high value crops that are sensitive to crop water stress gallardo et al 2013 cahn and johnson 2017 4 models and dsss to optimize nutrient management this section will deal mostly with n because of its agronomic and environmental importance where other nutrients are dealt with by particular dsss model they will be specifically referred to there are two major general approaches with which simulation models and dsss are used to assist with crop nutrient management namely 1 calculation of fertilizer requirements for individual crops thompson et al 2017 and 2 for scenario analysis to demonstrate the effects of different nutrient management practices on crop response and nutrient losses a third emerging approach is of dsss to interpret crop or soil monitoring measurements e g proximal sensors soil analyses sap analyses incrocci et al 2017 thompson et al 2017 padilla et al 2020 as with irrigation management ddss to assist with nutrient management of diverse crops have available since the late 1980s as modified spread sheets or stand alone computer programs both operated on personal computers thompson et al 1997 a listing of the principal dsss for assisting with nutrient management of vegetable crops reviewed in this article is presented in table 2 4 1 general considerations generally practical dsss for the calculation of crop and site specific fertilizer requirements for individual crops contain relatively simple simulation models with few inputs the information required for those inputs is generally readily available to growers and advisors such dsss have relatively few parameters that require calibration for a particular combination of species site and cropping system examples of practical dsss with these characteristics are cropmanage cahn et al 2014 and vegsyst dss gallardo et al 2014 models used for scenario analysis are generally appreciably more complex with more inputs and parameters e g eu rotate n rahn et al 2010 scenario analysis models are very useful for demonstration purposes but are too complex for practical crop management generally both practical and scenario analysis dsss use daily time steps for the determination of crop n requirements models and dsss generally calculate n balances thompson et al 2017 tei et al this issue and estimate many of the components of the n balance e g crop n uptake mineralized n n losses some n budget components e g n mineralization rates and n losses may be estimated using simple factors relatively simple equations or models total loss can be estimated based on the efficiency of n use e g in vegsyst dss the n efficiency term is the percentage of n sources that is recovered by the crop thompson et al 2017 in more complex models the different n loss processes are individually simulated with sub models that require numerous inputs however estimating individual n loss pathways is complex and composite n loss terms or n efficiency factors are commonly used doing so appreciably reduces the number of dss model inputs a general n efficiency factor can be applied to all n sources or individual n efficiency factors can be applied to each n source considered by the dsss model thompson et al 2017 to model crop n uptake the most commonly used approach is to simulate both crop dry matter production and the n content of the crop the product of the two being the crop n uptake crop n content is often estimated using n dilution curves greenwood et al 1990 the n dilution curves may be for a the critical n content cnc versus dry matter production cnc is the minimum crop n content at which dry matter production is not n limited greenwood et al 1990 or b crop n content of a well fertilized crop where some luxury n uptake occurs other approaches to calculate crop n uptake have been based on expected yield which is an input parameter or more mechanistic models that consider n uptake by roots incrocci et al 2017 different levels of mathematical complexity have been used in these models and dsss the more complex models e g eu rotate n rahn et al 2010 simulate numerous crop and soil processes such as dry matter production crop n uptake yield etc root growth and distribution root n uptake and various components of the soil n and water dynamics and specific n losses gescon is another dss where root growth is modelled and n soil dynamics are simulated elia and conversa 2015 elia et al 2020a b in contrast more practical models and dsss such as the vegsyst dss gallardo et al 2014 simulate a small number of processes related to crop growth n uptake and etc this avoids the complexity associated with modelling root growth soil water dynamics soil n transformations and n losses the alternatives to modelling numerous processes are the use of relatively simplified equations fixed coefficients such as n efficiency terms and a strong focus on the most relevant processes related to n use and demand the more complex models dsss that simulate soil n dynamics commonly have components that simulate etc and soil water dynamics because soil n and water dynamics are closely linked 4 2 models and dsss for practical nutrient management several dsss based on simulation models have been developed in europe to assist with n fertilization of vegetable crops e g n expert fink and scharpf 1993 feller et al 2011 azofert parneaudeau et al 2009 machet et al 2017 vegsyst dss gallardo et al 2011 2016 and gecon elia and conversa 2015 common to these dsss is the overall objective of using mineral n fertilizer as a supplement to soil n sources e g soil organic matter crop residues manure and that the supplemental amount of mineral n fertilizer is sufficient to ensure maximum production while minimizing n loss the french azofert system is used to provide n recommendations for numerous vegetable crops and cereals parneaudeau et al 2009 machet et al 2017 it has been adapted to various regions of france belgium and switzerland maltas et al 2015 machet et al 2017 azofert uses a n balance approach to prepare a n fertilizer recommendation crop n uptake is based on expected yield and standard crop n content values most of the n balance terms are modelled such as n mineralization from various sources and the n loss terms of immobilization no3 leaching and ammonia nh3 volatilization soil mineral n at the beginning of the crop can be measured machet et al 2017 azofert is a windows program that operates in stand alone mode or as a web based program it has been designed to integrate with data management systems used by french agricultural laboratories machet et al 2017 azofert facilitates user friendliness through a reduced number of inputs and a practical focus the german n expert is a windows based program used to provide n recommendations for numerous vegetable crops and cereals fink and scharpf 1993 feller 2015 n expert also assists growers and fertilizer advisers to calculate p k and mg fertilizer requirement of vegetable crops and to prepare nutrient balances for n p k and mg the n fertilizer recommendations and the nutrient balances are required by german law the n recommendations are based on the kns system thompson et al 2017 n expert contains an updated database of nutrient uptake for all relevant field vegetable crops and for numerous other crops that are grown in crop rotations with vegetables the n expert software and associated information are available in english and german

languages and can be downloaded at http www uco es fitotecnia fertilicalc html nitrogen recommendations are based on the expected yield and consideration of soil n supply a dss that calculates n fertilizer recommendations for leafy vegetables has been developed in italy massa et al 2013 the simulation model within this dss calculates the optimal amount of mineral n in the root zone to ensure maximum production while avoiding an excessive n supply the n fertilizer recommendations that are subsequently calculated are the amounts required to maintain the optimal soil mineral n content in the root zone this dss is based on the daily simulation of crop n uptake and a daily n balance calculation the dss was successfully tested in spinach massa et al 2013 several dsss that calculate both crop n and irrigation requirements for fertigated vegetable crops have been developed and are reviewed in section 5 these dsss include gescon elia and conversa 2015 and vegsyst dss gallardo et al 2014 2016 in europe and cropmanage cahn et al 2014 from california 4 3 models and dsss for scenarios analysis of nutrient management many of the simulation models developed to evaluate the effects of crop nutrient management on production and nutrient loss to the environment are complex scientific models their use has generally been restricted to scientific studies where they are used to aggregate knowledge or to conduct scenario analysis scenario analysis commonly takes two forms being either a demonstration of management consequences to stakeholders or b as an alternative to costly experimental field trials with multiple treatments generally these models simulate n and water dynamics in the crop soil system numerous such models have been developed such as epic williams et al 1984 stics brisson et al 2003 cropsyst stöckle et al 2003 and the dssat group of models jones et al 2003 these models are large and complex with numerous inputs they were generally developed for cereal crops there have been a small number of adaptations to simulate n dynamics in vegetable crops e g cavero et al 1998 rinaldi et al 2007 onofri et al 2009 while they may have appreciable scientific value their practical use value for n management of commercial vegetable crops is limited the comprehensive eu rotate n model rahn et al 2010 was developed to assist with optimal n management of a wide range of vegetable and field crops throughout europe rahn et al 2010 for many vegetable species eu rotate n simulates crop growth and marketable yield crop n uptake and etc and performs economic analyses it models n mineralization from various sources considers soil mineral n and models various n loss processes eu rotate n has been used to simulate growth production and n and water dynamics in diverse european vegetable production systems e g cool season species in open field conditions in germany nendel 2009 open field vegetable crops in mediterranean conditions doltra and muñoz 2010 and greenhouse grown vegetables in se spain soto et al 2014 2018 by comparing scenarios eu rotate n can also be used to identify optimal n management suárez rey et al 2016 calibrated and validated eu rotate n with open field drip irrigated lettuce and escarole and used it in combination with the kns system thompson et al 2017 to optimize n management of lettuce combined use of eu rotate n and the kns system suggested that the n fertilizer could be reduced by 57 compared with local grower practice while maintaining yield suárez rey et al 2016 additionally simulations suggested that no3 leaching and residual soil mineral n would be considerably reduced suárez rey et al 2016 this study demonstrated how eu rotate n can be used to identify and demonstrate optimal n fertilizer recommendations cropsyst is an established suite of programs that can analyze production and environmental management at different temporal and spatial scales stockle et al 2003 most studies have been conducted with cereals there has been little work with vegetable crops two exceptions have been giménez et al 2016 with garlic and suárez rey et al 2016 with leafy vegetables giménez et al 2016 evaluated n fertilization strategies with a garlic crop in southern spain suárez rey et al 2016 reported that the inability of cropsyst to consider drip irrigation and fertigation was a major limitation for using it with vegetable crops 4 4 dsss to assist with interpretation of monitoring data the green fert dss incrocci et al 2017 was developed at the university of pisa to assist growers using the dutch 1 2 vol soil water extract method sonneveld et al 1990 sonneveld and voogt 2009 padilla et al 2020 for different vegetable species grown in soil in greenhouses in italy this software in italian can be freely obtained at http www cespevi it softunipi greenfert html green fert contains a database for interpretation of the aqueous extracts see padilla et al 2020 users can modify the database according to their personal experience it is anticipated that with increasing use of different monitoring techniques to assist in n fertilization padilla et al 2020 that more dsss to assist with interpretation of these data will be produced in the near to intermediate future 4 5 adoption of dsss for nutrient management it is difficult to measure the use of dsss for nutrient management in commercial farming nevertheless it is clear that programs such as azofert n expert cropmanage and gescon are being used to provide nutrient recommendations for numerous commercial farms in the united kingdom planet has been used by many commercial farmers and advisors and there have been thousands of downloads of the smartphone versions of the rb209 fertiliser manual since its release in 2017 5 models and dsss for combined irrigation and nutrient management given that fertigation is being increasingly used with vegetable production a number of recent simulation models and dsss consider both nutrients mostly n and irrigation in the form of practical dsss they provide crop specific recommendations for irrigation and n fertilizer the comprehensive scenario analysis models such as eu rotate n see section 4 3 simulate both n and water dynamics in the crop soil system however these models are not suitable as practical crop management tools and have been described in some

developed for cool season vegetables in california cahn et al 2014 https cropmanage ucanr edu the vegetable crops currently supported include lettuce broccoli cabbage cauliflower spinach processing tomato and bell pepper the irrigation scheduling algorithm uses real time reference evapotranspiration data from the californian cimis climate station network http cimis water ca gov it uses a dual crop coefficient approach described by johnson et al 2016 and smith et al 2016 crop coefficients are calculated using an empirical model of canopy cover the empirical models of fractional cover included for each vegetable crop allows users to customize kc curves for a specific season bed width and planting configuration the estimation of irrigation intervals and volumes considers the soil water holding characteristics of the root zone nitrogen management with cropmanage is based on adding sufficient n in periodic e g weekly applications to maintain root zone soil mineral n close to a minimum optimal soil threshold for each species cahn and johnson 2017 the n fertilizer algorithm generates recommendations based on crop n uptake current soil no3 status and estimated soil n

by the university of california cooperative extension service periodically hands on workshops are organised to teach growers how to use the dss and to encourage its adoption 6 conclusions the complexity of decision making in modern intensive vegetable production requires the combined assessment of numerous factors and considerations in the unique context of an individual vegetable crop dsss commonly incorporating simulation models can assist vegetable growers to make these site and crop specific decisions numerous dsss have been developed in recent decades to assist with improving irrigation and nutrient management of vegetable crops the technical sophistication of these dsss has rapidly evolved with the rapid development of ict from simple spreadsheets requiring appreciable manual data entry to smart phone apps that access web based programs that can automatically obtain climate and other data from various on line data bases a feature of the evolving technical sophistication is an appreciable increase in their user friendliness and attractiveness to users while there have been some success stories numerous dsss have had little on going adoption as practical tools reasons for this include the complexity of earlier computer operated spread sheets and programs large manual data entry requirements limited on going funding to maintain the dsss and insufficient training and technical support for users the previously mentioned recent developments in ict combined with internet of things technologies appreciably facilitate the use of dsss additionally the capacity to use forecast climate data enables accurate forward planning for the next week or so with the current general emphasis on the digitalization of modern agriculture there is currently considerable interest in the use of dsss to assist with irrigation and nutrient management smartphone apps provide a means whereby growers will have immediate access to dss generated information and in a form that they accustomed to dealing with however any dsss in whatever format must be based on sound agronomic science any incorporated simulation models should be properly calibrated and validated for the conditions of use considerable care should be taken to ensure that they are easy to use and attractive to would be users that the outputs are readily usable that the dss will be maintained for numerous years and that training and technical support will be continually available to assist users references ramírez cuesta et al 2018 and tei et al 2020 declaration of

10551,the guanzhong plain in china is particularly sensitive to climate change owing to its fragile ecological environment and geographic features as a result climate change is affecting the production of winter wheat in this area in this study we used simclim climate model with the csm ceres wheat model to determine the impact of the climate change on the projected agricultural production of winter wheat in the guanzhong plain for 2020 2040 2060 2080 and 2100 projections scenarios for three global climate models gcms bcc csm 1 csiro mk3 6 0 and gfdl cm3 and one greenhouse gas concentration pathway rcp 4 5 were chosen the results showed a warming trend in the guanzhong plain for both maximum and minimum temperature for the different gcms although rainfall varied the projected rainfall showed an increasing trend for february june and december and a decreasing trend for april september and october the solar radiation for the baoji and weinan area showed an upward trend while the solar radiation in wugong was greatly reduced the maturity date of winter wheat for the three locations was reduced by 2 3 14 9 days compared with the reference year for different climate change scenarios water requirements of the winter wheat for the three locations under different gcms were all increased compared with the reference year overall winter wheat yield in wugong and weinan increased for the different gcms scenarios during the 21st century keywords winter wheat climate change yield csm ceres wheat model 1 introduction future climate change is projected to be one of the major challenges for regional agricultural production worldwide the global average temperature has increased about 0 74 c for the past century and it is expected to increase further about 2 0 c 5 4 c by 2100 ipcc 2007 tao et al 2008 generally the increase in both maximum and minimum temperature might increase the water requirement for both rainfed and irrigated crops and could also increase the risk of heat stress during flowering for crops grown during the winter and spring such as wheat and barley sommer et al 2013 wheat triticum aestivum l is the most widely grown crop and cultivated on 220 million ha of farmland across the word http www fao org about 21 of the world s food depends on the wheat crop however global wheat production is facing challenges from global warming water shortages and other factors tao and zhang 2013 in addition as a crop that prefers a relatively cool temperature wheat growth and yield could be affected by climate change in many regions of the world wheat production is projected to decrease due to climate warming and changes in precipitation asseng et al 2015 2011 the growing evidence from various regions in the world has shown marked phenological changes in response to rising temperatures resulting in accelerated developmental rate and a shortened spring wheat growing season mo et al 2016 moreover since both climate change and an increase in atmospheric co2 concentration vary impacts of these factors on wheat growth and yields are complex and diverse karimi et al 2018 therefore the vulnerability of wheat production in the future has become of key concern as some regions could experience an increase in yield while other regions could experience a decrease in yield kristensten et al 2011 olesen et al 2011 the effects of climatic change on crop growth and productivity have been studied using data based on long term historical field experiments peng et al 2004 tao et al 2006 additionally in order to assess the effects of climate change on crop phenology water demand and production and to provide adaptation strategies climate models have been coupled with crop models yan et al 2018 yang and mao 2018 process

three gcms and one representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios 4 5 were used to simulate the potential long term effects of future climate change on winter wheat phenology water demand and grain yields for different projections the specific objectives of this study were 1 to predict climate change based on different gcms from 2020 2100 2 to determine the potential impact of climate change for the projected years on rainfed winter wheat phenology and grain yield for three locations in the guanzhong plain and 3 to determine the relationship between climate variables and winter wheat yield 2 method and materials 2 1 study area winter wheat is one of the major food crops in china accounting for 90 of total wheat production the guanzhong plain located in shaanxi province is one of the most ancient agricultural regions in china the double cropping rotation of summer maize and winter wheat is the dominant cropping system in the region the study area is located in a continental monsoon climate zone with uneven rainfall distribution three different precipitation regions from west to east in the guanzhong plain were selected as the study sites for this study fig 1 baoji 34 38 n 107 15 e wugong 34 38 n 107 15 e and weinan 34 38 n 107 15 e the long term mean annual rainfall ranges from 330 to 620 mm and the reference evapotranspiration ranges from 400 to 550 mm respectively and more than 60 of rainfall is concentrated between july to september the altitude of the area ranges between 300 and 620 m above sea level 2 2 climate model simclim http www climsystems com simclim is an integrated model that can be customized by users to examine the effects and adaptations to climate variability and change including extreme climate events simclim supports both spatial and site time series analyses warrick 2009 simclim 2013 yin et al 2013 relies mainly on the ipcc cmip5 datasets the baseline period generally ranges from 1986 to 2005 centered on 1995 although it can also use 1961 1990 as the baseline period in this study we used 1961 1990 as the baseline period most of the basic spatial dataset baseline and future in simclim 2013 is run at the global scale of 0 5 0 5 resolution the climate projections for different spatial scales can be generated from 1991 to 2100 the effects of greenhouse gas concentration not emissions trajectories are analyzed using four rcps rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 rcp 6 0 and rc p8 5 as adopted by the ipcc for its fifth assessment report ar5 ipcc 2014 the four rcps are named after a possible range of radiative forcing values in the year 2100 of 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 w m2 respectively simclim 2013 can display climate change information either for a single gcm or an ensemble of multiple gcms simclim offers an easy and intuitive way

winter wheat yield prediction the csm ceres wheat model simulates the growth and development productivity water and nitrogen balances for wheat jones et al 2003 based on crop genetics including cultivar specific parameters or cultivar coefficients it is one of the most widely used crop models included in the dssat hoogenboom et al 2011 2019 jones et al 2003 the csm ceres wheat model has been evaluated extensively for basic decision support management and yield or water use predictions in china he et al 2013 ji et al 2014 li et al 2016 zheng et al 2016b in this study dssat version 4 6 hoogenboom et al 2011 was used to predict the number of days to maturity water use and productivity of winter wheat for the climate projections for 2020 2040 2060 2080 and 2100 for rainfed conditions for locations at baoji wugong and weinan the minimum inputs for the csm ceres wheat model are daily weather data soil profile characteristics cultivar genetics and crop management such as planting date plant population row spacing planting depth etc at each location hunt and boote 1998 hoogenboom et al 2012 the weather inputs for the ceres wheat model include daily precipitation maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin and solar radiation long term 1984 2013 daily records of rainfall tmax tmin and sunshine hours for the three locations were obtained from china meteorological data service center cmdc http data cma cn as reference years daily solar radiation was determined based on a multivariate stochastic process using the observed daylight sunshine hours through wgen weather generator in the dssat version 4 6 crop systems model garcia et al 2008 the weather inputs for simulating future projections were the reference weather data that modified based on simclim all of the four scenarios have different path shapes and emission targets and both rcp 4 5 and rcp 6 0 belong to the middle end scenario in this study we selected rcp 4 5 for its precedence over rcp 6 0 chen and lin 2011 bao et al 2015a recommends that at least three gcms should be selected in case the prediction is limited to a narrow representation of future climate therefore the three gcms selected for the present study were the beijing climate center china meteorological administration s model bcc csm1 1 bcc the queensland climate change centre of excellence and commonwealth scientific and industrial research organization s model csiro mk3 6 0 csiro and the noaa geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory s model gfdl cm3 gfdl five resulting projections for weather data for 2020 2040 2060 2080 and 2100 for baoji wugong and weinnan were generated with simclim soil types and associated profile surface and generic soil information were obtained from the china soil database csd the soil types for the trial sites were silty clay loam for baoji and wugong and a clay loam for weinan more information about model calibration and evaluation can be found in zheng et al 2017 and zheng et al 2016b the single cultivar xiaoyan22 the most common cultivar in the guanzhong plain was used for all three locations the simulated number of days to maturity grain yield and water use in the projections 2020 2040 2060 2080 and 2100 were compared with the reference years 1984 2013 3 results 3 1 climate projections the climate change patterns including monthly solar radiation precipitation maximum temperature tmax and minimum temperature tmin for the projections for 2020 2040 2060 2080 and 2100 were obtained using simclim for baoji wugong and weinan the changes were defined with respect to the baseline for the period 1961 1990 and the values varied by location month and the respective gcms that were used monthly solar radiation showed both a decrease and increase from the baseline depending upon which of the three gcms was used in general the projections based on the csiro showed both the largest increase and decrease in solar radiation there was a moderate change in solar radiation for the projections based on the gfdl and the smallest change in solar radiation was for the projections based on the bcc similarly the greatest change in monthly precipitation from the baseline was found for the projections based on the csiro followed by the gfdl and bcc monthly tmax and tmin increased from 2020 2100 compared with the baseline for the projections for all three gcms and the variation was similar for baoji the findings regarding changes in solar radiation monthly precipitation and tmax and tmin illustrated in fig 2 the change in monthly solar radiation from the baseline was small and the change in different projections was the same based on the bcc an extreme change occurred for september october and november based on the csiro which increased by 9 2 21 7 11 1 24 0 and then decreased by 14 6 17 9 the simulated change based on gfdl was intermediate between bcc and csiro the smallest change in monthly precipitation from the baseline ranged from 0 9 to 1 9 for february for different projections based on the bcc while the largest increase was ranged from 33 7 46 9 for june the largest increase in monthly precipitation ranged from 37 4 76 2 for december for different projections based on the csiro followed by june which increased 34 9 50 2 for different projections for the gfdl the prediction trend was similar with the bcc however the amplitude of variation in each month showed little difference the simulated tmax based on the three gcms all increased compared with the baseline based on the bcc the increase in temperature varied from 0 4 c for august to 2 2 c for february for 2020 and from 1 4 c for august to 3 0 c for february for 2100 while the increase in temperature varied from 0 7 c for june to 3 0 c for february for 2020 and from 2 1 c for june to 5 3 c for september for 2100 based on csiro based on gfdl the increase in temperature varied from 0 8 c for june and august to 2 6 c for february for 2020 and from 1 4 c for may to 4 1 c for september for 2100 for wugong the findings regarding changes in solar radiation monthly precipitation and tmax and tmin illustrated in fig 3 generally the changes from the baseline in monthly solar radiation for wugong for the projections were larger than baoji and decreased compared to the baseline an extreme change in solar radiation occurred in januray which decreased by 17 3 14 9 compared to the baseline based on three gcms the change in precipitation for august and june showed the largest increase among the different projections ranging from 27 7 for 2020 to 45 5 for 2100 and 30 5 for 2020 to 45 4 for 2100 respectively the tmax increased from 2 5 c for 2020 to 4 6 c for 2100 for february and from 2 2 c for 2020 to 4 0 c for 2100 for september based on the csiro and gfdl respectively the changes from baseline in monthly tmin for wugong were similar among the three gcms for weinan the findings regarding changes in solar radiation monthly precipitation and tmax and tmin illustrated in fig 4 in general the changes for weinan for the projections for 2020 2100 were similar to those for baoji with a few exceptions the projected solar radiation in june decreased based on three gcms and the increase was less than 20 based on the gfdl the largest change in solar radiation occurred from 1 8 for 2020 to 2 4 for 2100 the change in monthly precipitation decreased by 26 4 in september for 2100 and followed by a decrease in may of 24 6 for 2100 based on the bcc the largest change in precipitation based on the csiro was in december which was 35 7 for 2020 and 90 1 for 2100 while the largest change in precipitation based on the gfdl was for january which was 23 for 2020 and 51 3 for 2100 the increase in temperature based on gfdl was the largest followed by csiro and bcc the increase in the monthly tmax ranged from 0 5 c to 1 5 c for 2020 and and 0 9 c 3 5 c for 2100 based on bcc from 0 6 c to 1 9 c for 2020 and 2 0 c 4 4 c for 2100 based on csiro from 0 6 c to 1 4 c for 2020 and 1 1 c 3 1 c for 2100 based on gfdl 3 2 wheat phenology projections the number of days to maturity under rainfed conditions was simulated for the reference years and for the projections of 2020 2040 2060 2080 and 2100 each of the projections contained simulations for 30 years and the analysis is based on the average of 30 years to determine the potential impact of climate change the number of days to maturity was simulated for the 30 years of reference weather data for each location fig 5 for baoji the number of days to maturity for the three gcms was similar ranging from 222 to 231 222 232 and 225 232 days for the bcc csiro and gfdl respectively the change in number of days to maturity showed a decreasing trend based on all the gcms and the largest change was 13 2 days less than the reference years the changes in number of days to maturity for wugong and weinan for the projections were similar to those for baoji which decreased compared to the reference years for all the gcms the largest change occurred in 2080 and 2100 with a decrease of 14 3 days based on csiro for wugong and occurred in 2080 with a decrease of 14 9 days based on csiro for weinan the number of days to maturity in all the areas decreased compared to the reference years and it was clear that the increase in temperature was the major driver for the decrease in the number of days to maturity for the three locations because of the smaller increase in monthly mean temperature based on gfdl as compared to bcc and csiro the number of days to maturity was also smaller based on gfdl in baooji while in wugong and weinan the decrease in the number of days to maturity based on bcc was intermediate between csiro and gfdl reflecting the fact that bcc also projected an intermediate increase in monthly temperature fig 3 3 3 evapotranspiration projections average water demands for winter wheat was simulated for the 30 years of the reference data for baoji wugong and weinan with evapotranspiration et values of 312 0 mm 280 5 mm and 356 3 mm respectively simulated water demand for the winter wheat growth stage for the projections from 2020 2100 showed significant changes due to the effects of climate change fig 6 for baoji the et value changed from 11 6 mm 27 0 mm compared to the reference simulation and for all the gcms the water demand of the growth stage decreased from 2020 2100 for the same period et for wugong was similar to baoji and the change varied from 11 7 mm to 35 mm for the different gcm projections however for the same period for weinan the increase in et was greater for the projections based on the csiro and gfdl compared to the reference simulation the simulated et for weinan was much larger than those two locations was due to the wheat grown in weinan had a longer growing period 3 4 winter wheat yield projections as discussed earlier the historical weather data were modified with the climate change patterns using the outputs of the three gcms coupled with rcp 4 5 scenario in three locations and the projections were used for the prediction of winter wheat yield by using ceres wheat model rather than analyzing the absolute wheat yield predictions our analysis was based on the differences between the wheat simulations for the reference years and those for 2020 2040 2060 2080 and 2100 projections based on three gcm patterns fig 7 in general the number of days to maturity in the study area decreased compared to the reference years because of the increase in temperature while yield increased due to the increase in precipitation and co2 concentration for the future projections for baoji the change in grain yield was 22 1 3 5 based on the csiro for 2060 and gfdl for 2020 the grain yield showed a decreasing trend from 2020 to 2060 and then it increased from 2060 to 2100 the decrease in yield with respect to the reference simulations was always larger for the csiro than for the other two gcms reflecting the fact that csiro also projected larger decrease in precipitation compared to baoji for wugong the increase in yield was 6 8 21 7 based on the bcc and gfdl while the change in yield ranged from 7 8 to 0 4 based on the csiro similarly this was due to csiro generated the smallest increase in precipitation among the three gcms so the increase in rainfed yield was the lowest however the trend of change in yield for weinan was little different from those for baoji and wugong while the grain yield based on the three gcms increased from 2020 2100 projections the yield simulated by all the gcms decreased before the 2060 projection compared with the reference year the increases in yield for the 2060 and subsequent projections were larger than for the 2040 and 2020 projections because of the larger increase in precipitation and co2 concentration for the 2060 and the subsequent projections the grain yield based on the csiro showed an increasing trend from the 2020 projection to the 2060 projection with a slight decrease for the 2080 projection the change in yield ranged from 7 to 7 5 7 2 10 8 and 4 9 19 based on bcc csiro and gfdl compared to bcc the increase in rainfed yield based on gfdl was larger because of the larger increase in precipitation but showed a similar trend 4 discussion in this study the combination of different gcm outputs and the greenhouse gas emission scenario were used to assess the effects of climate change and its effect on winter wheat maturity dates water use and grain yield across the guanzhong plain the number of days to maturity decreased for all the locations in general there are many environmental factors that control crop phenology such as temperature photo period water and nutrient status etc however temperature is considered to be the main factor mcmaster and wilhelm 1997 our simulations indicated a reduction of the period from sowing to maturity ranging from 2 3 14 9 days according to climate change projection and site fig 5 the csiro predicted that the number of days to maturity for baoji would be reduced from 235 2 222 days from 233 3 219 days for wugong and from 288 9 275 days for weinan for the 2100 projection compared to the reference years which was the largest decreasing among the three gcms this shortening effect was due to the warming climates rather than to the water shortage since the primary effect of rainfall change and water availability on grain yield simulated by ceres wheat and by the majority of crop growth models is through limitations on growth with no effect on crop development rate such as maturity date dettori et al 2017 the results of our study are also consistent with those of moriondo and bindi 2007 who found a general reduction of the crop growing period of winter cereals i e barley and wheat in the entire mediterranean region in response to a 2 c increase in temperature with a decrease of the duration of the growing season ranging from 1 2 days in tunisia to 12 2 days in serbia the number of days to harvest maturity for the study area decreased for the different scenarios thus also decreasing potential growth and yield due to a shorter growing season the result are in agreement with the widely accepted evidence that shortening of the growth length is one of the main effects of climate change on crops and it is one of the primary causes of projected decreases in yield parry et al 2005 for the projection prior to 2060 the yield for baoji showed a larger decrease compared to the yield for wugong and weinan the yield based on the bcc and csiro models was less than the reference year for the projections while the gfdl model showed larger than the reference year this could be due to the variability in temperature for baoji especially in december and january during the normally dormant phase of winter wheat a significant increase in temperature could lead to rapid development of winter wheat during the early growth stage and an increase in tillering this in turn could lead to the decline of heading rate and decrease yield yield normally decreases for wet and cool sites because of a reduction in vegetative development lai and thus potential intercepted radiation and consequently a lower biomass production over the course of the growing season wang et al 2017 in our study yield decreased when temperature was either too low or too high with higher temperatures resulting in a significant reduction in yield in addition there was also an interaction among the temperature rainfall and co2 concentration on wheat yields ludwig and asseng 2006 different studies qu et al 2019 ventrella et al 2012 explored the projected positive effect of slight temperature increase on wheat grain yield possibly determined by the positive response of crops to elevated co2 concentration in the atmosphere i e increase in photosynthesis rate or water saving effect the evidences from the experiments indicated that increase in co2 concentration could offset the negative effects even enhance the positive effects of future climate change on productivity of cereal crop caused due to the co2 fertilization effect parry et al 2004 it was reported that the wheat yield would keep increasing until the co2 concentrate elevated to 890 ppm concluded by fitting both field and laboratory data a least squares cubic equation amthor 2001 however the present study did not take into account the physiological effect of projected high levels of co2 focusing the analysis on the impacts of changes in climate variables precipitation is an important meteorological factor affecting winter wheat growth and yield the seasonal distribution of precipitation in the guanzhong plain is uneven and the water demand of winter wheat varies for the different growth phases precipitation early and late during the growing season only has small effect on the grain yield while precipitation during the middle of the growing season such as the jointing stage and flowering stage has a significant positive effect on the final grain yield this study of winter wheat in northwest china showed that except for february the monthly total precipitation during the winter months was positively correlated with wheat yield while the precipitation during fallow period in june july and august was negatively correlated with wheat yield zhang et al 1996 in this study the response of winter wheat in the guanzhong plain to climate change under different scenarios showed differences due to the climate projections the decrease in the number of days to maturity was mainly caused by an increase in temperature similar to the findings of alexandrov and hoogenboom 2000 yield for baoji showed a decrease in yield with the decrease in yield getting larger for projections later in the century yield for wugong increased by 20 while yield for weinan increased gradually but showed the largest increase for all three sites of up to 41 our results are slightly different from yang et al 2014 who showed that the grain yield for rainfed wheat increased for most of china compared with the reference year 5 conclusion the present study found that future rainfall increased in february june and december and decreased in april september and october for the guanzhong plain maximum and minimum temperature for most months increased compared to the baseline with the largest increase in temperature for september and february for all the three locations the number of days to maturity decreased on average by 2 15 days based on three gcms while yield showed an increase after 2060 projection overall this study found that the impact of climate change on winter wheat grown under rainfed conditions in the guanzhong plain was positive while the impact differed among locations and some of the gcm projections some of the variability was due to the rainfed conditions that are more sensitive to climate change due to the uncertainty of future rainfall temperature solar radiation

10551,the guanzhong plain in china is particularly sensitive to climate change owing to its fragile ecological environment and geographic features as a result climate change is affecting the production of winter wheat in this area in this study we used simclim climate model with the csm ceres wheat model to determine the impact of the climate change on the projected agricultural production of winter wheat in the guanzhong plain for 2020 2040 2060 2080 and 2100 projections scenarios for three global climate models gcms bcc csm 1 csiro mk3 6 0 and gfdl cm3 and one greenhouse gas concentration pathway rcp 4 5 were chosen the results showed a warming trend in the guanzhong plain for both maximum and minimum temperature for the different gcms although rainfall varied the projected rainfall showed an increasing trend for february june and december and a decreasing trend for april september and october the solar radiation for the baoji and weinan area showed an upward trend while the solar radiation in wugong was greatly reduced the maturity date of winter wheat for the three locations was reduced by 2 3 14 9 days compared with the reference year for different climate change scenarios water requirements of the winter wheat for the three locations under different gcms were all increased compared with the reference year overall winter wheat yield in wugong and weinan increased for the different gcms scenarios during the 21st century keywords winter wheat climate change yield csm ceres wheat model 1 introduction future climate change is projected to be one of the major challenges for regional agricultural production worldwide the global average temperature has increased about 0 74 c for the past century and it is expected to increase further about 2 0 c 5 4 c by 2100 ipcc 2007 tao et al 2008 generally the increase in both maximum and minimum temperature might increase the water requirement for both rainfed and irrigated crops and could also increase the risk of heat stress during flowering for crops grown during the winter and spring such as wheat and barley sommer et al 2013 wheat triticum aestivum l is the most widely grown crop and cultivated on 220 million ha of farmland across the word http www fao org about 21 of the world s food depends on the wheat crop however global wheat production is facing challenges from global warming water shortages and other factors tao and zhang 2013 in addition as a crop that prefers a relatively cool temperature wheat growth and yield could be affected by climate change in many regions of the world wheat production is projected to decrease due to climate warming and changes in precipitation asseng et al 2015 2011 the growing evidence from various regions in the world has shown marked phenological changes in response to rising temperatures resulting in accelerated developmental rate and a shortened spring wheat growing season mo et al 2016 moreover since both climate change and an increase in atmospheric co2 concentration vary impacts of these factors on wheat growth and yields are complex and diverse karimi et al 2018 therefore the vulnerability of wheat production in the future has become of key concern as some regions could experience an increase in yield while other regions could experience a decrease in yield kristensten et al 2011 olesen et al 2011 the effects of climatic change on crop growth and productivity have been studied using data based on long term historical field experiments peng et al 2004 tao et al 2006 additionally in order to assess the effects of climate change on crop phenology water demand and production and to provide adaptation strategies climate models have been coupled with crop models yan et al 2018 yang and mao 2018 process

change for the projected years on rainfed winter wheat phenology and grain yield for three locations in the guanzhong plain and 3 to determine the relationship between climate variables and winter wheat yield 2 method and materials 2 1 study area winter wheat is one of the major food crops in china accounting for 90 of total wheat production the guanzhong plain located in shaanxi province is one of the most ancient agricultural regions in china the double cropping rotation of summer maize and winter wheat is the dominant cropping system in the region the study area is located in a continental monsoon climate zone with uneven rainfall distribution three different precipitation regions from west to east in the guanzhong plain were selected as the study sites for this study fig 1

winter wheat yield prediction the csm ceres wheat model simulates the growth and development productivity water and nitrogen balances for wheat jones et al 2003 based on crop genetics including cultivar specific parameters or cultivar coefficients it is one of the most widely used crop models included in the dssat hoogenboom et al 2011 2019 jones et al 2003 the csm ceres wheat model has been evaluated extensively for basic decision support management and yield or water use predictions in china he et al 2013 ji et al 2014 li et al 2016 zheng et al 2016b in this study dssat version 4 6 hoogenboom et al 2011 was used to predict the number of days to maturity water use and productivity of winter wheat for the climate projections for 2020 2040 2060 2080 and 2100 for rainfed conditions for locations at baoji wugong and weinan the minimum inputs for the csm ceres wheat model are daily weather data soil profile characteristics cultivar genetics and crop management such as planting date plant population row spacing planting depth etc at each location hunt and boote 1998 hoogenboom et al 2012 the weather inputs for the ceres wheat model include daily precipitation maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin and solar radiation long term 1984 2013 daily records of rainfall tmax tmin and sunshine hours for the three locations were obtained from china meteorological data service center cmdc http data cma cn as reference years daily solar radiation was determined based on a multivariate stochastic process using the observed daylight sunshine hours through wgen weather generator in the dssat version 4 6 crop systems model garcia et al 2008 the weather inputs for simulating future projections were the reference weather data that modified based on simclim all of the four scenarios have different path shapes and emission targets and both rcp 4 5 and rcp 6 0 belong to the middle end scenario in this study we selected rcp 4 5 for its precedence over rcp 6 0 chen and lin 2011 bao et al 2015a recommends that at least three gcms should be selected in case the prediction is limited to a narrow representation of future climate therefore the three gcms selected for the present study were the beijing climate center china meteorological administration s model bcc csm1 1 bcc the queensland climate change centre of excellence and commonwealth scientific and industrial research organization s model csiro mk3 6 0 csiro and the noaa geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory s model gfdl cm3 gfdl five resulting projections for weather data for 2020 2040 2060 2080 and 2100 for baoji wugong and weinnan were generated with simclim soil types and associated profile surface and generic soil information were obtained from the china soil database csd the soil types for the trial sites were silty clay loam for baoji and wugong and a clay loam for weinan more information about model calibration and evaluation can be found in zheng et al 2017 and zheng et al 2016b the single cultivar xiaoyan22 the most common cultivar in the guanzhong plain was used for all three locations the simulated number of days to maturity grain yield and water use in the projections 2020 2040 2060 2080 and 2100 were compared with the reference years 1984 2013 3 results 3 1 climate projections the climate change patterns including monthly solar radiation precipitation maximum temperature tmax and minimum temperature tmin for the projections for 2020 2040 2060 2080 and 2100 were obtained using simclim for baoji wugong and weinan the changes were defined with respect to the baseline for the period 1961 1990 and the values varied by location month and the respective gcms that were used monthly solar radiation showed both a decrease and increase from the baseline depending upon which of the three gcms was used in general the projections based on the csiro showed both the largest increase and decrease in solar radiation there was a moderate change in solar radiation for the projections based on the gfdl and the smallest change in solar radiation was for the projections based on the bcc similarly the greatest change in monthly precipitation from the baseline was found for the projections based on the csiro followed by the gfdl and bcc monthly tmax and tmin increased from 2020 2100 compared with the baseline for the projections for all three gcms and the variation was similar for baoji the findings regarding changes in solar radiation monthly precipitation and tmax and tmin illustrated in fig 2 the change in monthly solar radiation from the baseline was small and the change in different projections was the same based on the bcc an extreme change occurred for september october and november based on the csiro which increased by 9 2 21 7 11 1 24 0 and then decreased by 14 6 17 9 the simulated change based on gfdl was intermediate between bcc and csiro the smallest change in monthly precipitation from the baseline ranged from 0 9 to 1 9 for february for different projections based on the bcc while the largest increase was ranged from 33 7 46 9 for june the largest increase in monthly precipitation ranged from 37 4 76 2 for december for different projections based on the csiro followed by june which increased 34 9 50 2 for different projections for the gfdl the prediction trend was similar with the bcc however the amplitude of variation in each month showed little difference the simulated tmax based on the three gcms all increased compared with the baseline based on the bcc the increase in temperature varied from 0 4 c for august to 2 2 c for february for 2020 and from 1 4 c for august to 3 0 c for february for 2100 while the increase in temperature varied from 0 7 c for june to 3 0 c for february for 2020 and from 2 1 c for june to 5 3 c for september for 2100 based on csiro based on gfdl the increase in temperature varied from 0 8 c for june and august to 2 6 c for february for 2020 and from 1 4 c for may to 4 1 c for september for 2100 for wugong the findings regarding changes in solar radiation monthly precipitation and tmax and tmin illustrated in fig 3 generally the changes from the baseline in monthly solar radiation for wugong for the projections were larger than baoji and decreased compared to the baseline an extreme change in solar radiation occurred in januray which decreased by 17 3 14 9 compared to the baseline based on three gcms the change in precipitation for august and june showed the largest increase among the different projections ranging from 27 7 for 2020 to 45 5 for 2100 and 30 5 for 2020 to 45 4 for 2100 respectively the tmax increased from 2 5 c for 2020 to 4 6 c for 2100 for february and from 2 2 c for 2020 to 4 0 c for 2100 for september based on the csiro and gfdl respectively the changes from baseline in monthly tmin for wugong were similar among the three gcms for weinan the findings regarding changes in solar radiation monthly precipitation and tmax and tmin illustrated in fig 4 in general the changes for weinan for the projections for 2020 2100 were similar to those for baoji with a few exceptions the projected solar radiation in june decreased based on three gcms and the increase was less than 20 based on the gfdl the largest change in solar radiation occurred from 1 8 for 2020 to 2 4 for 2100 the change in monthly precipitation decreased by 26 4 in september for 2100 and followed by a decrease in may of 24 6 for 2100 based on the bcc the largest change in precipitation based on the csiro was in december which was 35 7 for 2020 and 90 1 for 2100 while the largest change in precipitation based on the gfdl was for january which was 23 for 2020 and 51 3 for 2100 the increase in temperature based on gfdl was the largest followed by csiro and bcc the increase in the monthly tmax ranged from 0 5 c to 1 5 c for 2020 and and 0 9 c 3 5 c for 2100 based on bcc from 0 6 c to 1 9 c for 2020 and 2 0 c 4 4 c for 2100 based on csiro from 0 6 c to 1 4 c for 2020 and 1 1 c 3 1 c for 2100 based on gfdl 3 2 wheat phenology projections the number of days to maturity under rainfed conditions was simulated for the reference years and for the projections of 2020 2040 2060 2080 and 2100 each of the projections contained simulations for 30 years and the analysis is based on the average of 30 years to determine the potential impact of climate change the number of days to maturity was simulated for the 30 years of reference weather data for each location fig 5 for baoji the number of days to maturity for the three gcms was similar ranging from 222 to 231 222 232 and 225 232 days for the bcc csiro and gfdl respectively the change in number of days to maturity showed a decreasing trend based on all the gcms and the largest change was 13 2 days less than the reference years the changes in number of days to maturity for wugong and weinan for the projections were similar to those for baoji which decreased compared to the reference years for all the gcms the largest change occurred in 2080 and 2100 with a decrease of 14 3 days based on csiro for wugong and occurred in 2080 with a decrease of 14 9 days based on csiro for weinan the number of days to maturity in all the areas decreased compared to the reference years and it was clear that the increase in temperature was the major driver for the decrease in the number of days to maturity for the three locations because of the smaller increase in monthly mean temperature based on gfdl as compared to bcc and csiro the number of days to maturity was also smaller based on gfdl in baooji while in wugong and weinan the decrease in the number of days to maturity based on bcc was intermediate between csiro and gfdl reflecting the fact that bcc also projected an intermediate increase in monthly temperature fig 3 3 3 evapotranspiration projections average water demands for winter wheat was simulated for the 30 years of the reference data for baoji wugong and weinan with evapotranspiration et values of 312 0 mm 280 5 mm and 356 3 mm respectively simulated water demand for the winter wheat growth stage for the projections from 2020 2100 showed significant changes due to the effects of climate change fig 6 for baoji the et value changed from 11 6 mm 27 0 mm compared to the reference simulation and for all the gcms the water demand of the growth stage decreased from 2020 2100 for the same period et for wugong was similar to baoji and the change varied from 11 7 mm to 35 mm for the different gcm projections however for the same period for weinan the increase in et was greater for the projections based on the csiro and gfdl compared to the reference simulation the simulated et for weinan was much larger than those two locations was due to the wheat grown in weinan had a longer growing period 3 4 winter wheat yield projections as discussed earlier the historical weather data were modified with the climate change patterns using the outputs of the three gcms coupled with rcp 4 5 scenario in three locations and the projections were used for the prediction of winter wheat yield by using ceres wheat model rather than analyzing the absolute wheat yield predictions our analysis was based on the differences between the wheat simulations for the reference years and those for 2020 2040 2060 2080 and 2100 projections based on three gcm patterns fig 7 in general the number of days to maturity in the study area decreased compared to the reference years because of the increase in temperature while yield increased due to the increase in precipitation and co2 concentration for the future projections for baoji the change in grain yield was 22 1 3 5 based on the csiro for 2060 and gfdl for 2020 the grain yield showed a decreasing trend from 2020 to 2060 and then it increased from 2060 to 2100 the decrease in yield with respect to the reference simulations was always larger for the csiro than for the other two gcms reflecting the fact that csiro also projected larger decrease in precipitation compared to baoji for wugong the increase in yield was 6 8 21 7 based on the bcc and gfdl while the change in yield ranged from 7 8 to 0 4 based on the csiro similarly this was due to csiro generated the smallest increase in precipitation among the three gcms so the increase in rainfed yield was the lowest however the trend of change in yield for weinan was little different from those for baoji and wugong while the grain yield based on the three gcms increased from 2020 2100 projections the yield simulated by all the gcms decreased before the 2060 projection compared with the reference year the increases in yield for the 2060 and subsequent projections were larger than for the 2040 and 2020 projections because of the larger increase in precipitation and co2 concentration for the 2060 and the subsequent projections the grain yield based on the csiro showed an increasing trend from the 2020 projection to the 2060 projection with a slight decrease for the 2080 projection the change in yield ranged from 7 to 7 5 7 2 10 8 and 4 9 19 based on bcc csiro and gfdl compared to bcc the increase in rainfed yield based on gfdl was larger because of the larger increase in precipitation but showed a similar trend 4 discussion in this study the combination of different gcm outputs and the greenhouse gas emission scenario were used to assess the effects of climate change and its effect on winter wheat maturity dates water use and grain yield across the guanzhong plain the number of days to maturity decreased for all the locations in general there are many environmental factors that control crop phenology such as temperature photo period water and nutrient status etc however temperature is considered to be the main factor mcmaster and wilhelm 1997 our simulations indicated a reduction of the period from sowing to maturity ranging from 2 3 14 9 days according to climate change projection and site fig 5 the csiro predicted that the number of days to maturity for baoji would be reduced from 235 2 222 days from 233 3 219 days for wugong and from 288 9 275 days for weinan for the 2100 projection compared to the reference years which was the largest decreasing among the three gcms this shortening effect was due to the warming climates rather than to the water shortage since the primary effect of rainfall change and water availability on grain yield simulated by ceres wheat and by the majority of crop growth models is through limitations on growth with no effect on crop development rate such as maturity date dettori et al 2017 the results of our study are also consistent with those of moriondo and bindi 2007 who found a general reduction of the crop growing period of winter cereals i e barley and wheat in the entire mediterranean region in response to a 2 c increase in temperature with a decrease of the duration of the growing season ranging from 1 2 days in tunisia to 12 2 days in serbia the number of days to harvest maturity for the study area decreased for the different scenarios thus also decreasing potential growth and yield due to a shorter growing season the result are in agreement with the widely accepted evidence that shortening of the growth length is one of the main effects of climate change on crops and it is one of the primary causes of projected decreases in yield parry et al 2005 for the projection prior to 2060 the yield for baoji showed a larger decrease compared to the yield for wugong and weinan the yield based on the bcc and csiro models was less than the reference year for the projections while the gfdl model showed larger than the reference year this could be due to the variability in temperature for baoji especially in december and january during the normally dormant phase of winter wheat a significant increase in temperature could lead to rapid development of winter wheat during the early growth stage and an increase in tillering this in turn could lead to the decline of heading rate and decrease yield yield normally decreases for wet and cool sites because of a reduction in vegetative development lai and thus potential intercepted radiation and consequently a lower biomass production over the course of the growing season wang et al 2017 in our study yield decreased when temperature was either too low or too high with higher temperatures resulting in a significant reduction in yield in addition there was also an interaction among the temperature rainfall and co2 concentration on wheat yields ludwig and asseng 2006 different studies qu et al 2019 ventrella et al 2012 explored the projected positive effect of slight temperature increase on wheat grain yield possibly determined by the positive response of crops to elevated co2 concentration in the atmosphere i e increase in photosynthesis rate or water saving effect the evidences from the experiments indicated that increase in co2 concentration could offset the negative effects even enhance the positive effects of future climate change on productivity of cereal crop caused due to the co2 fertilization effect parry et al 2004 it was reported that the wheat yield would keep increasing until the co2 concentrate elevated to 890 ppm concluded by fitting both field and laboratory data a least squares cubic equation amthor 2001 however the present study did not take into account the physiological effect of projected high levels of co2 focusing the analysis on the impacts of changes in climate variables precipitation is an important meteorological factor affecting winter wheat growth and yield the seasonal distribution of precipitation in the guanzhong plain is uneven and the water demand of winter wheat varies for the different growth phases precipitation early and late during the growing season only has small effect on the grain yield while precipitation during the middle of the growing season such as the jointing stage and flowering stage has a significant positive effect on the final grain yield this study of winter wheat in northwest china showed that except for february the monthly total precipitation during the winter months was positively correlated with wheat yield while the precipitation during fallow period in june july and august was negatively correlated with wheat yield zhang et al 1996 in this study the response of winter wheat in the guanzhong plain to climate change under different scenarios showed differences due to the climate projections the decrease in the number of days to maturity was mainly caused by an increase in temperature similar to the findings of alexandrov and hoogenboom 2000 yield for baoji showed a decrease in yield with the decrease in yield getting larger for projections later in the century yield for wugong increased by 20 while yield for weinan increased gradually but showed the largest increase for all three sites of up to 41 our results are slightly different from yang et al 2014 who showed that the grain yield for rainfed wheat increased for most of china compared with the reference year 5 conclusion the present study found that future rainfall increased in february june and december and decreased in april september and october for the guanzhong plain maximum and minimum temperature for most months increased compared to the baseline with the largest increase in temperature for september and february for all the three locations the number of days to maturity decreased on average by 2 15 days based on three gcms while yield showed an increase after 2060 projection overall this study found that the impact of climate change on winter wheat grown under rainfed conditions in the guanzhong plain was positive while the impact differed among locations and some of the gcm projections some of the variability was due to the rainfed conditions that are more sensitive to climate change due to the uncertainty of future rainfall temperature solar radiation and other weather conditions future studies should include different wheat varieties that could be more heat tolerant and drought resistance and other potential adaptation scenarios declaration of

10552,evapotranspiration et plays an important role in efficient irrigation and water resources management et can be accurately estimated via the fao penman monteith method etfpm which is known as the standard reference method for the et estimation however this model requires more detailed meteorological data than are generally available at most weather stations alternative methods for predicting daily et should be found which are simpler to work with less input data without scarifying prediction accuracy the main purpose of this study was to determine a reliable alternative et models that requires fewer input data compared with the etfpm as a reference method here five radiation based models including makkink etmak priestley and taylor etpt abtew etabt jensen haise etjh mcguinness and bordne etmb and three temperature based models including hargreaves and samani eths hamon etham linacre etlin were evaluated by comparing them with petfpm on a daily and growing season scale using long term data from 13 meteorological stations in northeast iran the statistical analysis revealed that the eths etjh etham and etlin were the best methods for predicting daily et in 54 15 15 and 15 of areas respectively in general the temperature based methods outperformed the radiation based methods in the study area the cumulative values of daily et during the growth periods showed that the jensen haise method performed the best for the warm growing season compared to other alternative methods while the hargreaves samani method was the best prediction method for the cool growing season nevertheless divergence between estimations of the best alternative methods and the reference method showed that the best et alternative methods might be unreliable in some regions and could not be recommended for estimating crop water requirements accordingly the spatiotemporal variability in predictability performance of et models should be taken into account prior to use keywords fao penman monteith method growing season predictability performance temperature based method radiation based method 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is one of the major biophysical processes of multiple disciplines and an essential component of the water cycle at or near land surfaces it has a great impact on hydrology and water management strategies and quality and quantity of crop production valipour et al 2017 yang et al 2019 knowing the amount of actual et is important for water resources planning and management for estimating crop water requirements drought monitoring and irrigation scheduling lang et al 2017 wang et al 2013 the direct measurement of actual et is difficult time consuming and costly on a large scale thus actual et is usually estimated from the reference crop evapotranspiration eto which is a climatic parameter and can be computed from weather data allen et al 1998 lang et al 2017 the ability of the atmosphere to remove water from the soil through evaporation and transpiration depends on meteorological factors such as solar radiation temperature wind speed and air humidity king et al 2015 silva et al 2016 the eto expresses the evaporative demand of the atmosphere at a given location and time and refers to the et from a reference well watered grass surface with specific characteristics allen et al 1998 it has been noted that potential evapotranspiration etp and eto are not equivalent terms although many researchers have sometimes used the two terms interchangeably xiang et al 2020 allen et al 1998 nevertheless eto and etp estimation equations are basically similar in structure because both represent quantities of atmospheric evaporation demand xiang et al 2020 peng et al 2017 so their estimates could be quantitatively linked peng et al 2017 many models have been proposed to estimate et eto etp using various meteorological data generally et estimation methods may be grouped into five main categories including pan evaporation based method temperature based method mass transfer based method radiation based method and the combined method gharbia et al 2018 lang et al 2017 xiang et al 2020 however these models vary in terms of their assumptions data requirements complexity and reliability the fao penman monteith method has been recommended by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao and world meteorological organization as a standard model to calculate eto and to evaluate the accuracy of other models allen et al 2006 2005 1998 lang et al 2017 silva et al 2016 wang and georgakakos 2007 this standard method is known as a complex mathematical calculation with various meteorological variables which are often difficult to obtain from local weather stations in developing countries thus simpler alternative methods based on empirical equations have been considered for computing et with limited data silva et al 2016 tegos et al 2017 again due to complex interactions between meteorological and time as well as the predictability of these models must be checked against the standard method before use in practice it has been highlighted that a site specific evaluation is required to determine the predictability performance of alternative methods for usage in a specific region lang et al 2017 todorovic et al 2013 after precipitation et is the largest component of the terrestrial hydrological budget and an accurate eto estimation is crucial for computing crop water requirements and irrigation schedules in cropping systems allen et al 1998 crop water requirement is affected by environmental demands during the growing season and each crop having a specific growing season which depends on its special growing requirements and environmental conditions many studies have worked on the potential of alternative methods for estimating et but evaluating the predictability performance of et estimation methods during crop growing seasons has been considered rarely in spite of its importance for cropping systems the primary objective of the present research was to evaluate the predictability performance of eight alternative daily eto etp methods by comparing to the fao penman monteith method in arid and semiarid regions finally the variability of estimated et was analyzed for each region and the main growing seasons to determine the best alternative methods for estimating et in cropping systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area total cultivated area of iran has been fluctuating around 12 million hectare over the past 25 years and khorasan razavi

to thornthwaite 1948 climate classification index is classified as hyper arid to semi arid table1 the study area includes dargaz fariman golmakan gonabad kashmar khaf neyshabour mashhad quchan sarakhs sabzevar torbat e jam and torbat e heydarieh counties fig 1 the daily meteorological data were collected from 13 meteorological stations across the study area fig 1 and table1 meteorological data included daily solar radiation or sunshine hours precipitation minimum temperature maximum temperature relative humidity and wind speed the locations of the selected whether stations along with climate characteristics and observation periods are shown in table 1 2 2 et models in this study eight et models were selected which are typically classified into temperature based and radiation based as well as into eto and etp as reviewed by xiang et al 2020 these models were selected based on their need for meteorological inputs which are generally available in all weather stations 2 2 1 radiation based models 2 2 1 1 makkink method the makkink 1957 method is frequently used to estimate the etp from grass makkink 1957 xiang et al 2020 this method is the simplified and modified form of the penman 1948 formula based on radiation and temperature as 1 e t m a k 0 61 δ δ γ r s λ 0 12 where etmak is the daily etp rate mm day 1 δ is the slope of the saturated water vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 γ denotes the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 rs is solar radiation mj m 2 day 1 and λ represents latent heat of vaporization mj kg 1 2 2 1 2 priestley and taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 proposed an empirical approach which was a simplified version of the penman penman 1948 equation for estimating etp in wet surface areas as 2 e t p t α δ δ γ r n g λ where etpt is the daily etp rate mm day 1 α is the calibration constant α 1 26 rn denotes net radiation mj m 2 day 1 and g represents the soil heat flux mj m 2 day 1 all other terms are the same as those used for eq 1 2 2 1 3 abtew method abtew 1996 proposed an empirical equation estimating eto from solar radiation as follows 3 e t a b t k r s λ where etabt is the daily eto rate mm day 1 k represents a dimensionless coefficient k 0 53 rs and λ are as defined for eq 1 2 2 1 4 jensen haise method based on 3000 et data obtained in arid regions of the western united states over a 35 year period jensen and haise 1963 developed a radiation based model as 4 e t j h 0 025 t 3 r s λ where etjh denotes the daily etp rate mm day 1 t is the mean daily air temperature c rs and λ are as defined for eq 1 2 2 1 5 mcguinness bordne method mcguinness and bordne 1972 developed a formula for calculating etp based on radiation and mean temperature as 5 e t m b t 5 68 r s λ where etmb is the daily etp rate mm day 1 and all terms are as defined for the eqs 1 and 4 2 2 2 temperature based model 2 2 2 1 hargreaves and samani method hargreaves and samani 1985 proposed a temperature based method for estimating the daily eto using the minimum and maximum air temperature as 6 e t h s 0 0023 t m a x t m i n 0 5 t 17 8 r a λ where eths is the daily eto rate mm day 1 ra denotes the extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2 day 1 tmax tmin and t indicate the maximum minimum and mean daily air temperature c respectively λ is as defined for eq 1 2 2 2 2 hamon method hamon 1961 developed an equation for estimating the daily etp using day length mean air temperature and the saturated water vapor density as 7 e t h a m k 0 165 216 7 n e s t 273 3 where etham is the daily etp rate mm day 1 k denotes a dimensionless coefficient k 1 2 n is daytime length from sunrise to sunset in multiples of 12 h es is saturation vapor pressure mb and t indicates the mean daily air temperature c 2 2 2 3 linacre method linacre 1977 proposed a temperature based method for calculating the daily etp using characteristics geographical and dew point temperature as 8 e t l i n 500 t 0 006 a 100 φ 15 t t d 80 t where etlin is the daily etp rate mm day 1 φ is the latitude of the station a denotes elevation of the station m t and td represent the mean air temperature and dew point temperature c respectively 2 3 fao penman monteith method in order to investigate the prediction performance of the above proposed models we conducted a cross comparison between the outputs of these eight models and the fao penman monteith model which is the standard model for calculating eto the fao penman monteith etfpm approach for estimating eto is described as follows allen et al 1998 9 p e t f p m 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2

pressure kpa respectively δ and γ are as defined for eq 1 evaluating the predictability performance of the alternative et eto etp methods during the growing season would be very useful for crop irrigation management then the performance of the alternative methods would be also evaluated during the growth periods crops are mainly separated into cool season fall or winter crops and early spring crops and warm season summer crops based on temperature requirements thus the growing season was divided into early cool season february september warm season june september and cool season october june and the cumulative daily et estimated for each growing season across various regions 2 4 model evaluation methodology the prediction performance of the eto etp models against the reference etfpm was evaluated using widely accepted statistical indices such as the correlation coefficient cc relative bias rbias root mean squared error rmse and nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse table 2 generally the closer the values of r and nse to 1 and the value of bias and rmse to 0 indicates the better the model performance furthermore the chi squared test was used to determine whether there is any significant difference between the et predictions of fao penman monteith model and the other models at confidence level of 95 10 x 2 i 1 n e t f p m e t a m 2 e t a m where χ2 is pearson s chi square n denotes the number of data etfpm is the daily reference evapotranspiration calculated by fao penman monteith model and etam shows the daily evapotranspiration calculated by the alternative models 3 results 3 1 eto estimated by fao penman monteith method mean daily and annual values of eto estimated by fao penman monteith method are reported in table 3 over the study area the mean daily eto ranged from 3 7 to 6 9 mm among the studied regions khaf and quchan showed the maximum and minimum amount of mean daily and annual eto respectively 3 2 evaluation of daily et estimates for the different alternative methods we compared the daily et estimates of the eight eto etp methods with the etfpm method using some statistical indices over arid and semi arid regions to evaluate the predictability performance of different models fig 2 the correlation coefficient between long term mean daily et estimated by the etfpm and the other alternative methods was higher than about 0 91 in the study areas fig 2 among the et estimation methods the etmb etham and etjh showed the highest correlation with the etfpm over the study areas the highest and lowest correlation coefficient between the etfpm and other methods were generally obtained in mashhad and khaf fig 2 the values of rmse for different et methods ranged from 0 35 to 5 6 in different regions fig 2 across the study area the mean lowest and highest values of rmse were obtained from the eths 1 11 and the etlin 2 79 the eths method performed the best with the lowest rmse value in sabzevar fariman quchan kashmar golmakan mashhad and neyshabour stations fig 2 in torbat e heydarieh and gonabad the etjh method had the best predictions with the lowest rmse values the etham method had the minimum rmse values in dargaz and sarakhs and the etlin method had the lowest rmse values in torbat e jam and khaf the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient revealed that the eths method performed the best in all stations except torbat e jam and khaf with the nse values ranging from 0 74 to 0 98 fig 2 in most regions the eths etjh and etham showed an accepted performance with the mean nse values of 0 82 0 79 and 0 74 respectively however the predictability performances of the eths for khaf nse 0 15 the etjh for khaf and fariman nse 0 24 as well as the etham for torbat e jam khaf and fariman nse 0 43 were definitely unacceptable the predictability performances of the other alternative models were strongly site specific fig 2 for example the predictability performance of the etlin was acceptable when it was used for torbat e jam nse 0 91 and khaf nse 0 78 the relative bias was used to measure the average underestimation and overestimation by et models as compared to the fao penman monteith model fig 2 in general the bias values of all methods ranged from 66 86 to 96 83 across the different regions the bias results indicated that all methods except etlin generally underestimated the daily et in most study areas fig 2 according to the bias results the lowest underestimation of et was obtained by the eths bias 1 72 method across the different regions chi square test was used to compare the goodness of fit between each of the alternative eto etp estimation methods and the fao penman monteith method across the study areas table 4 the chi square test indicated that there was no significant difference between the et predictions of fao penman monteith and the eths methods at 95 confidence level in all regions except two torbat e jam and khaf furthermore the differences between the et predictions of reference and the etjh methods were not significant at 95 confidence level in all regions except two fariman and khaf in torbat e jam fariman and khaf stations there was no significant difference between the et predictions of reference and the etlin model at 95 confidence level using the above statistical analysis the accuracy of daily eto etp estimation of eight alternative methods compared to the reference method were ranked in each region table 5 for each region spatio temporal variations in daily et estimations of fao penman monteith and the best alternative methods are shown in fig 3 the results indicated that the best ranked alternative method for reliable daily et estimation at 54 of locations was the hargreaves and samani method fig 3 and table 5 the linacre method for torbat e jam and khaf and the jensen haise method for torbat e heydarieh and gonabad ranked the first in dargaz and sarakhs the hamon method was the most accurate method the hamon and jensen haise methods ranked the second at 38 and 30 of locations respectively furthermore both hamon and jensen haise methods took the third position at 46 of locations table 5 an overview of the relationship between some meteorological parameters and the eto etp estimation methods in each area showed that the hargreaves and samani method generally had the best performance in regions with a wind speed less than 3 5 m s 1 fig 4 for locations where the etlin was the best et estimation method the average daily wind speed was more than 4 0 m s 1 fig 4 and the maximum wind speed for torbat e jam and khaf stations reached 7 13 and 10 75 m s 1 respectively furthermore the average sunshine duration was more than 8 5 h in torbat e jam and khaf fig 4 in the north and northeast of khorasan razavi province where the etham was selected as the best ranked the elevation was the most important variable among the geographical and meteorological variables which was considerably lower than those in the other regions table 1 and fig 4 furthermore the etjh could produce reliable estimation of daily et in the south of khorasan razavi province where wind speed was less than 2 5 m s 1 the average elevation was 1253 m and sunshine duration was more than 8 7 h table 1 and fig 4 3 3 evaluation of different alternative methods for computing et during the growing seasons 3 3 1 estimation of the eto etp during warm season the results indicated that the hargreaves and samani method estimated the et more accurately than other methods did when used during the warm season in fariman and neyshabour stations with an under or overestimation ranging from 19 3 to 3 9 table 6 in fariman and neyshabour the values of rmse and nse for eths estimation method ranged from 0 36 to 1 52 and from 1 24 to 0 89 respectively furthermore the etjh was the best alternative model for estimating the et in torbat e heydarieh sabzevar sarakhs quchan golmakan gonabad and mashhad stations with an under or overestimation ranging from 20 2 to 9 9 for these regions the values of rmse and nse for etjh method ranged from 0 27 to 1 74 and from 0 92 to 0 94 respectively for kashmar and dargaz the etham was the most accurate model during the warm season with an underestimation ranging from 3 1 to 3 9 table 6 for these regions the values of rmse and nse for the best estimation method ranged from 0 42 to 0 48 and from 0 82 to 0 90 respectively the etlin model estimated the et more accurately than the other models did with an overestimation of 9 9 and 14 4 in torbat e jam and khaf stations respectively in torbat e jam and khaf the values of rmse and nse for the best estimation method ranged from 1 13 to 2 19 and from 0 17 to 0 50 respectively 3 3 2 estimation of the eto etp during cool seasons 3 3 2 1 early spring crops the results showed that the eths method estimated the et more accurately than the other methods did when used during the early cool season in fariman quchan kashmar golmakan and neyshabour stations with an under or overestimation ranging from 17 8 to 5 1 table 6 for these regions the values of rmse and nse for eths method ranged from 0 35 to 1 19 and from 0 7 to 0 97 respectively the etjh was the most reliable method in torbat e heydarieh sabzevar sarakhs gonabad and mashhad stations with an under or overestimation ranging from 21 3 to 4 8 for these regions the values of rmse and nse for etjh method ranged from 0 49 to 1 41 and from 0 74 to 0 95 respectively the etlin was the best alternative method for estimating et during the early cool season in torbat e jam 11 4 and khaf 20 6 stations in torbat e jam and khaf the values of rmse and nse for the best estimation method ranged from 0 95 to 2 12 and from 0 76 to 0 92 respectively the etham was the most reliable method in dargaz with an underestimation of 4 6 table 6 3 3 2 2 fall or winter crops the results revealed that the eths was the best alternative method for estimating the et during the cool season in torbat e heydarieh sabzevar sarakhs fariman quchan kashmar golmakan mashhad and neyshabour stations with an under or overestimation ranging from 22 1 to 9 5 table 6 for these regions the values of rmse and nse for eths method ranged from 0 20 to 0 93 and from 0 90 to 0 99 respectively the etjh and etham were the most accurate models in gonabad and dargaz stations with an underestimation of 5 0 and 5 9 respectively table 6 in gonabad and dargaz the mean values of rmse and nse for the best estimation methods were 0 39 and 0 99 respectively furthermore the etlin was the best alternative model for estimating et during the cool season in torbat e jam 22 5 and khaf 37 8 stations 4 discussion there are various models for predicting the et with different complexity and accuracy meanwhile the simplicity and predictability performance of et models are the main determining factors where the availability of meteorological data is limited among the simple alternative methods the temperature based methods generally showed better performance than the radiation based methods for estimating daily et in the majority of study area this finding is in agreement with previous results in other arid regions banimahd et al 2014 esmaeili 2009 kousari et al 2013 valipour et al 2017 the statistical indicators showed various predictability performances among the alternative eto etp estimation methods the rbias suggested that the etlin overestimates the et while the other seven methods generally underestimate the et among the eto etp estimation methods the three temperature based models showed the best performance in 85 of the studied areas as the eths etham and etlin were the best daily et prediction methods in 54 15 and 15 of areas respectively the etjh was the best model among the studied radiation based models and took the first rank in 15 of areas nevertheless the efficiency coefficients of the etlin etmb and etmak models were less than 0 5 in 85 69 and 61 5 of areas respectively the results also indicated that the etmb model underestimated the mean daily et by more than 10 in the 69 of study areas and the etlin model overestimated daily et by more than 10 in 85 of areas furthermore the chi square test indicated that there was a significant difference between the daily et predictions of fao penman monteith model and the etmb model in the 77 of areas on the other hand the etmb predictions were not completely acceptable and the etlin and etmak models generally were not reliable for estimating the daily et in arid regions it has been reported that the etmb etmak and etlin do not perform well in most arid regions around the world efthimiou et al 2013 heydari et al 2014 irmak et al 2008 tabari et al 2011 zheng et al 2017 although they might be applicable to certain dry areas jacobs and de bruin 1998 sun et al 2016 the relationship between some meteorological parameters and the eto etp estimation methods in each area showed that the hargreaves samani and linacre methods generally had the best performance in regions with wind speeds less and more than 3 5 m s 1 respectively it has been reported that the eths is one of the best prediction methods in arid regions especially where the wind speed is less than 3 0 m s 1 droogers and allen 2002 todorovic et al 2013 in the north and northeast of khorasanrazavi province where the elevation is considerably lower than that in the other regions the etham provided the best estimates of et furthermore the etjh could produce reliable estimation of daily et in the south of khorasan razavi province where wind speed is less than 2 5 m s 1 and the sunshine duration is longer than 8 7 h all the eight models studied here produced different estimates of the et for particular sites across a range of climate regimes proving that local scale topography and microclimate conditions could affect the predictability performance of the models fisher et al 2011 lang et al 2017 zhang et al 2009 zheng et al 2017 zhang et al 2009 reported that wind speed sunshine duration temperature and relative humidity are the major climatic factors affecting the annual and seasonal variation of evapotranspiration they also found that the combined effect of wind speed sunshine duration and humidity was greater than the effect of temperature on the atmospheric evaporative demand peng et al 2017 reported that the most precise et estimation method varied for different regions and generally selected the hargreaves samani as the best alternative method in most arid regions of china the amount of crop water requirements is mainly determined by evaporative demand during the growing season here cumulative values of daily et during the growth period of the main cropping systems were calculated for evaluating the predictability and applicability of each eto etp estimation method the results showed that the best method for estimating et differed for different growing seasons in 54 of the study areas for warm growing season the etjh eths etlin and etham performed the best in 54 15 15 and 15 of the study areas respectively furthermore the cumulative et estimation during the early cool growing season february september showed that the eths etjh etlin and etham were the best alternative methods in 38 38 15 and 8 of the study areas respectively from october to june cool growing season the eths etlin etjh and etmak were the best estimation methods in 69 15 8 and 8 of the study areas in general the best estimates were obtained using the radiation based methods for the warm growing season and using the temperature based methods for the cool growing season bogawski and bednorz 2014 reported that the radiation based methods performed the best compared to mass transfer based pan coefficient based and temperature based methods during the warm season april october in poland zhang et al 2009 showed that radiation was the dominant climatic factor that affected et in summer for most stations of study areas in china while the importance of radiation on the et in spring and fall was far smaller than that in summer differences in the et estimations during the growing season between the best alternative methods and reference method showed that the over or underestimation by the alternative methods were less than 15 in most regions 69 however divergence between estimations of the best alternative methods and reference method was greater than 15 for one or all growing seasons in torbat e jam khaf sabzevar and fariman thus even the best alternative methods were unreliable in these areas and could not be recommended for use in agricultural managements todorovic et al 2013 showed that the differences between et predictions of the hargreaves samani and fao penman monteith were within 10 in most hyper arid and arid regions and in large parts of semi arid areas 5 conclusions using long term daily weather data collected from 13 weather stations across arid regions in the northeast iran several simple models were assessed for their potential to estimate the et the results indicated that performance of the eto etp estimation methods was variable among the different regions meanwhile the hargreaves samani method was a simple reliable alternative method for the et estimation in most arid regions furthermore the results indicated that the temperature based methods were more accurate than the radiation based methods for estimating the et in the study areas among the radiation based methods the jensen haise method was the only method which was reliable in some regions the statistical analysis showed that the mcguinness bordne linacre and makkink models generally could not be considered as reliable alternative methods for estimating daily et in the arid regions our results revealed that local scale topography and microclimate features might affect the performance of the eto etp estimation methods the hargreaves samani method had a good accuracy for the et prediction in regions where wind speed is less than 3 5 m s 1 in areas with high elevation 1253 m long sunshine duration more than 8 7 h and wind speed less than 2 5 m s 1 the jensen haise method had a very good accuracy for the et prediction the cumulative values of daily et during the growth periods of the main cropping systems were calculated for evaluating the predictability performance and applicability of each eto etp estimation method for estimating crop water requirements in general the jensen haise method performed the best compared to the other alternative methods during the warm season while the hargreaves samani method was the best for cool growing seasons for practical application the simple alternative methods of hargreaves samani and the jensen haise are recommended for use within arid and semi arid agricultural regions of khorasan razavi province where daily weather data are limited to just temperature and solar radiation or sunshine hours nevertheless the spatio temporal variations of et estimates across the regions and growing seasons should be consider to determine the exact water requirements of

10552,evapotranspiration et plays an important role in efficient irrigation and water resources management et can be accurately estimated via the fao penman monteith method etfpm which is known as the standard reference method for the et estimation however this model requires more detailed meteorological data than are generally available at most weather stations alternative methods for predicting daily et should be found which are simpler to work with less input data without scarifying prediction accuracy the main purpose of this study was to determine a reliable alternative et models that requires fewer input data compared with the etfpm as a reference method here five radiation based models including makkink etmak priestley and taylor etpt abtew etabt jensen haise etjh mcguinness and bordne etmb and three temperature based models including hargreaves and samani eths hamon etham linacre etlin were evaluated by comparing them with petfpm on a daily and growing season scale using long term data from 13 meteorological stations in northeast iran the statistical analysis revealed that the eths etjh etham and etlin were the best methods for predicting daily et in 54 15 15 and 15 of areas respectively in general the temperature based methods outperformed the radiation based methods in the study area the cumulative values of daily et during the growth periods showed that the jensen haise method performed the best for the warm growing season compared to other alternative methods while the hargreaves samani method was the best prediction method for the cool growing season nevertheless divergence between estimations of the best alternative methods and the reference method showed that the best et alternative methods might be unreliable in some regions and could not be recommended for estimating crop water requirements accordingly the spatiotemporal variability in predictability performance of et models should be taken into account prior to use keywords fao penman monteith method growing season predictability performance temperature based method radiation based method 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is one of the major biophysical processes of multiple disciplines and an essential component of the water cycle at or near land surfaces it has a great impact on hydrology and water management strategies and quality and quantity of crop production valipour et al 2017 yang et al 2019 knowing the amount of actual et is important for water resources planning and management for estimating crop water requirements drought monitoring and irrigation scheduling lang et al 2017 wang et al 2013 the direct measurement of actual et is difficult time consuming and costly on a large scale thus actual et is usually estimated from the reference crop evapotranspiration eto which is a climatic parameter and can be computed from weather data allen et al 1998 lang et al 2017 the ability of the atmosphere to remove water from the soil through evaporation and transpiration depends on meteorological factors such as solar radiation temperature wind speed and air humidity king et al 2015 silva et al 2016 the eto expresses the evaporative demand of the atmosphere at a given location and time and refers to the et from a reference well watered grass surface with specific characteristics allen et al 1998 it has been noted that potential evapotranspiration etp and eto are not equivalent terms although many researchers have sometimes used the two terms interchangeably xiang et al 2020 allen et al 1998 nevertheless eto and etp estimation equations are basically similar in structure because both represent quantities of atmospheric evaporation demand xiang et al 2020 peng et al 2017 so their estimates could be quantitatively linked peng et al 2017 many models have been proposed to estimate et eto etp using various meteorological data generally et estimation methods may be grouped into five main categories including pan evaporation based method temperature based method mass transfer based method radiation based method and the combined method gharbia et al 2018 lang et al 2017 xiang et al 2020 however these models vary in terms of their assumptions data requirements complexity and reliability the fao penman monteith method has been recommended by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao and world meteorological organization as a standard model to calculate eto and to evaluate the accuracy of other models allen et al 2006 2005 1998 lang et al 2017 silva et al 2016 wang and georgakakos 2007 this standard method is known as a complex mathematical calculation with various meteorological variables which are often difficult to obtain from local weather stations in developing countries thus simpler alternative methods based on empirical equations have been considered for computing et with limited data silva et al 2016 tegos et al 2017 again due to complex interactions between meteorological and time as well as the predictability of these models must be checked against the standard method before use in practice it has been highlighted that a site specific evaluation is required to determine the predictability performance of alternative methods for usage in a specific region lang et al 2017 todorovic et al 2013 after precipitation et is the largest component of the terrestrial hydrological budget and an accurate eto estimation is crucial for computing crop water requirements and irrigation schedules in cropping systems allen et al 1998 crop water requirement is affected by environmental demands during the growing season and each crop having a specific growing season which depends on its special growing requirements and environmental conditions many studies have worked on the potential of alternative methods for estimating et but evaluating the predictability performance of et estimation methods during crop growing seasons has been considered rarely in spite of its importance for cropping systems the primary objective of the present research was to evaluate the predictability performance of eight alternative daily eto etp methods by comparing to the fao penman monteith method in arid and semiarid regions finally the variability of estimated et was analyzed for each region and the main growing seasons to determine the best alternative methods for estimating et in cropping systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area total cultivated area of iran has been fluctuating around 12 million hectare over the past 25 years and khorasan razavi

to thornthwaite 1948 climate classification index is classified as hyper arid to semi arid table1 the study area includes dargaz fariman golmakan gonabad kashmar khaf neyshabour mashhad quchan sarakhs sabzevar torbat e jam and torbat e heydarieh counties fig 1 the daily meteorological data were collected from 13 meteorological stations across the study area fig 1 and table1 meteorological data included daily solar radiation or sunshine hours precipitation minimum temperature maximum temperature relative humidity and wind speed the locations of the selected whether stations along with climate characteristics and observation periods are shown in table 1 2 2 et models in this study eight et models were selected which are typically classified into temperature based and radiation based as well as into eto and etp as reviewed by xiang et al 2020 these models were selected based on their need for meteorological inputs which are generally available in all weather stations 2 2 1 radiation based models 2 2 1 1 makkink method the makkink 1957 method is frequently used to estimate the etp from grass makkink 1957 xiang et al 2020 this method is the simplified and modified form of the penman 1948 formula based on radiation and temperature as 1 e t m a k 0 61 δ δ γ r s λ 0 12 where etmak is the daily etp rate mm day 1 δ is the slope of the saturated water vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 γ denotes the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 rs is solar radiation mj m 2 day 1 and λ represents latent heat of vaporization mj kg 1 2 2 1 2 priestley and taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 proposed an empirical approach which was a simplified version of the penman penman 1948 equation for estimating etp in wet surface areas as 2 e t p t α δ δ γ r n g λ where etpt is the daily etp rate mm day 1 α is the calibration constant α 1 26 rn denotes net radiation mj m 2 day 1 and g represents the soil heat flux mj m 2 day 1 all other terms are the same as those used for eq 1 2 2 1 3 abtew method abtew 1996 proposed an empirical equation estimating eto from solar radiation as follows 3 e t a b t k r s λ where etabt is the daily eto rate mm day 1 k represents a dimensionless coefficient k 0 53 rs and λ are as defined for eq 1 2 2 1 4 jensen haise method based on 3000 et data obtained in arid regions of the western united states over a 35 year period jensen and haise 1963 developed a radiation based model as 4 e t j h 0 025 t 3 r s λ where etjh denotes the daily etp rate mm day 1 t is the mean daily air temperature c rs and λ are as defined for eq 1 2 2 1 5 mcguinness

terms are as defined for the eqs 1 and 4 2 2 2 temperature based model 2 2 2 1 hargreaves and samani method hargreaves and samani 1985 proposed a temperature based method for estimating the daily eto using the minimum and maximum air temperature as 6 e t h s 0 0023 t m a x t m i n 0 5 t 17 8 r a λ where eths is the daily eto rate mm day 1 ra denotes the extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2 day 1 tmax tmin and t indicate the maximum minimum and mean daily air temperature c respectively λ is as defined for eq 1 2 2 2 2 hamon method hamon 1961 developed an equation for estimating the daily etp using day length mean air temperature and the saturated water vapor density as 7 e t h a m k 0 165 216 7 n e s t 273 3 where etham is the daily etp rate mm day 1 k denotes a dimensionless coefficient k 1 2

temperature based method for calculating the daily etp using characteristics geographical and dew point temperature as 8 e t l i n 500 t 0 006 a 100 φ 15 t t d 80 t where etlin is the daily etp rate mm day 1 φ is the latitude of the station a denotes elevation of the station m t and td represent the mean air temperature and dew point temperature c respectively 2 3 fao penman monteith method in order to investigate the prediction performance of the above proposed models we conducted a cross comparison between the outputs of these eight models and the fao penman monteith model which is the standard model for calculating eto the fao penman monteith etfpm approach for estimating eto is described as follows allen et al 1998 9 p e t f p m 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2

irrigation management then the performance of the alternative methods would be also evaluated during the growth periods crops are mainly separated into cool season fall or winter crops and early spring crops and warm season summer crops based on temperature requirements thus the growing season was divided into early cool season february september warm season june september and cool season october june and the cumulative daily et estimated for each growing season across various regions 2 4 model evaluation methodology the prediction performance of the eto etp models against the reference etfpm was evaluated using widely accepted statistical indices such as the correlation coefficient cc relative bias rbias root mean squared error rmse and nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse table 2 generally the closer the values of r and nse to 1 and the value of bias and rmse to 0 indicates the better the model performance furthermore the chi squared test was used to determine whether there is any significant difference between the et predictions of fao penman monteith model and the other models at confidence level of 95 10 x 2 i 1 n e t f p m e t a m 2 e t a m where χ2 is pearson s chi square n denotes the number of data etfpm is the daily reference evapotranspiration calculated by fao penman monteith model and etam shows the daily evapotranspiration calculated by the alternative models 3 results 3 1 eto estimated by fao penman monteith method mean daily and annual values of eto estimated by fao penman monteith method are reported in table 3 over the study area the mean daily eto ranged from 3 7 to 6 9 mm among the studied regions khaf and quchan showed the maximum and minimum amount of mean daily and annual eto respectively 3 2 evaluation of daily et estimates for the different alternative methods we compared the daily et estimates of the eight eto etp methods with the etfpm method using some statistical indices over arid and semi arid regions to evaluate the predictability performance of different models fig 2 the correlation coefficient between long term mean daily et estimated by the etfpm and the other alternative methods was higher than about 0 91 in the study areas fig 2 among the et estimation methods the etmb etham and etjh showed the highest correlation with the etfpm over the study areas the highest and lowest correlation coefficient between the etfpm and other methods were generally obtained in mashhad and khaf fig 2 the values of rmse for different et methods ranged from 0 35 to 5 6 in different regions fig 2 across the study area the mean lowest and highest values of rmse were obtained from the eths 1 11 and the etlin 2 79 the eths method performed the best with the lowest rmse value in sabzevar fariman quchan kashmar golmakan mashhad and neyshabour stations fig 2 in torbat e heydarieh and gonabad the etjh method had the best predictions with the lowest rmse values the etham method had the minimum rmse values in dargaz and sarakhs and the etlin method had the lowest rmse values in torbat e jam and khaf the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient revealed that the eths method performed the best in all stations except torbat e jam and khaf with the nse values ranging from 0 74 to 0 98 fig 2 in most regions the eths etjh and etham showed an accepted performance with the mean nse values of 0 82 0 79 and 0 74 respectively however the predictability performances of the eths for khaf nse 0 15 the etjh for khaf and fariman nse 0 24 as well as the etham for torbat e jam khaf and fariman nse 0 43 were definitely unacceptable the predictability performances of the other alternative models were strongly site specific fig 2 for example the predictability performance of the etlin was acceptable when it was used for torbat e jam nse 0 91 and khaf nse 0 78 the relative bias was used to measure the average underestimation and overestimation by et models as compared to the fao penman monteith model fig 2 in general the bias values of all methods ranged from 66 86 to 96 83 across the different regions the bias results indicated that all methods except etlin generally underestimated the daily et in most study areas fig 2 according to the bias results the lowest underestimation of et was obtained by the eths bias 1 72 method across the different regions chi square test was used to compare the goodness of fit between each of the alternative eto etp estimation methods and the fao penman monteith method across the study areas table 4 the chi square test indicated that there was no significant difference between the et predictions of fao penman monteith and the eths methods at 95 confidence level in all regions except two torbat e jam and khaf furthermore the differences between the et predictions of reference and the etjh methods were not significant at 95 confidence level in all regions except two fariman and khaf in torbat e jam fariman and khaf stations there was no significant difference between the et predictions of reference and the etlin model at 95 confidence level using the above statistical analysis the accuracy of daily eto etp estimation of eight alternative methods compared to the reference method were ranked in each region table 5 for each region spatio temporal variations in daily et estimations of fao penman monteith and the best alternative methods are shown in fig 3 the results indicated that the best ranked alternative method for reliable daily et estimation at 54 of locations was the hargreaves and samani method fig 3 and table 5 the linacre method for torbat e jam and khaf and the jensen haise method for torbat e heydarieh and gonabad ranked the first in dargaz and sarakhs the hamon method was the most accurate method the hamon and jensen haise methods ranked the second at 38 and 30 of locations respectively furthermore both hamon and jensen haise methods took the third position at 46 of locations table 5 an overview of the relationship between some meteorological parameters and the eto etp estimation methods in each area showed that the hargreaves and samani method generally had the best performance in regions with a wind speed less than 3 5 m s 1 fig 4 for locations where the etlin was the best et estimation method the average daily wind speed was more than 4 0 m s 1 fig 4 and the maximum wind speed for torbat e jam and khaf stations reached 7 13 and 10 75 m s 1 respectively furthermore the average sunshine duration was more than 8 5 h in torbat e jam and khaf fig 4 in the north and northeast of khorasan razavi province where the etham was selected as the best ranked the elevation was the most important variable among the geographical and meteorological variables which was considerably lower than those in the other regions table 1 and fig 4 furthermore the etjh could produce reliable estimation of daily et in the south of khorasan razavi province where wind speed was less than 2 5 m s 1 the average elevation was 1253 m and sunshine duration was more than 8 7 h table 1 and fig 4 3 3 evaluation of different alternative methods for computing et during the growing seasons 3 3 1 estimation of the eto etp during warm season the results indicated that the hargreaves and samani method estimated the et more accurately than other methods did when used during the warm season in fariman and neyshabour stations with an under or overestimation ranging from 19 3 to 3 9 table 6 in fariman and neyshabour the values of rmse and nse for eths estimation method ranged from 0 36 to 1 52 and from 1 24 to 0 89 respectively furthermore the etjh was the best alternative model for estimating the et in torbat e heydarieh sabzevar sarakhs quchan golmakan gonabad and mashhad stations with an under or overestimation ranging from 20 2 to 9 9 for these regions the values of rmse and nse for etjh method ranged from 0 27 to 1 74 and from 0 92 to 0 94 respectively for kashmar and dargaz the etham was the most accurate model during the warm season with an underestimation ranging from 3 1 to 3 9 table 6 for these regions the values of rmse and nse for the best estimation method ranged from 0 42 to 0 48 and from 0 82 to 0 90 respectively the etlin model estimated the et more accurately than the other models did with an overestimation of 9 9 and 14 4 in torbat e jam and khaf stations respectively in torbat e jam and khaf the values of rmse and nse for the best estimation method ranged from 1 13 to 2 19 and from 0 17 to 0 50 respectively 3 3 2 estimation of the eto etp during cool seasons 3 3 2 1 early spring crops the results showed that the eths method estimated the et more accurately than the other methods did when used during the early cool season in fariman quchan kashmar golmakan and neyshabour stations with an under or overestimation ranging from 17 8 to 5 1 table 6 for these regions the values of rmse and nse for eths method ranged from 0 35 to 1 19 and from 0 7 to 0 97 respectively the etjh was the most reliable method in torbat e heydarieh sabzevar sarakhs gonabad and mashhad stations with an under or overestimation ranging from 21 3 to 4 8 for these regions the values of rmse and nse for etjh method ranged from 0 49 to 1 41 and from 0 74 to 0 95 respectively the etlin was the best alternative method for estimating et during the early cool season in torbat e jam 11 4 and khaf 20 6 stations in torbat e jam and khaf the values of rmse and nse for the best estimation method ranged from 0 95 to 2 12 and from 0 76 to 0 92 respectively the etham was the most reliable method in dargaz with an underestimation of 4 6 table 6 3 3 2 2 fall or winter crops the results revealed that the eths was the best alternative method for estimating the et during the cool season in torbat e heydarieh sabzevar sarakhs fariman quchan kashmar golmakan mashhad and neyshabour stations with an under or overestimation ranging from 22 1 to 9 5 table 6 for these regions the values of rmse and nse for eths method ranged from 0 20 to 0 93 and from 0 90 to 0 99 respectively the etjh and etham were the most accurate models in gonabad and dargaz stations with an underestimation of 5 0 and 5 9 respectively table 6 in gonabad and dargaz the mean values of rmse and nse for the best estimation methods were 0 39 and 0 99 respectively furthermore the etlin was the best alternative model for estimating et during the cool season in torbat e jam 22 5 and khaf 37 8 stations 4 discussion there are various models for predicting the et with different complexity and accuracy meanwhile the simplicity and predictability performance of et models are the main determining factors where the availability of meteorological data is limited among the simple alternative methods the temperature based methods generally showed better performance than the radiation based methods for estimating daily et in the majority of study area this finding is in agreement with previous results in other arid regions banimahd et al 2014 esmaeili 2009 kousari et al 2013 valipour et al 2017 the statistical indicators showed various predictability performances among the alternative eto etp estimation methods the rbias suggested that the etlin overestimates the et while the other seven methods generally underestimate the et among the eto etp estimation methods the three temperature based models showed the best performance in 85 of the studied areas as the eths etham and etlin were the best daily et prediction methods in 54 15 and 15 of areas respectively the etjh was the best model among the studied radiation based models and took the first rank in 15 of areas nevertheless the efficiency coefficients of the etlin etmb and etmak models were less than 0 5 in 85 69 and 61 5 of areas respectively the results also indicated that the etmb model underestimated the mean daily et by more than 10 in the 69 of study areas and the etlin model overestimated daily et by more than 10 in 85 of areas furthermore the chi square test indicated that there was a significant difference between the daily et predictions of fao penman monteith model and the etmb model in the 77 of areas on the other hand the etmb predictions were not completely acceptable and the etlin and etmak models generally were not reliable for estimating the daily et in arid regions it has been reported that the etmb etmak and etlin do not perform well in most arid regions around the world efthimiou et al 2013 heydari et al 2014 irmak et al 2008 tabari et al 2011 zheng et al 2017 although they might be applicable to certain dry areas jacobs and de bruin 1998 sun et al 2016 the relationship between some meteorological parameters and the eto etp estimation methods in each area showed that the hargreaves samani and linacre methods generally had the best performance in regions with wind speeds less and more than 3 5 m s 1 respectively it has been reported that the eths is one of the best prediction methods in arid regions especially where the wind speed is less than 3 0 m s 1 droogers and allen 2002 todorovic et al 2013 in the north and northeast of khorasanrazavi province where the elevation is considerably lower than that in the other regions the etham provided the best estimates of et furthermore the etjh could produce reliable estimation of daily et in the south of khorasan razavi province where wind speed is less than 2 5 m s 1 and the sunshine duration is longer than 8 7 h all the eight models studied here produced different estimates of the et for particular sites across a range of climate regimes proving that local scale topography and microclimate conditions could affect the predictability performance of the models fisher et al 2011 lang et al 2017 zhang et al 2009 zheng et al 2017 zhang et al 2009 reported that wind speed sunshine duration temperature and relative humidity are the major climatic factors affecting the annual and seasonal variation of evapotranspiration they also found that the combined effect of wind speed sunshine duration and humidity was greater than the effect of temperature on the atmospheric evaporative demand peng et al 2017 reported that the most precise et estimation method varied for different regions and generally selected the hargreaves samani as the best alternative method in most arid regions of china the amount of crop water requirements is mainly determined by evaporative demand during the growing season here cumulative values of daily et during the growth period of the main cropping systems were calculated for evaluating the predictability and applicability of each eto etp estimation method the results showed that the best method for estimating et differed for different growing seasons in 54 of the study areas for warm growing season the etjh eths etlin and etham performed the best in 54 15 15 and 15 of the study areas respectively furthermore the cumulative et estimation during the early cool growing season february september showed that the eths etjh etlin and etham were the best alternative methods in 38 38 15 and 8 of the study areas respectively from october to june cool growing season the eths etlin etjh and etmak were the best estimation methods in 69 15 8 and 8 of the study areas in general the best estimates were obtained using the radiation based methods for the warm growing season and using the temperature based methods for the cool growing season bogawski and bednorz 2014 reported that the radiation based methods performed the best compared to mass transfer based pan coefficient based and temperature based methods during the warm season april october in poland zhang et al 2009 showed that radiation was the dominant climatic factor that affected et in summer for most stations of study areas in china while the importance of radiation on the et in spring and fall was far smaller than that in summer differences in the et estimations during the growing season between the best alternative methods and reference method showed that the over or underestimation by the alternative methods were less than 15 in most regions 69 however divergence between estimations of the best alternative methods and reference method was greater than 15 for one or all growing seasons in torbat e jam khaf sabzevar and fariman thus even the best alternative methods were unreliable in these areas and could not be recommended for use in agricultural managements todorovic et al 2013 showed that the differences between et predictions of the hargreaves samani and fao penman monteith were within 10 in most hyper arid and arid regions and in large parts of semi arid areas 5 conclusions using long term daily weather data collected from 13 weather stations across arid regions in the northeast iran several simple models were assessed for their potential to estimate the et the results indicated that performance of the eto etp estimation methods was variable among the different regions meanwhile the hargreaves samani method was a simple reliable alternative method for the et estimation in most arid regions furthermore the results indicated that the temperature based methods were more accurate than the radiation based methods for estimating the et in the study areas among the radiation based methods the jensen haise method was the only method which was reliable in some regions the statistical analysis showed that the mcguinness bordne linacre and makkink models generally could not be considered as reliable alternative methods for estimating daily et in the arid regions our results revealed that local scale topography and microclimate features might affect the performance of the eto etp estimation methods the hargreaves samani method had a good accuracy for the et prediction in regions where wind speed is less than 3 5 m s 1 in areas with high elevation 1253 m long sunshine duration more than 8 7 h and wind speed less than 2 5 m s 1 the jensen haise method had a very good accuracy for the et prediction the cumulative values of daily et during the growth periods of the main cropping systems were calculated for evaluating the predictability performance and applicability of each eto etp estimation method for estimating crop water requirements in general the jensen haise method performed the best compared to the other alternative methods during the warm season while the hargreaves samani method was the best for cool growing seasons for practical application the simple alternative methods of hargreaves samani and the jensen haise are recommended for use within arid and semi arid agricultural regions of khorasan razavi province where daily weather data are limited to just temperature and solar radiation or sunshine hours nevertheless the spatio temporal variations of et estimates across the regions and growing seasons should be consider to determine the exact water requirements of

mm in 2016 were applied over two week period after sowing the objective of these irrigations were to keep soil surface wet for good emergence irrigation treatments were started after crop was well established mainly focusing on two critical growth stages of canola vegetative and reproductive four different irrigation treatments were used they were full season irrigation fi no irrigation at the vegetative stage vs no irrigation at the reproductive stage rs and dryland dl the fi was a control treatment with full irrigation throughout the cropping season to minimize yield damages irrigation was given every 2 3 weeks interval and the amount depended on environmental conditions crop growth stage and soil moisture observations the maximum amount targeted for full irrigation was 300 mm which will be the highest irrigation a producer can spare on any alternative crops in the region due to limited water availability irrigation was initiated at the same time and same amount for all treatments and individual treatments were imposed by irrigating or skipping irrigation at individual irrigation events or growth phases for example fi received irrigation during all irrigation events while irrigation was skipped in dl after initial establishment irrigation similarly irrigation was skipped from crop establishment to flower initiation for vs and from flowering to maturity for rs treatments additional irrigation amounts of 216 139 and 77 mm in 2015 and 203 114 and 89 mm in 2016 were applied after crop establishment to fi vs and rs treatment plots respectively fig 1 spring canola was harvested on 23 july 2015 and 20 july 2016 2 2 data collections neutron access tubes were installed immediately after sowing they were installed to a soil depth of 1 6 m in the central crop

pacific nuclear inc ca usa to assess moisture to the depth of 1 6 m soil moisture observations were made immediately after planting to immediately after harvest at regular intervals to account for all soil moisture used by canola soil water content mm at different depths were calculated by multiplying depth increment mm with volumetric water content for each depth increment total soil water content for each treatment plots at each sampling dates were calculated by adding soil water contents of each depth to 1 6 m soil water depletion due to crop water extraction at each depth between two

san jose ca 3 results and discussion 3 1 environmental conditions rainfall and temperature patterns during the growing seasons of spring canola in 2015 and 2016 are presented in fig 1 total annual rainfall was higher 811 mm in 2015 and lower 342 mm in 2016 compared to the past 10 year average 2005 2014 annual rainfall of 422 mm the sr april to july was also higher 313 mm in 2015 but lower 161 mm in 2016 compared to the past 10 year average 2005 2014 sr of 187 mm the proportion of sr received during vegetative 9 60 days after planting dap and reproductive 60 107 dap phases were 66 207 mm and 34 106 mm in 2015 respectively however it was 45 72 mm during vegetative 11 54 dap and 55 89 mm during reproductive 54 103 dap phases in 2016 total seasonal rainfall plus irrigation for fi rs vs and dl were 562 473 485 and 346 mm in 2015 while in drier year of 2016 it was 402 288 313 and 199 respectively average maximum and minimum temperatures during the growing season in either year were similar to the past 10 year average 2005 2014 maximum and minimum seasonal temperatures april to july of 28 and 11 c respectively these maximum and minimum temperatures during vegetative phase were 23 and 6 c in 2015 while 23 and 5 c in 2016 and reproductive phase were 30 and 16 c in 2015 while 32 and 16 c in 2016 respectively 3 2 seasonal soil moisture content averaged across cultivars data showed significant differences in seasonal soil water contents at each soil depth down to 1 6 m in four irrigation treatments of two years fig 2 seasonal pattern of soil water content in wet year of 2015 was different compared to that of 2016 in both years the wettest soil profile was observed around 50 days in the study area most annual crops utilize all available soil moisture during the season and not much moisture remains in the soil for subsequent crops rainfall and snowfall after summer growing season is small and unpredictable therefore it is common to have empty or half filled soil profile in the beginning of the season however in the current study soil water was significantly lower at all depths end of the season compared to beginning of the growing season in all irrigation treatments and in both wet and dry years this suggests that there was some available moisture in the soil profile when canola was planted water requirement of spring canola in the first half of the growing season is small as it is still increasing leaf and pod surface area for transpiration katuwal et al 2018 therefore seasonal rainfall and irrigation exceeded crop water use during the vegetative growth period of canola and that led to accumulation of water in the profile soil moisture depletion due to water extraction by canola was observed to a depth of 1 60 m in both wet and dry years as well as in all irrigation treatments singh et al 2016b also observed different irrigation treatments having similar depth of moisture depletion due to water extraction by safflower in the same location however kar et al 2007 found higher rooting depth in well irrigated treatment compared to non irrigated treatments in safflower linseed and mustard in different location although canola depleted soil moisture to a similar depth in all irrigation treatments time for significant water depletion at lower depths was varied across irrigation treatments or water availability in the current study for example in 2016 treatments which did not receive irrigation after flowering rs and dl showed earlier depletion of soil moisture at 1 60 m depth effects of irrigation treatments and growing seasons in soil moisture profile persisted even after harvest of canola more moisture remained in the profile after harvest in year that received more sr or in treatments those received irrigation after flowering fi and vs the vs treatment which recovered from earlier stress produced mostly similar biomass and seed yield as fi table 1 katuwal et al 2018 and had end of the season soil moisture profile close to fi this indicates that vs relied more on irrigation than on previously retained soil moisture for recovery from earlier stress the rs treatment which received irrigation before flowering accumulated higher leaf area and biomass at late vegetative stage katuwal et al 2018 and therefore probably had more et requirement during initial reproductive stage compared to vs and dl when irrigation was skipped after flowering in rs canola relied on previously retained insufficient soil moisture and therefore reduced harvest biomass and seed yield as well as profile soil moisture content at the end of the season compared to vs 3 3 soil water extraction soil water extraction during vegetative and reproductive stages showed effect of irrigation treatments fig 3 treatment fi received 108 mm of irrigation and extracted total 1 8 mm of soil moisture whereas dl received 76 mm less irrigation and extracted 4 8 fold 8 5 mm more soil moisture compared to fi to meet the demand of its biomass similar to fi katuwal et al 2018 during vegetative stage in 2015 all moisture was extracted from the top depth down to 0 6 m soil moisture was accumulated below 0 6 m depth in all treatments due to rainfall and irrigation exceeding the et requirement during vegetative stage greater moisture was accumulated in treatments receiving irrigation during vegetative stage for example fi accumulated 9 4 mm more water than dl below 0 6 m 0 6 1 6 m soil depth treatments which accumulated more moisture during vegetative stage fi and rs also extracted more water during reproductive stage in 2015 the fi and rs on average extracted 6 4 mm of more water than both vs and dl during reproductive stage treatment vs well utilized 139 mm of irrigation applied during reproductive stage to produce seed and oil yields similar to fi table 1 which received irrigation throughout the study period and also extracted more soil moisture during reproductive stage in 2016 irrigated and non irrigated treatments during vegetative stage showed distinct water extraction pattern similar to experimental year of 2015 irrigated treatments stored more water in the soil profile than non irrigated treatments during vegetative stage in 2016 higher leaf area index and biomass observed in irrigated treatments katuwal et al 2018 was not large enough to utilize 89 mm extra irrigation applied to fi and rs during vegetative stages in 2016 during reproductive stage in 2016 irrigation interacted with leaf area index and biomass to affect soil water extraction in spite of having the lowest leaf area index and biomass katuwal et al 2018 dl extracted second highest soil moisture after rs irrigated treatments vs and fi received 114 mm of extra water during reproductive stage in 2016 they recorded 54 and 81 higher harvest biomass and 213 and 263 higher seed yield in vs and fi compared to dl respectively table 1 katuwal et al 2018 which they achieved by efficiently utilizing that extra water received through irrigation in contrast rs treatment in 2016 had higher leaf area index and biomass compared to dl when stress was imposed by stopping irrigation katuwal et al 2018 and it relied on soil moisture extraction to produce higher biomass and seed yield over dl it extracted 33 41 more soil moisture compared to irrigated treatments rainfall confounds rooting depth assessment in such studies however if you observe 49 65 dap in 2015 and 56 73 dap in 2016 treatments stressed during reproductive stage rooted deeper by 20 cm this suggests that when stressed during reproductive stage canola tried to extract more soil moisture to meet its sink demand but extra soil moisture was not enough to reduce stress completely and maintain productivity similar to fi total water extraction from planting to harvest was in general greater in 2016 than in 2015 for all treatments at each soil depth fig 4 treatment separation was prominent in 2016 but not in 2015 for total water extraction in individual depths showing seasonal variability results variation in soil water use and treatment performances in water extraction in both years canola extracted the greatest amount of water from shallow depth 0 2 0 4 m in all treatment conditions when water extraction from individual depth was compared canola has 60 root volume and great portion of root surface area in 0 0 4 m soil depth cutforth et al 2013 gan et al 2011 greater root distribution in shallow depth probably resulted greater water extration by canola from shallow soil in the present study although canola extracted the greatest amount of water from shallower depth it was able to extract 0 3 15 of total water from deeper soil layer 1 4 1 6 m which was greater in drier year 2016 and treatment dl this result suggests the suitability of deficit irrigated canola production in the semi arid sgp as canola can tap into deeper soil moisture to supplement limited irrigation average across treatments all three cultivars extracted similar amount of water from each depth down to 1 0 m in both year fig 5 however cultivar l140 extracted average 180 and 27 more water in 2015 and 2016 than other two cultivars from deep soil layer 1 0 1 6 m soil depth respectively the l140 had greater leaf area biomass and pod numbers compared to other two cultivars in both years katuwal et al 2018 and it had to rely on deep soil moisture to meet the extra demand of water greater biomass production with greater affinity toward deep soil moisture by l140 indicating suitability of this cultivar over other two cultivars in water deficit condition of the sgp although quantity of water extracted from deep soil layer vary across cultivars total soil depth for water extraction was similar in all cultivars in all treatment conditions data not presented this result indicated no effect of treatment on water extraction depth of each cultivar similar results were found in cultivars of safflower singh et al 2016b and corn hao et al 2015 in the sgp however future study using more deeper soil moisture profile analysis would help to better clarify treatment effects on water extraction depth of individual cultivars 3 4 evapotranspiration and water use efficiency irrigation treatments and cultivars had significant effects on seasonal et of canola in both years of 2015 and 2016 table 1 seasonal et was ranges from 281 to 582 mm based on irrigation treatment and seasonal conditions previous studies in semi arid climatic conditions also reported similar range of et or 239 462 mm by dogan et al 2011 and 368 602 mm by majnooni heris et al 2014 in canola at different irrigation regimes the higher soil moisture especially in the top layers during 2015 due to higher sr enabled higher et in 2015 than in 2016 similarly et was also greater in treatment that received irrigation in all irrigation phases fi than the ones that did not receive irrigation at vegetative and or reproductive phase the fi had 15 32 and 55 greater et in 2015 while 21 26 and 63 greater et in 2016 compared to vs rs and dl respectively fi had the highest et among irrigation treatments in both years table 1 et in vs was significantly lower than fi but was higher than rs dl had the lowest et among irrigation treatments in both years strong linear regressions of et with harvest biomass and seed yield r2 0 64 and 0 72 for harvest biomass and seed yield respectively were obtained these results suggest increasing et by adequate irrigation and sr increases canola biomass and seed yield production similar results of greater seed yield due to greater et was reported by previous researchers in canola hergert et al 2016 angadi et al 2008 sunflower karam et al 2007 and safflower singh et al 2016b in addition to biomass and seed yield oil content was also greater in wetter year and treatments with greater et bilibio et al 2011 reported similar result of greater canola oil content in treatment with greater et and suggested canola enhanced oil formation with increasing et by increasing irrigation however growers concern is to reduce seasonal et without much reducing yield or optimize water use efficiency using judicious irrigation practices under water deficit conditions as overall aboveground biomass and leaf area index reaches peak during reproductive stage katuwal et al 2018 it probably increases total surface water loss through transpiration or increase et requirement in canola in addition to increased et requirement reproductive stage is characterized by many water sensitive processes such as floral retention floral bud development to pod and assimilate supply from leaves and pods for seed setting which determine yield formation in oilseed crops sweeney et al 2003 eck et al 1987 skipping irrigation during vegetative stage and irrigating only during reproductive stage when et requirement is greater and critical treatment vs reduced seasonal et compared to fi the vs reduced 13 and 18 of et without significantly changing seed yield table 1 katuwal et al 2018 treatment vs had numerically the greatest wuepb wuesy and wueoy although statistically mostly similar to fi similar to vs treatment rs and dl also reduced et compared to fi however biomass and yield losses were substantial making these irrigation strategies unsuitable for growers the rs and dl had similar wuesy and wueoy and their average wuesy and wueoy were almost half to the wuesy and wueoy in fi these results indicate limiting irrigation throughout growing season or even only during reproductive stage can significantly reduce efficiency of canola to produce seed and oil yields per unit water it consumes similar result of lowered efficiency in seed yield production per unit water consumption due to skipping irrigation during flowering or throughout growing season was previously reported in winter canola tesfamariam et al 2010 and wheat xue et al 2014 however safflower which is another potential alternative crop for the sgp showed unique result of increased water use efficiency for seed production when irrigation was withheld during reproductive stage or throughout growing season singh et al 2016b istanbulluoglu 2009 safflower s contrasting water use efficiency to canola in different growth stage based irrigation treatments suggest existence of genotypic variability in water sensitivity of individual growth phase and water use efficiency although rs and dl had similar wuesy and wueoy they differ for wuepb treatment rs had 27 and 7 greater wuepb compared to dl in 2015 and 2016 respectively extra irrigation applied during vegetative stage in rs supported vegetative growth and therefore increased its overall biomass production per unit water consumption compared to dl cultivar l140 had the greatest seasonal et in both experimental years table 1 as equal sr and irrigation was applied in all three cultivars greater et in l140 was due to its greater ability to pull up deep soil moisture the l140 had consistently the greatest wuepb with average 30 and 32 greater wuepb in 2015 and 2016 compared to both h930 and h955 respectively the l140 also had 34 and 36 greater wuesy and wueoy in drier year of 2016 compared to both h930 and h955 respectively these results suggest l140 could be the suitable spring canola cultivar for semi arid climatic conditions of the sgp 4 conclusions the results of two year study showed significant effects of growth stage based irrigation treatments and cultivars on spring canola soil water extraction wuesy wueoy and wuepb the vs extracted similar amount of total water 20 mm as fi during planting to harvest in wetter year 2015 but extracted 16 more water in drier year 2016 from soil depth down to 1 6 m extra water extracted by vs in 2016 was mostly from deeper profile 1 0 1 6 m although vs received 33 less irrigation in both years it maintained oil content similar to fi and maximized wuesy wueoy and wuepb by extracting more water from deeper profile when needed in contrast to vs rs and dl reduced oil content wuesy wueoy and wuepb regardless of the fact that they extracted either similar or greater water compared to vs suggesting irrigation during reproductive stage is critical all treatments had similar water extraction depth 1 6 m future study considering additional soil depth for water extraction measurement would clarify if water extraction depth varies across treatments among cultivars l140 maintained the greatest wuepb in both years and the greatest wuesy and wueoy in drier year 2016 by extracting deeper soil moisture when required therefore adopting l140 spring canola as an alternative crop and skipping irrigation at the vegetative stage could optimize water productivity in the semi arid sgp

main resource for irrigation in the semi arid u s southern great plains sgp chaudhuri and ale 2014 water from the ogallala aquifer currently supports 30 of irrigated agriculture in usa that transformed the sgp as the breadbasket of the world steward and allen 2016 the aquifer currently holds 368 million hectare meter of fossils water with rainfall as the only source of recharge mcguire 2003 however the extensive water withdrawal for irrigation has significantly depleted the aquifer for example in western kansas irrigation demand is 305 mm per year exceeding the rate of recharge that ranges from 13 to 76 mm per year in the region sanderson and frey 2015 annual precipitation only provides 15 of pumping needs leading the system to be unsustainable steward et al 2013 steward et al

2002 short growing season of spring canola further reduces its irrigation requirement therefore spring canola can be a potential alternative crop for the region deficit irrigation di is a way of using limited irrigation water resources in which crops are supplied with water below their evapotranspiration requirements during less critical growth stages yang et al 2017 the di help maximize crop water

strategy would best fit to cropping system of the sgp by reducing irrigation need without significantly reducing seed and oil yields however soil water extraction profile across rooting zones and water use efficiency of canola in response to di has not been previously discussed and or studied in the region information on soil water extraction profile is critical in determining the suitability of canola with di in pulling up of water from various soil depths unused by previous crops and the surplus water it may leave for subsequent crop the objective of the study was to assess soil water

established mainly focusing on two critical growth stages of canola vegetative and reproductive four different irrigation treatments were used they were full season irrigation fi no irrigation at the vegetative stage vs no irrigation at the reproductive stage rs and dryland dl the fi was a control treatment with full irrigation throughout the cropping season to minimize yield damages irrigation was given every 2 3 weeks interval and the amount depended on environmental conditions crop growth stage and soil moisture observations the maximum amount targeted for full irrigation was 300 mm which will be the highest irrigation a producer can spare on any alternative crops in the region due to limited water availability irrigation was initiated at the same time and same amount for all treatments and individual treatments were imposed by irrigating or skipping irrigation at individual irrigation events or growth phases for example fi received irrigation during all irrigation events while irrigation was skipped in dl after initial establishment irrigation similarly irrigation was skipped from crop establishment to flower initiation for vs and from flowering to maturity for rs treatments additional irrigation amounts of 216 139 and 77 mm in 2015 and 203 114 and 89 mm in 2016 were applied after crop establishment to fi vs and rs treatment plots respectively fig 1 spring

rainfall was higher 811 mm in 2015 and lower 342 mm in 2016 compared to the past 10 year average 2005 2014 annual rainfall of 422 mm the sr april to july was also higher 313 mm in 2015 but lower 161 mm in 2016 compared to the past 10 year average 2005 2014 sr of 187 mm the proportion of sr received during vegetative 9 60 days after planting dap and reproductive 60 107 dap phases were 66 207 mm and 34 106 mm in 2015 respectively however it was 45 72 mm during vegetative 11 54 dap and 55 89 mm during reproductive 54 103 dap phases in 2016 total seasonal rainfall plus irrigation for fi rs vs and dl were 562 473 485 and 346 mm in 2015 while in drier year of 2016 it was 402 288 313 and 199 respectively average maximum and minimum temperatures during the growing season in either year were similar to the past 10 year average 2005 2014 maximum and minimum seasonal temperatures april to july of 28 and 11 c respectively these maximum and minimum temperatures during vegetative phase were 23 and 6 c in 2015 while 23 and 5 c in 2016 and reproductive phase were 30 and 16 c in 2015 while 32 and 16 c in 2016 respectively 3 2 seasonal soil moisture content averaged across cultivars data showed significant differences in seasonal soil water contents at each soil depth down to 1 6 m in four irrigation treatments of two years fig 2 seasonal pattern of soil water content in wet year of 2015 was different compared to that of 2016 in both years the wettest soil profile was observed around 50 days in the study area most annual crops utilize all available soil moisture during the season and not much moisture remains in the soil for subsequent crops rainfall and snowfall after summer growing season is small and unpredictable therefore it is common to have empty or half filled soil profile in the beginning of the season however in the current study soil water was significantly lower at all depths end of the season compared to beginning of the growing season in all irrigation treatments and in both wet and dry years this suggests that there was some available moisture in the soil profile when canola was planted water requirement of spring canola in the first half of the growing season is small as it is still increasing leaf and pod surface area for transpiration katuwal et al 2018 therefore seasonal rainfall and irrigation exceeded crop water use during the vegetative growth period of canola and that led to accumulation of water in the profile soil moisture depletion due to water extraction by canola was observed to a depth of 1 60 m in both wet and dry years as well as in all irrigation treatments singh et al 2016b also observed different irrigation treatments having similar depth of moisture depletion due to water extraction by safflower in the same location however kar et al 2007 found higher rooting depth in well irrigated treatment compared to non irrigated treatments in safflower linseed and mustard in different location although canola depleted soil moisture to a similar depth in all irrigation treatments time for significant water depletion at lower depths was varied across irrigation treatments or water availability in the current study for example in 2016 treatments which did not receive irrigation after flowering rs and dl showed earlier depletion of soil moisture at 1 60 m depth effects of irrigation treatments and growing seasons in soil moisture profile persisted even after harvest of canola more moisture remained in the profile after harvest in year that received more sr or in treatments those received irrigation after flowering fi and vs the vs treatment which recovered from earlier stress produced mostly similar biomass and seed yield as fi table 1 katuwal et al 2018 and had end of the season soil moisture profile close to fi this indicates that vs relied more on irrigation than on previously retained soil moisture for recovery from earlier stress the rs treatment which received irrigation before flowering accumulated higher leaf area and biomass at late vegetative stage katuwal et al 2018 and therefore probably had more et requirement during initial reproductive stage compared to vs and dl when irrigation was skipped after flowering in rs canola relied on previously retained insufficient soil moisture and therefore reduced harvest biomass and seed yield as well as profile soil moisture content at the end of the season compared to vs 3 3 soil water extraction soil water extraction during vegetative and reproductive stages showed effect of irrigation treatments fig 3 treatment fi received 108 mm of irrigation and extracted total 1 8 mm of soil moisture whereas dl received 76 mm less irrigation and extracted 4 8 fold 8 5 mm more soil moisture compared to fi to meet the demand of its biomass similar to fi katuwal et al 2018 during vegetative stage in 2015 all moisture was extracted from the top depth down to 0 6 m soil moisture was accumulated below 0 6 m depth in all treatments due to rainfall and irrigation exceeding the et requirement during vegetative stage greater moisture was accumulated in treatments receiving irrigation during vegetative stage for example fi accumulated 9 4 mm more water than dl below 0 6 m 0 6 1 6 m soil depth treatments which accumulated more moisture during vegetative stage fi and rs also extracted more water during reproductive stage in 2015 the fi and rs on average extracted 6 4 mm of more water than both vs and dl during reproductive stage treatment vs well utilized 139 mm of irrigation applied during reproductive stage to produce seed and oil yields similar to fi table 1 which received irrigation throughout the study period and also extracted more soil moisture during reproductive stage in 2016 irrigated and non irrigated treatments during vegetative stage showed distinct water extraction pattern similar to experimental year of 2015 irrigated treatments stored more water in the soil profile than non irrigated treatments during vegetative stage in 2016 higher leaf area index and biomass observed in irrigated treatments katuwal et al 2018 was not large enough to utilize 89 mm extra irrigation applied to fi and rs during vegetative stages in 2016 during reproductive stage in 2016 irrigation interacted with leaf area index and biomass to affect soil water extraction in spite of having the lowest leaf area index and biomass katuwal et al 2018 dl extracted second highest soil moisture after rs irrigated treatments vs and fi received 114 mm of extra water during reproductive stage in 2016 they recorded 54 and 81 higher harvest biomass and 213 and 263 higher seed yield in vs and fi compared to dl respectively table 1 katuwal et al 2018 which they achieved by efficiently utilizing that extra water received through irrigation in contrast rs treatment in 2016 had higher leaf area index and biomass compared to dl when stress was imposed by stopping irrigation katuwal et al 2018 and it relied on soil moisture extraction to produce higher biomass and seed yield over dl it extracted 33 41 more soil moisture compared to irrigated treatments rainfall confounds rooting depth assessment in such studies however if you observe 49 65 dap in 2015 and 56 73 dap in 2016 treatments stressed during reproductive stage rooted deeper by 20 cm this suggests that when stressed during reproductive stage canola tried to extract more soil moisture to meet its sink demand but extra soil moisture was not enough to reduce stress completely and maintain productivity similar to fi total water extraction from planting to harvest was in general greater in 2016 than in 2015 for all treatments at each soil depth fig 4 treatment separation was prominent in 2016 but not in 2015 for total water extraction in individual depths showing seasonal variability results variation in soil water use and treatment performances in water extraction in both years canola extracted the greatest amount of water from shallow depth 0 2 0 4 m in all treatment conditions when water extraction from individual depth was compared canola has 60 root volume and great portion of root surface area in 0 0 4 m soil depth cutforth et al 2013 gan et al 2011 greater root distribution in shallow depth probably resulted greater water extration by canola from shallow soil in the present study although canola extracted the greatest amount of water from shallower depth it was able to extract 0 3 15 of total water from deeper soil layer 1 4 1 6 m which was greater in drier year 2016 and treatment dl this result suggests the suitability of deficit irrigated canola production in the semi arid sgp as canola can tap into deeper soil moisture to supplement limited irrigation average across treatments all three cultivars extracted similar amount of water from each depth down to 1 0 m in both year fig 5 however cultivar l140 extracted average 180 and 27 more water in 2015 and 2016 than other two cultivars from deep soil layer 1 0 1 6 m soil depth respectively the l140 had greater leaf area biomass and pod numbers compared to other two cultivars in both years katuwal et al 2018 and it had to rely on deep soil moisture to meet the extra demand of water greater biomass production with greater affinity toward deep soil moisture by l140 indicating suitability of this cultivar over other two cultivars in water deficit condition of the sgp although quantity of water extracted from deep soil layer vary across cultivars total soil depth for water extraction was similar in all cultivars in all treatment conditions data not presented this result indicated no effect of treatment on water extraction depth of each cultivar similar results were found in cultivars of safflower singh et al 2016b and corn hao et al 2015 in the sgp however future study using more deeper soil moisture profile analysis would help to better clarify treatment effects on water extraction depth of individual cultivars 3 4 evapotranspiration and water use efficiency irrigation treatments and cultivars had significant effects on seasonal et of canola in both years of 2015 and 2016 table 1 seasonal et was ranges from 281 to 582 mm based on irrigation treatment and seasonal conditions previous studies in semi arid climatic conditions also reported similar range of et or 239 462 mm by dogan et al 2011 and 368 602 mm by majnooni heris et al 2014 in canola at different irrigation regimes the higher soil moisture especially in the top layers during 2015 due to higher sr enabled higher et in 2015 than in 2016 similarly et was also greater in treatment that received irrigation in all irrigation phases fi than the ones that did not receive irrigation at vegetative and or reproductive phase the fi had 15 32 and 55 greater et in 2015 while 21 26 and 63 greater et in 2016 compared to vs rs and dl respectively fi had the highest et among irrigation treatments in both years table 1 et in vs was significantly lower than fi but was higher than rs dl had the lowest et among irrigation treatments in both years strong linear regressions of et with harvest biomass and seed yield r2 0 64 and 0 72 for harvest biomass and seed yield respectively were obtained these results suggest increasing et by adequate irrigation and sr increases canola biomass and seed yield production similar results of greater seed yield due to greater et was reported by previous researchers in canola hergert et al 2016 angadi et al 2008 sunflower karam et al 2007 and safflower singh et al 2016b in addition to biomass and seed yield oil content was also greater in wetter year and treatments with greater et bilibio et al 2011 reported similar result of greater canola oil content in treatment with greater et and suggested canola enhanced oil formation with increasing et by increasing irrigation however growers concern is to reduce seasonal et without much reducing yield or optimize water use efficiency using judicious irrigation practices under water deficit conditions as overall aboveground biomass and leaf area index reaches peak during reproductive stage katuwal et al 2018 it probably increases total surface water loss through transpiration or increase et requirement in canola in addition to increased et requirement reproductive stage is characterized by many water sensitive processes such as floral retention floral bud development to pod and assimilate supply from leaves and pods for seed setting which determine yield formation in oilseed crops sweeney et al 2003 eck et al 1987 skipping irrigation during vegetative stage and irrigating only during reproductive stage when et requirement is greater and critical treatment vs reduced seasonal et compared to fi the vs reduced 13 and 18 of et without significantly changing seed yield table 1 katuwal et al 2018 treatment vs had numerically the greatest wuepb wuesy and wueoy although statistically mostly similar to fi similar to vs treatment rs and dl also reduced et compared to fi however biomass and yield losses were substantial making these irrigation strategies unsuitable for growers the rs and dl had similar wuesy and wueoy and their average wuesy and wueoy were almost half to the wuesy and wueoy in fi these results indicate limiting irrigation throughout growing season or even only during reproductive stage can significantly reduce efficiency of canola to produce seed and oil yields per unit water it consumes similar result of lowered efficiency in seed yield production per unit water consumption due to skipping irrigation during flowering or throughout growing season was previously reported in winter canola tesfamariam et al 2010 and wheat xue et al 2014 however safflower which is another potential alternative crop for the sgp showed unique result of increased water use efficiency for seed production when irrigation was withheld during reproductive stage or throughout growing season singh et al 2016b istanbulluoglu 2009 safflower s contrasting water use efficiency to canola in different growth stage based irrigation treatments suggest existence of genotypic variability in water sensitivity of individual growth phase and water use efficiency although rs and dl had similar wuesy and wueoy they differ for wuepb treatment rs had 27 and 7 greater wuepb compared to dl in 2015 and 2016 respectively extra irrigation applied during vegetative stage in rs supported vegetative growth and therefore increased its overall biomass production per unit water consumption compared to dl cultivar l140 had the greatest seasonal et in both experimental years table 1 as equal sr and irrigation was applied in all three cultivars greater et in l140 was due to its greater ability to pull up deep soil moisture the l140 had consistently the greatest wuepb with average 30 and 32 greater wuepb in 2015 and 2016 compared to both h930 and h955 respectively the l140 also had 34 and 36 greater wuesy and wueoy in drier year of 2016 compared to both h930 and h955 respectively these results suggest l140 could be the suitable spring canola cultivar for semi arid climatic conditions of the sgp 4 conclusions the results of two year study showed significant effects of growth stage based irrigation treatments and cultivars on spring canola soil water extraction wuesy wueoy and wuepb the vs extracted similar amount of total water 20 mm as fi during planting to harvest in wetter year 2015 but extracted 16 more water in drier year 2016 from soil depth down to 1 6 m extra water extracted by vs in 2016 was mostly from deeper profile 1 0 1 6 m although vs received 33 less irrigation in both years it maintained oil content similar to fi and maximized wuesy wueoy and wuepb by extracting more water from deeper profile when needed in contrast to vs rs and dl reduced oil content wuesy wueoy and wuepb regardless of the fact that they extracted either similar or greater water compared to vs suggesting irrigation during reproductive stage is critical all treatments had similar water extraction depth 1 6 m future study considering additional soil depth for water extraction measurement would clarify if water extraction depth varies across treatments among cultivars l140 maintained the greatest wuepb in both years and the greatest wuesy and wueoy in drier year 2016 by extracting deeper soil moisture when required therefore adopting l140 spring canola as an alternative crop and skipping irrigation at the vegetative stage could optimize water productivity in the semi arid sgp

10554,in this study two artificial neural network models viz supervised feed forward back propagation ff bp and unsupervised kohonen self organizing map k som have been developed to predict the crop water stress index cwsi using air temperature relative humidity and canopy temperature field experiments were conducted on indian mustard to observe the crop canopy temperature under different levels of irrigation treatment during the 2017 and 2018 cropping seasons the empirical cwsi was computed using well watered and non transpiring baseline canopy temperatures the k som and ff bp cwsi predictions were compared with the empirical cwsi estimates and both performed satisfactorily of the two however the k som was better with r2 coefficient of determination of 0 97 and 0 96 for model development and validation respectively corresponding values for ff bp were 0 86 and 0 75 the results of the study suggest that neural network modelling offers significant potential for reliable prediction of the cwsi which can be utilized in irrigation scheduling and crop stress management keywords artificial neural networks self organizing map taylor diagram crop water stress index indian mustard 1 introduction irrigated agriculture is essential to global food production accounting for nearly 70 of the total freshwater withdrawal shankar et al 2017 however freshwater resources are limited and severely stressed due to climatic change hence effective utilization of existing water resources is essential through improved irrigation efficiency without compromising with the yield production of crops the application of optimized irrigation schedules on field crops results in improved water use efficiency but requires an improved understanding of physical interactions between the soil plant air and precise estimation of the crop water requirements berbel et al 2018 conventional methods for irrigation scheduling are based on soil moisture measurements and evapotranspiration estimates zhang and pierce 2016 poddar et al 2018 the former approach is destructive and might require soil water balance computations whereas the latter involves intensive climatic data collection most of which are either unavailable or unfeasible in actual field conditions osroosh et al 2016 infrared thermometry based canopy temperature is a non destructive reliable and recognized indicator of plant water status fuchs 1990 gonzález dugo et al 2014 kumar et al 2019 several indices based on canopy temperature have been developed of which the most widely used index is the crop water stress index cwsi ihuoma and madramootoo 2017 cwsi has been used for stress detection irrigation scheduling and yield prediction purposes in many crops under different agro climatic conditions yuan et al 2004 emekli et al 2007 gontia and tiwari 2008 gonzález dugo et al 2014 bellvert et al 2016 kumar et al 2020 anda et al 2020 the principle underlying cwsi is the relative transpirational cooling of the leaf surface gerhards et al 2019 when adequate soil moisture is available for the plants the transpiration takes place at the potential rate cooling the leaf surface relative to the ambient air temperature but as the moisture depletes the transpiration is lowered causing a reduction in the relative cooling of the leaf surface the limits of cwsi are 0 and 1 where 0 indicates the non water stressed or well watered condition and 1 represents the maximum water stressed or non transpiring condition cwsi can be computed using either the theoretical approach or the empirical approach the theoretical approach is based on the energy balance model and was proposed by jackson et al 1981 this approach provides precise estimates of the cwsi but its computation requires large model input parameters particularly aero dynamic resistance and net radiation values field estimation of which is complex and infeasible alghory and yazar 2019 the empirical approach idso et al 1981 on the other hand is relatively simple to use and provides reliable estimates of cwsi it considers two baseline temperatures viz well watered and non transpiring canopy temperatures the cwsi is empirically computed using the relation given in eq 1 1 c w s i t c t a t w w t a t d r y t a t w w t a where tc actual canopy temperature 0c ta air temperature 0c tww is the canopy temperature of a plant transpiring at full potential when the soil moisture is adequate and tdry is the canopy temperature of a non transpiring plant due to stomatal closure when the soil becomes dry the reliability of the empirically computed cwsi depends on the precise estimation of the baseline temperatures tww and tdry however their estimation is difficult as both involve field soil moisture that is either undesirable tdry that requires the crop to wither or unattainable tww that requires a perpetually saturated soil in practical conditions méndez barroso et al 2008 pramanik et al 2017 the traditional approach for obtaining the tww and tdry is based on regression between vapour pressure deficit and canopy air temperature differential the use of artificial reference surfaces pou et al 2014 and physical models jones 1999 has been suggested for estimating the baseline temperatures but their application in the field is limited due to extensive maintenance of reference surfaces and complex parameter requirements of the physical models park 2018 hence parsimonious models that can predict the cwsi with reasonable accuracy without the need of the baseline temperatures will enhance the utilization of cwsi as a tool for monitoring crop stress and scheduling irrigation dold et al 2019 data driven artificial intelligence modelling techniques such as artificial neural networks ann have been successfully used in modelling non linear complex relationships for predicting physical variables or conditions the beauty of these modelling techniques is that they do not explicitly require the mathematical form of the model and still can give good results even with minimum data generally the supervised feed forward back propagation ff bp modelling approach is favoured and has been widely used in various water resources applications including rainfall runoff modelling evapotranspiration reservoir operations streamflow prediction and many more asce task committee on application of artificial neural networks in hydrology 2000 adeloye et al 2012 however a problem with ff bp is that its prediction ability is affected by the outliers or missing values in fact ff bp has been found to give unrealistic predictions where such noise is present in the input data rustum 2009 the unsupervised kohonen self organizing maps k som on the other hand have no specific input or output variables since all the variables in the input vector are also contained in each unit of the output layer kohonen et al 1996 this way the k som is able to handle missing data and can extract useful information even when the data is noisy the k som has been successfully used in evapotranspiration modelling adeloye et al 2011 rainfall runoff modelling adeloye and rustum 2012 streamflow forecasting mwale et al 2012 global water flows assessment clark et al 2015 soil moisture riese and keller 2018 groundwater studies chen et al 2018 wastewater treatment ramachandran et al 2019 and irrigation management ohana levi et al 2019 although the application of ann modelling to predict the well watered canopy temperature has been reported king and shellie 2016 to the best of our knowledge ann has never been utilized for direct prediction of cwsi and there has not been a reported study on the use of the k som in cwsi investigations as far as the authors are aware this approach will eliminate the need to obtain the baseline temperatures for calculation of the cwsi which otherwise would have been complex for this purpose field experiments were performed on indian mustard crop grown in humid sub tropical agro climate the study aims to evaluate the neural computing models to predict cwsi the objectives are to i estimate the empirical cwsi using well watered and non transpiring canopy temperatures ii develop and validate the k som and ff bp neural network models to predict the empirical cwsi using easily attainable data iii compare the relative performance of k som and ff bp models for predicting empirical cwsi in section 2 the description of the field experiments and database used are given additionally details of the ff bp and k som modelling and evaluation criterion are given this is then followed by results and discussion section 3 of the modelling of empirical cwsi using ff bp and k som neural networks finally the conclusions section 4 of the study are presented 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental details 2 1 1 description of the field data the study was carried out at the agricultural experimental station of the civil engineering department national institute of technology hamirpur india lat 31 42 40 long 76 31 33 alt 900 m asl the climate of the study area is humid sub tropical field crop experiments were performed on indian mustard brassica juncea from september to december during 2017 and 2018 treatment plots consisted of five rows with twelve plants per row 60 plants per plot table 1 presents the relevant crop details the soil in the experimental station and nearby agricultural fields was sandy loam sand 55 silt 24 and clay 21 up to 1 6 m depth the value of field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp obtained using pressure plate apparatus m s soil moisture equipment corp usa was 0 22 cm3 cm 3 and 0 07 cm3 cm 3 respectively the available soil water asw was estimated to be 0 15 cm3 cm 3 a multi meter weather monitoring and data logging system meter group inc pullman wa usa installed nearby the agricultural field was used for recording air temperature ta and relative humidity rh the climatic variables were recorded at an interval of 10 min 2 1 2 description of irrigation treatments randomized complete block design rcbd was used for designing the experimental layout irrigation was identical in each trial and provided for the application of eight irrigation treatment levels t1 t8 one for each of the plots of size 2 m 2 m to which the field was divided into with three replications the plots were separated from each other by embedding asbestos sheets 2 m deep into the ground to prevent the horizontal flow of soil water from one plot to another the soil moisture was monitored daily using a capacitance probe sentek sensor technologies sa australia which recorded the moisture every 0 1 m interval up to 1 6 m depth water was supplied in calculated amounts water meter installed at the inlet to respective plots with the help of water hose pipe a recording type rain gauge tipping bucket was used for measuring the rainfall the layout of the experimental plot is shown in fig 1 the irrigation treatments were based on the soil moisture depletion smd of the asw in the root zone of crops treatment t1 was supplied with frequent irrigations to maintain the moisture content near the fc whereas treatment t8 was provided with no supplemental irrigation except for pre sowing and one for the crop survival during the entire crop season treatments t1 and t8 were deliberately kept well watered and dry to allow the estimation of baseline temperatures the maximum level of smd allowed was 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 of asw in the treatments t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 and t7 respectively 2 1 3 canopy temperature and empirical cwsi a portable hand held infrared thermometer mi 2h0 irt apogee instruments inc north logan ut usa was used for measuring the canopy temperature tc the irt was accurate to 0 3 c with a response time less than 600 milliseconds operating within an atmospheric window of 8 14 μm the tc values were recorded between 1 pm and 2 pm under clear sky conditions the tc measurements began 20 days after sowing the crops when 70 of crop cover was achieved each observation of tc was recorded from four directions north east west and south to avoid radiation effects and averaged to determine the tc of the treatment the values of tc obtained from treatment t1 were considered as the values of lower baseline temperature tww the value of upper baseline temperature tdry adopted in the study is equal to ta 2 c which was based on tc measurements from treatment t8 under maximum water stressed conditions a similar value of tdry for indian mustard under the same agro climatic conditions was reported by kumar et al 2020 the cwsi was empirically computed using the baseline temperatures as given in eq 1 henceforth in this paper the empirical cwsi will be referred to as cwsi for all database modelling and evaluation purposes 2 2 database the data collected during 2017 and 2018 crop period was used for model development training or calibration and validation respectively the modelling dataset comprised of ta rh tc and cwsi this was purposely done to evaluate the models using limited data which is easily available the cwsi values corresponding to treatments t1 and t8 were not considered for modelling due to two reasons i their purpose was to estimate the baseline temperatures and ii to appreciate the predictive capability of the models for commonly encountered field moisture conditions table 2 summarises the datasets for model development and validation a total of 1260 observations of each variable were used for model development similarly for model validation a set of 1350 data points was considered 2 3 neural network modelling 2 3 1 feed forward back propagation the ff bp is the widely used ann algorithm in which several forward and backward passes are made through a network until the maximum number of epochs are reached or a specified target error is attained jain and kumar 2007 normally the network is trained using a pair of input output variables to estimate the synaptic weights bowden et al 2005 the network architecture along with the synaptic weights together constitutes the model and is stored when new inputs are presented to the model the model uses the training experience to predict the output a network architecture essentially consists of a layer of input neurons a layer of hidden neurons and a layer of output neuron neural network toolbox an inbuilt toolbox of matlab was used to develop and validate the ff bp model the data for model development was further partitioned randomly into training 70 882 validation while training 15 189 and testing 15 189 datasets the trial error method was used to select the best architecture which was based on error minimization and correlation maximization within the training dataset a feed forward architecture consisting of a hidden layer with five neurons and an output neuron was selected fig 2 shows the network architecture used in the present study the levenberg marquardt algorithm was applied for training the network the performance of the trained ff bp model was then validated with the dataset of 2018 comprising 1350 data points 2 3 2 kohonen self organizing map k som is a widely used ann tool which uses clustering to convert complex non linear relationship between a high dimensional input data into a simple relationship on a low dimensional output display kohonen et al 1996 the units neurons or nodes of the map compete internally based on unsupervised learning and become tuned to input signal patterns the clustering of the input data is performed in a way that enables the representation of similar patterns by the same output unit or by one of its neighbouring units stefanovic and kurasova 2011 the k som consists of a high dimensional input layer and a low dimensional output or competitive layer these layers are completely interconnected with each other as shown in fig 3 the size of the map is dependent on the number of data points used while training the detailed theoretical and mathematical description of initialization and training of the k som can be referred to in vesanto 2000 rustum 2009 and adeloye et al 2012 the training uses euclidian distance to identify the weight vector code vector most similar to the input vector the node for which the euclidian distance is minimum is chosen as the winning node or best matching unit bmu as shown in fig 3 the weight vectors of this bmu and its adjacent nodes are then updated to enhance the agreement with the input data the process is continued until a specific error criterion is achieved or the optimal number of iterations is reached this feature is referred to as self organizing since the clustering is achieved without any external information or output penn 2005 the learning effectiveness of the k som is affected by the learning rate and the neighbourhood function the quality of the trained k som is measured using topographic and quantization error as detailed in rustum 2009 the som toolbox version 2 1 for matlab was used in the present study vesanto et al 2000 vatanen et al 2015 the toolbox is freely available and can be downloaded from https github com ilarinieminen som toolbox the primary objective of the study was to develop a model for estimating the cwsi for this purpose ta rh tc and cwsi data was used in the modelling the statistical summary of the data set used for model development and validation is reported in table 2 the input data was first normalized to ensure that each of the input variables has equal significance on the construction of maps then the map was initialized by assigning random weight to each input vector once the map was initialized sequential training algorithm was used for training and updating the weight vectors in the map to minimize the potential bias of the autocorrelation in the predictive ability of the trained maps the input vectors of the training dataset were randomly selected at each time step and presented to the map the validation of the model was important to establish the ability of the k som to generalize the cwsi was omitted from the input vectors in the validation phase implying missing cwsi values the bmu for each input vector during validation was then determined to predict the missing cwsi values as illustrated in fig 4 once the cwsi values were extracted from the bmu s they were finally compared with their actual values to evaluate the performance of k som predictions 2 4 model evaluation the performance of the k som and ff bp models was evaluated using graphical comparisons and error statistics the significance of the regression line was evaluated using analysis of variance anova statistics the error statistics used in the study were absolute error bias error and coefficient of determination r 2 given by eqs 2 and 3 and 4 respectively 2 a b s o l u t e e r r o r x x 3 b i a s e r r o r x x 4 r 2 n x x x x n x 2 x 2 n x 2 x 2 2 where x is the actual value x is the model predicted value and n is the number of samples apart from these error statistics the relative skill of model predictions was evaluated using the taylor diagram taylor 2001 taylor diagram uses standard deviation centred root mean squared difference and pearson s correlation coefficient r to display the relative closeness of the model predictions with reference observations empirical cwsi in this case in this study skillmetrics toolbox for matlab https github com peterrochford skillmetricstoolbox wiki was used to plot the taylor diagram 3 results and discussion 3 1 ff bp modelling of cwsi the ff bp model was trained using different scenarios and the best performed model was the one with three input variables rh ta tc one hidden layer having five neurons and one output variable cwsi fig 2 the performance of the ff bp model was evaluated using x y scatter plots and error statistics table 3 provides a descriptive summary of the error statistics for ff bp model fig 5 shows the x y scatter plot of ff bp predicted cwsi hereinafter denoted as cwsiff bp and baseline computed empirical cwsi which shows a good correlation with r2 value of 0 86 during model development however during validation the correlation was relatively weak r 2 0 75 indicating a mere satisfactory performance of the ff bp model for cwsi predictions the slope of the regression line was not different p 0 05 from 1 1 line during model development however the slope was significantly different p 0 05 during model validation indicating a possible bias in ff bp predictions the mean values of bias error given in table 3 also confirm that a negative bias is present in cwsiff bp values particularly during validation this overestimation could be either due to the pseudorandom nature of training dataset or due to presence of positive skewness in the distribution of the target variable i e cwsi the scatter plots also indicate that the ff bp model predictions were poor for low cwsi values as can be seen from high scatter near the origin when closely observed the overestimation in model predictions was maximum for near zero cwsi values this suggests that the ff bp model could not learn efficiently to predict near zero cwsi values from the given training dataset 3 2 k som modelling of cwsi initially the k som model was trained using the default values of neighbourhood radius σ0 max l 1 l 2 4 and learning rate α0 0 5 in the som toolbox where l 1 and l 2 are the map dimensions the final map units m are adjusted in such a way that it is exactly equal to the product of l 1 and l 2 the k som model has a map size of 180 units the characteristics of the trained k som are given in table 4 the small values of quantization and topographic error indicate that the prediction ability of the developed model is good a significant characteristic of the k som is its ability to visualize the correlation between the variables through the component planes fig 6 shows the component planes of each variable in the k som each component plane is a sliced version of the k som containing a single vector variable and representing their values in each map unit stefanovic and kurasova 2011 each plane is comprised of 180 numbers of hexagonal nodes whose values are indicated by the colour coding adjacent to the respective component the high values are given by brown red colour medium values by yellow green colour and low values by blue colour in this way the component planes help to visually indicate the regions in which a variable is low high or medium this enables visual identification of the relationship between k som predicted cwsi and other variables considered in the modelling analysis visual observation of the component planes indicates that the correlation between the variables is quite complex and needs meticulous analysis for sound interpretation the colour gradient of ta component plane is negatively correlated with the tc component plane in the lower half portion however the correlation is positive in the upper half the rh component plane presents a negative correlation with ta and tc component planes with high values top left of rh correlated with low values top left of ta and tc although the colour gradient is nearly similar between rh and ta for the most part of the map while looking at the component plane of cwsi multiple observations can be made regarding its correlation with other variables for instance a closer observation of the bottom left part indicates that high cwsi can be correlated with two scenarios i high values of ta and tc and medium values of rh and ii medium values of ta and tc and low values of rh similarly in the top left low cwsi is correlated with low ta low tc and high rh values other observations regarding the component planes can be made in this way although a general description can t be given part wise analysis of the component planes enables a good visualization of the correlation between variables the performance of the k som model is assessed through error statistics and x y scatter plots table 5 summarises the error statistics of k som model during both development 2017 and validation 2018 phases the results indicate an excellent performance of the k som model in predicting the cwsi for indian mustard a remarkable achievement is that the k som used only three variables ta tc and rh and was still able to give exemplary results the correlation between baseline computed cwsi and k som predicted cwsi hereafter referred to as cwsik som was high with r2 values during model development and validation equal to 0 97 and 0 96 respectively fig 7 shows the x y scatter plots of the linear regression between empirical cwsi and cwsik som which demonstrate a uniform scatter around the 1 1 line the slope of regression lines was not different p 0 05 from 1 1 line during both model development and validation which indicates no bias in the model predictions this is further verified by the extremely low values of bias error given in table 5 3 3 comparison of ff bp and k som models the relative performance of the ff bp and k som models was evaluated using time series plots of cwsi values figs 8 and 9 show the time series plot of empirical cwsi cwsik som and cwsiff bp for indian mustard in each treatment plot during model development and validation respectively anova statistics indicated that there was no difference p 0 in cwsi between the replications hence the time series plots are shown for a single replication of each treatment anova results for cwsi indicated a significant difference p 0 05 between the treatments t2 t7 this is not surprising since irrigation in each treatment was supplied at a certain level of smd and the resulting cwsi was likely to be different in each treatment the cwsi reached a certain maximum value and then falls due to a wetting event irrigation or rainfall this can be related to the inverse of soil moisture dynamics in the field figs 8 and 9 show that the empirical cwsi presented a better agreement with cwsik som as compared to cwsiff bp during both model development and validation this indicates a better performance of k som than ff bp for predicting cwsi which is further substantiated by the comparison of error statistics given in tables 3 and 5 this can be attributed to the unsupervised competitive learning process of ksom due to which the model predictions were not constrained by the existence of a correct optimal solution further in contrast to the ff bp the ksom has the power to recognize input patterns even when the input data is noisy corrupted or has significant variation in addition both methods are data driven techniques and hence their performance depends on the data used for training verification and testing the cwsik som closely followed the empirical cwsi in each treatment however in treatments t6 and t7 it was observed that cwsik som was unable to go beyond a value of 0 6 a similar observation is evident in fig 7 an investigation on the codebook vectors of k som revealed that the model could not predict cwsi higher than 0 6 probably due to a smaller number of training data points of cwsi above 0 6 as all these are clustered to one code vector and hence averaged to a value close to 0 6 to overcome this issue more data with high cwsi value are required to improve model training and these data unfortunately have not been recorded during the experiment the performance of ff bp in treatments t2 and t3 was poor particularly during validation indicating poor prediction ability of the model for lower cwsi values this was also observed in the x y scatter plot fig 5 where the data points at low values of cwsi near the origin were highly scattered indicating large prediction errors in other treatments the model predictions were relatively better however in general the cwsiff bp overestimated the empirical cwsi values in each treatment plot for e g in treatment t7 the cwsiff bp reached as high as 0 92 in comparison to the empirical cwsi value of 0 72 the prediction by data driven models depends on what they learn during training thus performance will improve with the amount of information presented in a given range of input data the training data set for the models had more values in the middle range 0 3 0 6 which is why the models seemed to perform better in this range if more data in the upper 0 6 and lower 0 3 range were available and the model could learn from them the performance in that range would improve as well the current results are encouraging however since the middle cwsi range is commonly observed in irrigation scheduling practice and for which irrigators require guidance the relative skill of model predictions is visualized through taylor plots fig 10 shows the taylor diagrams summarizing the statistical comparison of cwsik som and cwsiff bp with empirical cwsi during development and validation visual observation of the plots leads to a few immediate conclusions the distance between reference empirical cwsi and cwsik som was small indicating the good performance of the k som model also the performance of k som was better than ff bp during both phases during validation the performance of ff bp was relatively poor as indicated by the large distance from the reference cwsi overall the k som predictions were better and provide a reliable alternative to other complex algorithms requiring extensive data and computations a critical observation can be made regarding the value of maximum cwsi in each treatment since it is the criterion used for irrigation scheduling through the cwsi approach further analysis of these results and comparison thereof with the moisture depletion yield output and water use efficiency will provide an insight into the scheduling criterion using a simple k som based approach for predicting cwsi 4 conclusion the study presents a completely novel methodology considering the application of kohonen self organizing map k som and feed forward back propagation ff bp neural network models to predict the crop water stress index cwsi the modelling used canopy temperature tc of indian mustard along with the air temperature and relative humidity data during the crop period the empirical cwsi was computed using the well watered and non transpiring baseline canopy temperatures the cwsi predicted using k som cwsik som and ff bp cwsiff bp was compared with the empirical cwsi for evaluating the models the comparison was based on the use of error statistics x y scatter plots and taylor plots the cwsik som values presented a strong agreement with empirical cwsi values during model development and validation indicating the good performance of the model the cwsiff bp showed good agreement with the empirical cwsi during model development however during validation the performance of the model was merely satisfactory overall the k som performed much better than ff bp for cwsi prediction the cwsi predicted using neural network models particularly the k som model in this study provides an alternative to other complex algorithms a major advantage of using this approach is that it eliminates the need to obtain the baseline temperatures for computing the cwsi additional research should focus on the application of these models to predict the cwsi for different crops across different agro climatic conditions

10554,in this study two artificial neural network models viz supervised feed forward back propagation ff bp and unsupervised kohonen self organizing map k som have been developed to predict the crop water stress index cwsi using air temperature relative humidity and canopy temperature field experiments were conducted on indian mustard to observe the crop canopy temperature under different levels of irrigation treatment during the 2017 and 2018 cropping seasons the empirical cwsi was computed using well watered and non transpiring baseline canopy temperatures the k som and ff bp cwsi predictions were compared with the empirical cwsi estimates and both performed satisfactorily of the two however the k som was better with r2 coefficient of determination of 0 97 and 0 96 for model development and validation respectively corresponding values for ff bp were 0 86 and 0 75 the results of the study suggest that neural network modelling offers significant potential for reliable prediction of the cwsi which can be utilized in irrigation scheduling and crop stress management keywords artificial neural networks self organizing map taylor diagram crop water stress index indian mustard 1 introduction irrigated agriculture is essential to global food production accounting for nearly 70 of the total freshwater withdrawal shankar et al 2017 however freshwater resources are limited and severely stressed due to climatic change hence effective utilization of existing water resources is essential through improved irrigation efficiency without compromising with the yield production of crops the application of optimized irrigation schedules on field crops results in improved water use efficiency but requires an improved understanding of physical interactions between the soil plant air and precise estimation of the crop water requirements berbel et al 2018 conventional methods for irrigation scheduling are based on soil moisture measurements and evapotranspiration estimates zhang and pierce 2016 poddar et al 2018 the former approach is destructive and might require soil water balance computations whereas the latter involves intensive climatic data collection most of which are either unavailable or unfeasible in actual field conditions osroosh et al 2016 infrared thermometry based canopy temperature is a non destructive reliable and recognized indicator of plant water status fuchs 1990 gonzález dugo et al 2014 kumar et al 2019 several indices based on canopy temperature have been developed of which the most widely used index is the crop water stress index cwsi ihuoma and madramootoo 2017 cwsi has been used for stress detection irrigation scheduling and yield prediction purposes in many crops under different agro climatic conditions yuan et al 2004 emekli et al 2007 gontia and tiwari 2008 gonzález dugo et al 2014 bellvert et al 2016 kumar et al 2020 anda et al 2020 the principle underlying cwsi is the relative transpirational cooling of the leaf surface gerhards et al 2019 when adequate soil moisture is available for the plants the transpiration takes place at the potential rate cooling the leaf surface relative to the ambient air temperature but as the moisture depletes the transpiration is lowered causing a reduction in the relative cooling of the leaf surface the limits of cwsi are 0 and 1 where 0 indicates the non water stressed or well watered condition and 1 represents the maximum water stressed or non transpiring condition cwsi can be computed using either the theoretical approach or the empirical approach the theoretical approach is based on the energy balance model and was proposed by jackson et al 1981 this approach provides precise estimates of the cwsi but its computation requires large model input parameters particularly aero dynamic resistance and net radiation values field estimation of which is complex and infeasible alghory and yazar 2019 the empirical approach idso et al 1981 on the other hand is relatively simple to use and provides reliable estimates of cwsi it considers two baseline temperatures viz well watered and non transpiring canopy temperatures the cwsi is empirically computed using the relation given in eq 1 1 c w s i t c t a t w w t a t d r y t a t w w t a where tc actual canopy temperature 0c ta air temperature 0c tww is the canopy temperature of a plant transpiring at full potential when the soil moisture is adequate and tdry is the canopy temperature of a non transpiring plant due to stomatal closure when the soil becomes dry the reliability of the empirically computed cwsi depends on the precise estimation of the baseline temperatures tww and tdry however their estimation is difficult as both involve field soil moisture that is either undesirable tdry that requires the crop to wither or unattainable tww that requires a perpetually saturated soil in practical conditions méndez barroso et al 2008 pramanik et al 2017 the traditional approach for obtaining the tww and tdry is based on regression between vapour pressure deficit and canopy air temperature differential the use of artificial reference surfaces pou et al 2014 and physical models jones 1999 has been suggested for estimating the baseline temperatures but their application in the field is limited due to extensive maintenance of reference surfaces and complex parameter requirements of the physical models park 2018 hence parsimonious models that can predict the cwsi with reasonable accuracy without the need of the baseline temperatures will enhance the utilization of cwsi as a tool for monitoring crop stress and scheduling irrigation dold et al 2019 data driven artificial intelligence modelling techniques such as artificial neural networks ann have been successfully used in modelling non linear complex relationships for predicting physical variables or conditions the beauty of these modelling techniques is that they do not explicitly require the mathematical form of the model and still can give good results even with minimum data generally the supervised feed forward back propagation ff bp modelling approach is favoured and has been widely used in various water resources applications including rainfall runoff modelling evapotranspiration reservoir operations streamflow prediction and many more asce task committee on application of artificial neural networks in hydrology 2000 adeloye et al 2012 however a problem with ff bp is that its prediction ability is affected by the outliers or missing values in fact ff bp has been found to give unrealistic predictions where such noise is present in the input data rustum 2009 the unsupervised kohonen self organizing maps k som on the other hand have no specific input or output variables since all the variables in the input vector are also contained in each unit of the output layer kohonen et al 1996 this way the k som is able to handle missing data and can extract useful information even when the data is noisy the k som has been successfully used in evapotranspiration modelling adeloye et al 2011 rainfall runoff modelling adeloye and rustum 2012 streamflow forecasting mwale et al 2012 global water flows assessment clark et al 2015 soil moisture riese and keller 2018 groundwater studies chen et al 2018 wastewater treatment ramachandran et al 2019 and irrigation management ohana levi et al 2019 although the application of ann modelling to predict the well watered canopy temperature has been reported king and shellie 2016 to the best of our knowledge ann has never been utilized for direct prediction of cwsi and there has not been a reported study on the use of the k som in cwsi investigations as far as the authors are aware this approach will eliminate the need to obtain the baseline temperatures for calculation of the cwsi which otherwise would have been complex for this purpose field experiments were performed on indian mustard crop grown in humid sub tropical agro climate the study aims to evaluate the neural computing models to predict cwsi the objectives are to i estimate the empirical cwsi using well watered and non transpiring canopy temperatures ii develop and validate the k som and ff bp neural network models to predict the empirical cwsi using easily attainable data iii compare the relative performance of k som and ff bp models for predicting empirical cwsi in section 2 the description of the field experiments and database used are given additionally details of the ff bp and k som modelling and evaluation criterion are given this is then followed by results and discussion section 3 of the modelling of empirical cwsi using ff bp and k som neural networks finally the conclusions section 4 of the study are presented 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental details 2 1 1 description of the field data the study was carried out at the agricultural experimental station of the civil engineering department national institute of technology hamirpur india lat 31 42 40 long 76 31 33 alt 900 m asl the climate of the study area is humid sub tropical field crop experiments were performed on indian mustard brassica juncea from september to december during 2017 and 2018 treatment plots consisted of five rows with twelve plants per row 60 plants per plot table 1 presents the relevant crop details the soil in the experimental station and nearby agricultural fields was sandy loam sand 55 silt 24 and clay 21 up to 1 6 m depth the value of field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp obtained using pressure plate apparatus m s soil moisture equipment corp usa was 0 22 cm3 cm 3 and 0 07 cm3 cm 3 respectively the available soil water asw was estimated to be 0 15 cm3 cm 3 a multi meter weather monitoring and data logging system meter group inc pullman wa usa installed nearby the agricultural field was used for recording air temperature ta and relative humidity rh the climatic variables were recorded at an interval of 10 min 2 1 2 description of irrigation treatments randomized complete block design rcbd was used for designing the experimental layout irrigation was identical in each trial and provided for the application of eight irrigation treatment levels t1 t8 one for each of the plots of size 2 m 2 m to which the field was divided into with three replications the plots were separated from each other by embedding asbestos sheets 2 m deep into the ground to prevent the horizontal flow of soil water from one plot to another the soil moisture was monitored daily using a capacitance probe sentek sensor technologies sa australia which recorded the moisture every 0 1 m interval up to 1 6 m depth water was supplied in calculated amounts water meter installed at the inlet to respective plots with the help of water hose pipe a recording type rain gauge tipping bucket was used for measuring the rainfall the layout of the experimental plot is shown in fig 1 the irrigation treatments were based on the soil moisture depletion smd of the asw in the root zone of crops treatment t1 was supplied with frequent irrigations to maintain the moisture content near the fc whereas treatment t8 was provided with no supplemental irrigation except for pre sowing and one for the crop survival during the entire crop season treatments t1 and t8 were deliberately kept well watered and dry to allow the estimation of baseline temperatures the maximum level of smd allowed was 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 of asw in the treatments t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 and t7 respectively 2 1 3 canopy temperature and empirical cwsi a portable hand held infrared thermometer mi 2h0 irt apogee instruments inc north logan ut usa was used for measuring the canopy temperature tc the irt was accurate to 0 3 c with a response time less than 600 milliseconds operating within an atmospheric window of 8 14 μm the tc values were recorded between 1 pm and 2 pm under clear sky conditions the tc measurements began 20 days after sowing the crops when 70 of crop cover was achieved each observation of tc was recorded from four directions north east west and south to avoid radiation effects and averaged to determine the tc of the treatment the values of tc obtained from treatment t1 were considered as the values of lower baseline temperature tww the value of upper baseline temperature tdry adopted in the study is equal to ta 2 c which was based on tc measurements from treatment t8 under maximum water stressed conditions a similar value of tdry for indian mustard under the same agro climatic conditions was reported by kumar et al 2020 the cwsi was empirically computed using the baseline temperatures as given in eq 1 henceforth in this paper the empirical cwsi will be referred to as cwsi for all database modelling and evaluation purposes 2 2 database the data collected during 2017 and 2018 crop period was used for model development training or calibration and validation respectively the modelling dataset comprised of ta rh tc and cwsi this was purposely done to evaluate the models using limited data which is easily available the cwsi values corresponding to treatments t1 and t8 were not considered for modelling due to two reasons i their purpose was to estimate the baseline temperatures and ii to appreciate the predictive capability of the models for commonly encountered field moisture conditions table 2 summarises the datasets for model development and validation a total of 1260 observations of each variable were used for model development similarly for model validation a set of 1350 data points was considered 2 3 neural network modelling 2 3 1 feed forward back propagation the ff bp is the widely used ann algorithm in which several forward and backward passes are made through a network until the maximum number of epochs are reached or a specified target error is attained jain and kumar 2007 normally the network is trained using a pair of input output variables to estimate the synaptic weights bowden et al 2005 the network architecture along with the synaptic weights together constitutes the model and is stored when new inputs are presented to the model the model uses the training experience to predict the output a network architecture essentially consists of a layer of input neurons a layer of hidden neurons and a layer of output neuron neural network toolbox an inbuilt toolbox of matlab was used to develop and validate the ff bp model the data for model development was further partitioned randomly into training 70 882 validation while training 15 189 and testing 15 189 datasets the trial error method was used to select the best architecture which was based on error minimization and correlation maximization within the training dataset a feed forward architecture consisting of a hidden layer with five neurons and an output neuron was selected fig 2 shows the network architecture used in the present study the levenberg marquardt algorithm was applied for training the network the performance of the trained ff bp model was then validated with the dataset of 2018 comprising 1350 data points 2 3 2 kohonen self organizing map k som is a widely used ann tool which uses clustering to convert complex non linear relationship between a high dimensional input data into a simple relationship on a low dimensional output display kohonen et al 1996 the units neurons or nodes of the map compete internally based on unsupervised learning and become tuned to input signal patterns the clustering of the input data is performed in a way that enables the representation of similar patterns by the same output unit or by one of its neighbouring units stefanovic and kurasova 2011 the k som consists of a high dimensional input layer and a low dimensional output or competitive layer these layers are completely interconnected with each other as shown in fig 3 the size of the map is dependent on the number of data points used while training the detailed theoretical and mathematical description of initialization and training of the k som can be referred to in vesanto 2000 rustum 2009 and adeloye et al 2012 the training uses euclidian distance to identify the weight vector code vector most similar to the input vector the node for which the euclidian distance is minimum is chosen as the winning node or best matching unit bmu as shown in fig 3 the weight vectors of this bmu and its adjacent nodes are then updated to enhance the agreement with the input data the process is continued until a specific error criterion is achieved or the optimal number of iterations is reached this feature is referred to as self organizing since the clustering is achieved without any external information or output penn 2005 the learning effectiveness of the k som is affected by the learning rate and the neighbourhood function the quality of the trained k som is measured using topographic and quantization error as detailed in rustum 2009 the som toolbox version 2 1 for matlab was used in the present study vesanto et al 2000 vatanen et al 2015 the toolbox is freely available and can be downloaded from https github com ilarinieminen som toolbox the primary objective of the study was to develop a model for estimating the cwsi for this purpose ta rh tc and cwsi data was used in the modelling the statistical summary of the data set used for model development and validation is reported in table 2 the input data was first normalized to ensure that each of the input variables has equal significance on the construction of maps then the map was initialized by assigning random weight to each input vector once the map was initialized sequential training algorithm was used for training and updating the weight vectors in the map to minimize the potential bias of the autocorrelation in the predictive ability of the trained maps the input vectors of the training dataset were randomly selected at each time step and presented to the map the validation of the model was important to establish the ability of the k som to generalize the cwsi was omitted from the input vectors in the validation phase implying missing cwsi values the bmu for each input vector during validation was then determined to predict the missing cwsi values as illustrated in fig 4 once the cwsi values were extracted from the bmu s they were finally compared with their actual values to evaluate the performance of k som predictions 2 4 model evaluation the performance of the k som and ff bp models was evaluated using graphical comparisons and error statistics the significance of the regression line was evaluated using analysis of variance anova statistics the error statistics used in the study were absolute error bias error and coefficient of determination r 2 given by eqs 2 and 3 and 4 respectively 2 a b s o l u t e e r r o r x x 3 b i a s e r r o r x x 4 r 2 n x x x x n x 2 x 2 n x 2 x 2 2 where x is the actual value x is the model predicted value and n is the number of samples apart from these error statistics the relative skill of model predictions was evaluated using the taylor diagram taylor 2001 taylor diagram uses standard deviation centred root mean squared difference and pearson s correlation coefficient r to display the relative closeness of the model predictions with reference observations empirical cwsi in this case in this study skillmetrics toolbox for matlab https github com peterrochford skillmetricstoolbox wiki was used to plot the taylor diagram 3 results and discussion 3 1 ff bp modelling of cwsi the ff bp model was trained using different scenarios and the best performed model was the one with three input variables rh ta tc one hidden layer having five neurons and one output variable cwsi fig 2 the performance of the ff bp model was evaluated using x y scatter plots and error statistics table 3 provides a descriptive summary of the error statistics for ff bp model fig 5 shows the x y scatter plot of ff bp predicted cwsi hereinafter denoted as cwsiff bp and baseline computed empirical cwsi which shows a good correlation with r2 value of 0 86 during model development however during validation the correlation was relatively weak r 2 0 75 indicating a mere satisfactory performance of the ff bp model for cwsi predictions the slope of the regression line was not different p 0 05 from 1 1 line during model development however the slope was significantly different p 0 05 during model validation indicating a possible bias in ff bp predictions the mean values of bias error given in table 3 also confirm that a negative bias is present in cwsiff bp values particularly during validation this overestimation could be either due to the pseudorandom nature of training dataset or due to presence of positive skewness in the distribution of the target variable i e cwsi the scatter plots also indicate that the ff bp model predictions were poor for low cwsi values as can be seen from high scatter near the origin when closely observed the overestimation in model predictions was maximum for near zero cwsi values this suggests that the ff bp model could not learn efficiently to predict near zero cwsi values from the given training dataset 3 2 k som modelling of cwsi initially the k som model was trained using the default values of neighbourhood radius σ0 max l 1 l 2 4 and learning rate α0 0 5 in the som toolbox where l 1 and l 2 are the map dimensions the final map units m are adjusted in such a way that it is exactly equal to the product of l 1 and l 2 the k som model has a map size of 180 units the characteristics of the trained k som are given in table 4 the small values of quantization and topographic error indicate that the prediction ability of the developed model is good a significant characteristic of the k som is its ability to visualize the correlation between the variables through the component planes fig 6 shows the component planes of each variable in the k som each component plane is a sliced version of the k som containing a single vector variable and representing their values in each map unit stefanovic and kurasova 2011 each plane is comprised of 180 numbers of hexagonal nodes whose values are indicated by the colour coding adjacent to the respective component the high values are given by brown red colour medium values by yellow green colour and low values by blue colour in this way the component planes help to visually indicate the regions in which a variable is low high or medium this enables visual identification of the relationship between k som predicted cwsi and other variables considered in the modelling analysis visual observation of the component planes indicates that the correlation between the variables is quite complex and needs meticulous analysis for sound interpretation the colour gradient of ta component plane is negatively correlated with the tc component plane in the lower half portion however the correlation is positive in the upper half the rh component plane presents a negative correlation with ta and tc component planes with high values top left of rh correlated with low values top left of ta and tc although the colour gradient is nearly similar between rh and ta for the most part of the map while looking at the component plane of cwsi multiple observations can be made regarding its correlation with other variables for instance a closer observation of the bottom left part indicates that high cwsi can be correlated with two scenarios i high values of ta and tc and medium values of rh and ii medium values of ta and tc and low values of rh similarly in the top left low cwsi is correlated with low ta low tc and high rh values other observations regarding the component planes can be made in this way although a general description can t be given part wise analysis of the component planes enables a good visualization of the correlation between variables the performance of the k som model is assessed through error statistics and x y scatter plots table 5 summarises the error statistics of k som model during both development 2017 and validation 2018 phases the results indicate an excellent performance of the k som model in predicting the cwsi for indian mustard a remarkable achievement is that the k som used only three variables ta tc and rh and was still able to give exemplary results the correlation between baseline computed cwsi and k som predicted cwsi hereafter referred to as cwsik som was high with r2 values during model development and validation equal to 0 97 and 0 96 respectively fig 7 shows the x y scatter plots of the linear regression between empirical cwsi and cwsik som which demonstrate a uniform scatter around the 1 1 line the slope of regression lines was not different p 0 05 from 1 1 line during both model development and validation which indicates no bias in the model predictions this is further verified by the extremely low values of bias error given in table 5 3 3 comparison of ff bp and k som models the relative performance of the ff bp and k som models was evaluated using time series plots of cwsi values figs 8 and 9 show the time series plot of empirical cwsi cwsik som and cwsiff bp for indian mustard in each treatment plot during model development and validation respectively anova statistics indicated that there was no difference p 0 in cwsi between the replications hence the time series plots are shown for a single replication of each treatment anova results for cwsi indicated a significant difference p 0 05 between the treatments t2 t7 this is not surprising since irrigation in each treatment was supplied at a certain level of smd and the resulting cwsi was likely to be different in each treatment the cwsi reached a certain maximum value and then falls due to a wetting event irrigation or rainfall this can be related to the inverse of soil moisture dynamics in the field figs 8 and 9 show that the empirical cwsi presented a better agreement with cwsik som as compared to cwsiff bp during both model development and validation this indicates a better performance of k som than ff bp for predicting cwsi which is further substantiated by the comparison of error statistics given in tables 3 and 5 this can be attributed to the unsupervised competitive learning process of ksom due to which the model predictions were not constrained by the existence of a correct optimal solution further in contrast to the ff bp the ksom has the power to recognize input patterns even when the input data is noisy corrupted or has significant variation in addition both methods are data driven techniques and hence their performance depends on the data used for training verification and testing the cwsik som closely followed the empirical cwsi in each treatment however in treatments t6 and t7 it was observed that cwsik som was unable to go beyond a value of 0 6 a similar observation is evident in fig 7 an investigation on the codebook vectors of k som revealed that the model could not predict cwsi higher than 0 6 probably due to a smaller number of training data points of cwsi above 0 6 as all these are clustered to one code vector and hence averaged to a value close to 0 6 to overcome this issue more data with high cwsi value are required to improve model training and these data unfortunately have not been recorded during the experiment the performance of ff bp in treatments t2 and t3 was poor particularly during validation indicating poor prediction ability of the model for lower cwsi values this was also observed in the x y scatter plot fig 5 where the data points at low values of cwsi near the origin were highly scattered indicating large prediction errors in other treatments the model predictions were relatively better however in general the cwsiff bp overestimated the empirical cwsi values in each treatment plot for e g in treatment t7 the cwsiff bp reached as high as 0 92 in comparison to the empirical cwsi value of 0 72 the prediction by data driven models depends on what they learn during training thus performance will improve with the amount of information presented in a given range of input data the training data set for the models had more values in the middle range 0 3 0 6 which is why the models seemed to perform better in this range if more data in the upper 0 6 and lower 0 3 range were available and the model could learn from them the performance in that range would improve as well the current results are encouraging however since the middle cwsi range is commonly observed in irrigation scheduling practice and for which irrigators require guidance the relative skill of model predictions is visualized through taylor plots fig 10 shows the taylor diagrams summarizing the statistical comparison of cwsik som and cwsiff bp with empirical cwsi during development and validation visual observation of the plots leads to a few immediate conclusions the distance between reference empirical cwsi and cwsik som was small indicating the good performance of the k som model also the performance of k som was better than ff bp during both phases during validation the performance of ff bp was relatively poor as indicated by the large distance from the reference cwsi overall the k som predictions were better and provide a reliable alternative to other complex algorithms requiring extensive data and computations a critical observation can be made regarding the value of maximum cwsi in each treatment since it is the criterion used for irrigation scheduling through the cwsi approach further analysis of these results and comparison thereof with the moisture depletion yield output and water use efficiency will provide an insight into the scheduling criterion using a simple k som based approach for predicting cwsi 4 conclusion the study presents a completely novel methodology considering the application of kohonen self organizing map k som and feed forward back propagation ff bp neural network models to predict the crop water stress index cwsi the modelling used canopy temperature tc of indian mustard along with the air temperature and relative humidity data during the crop period the empirical cwsi was computed using the well watered and non transpiring baseline canopy temperatures the cwsi predicted using k som cwsik som and ff bp cwsiff bp was compared with the empirical cwsi for evaluating the models the comparison was based on the use of error statistics x y scatter plots and taylor plots the cwsik som values presented a strong agreement with empirical cwsi values during model development and validation indicating the good performance of the model the cwsiff bp showed good agreement with the empirical cwsi during model development however during validation the performance of the model was merely satisfactory overall the k som performed much better than ff bp for cwsi prediction the cwsi predicted using neural network models particularly the k som model in this study provides an alternative to other complex algorithms a major advantage of using this approach is that it eliminates the need to obtain the baseline temperatures for computing the cwsi additional research should focus on the application of these models to predict the cwsi for different crops across different agro climatic conditions
