5445,the generation of subsurface saturation is highly related to shallow landslide initiation although many studies have relied on experiments to report the generation processes of subsurface saturation that triggers shallow artificial landslides studies based on detailed in situ monitoring data sets or pre and post slide data sets for a natural landslide are still rare this study recorded the dynamics of pore water pressure at the soil bedrock interface with high spatiotemporal resolution concurrently with the occurrence of a shallow landslide in a steep natural forested headwater catchment using event based analyses we explored patterns in the generation of subsurface saturation and other main hydrological factors triggering the landslide the landslide was not induced by the event with the greatest rainfall amount but by a smaller event with intermittent rainfall over a long duration of 9 days and intense rainfall from the seventh day the landslide occurred as a result of record high subsurface saturation generation with a spatial mean pore water pressure of 17 5 cmh2o and a saturation ratio of 0 89 at the site it was attributed to the landslide event that began during wet conditions with a mean pore water pressure of 7 2 cmh2o although the rainfall contributed a near uniform increase in pore water pressure at all measurement points high pore water pressure was recorded within the landslide area in the downslope area of the site where subsurface saturation existed perennially heterogeneous distribution of subsurface saturation including perennial and ephemeral saturation was likely related to the extent of the landslide area in addition the two biggest events in the observation period caused subsurface displacements in the year before the landslide the subsurface displacements weakened the geological structure and enlarged the amount of perennial saturation which all reduced slope stability and facilitated the landslide at least two origins of subsurface saturation should be a general feature for a headwater catchment e g vertically downward infiltrated water and an upward rise in groundwater and the different generation processes of subsurface saturation should be considered separately in future stability analysis models or disaster warning systems for shallow landslides keywords headwaters landslide soil bedrock interface subsurface displacement subsurface saturation 1 introduction rainfall initiated landslides are common hazards in hillslope environments from 2004 to 2016 rainfall induced landslides killed 55 997 people in 4862 distinct landslide events in the world with asia being the geographical area most affected froude and petley 2018 landslides are typically related to hydrological geomorphic pedological geological and biological factors sidle and bogaard 2016 of these hydrological controls are primary factors in rainfall induced landslides bogaard and greco 2016 coined the term landslide hydrology to describe the interdisciplinary study of water transfer storage and pressure buildup linked to hydrologically triggered destabilization and displacement of a slope understanding the processes and mechanisms of landslides is a critical step in reducing damage from landslides and establishing disaster warning systems the relationships between landslide occurrence and hydrological responses have been elucidated by experiments of artificial water supplies on artificial flumes or natural slopes harp et al 1990 iverson et al 2000 okura et al 2002 ochiai et al 2004 kim et al 2018 using experiments of artificial rainfall on a flume okura et al 2002 reported that landslide fluidization caused by undrained sudden loading undergoes three stages compaction of the sand layer by the sliding mass from the upper slope generation of excess pore water pressure in the saturated zone and induction of fast shearing kim et al 2018 compared effects of artificial rainfall versus seepage through water being forcibly injected into the sloping bed of a flume they found that the seepage caused greater instability than the rainfall ochiai et al 2004 conducted an experiment in which a landslide was induced by artificial rainfall with an intensity of 78 mm h on a natural slope without vegetation cover they observed that initially negative pore water pressure at six soil depths of 20 to 290 cm increased from upper to lower layers with an increase in water supply and all of the pore water pressure was positive when the failure occurred the results of these experiments suggest that the generation of positive pore water pressure from water supplied from vertical infiltration or lateral seepage has crucial implications for landslide occurrences however these kinds of experiments take place under controlled conditions that cannot include variation in rainfall vegetation or topography and therefore they do not address the features or mechanisms of landslides that occur on natural forested hillslopes few researchers have successfully collected observations of soil water dynamics or underground hydrological responses during shallow landslide occurrences anderson and kneale 1980 measured pore water pressure using 22 tensiometers installed within soil layers at depths of 25 100 cm in a clay embankment and recorded high positive pore water pressure at the foot of the embankment when a shallow landslide occurred after continuous low intensity precipitation sidle and swanston 1982 monitored the maximum rise in the water table with a piezometer during a moderately intense storm that triggered a small debris slide on a forested mid slope they reported that the debris slide was likely initiated by a perched water table generating at a hydrologic discontinuity of bedrock surface with a pore water pressure of 22 cmh2o calculated by an infinite slope model they suggested that the cause of the debris slide was related more to the distribution of rainfall and the maximum short term intensity than to the total precipitation from the storm godt et al 2009 observed a shallow landslide on a coastal bluff which occurred under partially saturated conditions the failure surface was at the contact between the loose sandy colluvium and the better consolidated glacial outwash sand montgomery et al 2009 monitored piezometric responses in colluvium and bedrock during heavy rainfall in november 1996 that triggered a slope failure at the middle of a hillslope hollow and then mobilized as a debris flow at an intensively instrumented catchment coos bay 1 they reported that the failure was initiated by local upward flow from bedrock developed into overlying colluvium with high spatial variability bittelli et al 2012 conducted integrated field monitoring of soil water and subsurface displacements and observed a soil failure during the observation period they detected the failure plane at a depth of 1 4 m the location of an interface between a superficial layer with higher permeability and a compacted substrate with lower permeability in recent reports that recorded underground data for slow moving or episodically recurring landslides uhlemann et al 2017 monitored subsurface moisture dynamics of slow moving landslides for 3 years using 3d and time lapse electrical resistivity imaging in the months preceding the reactivation of landslides subsurface moisture increased by more than 45 throughout the slope resulting in slow movement at the toe of the slope and rotational failures at the upslope mirus et al 2017 compared soil properties and hydrological responses of a vegetated hillslope and a landslide hillslope where sliding episodically recurred and reported that the landslide hillslope featured lower matrix porosity and hydraulic conductivity an earlier seasonal transition to near saturated conditions longer persistence of positive pore water pressure and slower drainage although the field cases described above reported several types of shallow landslides they suggest that the processes of drainage or saturation generation as well as rainfall characteristics have crucial implications for landslide occurrences in particular the landslides were initiated by a perched water table at a discontinuous interface e g the soil bedrock interface due to sharp changes and clear differences in hydraulic properties between different layers weiler et al 2006 katsura et al 2009 katsura et al 2014 thus the spatial patterns of subsurface saturation are the key factor linking the location and timing of landslide occurrences the development pattern of subsurface saturation from the downslope to the upslope in the side slopes or headwaters was previously acknowledged hewlett and hibbert 1967 proposed the variable source area concept in which subsurface saturation develops from riparian areas near stream channels where the water table rises to intersect with the soil surface according to this concept subsurface saturation expands in a vertically upward or upslope direction along the soil bedrock interface with an increase in rainwater input and a saturated wedge forms at the downslope atkinson 1978 although this kind of process was also reported in previous field studies anderson and burt 1978 tsukamoto and ohta 1988 the concept was more arguable in recent studies that observed the expansion patterns of subsurface saturation from the upslope to the downslope anderson et al 1997 montgomery et al 1997 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 the inconsistency in previous studies can be attributed to the origins of subsurface saturation with different generation mechanisms such as percolated rainwater and groundwater anderson and burt 1977 katsuyama et al 2005 uchida et al 2006 masaoka et al 2016 the various generation patterns of subsurface saturation raise a concern that a landslide could have other activation mechanisms than induction by perched water from vertical rainfall infiltration sidle and ochiai 2013 and bogaard and greco 2016 therefore emphasized the effects and contributions of groundwater on landslides in addition to the issues raised above some common but important issues in landslide hydrology are still unclear for example what kind of rainfall patterns would be prone to landslide origination is the occurrence of a rainfall induced landslide limited to record high rainfall events does a landslide occur under subsurface conditions of either total or partial saturation these issues have not been completely examined because of the lack of detailed monitoring data sets or pre and post slide data sets in landslide hydrology obtaining more in situ data on water dynamics during slope failures is the main challenge to understanding mechanisms of landslide hydrology the main objective of this study was to present rare data on pore water pressure at the soil bedrock interface that were recorded during a typhoon induced landslide in a steep natural forested headwater catchment hydrological data sets of rainfall surface runoff and pore water pressure in other rainfall events over 2 years were used to determine the hydrological conditions that triggered the landslide in addition data sets of the two biggest typhoon events that had previously caused subsurface displacement were compared to data for the present landslide event the influences of previous subsurface displacement on hydrological responses and landslide were discussed we addressed the following questions related to the landslide 1 how was subsurface saturation generated and distributed when the landslide occurred in a headwater catchment was the landslide simply induced by perched water at the soil bedrock interface from vertical rainfall infiltration 2 was the landslide induced by the event with record high rainfall amount or intensity if not what were the dominant factors triggering the landslide 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and site the study area was in a natural forest at the fushan research center forestry research institute 24 45 42 n 121 35 45 e located in yilan county northeastern taiwan fig 1 a this area has a humid subtropical climate with an average annual air temperature of 18 5 c the average annual precipitation is 4125 mm distributed throughout the year the forest is characterized as a moist subtropical mixed evergreen forest and is dominated by trees of the families lauraceae fagaceae and theaceae wang et al 2000 the bedrock consists of argillite shale and slate soil can be classified as yellow colluvial and lithosol groups or as hapludults dystrochrepts udipsamments and udorthents according to the usda soil classification system lin et al 1996 there are several erosion gullies close to the tsukeng stream in the study area fig 1a we established a hydrological observation site in a small headwater catchment located upstream of an erosion gully beside the stream liang et al 2014 liang and chan 2017 liang et al 2017 the area of the observation site was 0 16 ha with a length of 59 m and width of 35 m fig 1b surface runoff originated from two small gullies and occurred year round downhill of the observation site trees and understory vegetation were evenly distributed across the site except in the two small gullies fig 1c left we measured surface topography using a laser rangefinder at 498 points at 2 m intervals and we determined the bedrock topography i e the soil bedrock interface from the spatial distribution of soil depth measured using a knocking type cone penetrometer at 151 points at 2 4 m intervals across the observation site liang and chan 2017 the mean slope gradient of the site was 41 range 4 75 the spatial distribution of soil depths was highly variable ranging from 0 4 to 7 0 m with a mean of 2 4 m and therefore bedrock topography was not consistent with surface topography bedrock topography featured bending or wave like knickpoints at the upper and middle slope areas fig 2 the knickpoints at mid slope were interrupted by a depression and a raised section with a flat head was below the depression 2 2 monitoring of pore water pressure at the soil bedrock interface runoff and rainfall hydrological measurements of pore water pressure ψ at the soil bedrock interface runoff and rainfall were conducted at 10 min intervals for 2 years and 10 months from december 2013 to september 2016 this includes the first year data set reported in liang and chan 2017 i e from december 2013 to february 2015 we established a monitoring area of 0 10 ha with a length of 43 m and width of 33 m in the valley head hillslope of the observation site to measure the spatial and temporal variation in subsurface saturation fig 1b sixty tensiometers were installed at the soil bedrock interface at approximately 4 m intervals at points where the penetration tests had been performed we designed and built these tensiometers for this study they consisted of a pressure transducer pa 750 copal electronics a polyvinyl chloride pvc probe body and a porous ceramic cup other details on the size measurement resolution and setting of tensiometers are described in liang and chan 2017 the values of ψ measured with the tensiometers were simultaneously and automatically recorded by two data loggers cr1000 campbell scientific set on the upslope and the downslope of the monitoring area surface runoff at a small gully was monitored by a 30 v notch weir fig 1b water level was monitored with two pressure sensors with built in data loggers baro diver schlumberger one that was set in the weir and one that recorded atmospheric pressure thus the water level in the weir could be calculated as the difference recorded by the two sensors after january 2016 we monitored the water level in the weir using a capacitance based water height sensor with a built in data logger wt hr 250 trutrack the water levels cm recorded by the pressure or capacitance sensors were converted into instantaneous water amounts ml s based on field calibrations conducted monthly gross rainfall was measured with a tipping bucket rain gauge 7852 m davis and automatically recorded by a data logger ua 003 64 onset in an open area approximately 800 m from the observation site 2 3 typhoon induced subsurface displacement and landslide the typhoon events starting on august 6 soudelor no 1513 and september 27 dujuan no 1521 were the two biggest such events in 2015 and each brought high rainfall amounts both typhoon events caused huge disasters from landslides debris flow and floods in taiwan including deaths injuries large scale power and water outages and serious damage to agricultural industry with losses estimated in the billions of taiwan new dollars in the study area surface cracks hillslope collapses gully expansions and huge fluctuations in the stream bed were observed lin and liang 2018 the surficial environment of the observation site was not obviously damaged except for some wind fallen branches or trees some tensiometers lost water and could not be refilled after the typhoon events while replacing the tensiometers we found that the porous cups were broken and the pvc probes were bent at the tip this damage likely resulted from shear forces around the soil bedrock interface as well as subsurface displacements at specific points figs 1b and 2 in particular the porous cups were frequently destroyed at two downslope points near the head of the raised part fig 2 which had never been observed before the typhoon events we therefore infer that these two typhoon events caused subsurface displacements hereafter displacement events the typhoon event starting on september 19 2016 megi no 1617 was the biggest event that year and also resulted in high rainfall amounts and huge disasters in taiwan the typhoon caused a landslide across the observation site field observations on september 30 2016 i e the third day after the landslide occurrence revealed that the landslide expanded from the eastern area outside the site to the downslope inside the site except for some small failures and cracks the upslope of the site showed little damage in the landslide area within the site bedrock was exposed in the downslope of the ψ monitoring area and debris was deposited mainly at the downslope outside the monitoring area fig 1b the failure depths were greater than 1 m at the bedrock exposure areas and 1 m at the west north part of the landslide area with a narrow shape where topsoil slid out but subsoil remained exfiltration water was found at some locations on the exposed bedrock surface where gray clayey materials were abundant fig 1c right because the sliding plane did not significantly reach inside the bedrock layers it may be classified as a shallow landslide at the headwater induced by the event hereafter landslide event 2 4 data analyses of subsurface saturation for rainfall events event based hydrological analyses were conducted we used a heuristic event separation method wiekenkamp et al 2016 to separate the continuous rainfall time series into rainfall events this method is based on two thresholds consecutive hours without rainfall tp which is used to separate events and minimum rainfall amount in millimeters ta which is used to exclude rainfall events with a very small amount of rainfall in our previous study liang and chan 2017 the validity of rainfall event separations was tested with several settings of tp and ta and tp 18 and ta 2 were determined to be appropriate for separating events in the study area using the same criteria in this study we separated individual rainfall events from other events based on an accumulated rainfall 2 mm in 18 consecutive hours in addition separated rainfall events with more than five missing ψ data points out of the total of 60 measurement points at the start peak rainfall or end of an event were excluded from the following analyses as the sole exception a landslide event with nine missing ψ data points at the start of the event was included we first analyzed rainfall characteristics and relationships of the maxima of the spatial mean ψ and the saturation ratio of the site to the accumulated rainfall amount for each event then we investigated spatial and temporal variation in ψ during the displacement and landslide events finally we compared characteristics of subsurface saturation responses for the events before and after subsurface displacement events indices of average rainfall intensity maximum rainfall intensity total rainfall amount and antecedent rainfall amount were used to describe the rainfall characteristics of each event the total rainfall amount was the sum total of rainfall from the start to the end of an event the average rainfall intensity was the total rainfall amount divided by the duration of the event and the maximum rainfall intensity was the maximum hourly rainfall amount during an event the antecedent rainfall amount rt was calculated by eq 1 which has been adopted by the public disaster warning system in taiwan chen and fujita 2013 1 r t i 0 7 α i r i whereas t is time point i is day ri is the amount of rainfall for the antecedent i days α is a weighting factor and rt is the sum of the unadjusted rainfall amount on day 0 and the rainfall amount in the antecedent 7 days adjusted by α based on historic debris flow disasters and practical applications α was set at 0 7 which is the official value used in taiwan after 2014 chen et al 2017 as a preparatory investigation rt at the start of events using several sets of α and i was tested with initial ψ for rainfall events fig s1 see supplementary material for the cases of α 0 7 using in the present study fig s1a the correlation of rt and initial ψ increased from i 3 and became stable at i 7 showing consistent correlations in the antecedent 7 49 days i e the spearman rank correlation coefficient 0 78 0 79 for the cases of α 1 fig s1b disregarding reduction effects of antecedent rainfall the correlation of rt and initial ψ was greatest at i 7 thus the setting of rt with α 0 7 in the antecedent 7 days could be appropriate to evaluate the antecedent rainfall amount on ψ rt at the end of a rainfall event rend and the maximum rt during a rainfall event rmax were also used to describe the characteristics of an event the characteristics of the landslide event were analyzed from the start of the event through the start of landslide occurrence the timing of the landslide occurrence was defined as the time that ψ suddenly missed or the time that runoff greatly declined during the landslide event for the next step of the analyses which consisted of verifying the general characteristics of ψ among rainfall events the maximum values of the mean ψ at all points and the maximum saturation ratio of the site were compared to the accumulated rainfall amount for each event the mean ψ was calculated as the mean ψ for all points enabled for monitoring i e excluding missing points the saturation ratio was calculated as the ratio of the number of saturated points to the total number of points enabled for monitoring accumulated rainfall was calculated from the start of a rainfall event to the time that the mean ψ or the saturation ratio reached its maximum during the rainfall event we separated the maximum ψ or the maximum saturation ratio at all points into four levels with different saturation frequencies to analyze contributions from perennially or ephemerally saturated points in our previous study liang and chan 2017 the mean μ and standard deviation σ of ψ at 60 measurement points calculated from the continuous time series data set were used to classify the frequency of saturation generation at each measurement point by eq 2 in which the four levels were denoted as always usually sometimes and rarely 2 always perennial μ 0 cm and μ σ 0 cm usually perennial μ 0 cm and μ σ 0 cm sometimes ephemeral μ 0 cm and μ σ 0 cm rarely ephemeral μ 0 cm and μ σ 0 cm the first condition μ 0 cm or μ 0 cm was used to roughly differentiate between perennial i e always and usually and ephemeral i e sometimes and rarely saturation the second condition μ σ or μ σ was used to evaluate variation from ψ 0 cmh2o the frequency of saturation generation determined at each measurement point in our previous study liang and chan 2017 was used in this study always usually sometimes and rarely were determined at 11 3 22 and 24 points which accounted for 18 5 37 and 40 of all points respectively fig 2 the always and usually points were mostly located around the raised part of the downslope and some of these were near the knickpoints on the upslope the sometimes and rarely saturated points were distributed across the monitoring area without discernable spatial patterns and were even found on the raised part of the downslope for analyses of how subsurface saturation is generated during heavy storm events spatial and temporal variation in ψ at the soil bedrock interface during the displacement events and landslide events was investigated negative and positive values of ψ were assumed to represent unsaturated and saturated conditions at the soil bedrock interface in addition to the saturation ratio described above we calculated the monitorable ratio as the ratio of the number of points enabled for monitoring to all 60 measurement points for the last step in the analyses which investigated the influences of subsurface displacements on hydrological responses the event based hydrological data sets were separated into two periods before and after the displacement events to detect general trends of the events in the two periods we excluded extreme displacement and landslide events from the analyses the amount of subsurface saturation of the site was calculated as the sum of ψ values 0 cmh2o the maximum increase in runoff or saturation was calculated from the start of an event to the time that runoff or saturation reached its maximum during that event 3 results 3 1 general characteristics of hydrological responses and rainfall events fig 3 shows the time series of hydrological data sets for the observation period rainfall was distributed throughout the year without significantly dry or wet periods typhoons or showers in the summer caused intense rainfall whereas frequent rainfall in winter was due to northeast monsoons based on the criteria of tp 18 and ta 2 and the missing ψ data point 5 for an event 155 rainfall events were selected for analysis in this study of these six were caused by typhoons based on eq 2 the mean ψ was higher at points of always usually sometimes and rarely in order of descending frequency the temporal variation in ψ was high in summer because of intense rainfall and high evaporation and low in winter because of low rainfall intensity and evaporation the mean ψ at all points including all four saturation generation frequencies was sensitive to rainfall supply and increased in the period after the displacements events runoff was sensitive to rainfall intensity with little time lag and was greater in the summer than the winter the total rainfall ranged from 2 4 to 387 2 mm for the 155 rainfall events and from 161 0 to 387 2 mm for the typhoons there was no significant correlation between the total rainfall amount and the average rainfall intensity pearson correlation coefficient 0 15 p 0 05 fig 4 a a significant positive correlation was found between the total rainfall amount and the maximum rainfall intensity pearson correlation coefficient 0 66 p 0 05 fig 4b and between the total rainfall amount and the antecedent rainfall amount of rend pearson correlation coefficient 0 81 p 0 05 fig 4c for the typhoon events rend corresponded approximately to the total rainfall amount except for the landslide event that had a relatively lower rend rmax almost corresponded to rend for all typhoon events and for most of the other events fig 4d which indicates that the antecedent rainwater supply reached a maximum value mostly at the end of the events typhoon events featured greater amounts of total rainfall or antecedent rainfall than the other events for the ranking of average rainfall intensity maximum rainfall intensity total rainfall amount and rend the displacement events ranked 11th 13th 2nd 3rd 1st 2nd and 1st 2nd and the landslide event ranked 53th 11th 3rd and 6th among all events respectively the amount and intensity of these variables was far greater for displacement events than for the landslide event 3 2 general responses of pore water pressure to rainfall events the maximum spatial mean ψ increased with accumulated rainfall and antecedent rainfall during rainfall events and was consequently greater at always usually sometimes and rarely points in that order fig 5 a although the accumulated rainfall and antecedent rainfall were not necessarily the same when the spatial mean ψ reached its maximum the slopes of the trend lines were very similar for all points and the points at the four levels range 0 04 0 09 the top three values of mean ψ at all points during the landslide and displacement events were 17 5 16 1 and 13 4 cmh2o the maximum values of mean ψ at the always and rarely points during the landslide event were ranked 1st among rainfall events at 45 and 10 cmh2o respectively the maximum saturation ratio increased with accumulated rainfall and antecedent rainfall during rainfall events showing an exponential trend at all points fig 5b the saturation ratio at all points increased sharply when accumulated rainfall or antecedent rainfall was 100 mm and increased gradually when rainfall was greater than 100 mm the saturation ratio at the always and usually points displayed minor variation with rainfall amounts corresponding to the ratios of the numbers of their points to all points those values were 18 and 5 respectively the saturation ratio at the sometimes points plateaued when rainfall was greater than 100 mm which was close to the ratio of the number of the points to all points 37 however the saturation ratio at the rarely points was smaller than the ratio of the number of the points to all points 40 even for the big events the top three values of the maximum saturation ratio at all points were recorded during a displacement event 0 89 the landslide event 0 89 and the other displacement event 0 84 the top two were separated by a difference of 0 006 the maximum saturation ratio among all rainfall events at the rarely points was observed during the landslide event 0 34 and the second and third highest values 0 32 and 0 26 respectively were observed during the displacement events 3 3 dynamics of pore water pressure at the soil bedrock interface during the displacement events and landslide event fig 6 shows the hydrological responses during the first displacement event which occurred august 6 8 2015 this was the second largest rainfall event in the observation period with a total rainfall of 370 mm accumulated rainfall and antecedent rainfall amounts and the temporal variation therein were similar which suggests little influence of antecedent rainfall on the hydrological responses observed during the event fig 6a the event had a duration of 46 3 h with variable intensity rainfall was intermittent in the early period but intense in the later period of the event the maximum rainfall intensity was 13 4 mm 10 min the monitorable values of ψ were 57 and 55 cmh20 at the start and end of the event respectively the saturation ratio of ψ at monitorable points increased with accumulated rainfall and reached a maximum of 0 89 at 40 5 h into the event the event started in dry conditions with a mean ψ of 17 5 cmh2o at all points the mean ψ of the points followed the saturation level classification order being highest to lowest from always usually sometimes to rarely points during the event although only the always points remained saturated throughout the event the mean ψ at usually sometimes and rarely points became positive around the time of peak rainfall runoff sensitivity increased with rainfall intensity before the peak rainfall but declined rapidly after the peak rainfall because the weir was blocked with sediment this was observed in the field investigation after the event as for temporal variation in the spatial pattern of ψ fig 6b most of the measurement points were unsaturated at the start of the event the visually obvious saturated zones were measured only around the raised part of the downslope area at 34 h before the intense rainfall the accumulated rainfall thus far was 83 8 mm ψ had increased at most of points and fragmentary saturated zones developed at the downslope and the upslope the fragmentary saturated zones connected from the upslope to the downslope to form a single saturated zone 35 h into the event concurrent with an increase in rainfall intensity the accumulated rainfall at this time was 106 2 mm at 39 3 h the peak rainfall had passed the monitoring area was widely saturated saturation ratio 0 84 and the mean saturation amount reached a maximum value of 16 6 cmh2o high positive ψ values were measured around the raised section of the downslope in a location near surface runoff at the end of the event 46 3 h in total the mean saturation amount had decreased to 12 5 cmh2o but a wide distribution of saturation remained saturation ratio 0 82 fig 7 shows the hydrological responses measured during the second displacement event september 27 29 2015 this was the biggest rainfall event in the observation period with a total rainfall of 387 2 mm the antecedent rainfall presumably had little influence on the event which displayed similar values and temporal variation for accumulated rainfall and antecedent rainfall amounts fig 7a the event showed a maximum rainfall intensity of 11 6 mm 10 min in a total event duration of 53 8 h in which rainfall was light in the beginning but intense later the monitorable value of ψ was 57 throughout the event the saturation ratio of ψ at monitorable points increased with accumulated rainfall and reached a maximum of 0 84 at the 40 3 h mark compared to the first displacement event shown in fig 6 the second displacement event started in wetter conditions with a mean ψ of 6 2 cmh2o similar to the first displacement event only the always points remained saturated throughout the event and ψ at the other points became positive at around the time of peak rainfall increases in runoff indicated a sensitivity to increases with rainfall intensity and were blocked by sediment after the peak rainfall a similar generation pattern of subsurface saturation as in the first displacement event was found in the second fig 7b at the start of the event saturation areas were discontiguous on the upslope but connected around the raised part of the downslope when accumulated rainfall increased from 40 6 mm at 32 h to 80 mm at 36 h fragmentary saturated zones were linked together from the upslope to the downslope at 40 8 h at peak rainfall accumulated rainfall 249 mm the mean saturation amount reached its maximum of 14 7 cmh2o with a saturation ratio of 0 81 at 53 8 h the event ended with a decrease in the mean saturation value to 11 1 cmh2o and a saturation ratio of 0 71 the landslide event from september 19 to 28 2016 featured intermittent rainfall over a relatively long duration of 9 days and intense rainfall from the seventh day fig 8 a it resulted in higher antecedent rainfall than accumulated rainfall in the early period but not in the later period of the event the total rainfall was 457 6 mm this includes significant rainfall after the initiation of the landslide the event started in wet conditions with a mean ψ of 7 2 cmh2o and a saturation ratio of 0 47 both ψ and runoff increased rapidly after hour 174 once rainfall became intense but decreased greatly from hour 188 7 before the peak of the rainfall event fig 8b based on the monitorable ratio of ψ and the decline in runoff the landslide likely occurred at the 188 7 h mark and further expanded at hour 192 3 as indicated by the destruction of several tensiometers and the weir the accumulated rainfall until the landslide occurrence at hour 188 7 was 271 4 mm which was ranked as the third largest amount in the observation period fig 4 temporal variation in the spatial pattern of ψ fig 8c features interconnected subsurface saturation zones developing from the upslope to the downslope at the start of the event similar to those shown for hour 174 with increasing rainfall the saturated zone further expanded across the monitoring area and the saturation amount increased everywhere in particular very high positive values of ψ were recorded around the raised part of the downslope as well as at the two small gullies to infer where the landslide started and expanded we calculated monitorable duration for each measurement point as the period from hour 188 7 of landslide occurrence through the time which point it is no longer monitorable fig 9 a shorter monitorable duration was recorded in the downslope landslide area where the failure depth was greater than 1 m a longer monitorable duration was recorded in the narrow upslope landslide area where the failure depth was less than 1 m thus the landslide likely started from the small gullies at the downslope where surface runoff originated and then expanded upslope immediately before the landslide occurred the mean ψ mean saturation amount and saturation ratio reached their maxima of 17 5 cmh2o 18 0 cmh2o and 0 89 respectively when we consider the landslide area exclusively we find mean ψ and mean saturation amount maxima of 29 0 and 39 1 cmh2o respectively 3 4 subsurface saturation responses before and after subsurface displacement events as shown in fig 3 the values of ψ become larger after the displacement events to clarify the influence of subsurface displacements on hydrological responses we compared the maximum values of rainfall amount or intensity runoff and saturation generation for all rainfall events before eventbefore and after eventafter the displacement events fig 10 the relationships between eventbefore and eventafter data for total rainfall amount versus maximum rainfall intensity were closely matched but slight differences were found in the relationship between total rainfall amount and rmax fig 10a eventafter rmax was slightly greater than eventbefore rmax at total rainfall 100 mm and slightly less than eventbefore rmax at total rainfall 100 mm thus it might be presumed that characteristics of rainfall events differed little between eventbefore and eventafter although the antecedent rainfall amount for the big events was slightly less for eventafter than eventbefore for trends between total rainfall amount and rmax the maximum runoff amount for eventafter was slightly greater than for eventbefore for accumulated rainfall 80 mm but slightly less for accumulated rainfall 80 mm fig 10b however the maximum increase in runoff i e the difference between the maximum and initial runoff was much smaller for eventafter than for eventbefore the maximum saturation amount at all points was greater for eventafter than eventbefore for events with accumulated rainfall 150 mm fig 10c the tendency of the greater saturation amount for eventafter was significant at the always and usually points slight at the rarely points and weak at the sometimes points the maximum increase in saturation amount i e the difference between the maximum and initial saturation was smaller for eventafter at the always usually and sometimes points but this was not true for the rarely points fig 10d the maximum increase in saturation amount at the rarely points differed little between eventbefore and eventafter although characteristics of rainwater inputs did not change substantially between eventbefore and eventafter the total amount of subsurface saturation was enlarged but the increase in the amount of subsurface saturation was less produced in eventafter these trends were more significant at the perennially saturated points 4 discussion 4 1 the heterogeneous distribution of subsurface saturation related to the landslide occurrence the main factor triggering the landslide was the generation of record high and positive ψ at the soil bedrock interface which served as a sliding plane figs 1c 5a and 8 however the landslide event did not occur during the maxima of rainfall intensity rainfall amount or antecedent rainfall amount in the observation period fig 4 unlike the other big events the record high ψ generated in the landslide event was attributed to the wet initial condition at the start of the event and to a longer duration of the event fig 8a and c this explains the paradox that the two largest events with higher rainfall amounts only caused subsurface displacements but the smaller event triggered the landslide fig 4 it also suggests that data on rainfall are not sufficient to fully inform a disaster warning system data on ψ at the potential sliding planes are crucial for an effective disaster warning system mirus et al 2018 thomas et al 2018 thomas et al 2019 previous research has established that subsurface saturation with a high ψ can trigger a landslide but the details behind this were poorly understood because of the lack of subsurface saturation data at the time when landslides occurred in the rare reports that have used artificial landslide initiation or purpose built study areas to get information on subsurface saturation at landslide initiation anderson and kneale 1980 sidle and swanston 1982 okura et al 2002 ochiai et al 2004 the generation of perched water on a poorly permeable or impermeable subsurface was the main cause of landslides the generation process can be described as percolated rainwater reaching a poorly permeable layer to form perched water which can further flow laterally along this layer this kind of generation process does not include other subsurface saturation that existed previously or was exchanged through the poorly permeable layer bogaard and greco 2016 argued that assumptions about the poor permeability of the bedrock and the fact that subsurface water triggering landslides originates exclusively from the ground surface could be a significant source of error in the present study we found that heterogeneous distribution of subsurface saturation contributed to the landslide occurrence based on the similar trendline slopes for the relationships between rainfall and the maximum ψ at all points and for the points classified in the four saturation generation frequencies fig 5a rainfall contributed almost equally to the increase in ψ at all points as well as the perennially or ephemerally saturated points in spite of the nearly equivalent rainfall the record high ψ at the site received a major contribution from the perennially saturated points mainly located at the downslope and within the landslide area figs 2 and 5a this may indicate that the landslide is also attributable to the heterogeneous distribution of subsurface saturation in particular the perennial saturation at the downslope characterized by frequent wet conditions and prone to failure in addition to all points and the always points the record high value of the mean ψ was also observed at the rarely points in the landslide event fig 5a the saturation ratio did not change substantially at the perennially saturated points but varied with the rainwater supply at the ephemerally saturated points fig 5b the center of the landslide area featured a raised area between two gullies that in general was rarely saturated fig 2 but became saturated when the landslide occurred fig 8 these results suggest that the ephemerally saturated points controlled the saturation ratio of the site and were likely related to the extent of the landslide area subsurface saturation at the perennially saturated points may be the main index for evaluating the slope stability and data from the ephemerally saturated points around the perennially saturated points could be another important index in a disaster warning system 4 2 generation patterns of subsurface saturation related to the landslide in the headwater at the study site the expansion patterns of subsurface saturation could be classified into four stages that were observed in the displacement and landslide events figs 6 7 and 8 and were detailed in our previous study liang and chan 2017 to summarize saturated zones were distributed in a fragmented and disconnected way and were mostly present at the downslope and rare at the upslope in the early period of a storm event stage 1 with an increase in rainwater supply stage 2 fragmentary saturated zones in upslope and downslope areas expanded downward and upward respectively after saturation interconnected from the upslope to the downslope stage 3 rainwater contributed to the amount of saturation in a highly linear way in the recession period stage 4 saturation disappeared in the middle area of the slope and the spatial distribution of saturation returned to a distribution similar to that at stage 2 or stage 1 thus the distribution of subsurface saturation at the soil bedrock interface in our headwater catchment changed from fragmentary to integrated during storm events then returned to fragmentary after the storm events based on the expansion patterns and point dependent saturation frequencies the heterogeneous distribution of subsurface saturation likely generated from different sources of vertical downward or downslope toward and vertical upward or upslope toward fluxes rather than the piezometric monitoring this study used tensiometric responses of negative and positive values of ψ at the soil bedrock interface to represent subsurface unsaturation and saturation although the origins could be verified using isotope chemical tracing techniques not conducted in this study we presume that these opposite fluxes likely resulted from vertical percolation of rainwater and an increase in groundwater which caused the generation of ephemeral and perennial saturation respectively as discussed in the previous section the landslides reported in the rare field observations were mainly induced by perched water from vertical percolation of rainwater anderson and kneale 1980 sidle and swanston 1982 bittelli et al 2012 montgomery et al 2002 indicated that the exfiltrating bedrock fracture flow would be connected to landslide initiation which could explain the wide variability in the occurrence of slope instability in topographically analogous locations unlike the relatively simple pattern of percolated rainwater accumulation subsurface seepage or groundwater may accelerate the timing or increase the extent of a shallow landslide occurrence a claim that has been researched using artificial seepage supplies harp et al 1990 kim et al 2018 although the exfiltration flux from the bedrock may also trigger a shallow landslide this was only discussed by the neighbor sites in previous studies brönnimann et al 2013 masaoka et al 2016 as a rare case montgomery et al 2009 monitored both infiltrating and exfiltrating gradients between colluvium and bedrock by a few piezometers when the middle of the hillslope hollow failed after the report of montgomery et al 2009 this study presents a rare case using extensive tensiometer measurements in which the recorded landslide was triggered by both vertically downward infiltrated water and an upward rise in groundwater these two sources of subsurface saturation interconnected around the soil bedrock interface at the unstable downslope where perennially produced surface runoff had accumulated headwater catchments should be characterized by at least two sources of subsurface saturation which cause a headwater to be most active hydrologically and erosionally among the various slope units tsukamoto and ohta 1988 to accurately predict the location and timing of shallow landslide occurrences in this type of headwater environment future stability analysis models must separately consider the generation processes of different origins of subsurface saturation e g ebel et al 2008 4 3 the influences of subsurface displacement on the landslide subsurface displacements can produce knickpoints or knicklines on surface or bedrock topography producing locations for landslide origination chigira 1992 sasaki et al 2000 in addition to modifying topographic or geological properties subsurface displacement might produce cracks or fissures within soil or bedrock layers that serve as preferential pathways and facilitate percolation krzeminska et al 2014 sidle and bogaard 2016 uhlemann et al 2017 such disturbances to subsurface properties promote hydrologic conditions that contribute to extended and elevated landslide susceptibility mirus et al 2017 in the present study the landslide triggered by the smaller event was also attributable to prior subsurface displacements that changed the responses of subsurface saturation the response of saturation generation was different for each of the four saturation generation frequencies for the events before and after the displacement events fig 10 for the events after the subsurface displacements the maximum saturation amount increased but the increase in saturation amount and runoff declined the tendencies were more obvious at the perennially saturated points data from those points indicated that the storage ability of groundwater increased and the perched water or discharge along the soil bedrock interface declined after the displacement events one possible mechanism for this could be that the subsurface displacements produce fissures or cracks around the soil bedrock interface or within bedrock layers this in turn would cause rainwater to percolate deeply and to recharge the groundwater more rather than temporarily perching or flowing out along the soil bedrock interface thus subsurface displacements would not only weaken the strength of the geological structure but also enlarge the amount of subsurface saturation at perennially saturated points all of which would reduce slope stability and therefore facilitate the occurrence of a landslide 5 conclusion this study presented the dynamics of pore water pressure ψ at the soil bedrock interface during a shallow landslide induced by a typhoon event this is a rare case recording the dynamics of both subsurface unsaturation and saturation with high resolution spatiotemporal data during a shallow landslide occurring in a natural forested headwater the two largest rainfall events in the observation period only caused subsurface displacements whereas a smaller rainfall event triggered a landslide at the downslope of the site the dominant factors triggering the landslide are summarized as follows 1 record high ψ at the soil bedrock interface the landslide occurred with a spatial mean ψ of 17 5 cmh2o and a saturation ratio of 0 89 at the site a record high and positive ψ was also observed at points where subsurface saturation rarely occurred the generation of record high saturation at the soil bedrock interface served as a sliding plane that was the main factor triggering the landslide 2 initially wet conditions the landslide event started in wet conditions with a mean ψ of 7 2 cmh2o and a saturation ratio of 0 47 this explains why the landslide occurred as a result of a smaller event but caused record high ψ in the observation period 3 heterogeneous distribution of subsurface saturation both perennial and ephemeral saturation was observed at the site although the rainfall contributed to nearly equivalent increases in ψ at all measurement points the downslope of the site where subsurface saturation perennially existed was prone to failure 4 influence of previous subsurface displacements the maximum amount of subsurface saturation increased in the event after the subsurface displacements in particular at the perennially saturated points the subsurface displacements not only weakened the strength of the geological structure but also enlarged the amount of perennial saturation all of which served to reduce slope stability and facilitate the landslide the occurrence of the shallow landslide not only depended on rainfall characteristics but was controlled by the responses of subsurface saturation at the sliding plane this study demonstrates that the landslide was triggered by record high subsurface saturation combined with heterogeneous distribution of perennial and ephemeral saturation we suggest that headwater catchments be characterized by at least two sources of subsurface saturation the different generation processes of different origins of subsurface saturation should be considered separately in stability analysis models or disaster warning systems declaration of

5445,the generation of subsurface saturation is highly related to shallow landslide initiation although many studies have relied on experiments to report the generation processes of subsurface saturation that triggers shallow artificial landslides studies based on detailed in situ monitoring data sets or pre and post slide data sets for a natural landslide are still rare this study recorded the dynamics of pore water pressure at the soil bedrock interface with high spatiotemporal resolution concurrently with the occurrence of a shallow landslide in a steep natural forested headwater catchment using event based analyses we explored patterns in the generation of subsurface saturation and other main hydrological factors triggering the landslide the landslide was not induced by the event with the greatest rainfall amount but by a smaller event with intermittent rainfall over a long duration of 9 days and intense rainfall from the seventh day the landslide occurred as a result of record high subsurface saturation generation with a spatial mean pore water pressure of 17 5 cmh2o and a saturation ratio of 0 89 at the site it was attributed to the landslide event that began during wet conditions with a mean pore water pressure of 7 2 cmh2o although the rainfall contributed a near uniform increase in pore water pressure at all measurement points high pore water pressure was recorded within the landslide area in the downslope area of the site where subsurface saturation existed perennially heterogeneous distribution of subsurface saturation including perennial and ephemeral saturation was likely related to the extent of the landslide area in addition the two biggest events in the observation period caused subsurface displacements in the year before the landslide the subsurface displacements weakened the geological structure and enlarged the amount of perennial saturation which all reduced slope stability and facilitated the landslide at least two origins of subsurface saturation should be a general feature for a headwater catchment e g vertically downward infiltrated water and an upward rise in groundwater and the different generation processes of subsurface saturation should be considered separately in future stability analysis models or disaster warning systems for shallow landslides keywords headwaters landslide soil bedrock interface subsurface displacement subsurface saturation 1 introduction rainfall initiated landslides are common hazards in hillslope environments from 2004 to 2016 rainfall induced landslides killed 55 997 people in 4862 distinct landslide events in the world with asia being the geographical area most affected froude and petley 2018 landslides are typically related to hydrological geomorphic pedological geological and biological factors sidle and bogaard 2016 of these hydrological controls are primary factors in rainfall induced landslides bogaard and greco 2016 coined the term landslide hydrology to describe the interdisciplinary study of water transfer storage and pressure buildup linked to hydrologically triggered destabilization and displacement of a slope understanding the processes and mechanisms of landslides is a critical step in reducing damage from landslides and establishing disaster warning systems the relationships between landslide occurrence and hydrological responses have been elucidated by experiments of artificial water supplies on artificial flumes or natural slopes harp et al 1990 iverson et al 2000 okura et al 2002 ochiai et al 2004 kim et al 2018 using experiments of artificial rainfall on a flume okura et al 2002 reported that landslide fluidization caused by undrained sudden loading undergoes three stages compaction of the sand layer by the sliding mass from the upper slope generation of excess pore water pressure in the saturated zone and induction of fast shearing kim et al 2018 compared effects of artificial rainfall versus seepage through water being forcibly injected into the sloping bed of a flume they found that the seepage caused greater instability than the rainfall ochiai et al 2004 conducted an experiment in which a landslide was induced by artificial rainfall with an intensity of 78 mm h on a natural slope without vegetation cover they observed that initially negative pore water pressure at six soil depths of 20 to 290 cm increased from upper to lower layers with an increase in water supply and all of the pore water pressure was positive when the failure occurred the results of these experiments suggest that the generation of positive pore water pressure from water supplied from vertical infiltration or lateral seepage has crucial implications for landslide occurrences however these kinds of experiments take place under controlled conditions that cannot include variation in rainfall vegetation or topography and therefore they do not address the features or mechanisms of landslides that occur on natural forested hillslopes few researchers have successfully collected observations of soil water dynamics or underground hydrological responses during shallow landslide occurrences anderson and kneale 1980 measured pore water pressure using 22 tensiometers installed within soil layers at depths of 25 100 cm in a clay embankment and recorded high positive pore water pressure at the foot of the embankment when a shallow landslide occurred after continuous low intensity precipitation sidle and swanston 1982 monitored the maximum rise in the water table with a piezometer during a moderately intense storm that triggered a small debris slide on a forested mid slope they reported that the debris slide was likely initiated by a perched water table generating at a hydrologic discontinuity of bedrock surface with a pore water pressure of 22 cmh2o calculated by an infinite slope model they suggested that the cause of the debris slide was related more to the distribution of rainfall and the maximum short term intensity than to the total precipitation from the storm godt et al 2009 observed a shallow landslide on a coastal bluff which occurred under partially saturated conditions the failure surface was at the contact between the loose sandy colluvium and the better consolidated glacial outwash sand montgomery et al 2009 monitored piezometric responses in colluvium and bedrock during heavy rainfall in november 1996 that triggered a slope failure at the middle of a hillslope hollow and then mobilized as a debris flow at an intensively instrumented catchment coos bay 1 they reported that the failure was initiated by local upward flow from bedrock developed into overlying colluvium with high spatial variability bittelli et al 2012 conducted integrated field monitoring of soil water and subsurface displacements and observed a soil failure during the observation period they detected the failure plane at a depth of 1 4 m the location of an interface between a superficial layer with higher permeability and a compacted substrate with lower permeability in recent reports that recorded underground data for slow moving or episodically recurring landslides uhlemann et al 2017 monitored subsurface moisture dynamics of slow moving landslides for 3 years using 3d and time lapse electrical resistivity imaging in the months preceding the reactivation of landslides subsurface moisture increased by more than 45 throughout the slope resulting in slow movement at the toe of the slope and rotational failures at the upslope mirus et al 2017 compared soil properties and hydrological responses of a vegetated hillslope and a landslide hillslope where sliding episodically recurred and reported that the landslide hillslope featured lower matrix porosity and hydraulic conductivity an earlier seasonal transition to near saturated conditions longer persistence of positive pore water pressure and slower drainage although the field cases described above reported several types of shallow landslides they suggest that the processes of drainage or saturation generation as well as rainfall characteristics have crucial implications for landslide occurrences in particular the landslides were initiated by a perched water table at a discontinuous interface e g the soil bedrock interface due to sharp changes and clear differences in hydraulic properties between different layers weiler et al 2006 katsura et al 2009 katsura et al 2014 thus the spatial patterns of subsurface saturation are the key factor linking the location and timing of landslide occurrences the development pattern of subsurface saturation from the downslope to the upslope in the side slopes or headwaters was previously acknowledged hewlett and hibbert 1967 proposed the variable source area concept in which subsurface saturation develops from riparian areas near stream channels where the water table rises to intersect with the soil surface according to this concept subsurface saturation expands in a vertically upward or upslope direction along the soil bedrock interface with an increase in rainwater input and a saturated wedge forms at the downslope atkinson 1978 although this kind of process was also reported in previous field studies anderson and burt 1978 tsukamoto and ohta 1988 the concept was more arguable in recent studies that observed the expansion patterns of subsurface saturation from the upslope to the downslope anderson et al 1997 montgomery et al 1997 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 the inconsistency in previous studies can be attributed to the origins of subsurface saturation with different generation mechanisms such as percolated rainwater and groundwater anderson and burt 1977 katsuyama et al 2005 uchida et al 2006 masaoka et al 2016 the various generation patterns of subsurface saturation raise a concern that a landslide could have other activation mechanisms than induction by perched water from vertical rainfall infiltration sidle and ochiai 2013 and bogaard and greco 2016 therefore emphasized the effects and contributions of groundwater on landslides in addition to the issues raised above some common but important issues in landslide hydrology are still unclear for example what kind of rainfall patterns would be prone to landslide origination is the occurrence of a rainfall induced landslide limited to record high rainfall events does a landslide occur under subsurface conditions of either total or partial saturation these issues have not been completely examined because of the lack of detailed monitoring data sets or pre and post slide data sets in landslide hydrology obtaining more in situ data on water dynamics during slope failures is the main challenge to understanding mechanisms of landslide hydrology the main objective of this study was to present rare data on pore water pressure at the soil bedrock interface that were recorded during a typhoon induced landslide in a steep natural forested headwater catchment hydrological data sets of rainfall surface runoff and pore water pressure in other rainfall events over 2 years were used to determine the hydrological conditions that triggered the landslide in addition data sets of the two biggest typhoon events that had previously caused subsurface displacement were compared to data for the present landslide event the influences of previous subsurface displacement on hydrological responses and landslide were discussed we addressed the following questions related to the landslide 1 how was subsurface saturation generated and distributed when the landslide occurred in a headwater catchment was the landslide simply induced by perched water at the soil bedrock interface from vertical rainfall infiltration 2 was the landslide induced by the event with record high rainfall amount or intensity if not what were the dominant factors triggering the landslide 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and site the study area was in a natural forest at the fushan research center forestry research institute 24 45 42 n 121 35 45 e located in yilan county northeastern taiwan fig 1 a this area has a humid subtropical climate with an average annual air temperature of 18 5 c the average annual precipitation is 4125 mm distributed throughout the year the forest is characterized as a moist subtropical mixed evergreen forest and is dominated by trees of the families lauraceae fagaceae and theaceae wang et al 2000 the bedrock consists of argillite shale and slate soil can be classified as yellow colluvial and lithosol groups or as hapludults dystrochrepts udipsamments and udorthents according to the usda soil classification system lin et al 1996 there are several erosion gullies close to the tsukeng stream in the study area fig 1a we established a hydrological observation site in a small headwater catchment located upstream of an erosion gully beside the stream liang et al 2014 liang and chan 2017 liang et al 2017 the area of the observation site was 0 16 ha with a length of 59 m and width of 35 m fig 1b surface runoff originated from two small gullies and occurred year round downhill of the observation site trees and understory vegetation were evenly distributed across the site except in the two small gullies fig 1c left we measured surface topography using a laser rangefinder at 498 points at 2 m intervals and we determined the bedrock topography i e the soil bedrock interface from the spatial distribution of soil depth measured using a knocking type cone penetrometer at 151 points at 2 4 m intervals across the observation site liang and chan 2017 the mean slope gradient of the site was 41 range 4 75 the spatial distribution of soil depths was highly variable ranging from 0 4 to 7 0 m with a mean of 2 4 m and therefore bedrock topography was not consistent with surface topography bedrock topography featured bending or wave like knickpoints at the upper and middle slope areas fig 2 the knickpoints at mid slope were interrupted by a depression and a raised section with a flat head was below the depression 2 2 monitoring of pore water pressure at the soil bedrock interface runoff and rainfall hydrological measurements of pore water pressure ψ at the soil bedrock interface runoff and rainfall were conducted at 10 min intervals for 2 years and 10 months from december 2013 to september 2016 this includes the first year data set reported in liang and chan 2017 i e from december 2013 to february 2015 we established a monitoring area of 0 10 ha with a length of 43 m and width of 33 m in the valley head hillslope of the observation site to measure the spatial and temporal variation in subsurface saturation fig 1b sixty tensiometers were installed at the soil bedrock interface at approximately 4 m intervals at points where the penetration tests had been performed we designed and built these tensiometers for this study they consisted of a pressure transducer pa 750 copal electronics a polyvinyl chloride pvc probe body and a porous ceramic cup other details on the size measurement resolution and setting of tensiometers are described in liang and chan 2017 the values of ψ measured with the tensiometers were simultaneously and automatically recorded by two data loggers cr1000 campbell scientific set on the upslope and the downslope of the monitoring area surface runoff at a small gully was monitored by a 30 v notch weir fig 1b water level was monitored with two pressure sensors with built in data loggers baro diver schlumberger one that was set in the weir and one that recorded atmospheric pressure thus the water level in the weir could be calculated as the difference recorded by the two sensors after january 2016 we monitored the water level in the weir using a capacitance based water height sensor with a built in data logger wt hr 250 trutrack the water levels cm recorded by the pressure or capacitance sensors were converted into instantaneous water amounts ml s based on field calibrations conducted monthly gross rainfall was measured with a tipping bucket rain gauge 7852 m davis and automatically recorded by a data logger ua 003 64 onset in an open area approximately 800 m from the observation site 2 3 typhoon induced subsurface displacement and landslide the typhoon events starting on august 6 soudelor no 1513 and september 27 dujuan no 1521 were the two biggest such events in 2015 and each brought high rainfall amounts both typhoon events caused huge disasters from landslides debris flow and floods in taiwan including deaths injuries large scale power and water outages and serious damage to agricultural industry with losses estimated in the billions of taiwan new dollars in the study area surface cracks hillslope collapses gully expansions and huge fluctuations in the stream bed were observed lin and liang 2018 the surficial environment of the observation site was not obviously damaged except for some wind fallen branches or trees some tensiometers lost water and could not be refilled after the typhoon events while replacing the tensiometers we found that the porous cups were broken and the pvc probes were bent at the tip this damage likely resulted from shear forces around the soil bedrock interface as well as subsurface displacements at specific points figs 1b and 2 in particular the porous cups were frequently destroyed at two downslope points near the head of the raised part fig 2 which had never been observed before the typhoon events we therefore infer that these two typhoon events caused subsurface displacements hereafter displacement events the typhoon event starting on september 19 2016 megi no 1617 was the biggest event that year and also resulted in high rainfall amounts and huge disasters in taiwan the typhoon caused a landslide across the observation site field observations on september 30 2016 i e the third day after the landslide occurrence revealed that the landslide expanded from the eastern area outside the site to the downslope inside the site except for some small failures and cracks the upslope of the site showed little damage in the landslide area within the site bedrock was exposed in the downslope of the ψ monitoring area and debris was deposited mainly at the downslope outside the monitoring area fig 1b the failure depths were greater than 1 m at the bedrock exposure areas and 1 m at the west north part of the landslide area with a narrow shape where topsoil slid out but subsoil remained exfiltration water was found at some locations on the exposed bedrock surface where gray clayey materials were abundant fig 1c right because the sliding plane did not significantly reach inside the bedrock layers it may be classified as a shallow landslide at the headwater induced by the event hereafter landslide event 2 4 data analyses of subsurface saturation for rainfall events event based hydrological analyses were conducted we used a heuristic event separation method wiekenkamp et al 2016 to separate the continuous rainfall time series into rainfall events this method is based on two thresholds consecutive hours without rainfall tp which is used to separate events and minimum rainfall amount in millimeters ta which is used to exclude rainfall events with a very small amount of rainfall in our previous study liang and chan 2017 the validity of rainfall event separations was tested with several settings of tp and ta and tp 18 and ta 2 were determined to be appropriate for separating events in the study area using the same criteria in this study we separated individual rainfall events from other events based on an accumulated rainfall 2 mm in 18 consecutive hours in addition separated rainfall events with more than five missing ψ data points out of the total of 60 measurement points at the start peak rainfall or end of an event were excluded from the following analyses as the sole exception a landslide event with nine missing ψ data points at the start of the event was included we first analyzed rainfall characteristics and relationships of the maxima of the spatial mean ψ and the saturation ratio of the site to the accumulated rainfall amount for each event then we investigated spatial and temporal variation in ψ during the displacement and landslide events finally we compared characteristics of subsurface saturation responses for the events before and after subsurface displacement events indices of average rainfall intensity maximum rainfall intensity total rainfall amount and antecedent rainfall amount were used to describe the rainfall characteristics of each event the total rainfall amount was the sum total of rainfall from the start to the end of an event the average rainfall intensity was the total rainfall amount divided by the duration of the event and the maximum rainfall intensity was the maximum hourly rainfall amount during an event the antecedent rainfall amount rt was calculated by eq 1 which has been adopted by the public disaster warning system in taiwan chen and fujita 2013 1 r t i 0 7 α i r i whereas t is time point i is day ri is the amount of rainfall for the antecedent i days α is a weighting factor and rt is the sum of the unadjusted rainfall amount on day 0 and the rainfall amount in the antecedent 7 days adjusted by α based on historic debris flow disasters and practical applications α was set at 0 7 which is the official value used in taiwan after 2014 chen et al 2017 as a preparatory investigation rt at the start of events using several sets of α and i was tested with initial ψ for rainfall events fig s1 see supplementary material for the cases of α 0 7 using in the present study fig s1a the correlation of rt and initial ψ increased from i 3 and became stable at i 7 showing consistent correlations in the antecedent 7 49 days i e the spearman rank correlation coefficient 0 78 0 79 for the cases of α 1 fig s1b disregarding reduction effects of antecedent rainfall the correlation of rt and initial ψ was greatest at i 7 thus the setting of rt with α 0 7 in the antecedent 7 days could be appropriate to evaluate the antecedent rainfall amount on ψ rt at the end of a rainfall event rend and the maximum rt during a rainfall event rmax were also used to describe the characteristics of an event the characteristics of the landslide event were analyzed from the start of the event through the start of landslide occurrence the timing of the landslide occurrence was defined as the time that ψ suddenly missed or the time that runoff greatly declined during the landslide event for the next step of the analyses which consisted of verifying the general characteristics of ψ among rainfall events the maximum values of the mean ψ at all points and the maximum saturation ratio of the site were compared to the accumulated rainfall amount for each event the mean ψ was calculated as the mean ψ for all points enabled for monitoring i e excluding missing points the saturation ratio was calculated as the ratio of the number of saturated points to the total number of points enabled for monitoring accumulated rainfall was calculated from the start of a rainfall event to the time that the mean ψ or the saturation ratio reached its maximum during the rainfall event we separated the maximum ψ or the maximum saturation ratio at all points into four levels with different saturation frequencies to analyze contributions from perennially or ephemerally saturated points in our previous study liang and chan 2017 the mean μ and standard deviation σ of ψ at 60 measurement points calculated from the continuous time series data set were used to classify the frequency of saturation generation at each measurement point by eq 2 in which the four levels were denoted as always usually sometimes and rarely 2 always perennial μ 0 cm and μ σ 0 cm usually perennial μ 0 cm and μ σ 0 cm sometimes ephemeral μ 0 cm and μ σ 0 cm rarely ephemeral μ 0 cm and μ σ 0 cm the first condition μ 0 cm or μ 0 cm was used to roughly differentiate between perennial i e always and usually and ephemeral i e sometimes and rarely saturation the second condition μ σ or μ σ was used to evaluate variation from ψ 0 cmh2o the frequency of saturation generation determined at each measurement point in our previous study liang and chan 2017 was used in this study always usually sometimes and rarely were determined at 11 3 22 and 24 points which accounted for 18 5 37 and 40 of all points respectively fig 2 the always and usually points were mostly located around the raised part of the downslope and some of these were near the knickpoints on the upslope the sometimes and rarely saturated points were distributed across the monitoring area without discernable spatial patterns and were even found on the raised part of the downslope for analyses of how subsurface saturation is generated during heavy storm events spatial and temporal variation in ψ at the soil bedrock interface during the displacement events and landslide events was investigated negative and positive values of ψ were assumed to represent unsaturated and saturated conditions at the soil bedrock interface in addition to the saturation ratio described above we calculated the monitorable ratio as the ratio of the number of points enabled for monitoring to all 60 measurement points for the last step in the analyses which investigated the influences of subsurface displacements on hydrological responses the event based hydrological data sets were separated into two periods before and after the displacement events to detect general trends of the events in the two periods we excluded extreme displacement and landslide events from the analyses the amount of subsurface saturation of the site was calculated as the sum of ψ values 0 cmh2o the maximum increase in runoff or saturation was calculated from the start of an event to the time that runoff or saturation reached its maximum during that event 3 results 3 1 general characteristics of hydrological responses and rainfall events fig 3 shows the time series of hydrological data sets for the observation period rainfall was distributed throughout the year without significantly dry or wet periods typhoons or showers in the summer caused intense rainfall whereas frequent rainfall in winter was due to northeast monsoons based on the criteria of tp 18 and ta 2 and the missing ψ data point 5 for an event 155 rainfall events were selected for analysis in this study of these six were caused by typhoons based on eq 2 the mean ψ was higher at points of always usually sometimes and rarely in order of descending frequency the temporal variation in ψ was high in summer because of intense rainfall and high evaporation and low in winter because of low rainfall intensity and evaporation the mean ψ at all points including all four saturation generation frequencies was sensitive to rainfall supply and increased in the period after the displacements events runoff was sensitive to rainfall intensity with little time lag and was greater in the summer than the winter the total rainfall ranged from 2 4 to 387 2 mm for the 155 rainfall events and from 161 0 to 387 2 mm for the typhoons there was no significant correlation between the total rainfall amount and the average rainfall intensity pearson correlation coefficient 0 15 p 0 05 fig 4 a a significant positive correlation was found between the total rainfall amount and the maximum rainfall intensity pearson correlation coefficient 0 66 p 0 05 fig 4b and between the total rainfall amount and the antecedent rainfall amount of rend pearson correlation coefficient 0 81 p 0 05 fig 4c for the typhoon events rend corresponded approximately to the total rainfall amount except for the landslide event that had a relatively lower rend rmax almost corresponded to rend for all typhoon events and for most of the other events fig 4d which indicates that the antecedent rainwater supply reached a maximum value mostly at the end of the events typhoon events featured greater amounts of total rainfall or antecedent rainfall than the other events for the ranking of average rainfall intensity maximum rainfall intensity total rainfall amount and rend the displacement events ranked 11th 13th 2nd 3rd 1st 2nd and 1st 2nd and the landslide event ranked 53th 11th 3rd and 6th among all events respectively the amount and intensity of these variables was far greater for displacement events than for the landslide event 3 2 general responses of pore water pressure to rainfall events the maximum spatial mean ψ increased with accumulated rainfall and antecedent rainfall during rainfall events and was consequently greater at always usually sometimes and rarely points in that order fig 5 a although the accumulated rainfall and antecedent rainfall were not necessarily the same when the spatial mean ψ reached its maximum the slopes of the trend lines were very similar for all points and the points at the four levels range 0 04 0 09 the top three values of mean ψ at all points during the landslide and displacement events were 17 5 16 1 and 13 4 cmh2o the maximum values of mean ψ at the always and rarely points during the landslide event were ranked 1st among rainfall events at 45 and 10 cmh2o respectively the maximum saturation ratio increased with accumulated rainfall and antecedent rainfall during rainfall events showing an exponential trend at all points fig 5b the saturation ratio at all points increased sharply when accumulated rainfall or antecedent rainfall was 100 mm and increased gradually when rainfall was greater than 100 mm the saturation ratio at the always and usually points displayed minor variation with rainfall amounts corresponding to the ratios of the numbers of their points to all points those values were 18 and 5 respectively the saturation ratio at the sometimes points plateaued when rainfall was greater than 100 mm which was close to the ratio of the number of the points to all points 37 however the saturation ratio at the rarely points was smaller than the ratio of the number of the points to all points 40 even for the big events the top three values of the maximum saturation ratio at all points were recorded during a displacement event 0 89 the landslide event 0 89 and the other displacement event 0 84 the top two were separated by a difference of 0 006 the maximum saturation ratio among all rainfall events at the rarely points was observed during the landslide event 0 34 and the second and third highest values 0 32 and 0 26 respectively were observed during the displacement events 3 3 dynamics of pore water pressure at the soil bedrock interface during the displacement events and landslide event fig 6 shows the hydrological responses during the first displacement event which occurred august 6 8 2015 this was the second largest rainfall event in the observation period with a total rainfall of 370 mm accumulated rainfall and antecedent rainfall amounts and the temporal variation therein were similar which suggests little influence of antecedent rainfall on the hydrological responses observed during the event fig 6a the event had a duration of 46 3 h with variable intensity rainfall was intermittent in the early period but intense in the later period of the event the maximum rainfall intensity was 13 4 mm 10 min the monitorable values of ψ were 57 and 55 cmh20 at the start and end of the event respectively the saturation ratio of ψ at monitorable points increased with accumulated rainfall and reached a maximum of 0 89 at 40 5 h into the event the event started in dry conditions with a mean ψ of 17 5 cmh2o at all points the mean ψ of the points followed the saturation level classification order being highest to lowest from always usually sometimes to rarely points during the event although only the always points remained saturated throughout the event the mean ψ at usually sometimes and rarely points became positive around the time of peak rainfall runoff sensitivity increased with rainfall intensity before the peak rainfall but declined rapidly after the peak rainfall because the weir was blocked with sediment this was observed in the field investigation after the event as for temporal variation in the spatial pattern of ψ fig 6b most of the measurement points were unsaturated at the start of the event the visually obvious saturated zones were measured only around the raised part of the downslope area at 34 h before the intense rainfall the accumulated rainfall thus far was 83 8 mm ψ had increased at most of points and fragmentary saturated zones developed at the downslope and the upslope the fragmentary saturated zones connected from the upslope to the downslope to form a single saturated zone 35 h into the event concurrent with an increase in rainfall intensity the accumulated rainfall at this time was 106 2 mm at 39 3 h the peak rainfall had passed the monitoring area was widely saturated saturation ratio 0 84 and the mean saturation amount reached a maximum value of 16 6 cmh2o high positive ψ values were measured around the raised section of the downslope in a location near surface runoff at the end of the event 46 3 h in total the mean saturation amount had decreased to 12 5 cmh2o but a wide distribution of saturation remained saturation ratio 0 82 fig 7 shows the hydrological responses measured during the second displacement event september 27 29 2015 this was the biggest rainfall event in the observation period with a total rainfall of 387 2 mm the antecedent rainfall presumably had little influence on the event which displayed similar values and temporal variation for accumulated rainfall and antecedent rainfall amounts fig 7a the event showed a maximum rainfall intensity of 11 6 mm 10 min in a total event duration of 53 8 h in which rainfall was light in the beginning but intense later the monitorable value of ψ was 57 throughout the event the saturation ratio of ψ at monitorable points increased with accumulated rainfall and reached a maximum of 0 84 at the 40 3 h mark compared to the first displacement event shown in fig 6 the second displacement event started in wetter conditions with a mean ψ of 6 2 cmh2o similar to the first displacement event only the always points remained saturated throughout the event and ψ at the other points became positive at around the time of peak rainfall increases in runoff indicated a sensitivity to increases with rainfall intensity and were blocked by sediment after the peak rainfall a similar generation pattern of subsurface saturation as in the first displacement event was found in the second fig 7b at the start of the event saturation areas were discontiguous on the upslope but connected around the raised part of the downslope when accumulated rainfall increased from 40 6 mm at 32 h to 80 mm at 36 h fragmentary saturated zones were linked together from the upslope to the downslope at 40 8 h at peak rainfall accumulated rainfall 249 mm the mean saturation amount reached its maximum of 14 7 cmh2o with a saturation ratio of 0 81 at 53 8 h the event ended with a decrease in the mean saturation value to 11 1 cmh2o and a saturation ratio of 0 71 the landslide event from september 19 to 28 2016 featured intermittent rainfall over a relatively long duration of 9 days and intense rainfall from the seventh day fig 8 a it resulted in higher antecedent rainfall than accumulated rainfall in the early period but not in the later period of the event the total rainfall was 457 6 mm this includes significant rainfall after the initiation of the landslide the event started in wet conditions with a mean ψ of 7 2 cmh2o and a saturation ratio of 0 47 both ψ and runoff increased rapidly after hour 174 once rainfall became intense but decreased greatly from hour 188 7 before the peak of the rainfall event fig 8b based on the monitorable ratio of ψ and the decline in runoff the landslide likely occurred at the 188 7 h mark and further expanded at hour 192 3 as indicated by the destruction of several tensiometers and the weir the accumulated rainfall until the landslide occurrence at hour 188 7 was 271 4 mm which was ranked as the third largest amount in the observation period fig 4 temporal variation in the spatial pattern of ψ fig 8c features interconnected subsurface saturation zones developing from the upslope to the downslope at the start of the event similar to those shown for hour 174 with increasing rainfall the saturated zone further expanded across the monitoring area and the saturation amount increased everywhere in particular very high positive values of ψ were recorded around the raised part of the downslope as well as at the two small gullies to infer where the landslide started and expanded we calculated monitorable duration for each measurement point as the period from hour 188 7 of landslide occurrence through the time which point it is no longer monitorable fig 9 a shorter monitorable duration was recorded in the downslope landslide area where the failure depth was greater than 1 m a longer monitorable duration was recorded in the narrow upslope landslide area where the failure depth was less than 1 m thus the landslide likely started from the small gullies at the downslope where surface runoff originated and then expanded upslope immediately before the landslide occurred the mean ψ mean saturation amount and saturation ratio reached their maxima of 17 5 cmh2o 18 0 cmh2o and 0 89 respectively when we consider the landslide area exclusively we find mean ψ and mean saturation amount maxima of 29 0 and 39 1 cmh2o respectively 3 4 subsurface saturation responses before and after subsurface displacement events as shown in fig 3 the values of ψ become larger after the displacement events to clarify the influence of subsurface displacements on hydrological responses we compared the maximum values of rainfall amount or intensity runoff and saturation generation for all rainfall events before eventbefore and after eventafter the displacement events fig 10 the relationships between eventbefore and eventafter data for total rainfall amount versus maximum rainfall intensity were closely matched but slight differences were found in the relationship between total rainfall amount and rmax fig 10a eventafter rmax was slightly greater than eventbefore rmax at total rainfall 100 mm and slightly less than eventbefore rmax at total rainfall 100 mm thus it might be presumed that characteristics of rainfall events differed little between eventbefore and eventafter although the antecedent rainfall amount for the big events was slightly less for eventafter than eventbefore for trends between total rainfall amount and rmax the maximum runoff amount for eventafter was slightly greater than for eventbefore for accumulated rainfall 80 mm but slightly less for accumulated rainfall 80 mm fig 10b however the maximum increase in runoff i e the difference between the maximum and initial runoff was much smaller for eventafter than for eventbefore the maximum saturation amount at all points was greater for eventafter than eventbefore for events with accumulated rainfall 150 mm fig 10c the tendency of the greater saturation amount for eventafter was significant at the always and usually points slight at the rarely points and weak at the sometimes points the maximum increase in saturation amount i e the difference between the maximum and initial saturation was smaller for eventafter at the always usually and sometimes points but this was not true for the rarely points fig 10d the maximum increase in saturation amount at the rarely points differed little between eventbefore and eventafter although characteristics of rainwater inputs did not change substantially between eventbefore and eventafter the total amount of subsurface saturation was enlarged but the increase in the amount of subsurface saturation was less produced in eventafter these trends were more significant at the perennially saturated points 4 discussion 4 1 the heterogeneous distribution of subsurface saturation related to the landslide occurrence the main factor triggering the landslide was the generation of record high and positive ψ at the soil bedrock interface which served as a sliding plane figs 1c 5a and 8 however the landslide event did not occur during the maxima of rainfall intensity rainfall amount or antecedent rainfall amount in the observation period fig 4 unlike the other big events the record high ψ generated in the landslide event was attributed to the wet initial condition at the start of the event and to a longer duration of the event fig 8a and c this explains the paradox that the two largest events with higher rainfall amounts only caused subsurface displacements but the smaller event triggered the landslide fig 4 it also suggests that data on rainfall are not sufficient to fully inform a disaster warning system data on ψ at the potential sliding planes are crucial for an effective disaster warning system mirus et al 2018 thomas et al 2018 thomas et al 2019 previous research has established that subsurface saturation with a high ψ can trigger a landslide but the details behind this were poorly understood because of the lack of subsurface saturation data at the time when landslides occurred in the rare reports that have used artificial landslide initiation or purpose built study areas to get information on subsurface saturation at landslide initiation anderson and kneale 1980 sidle and swanston 1982 okura et al 2002 ochiai et al 2004 the generation of perched water on a poorly permeable or impermeable subsurface was the main cause of landslides the generation process can be described as percolated rainwater reaching a poorly permeable layer to form perched water which can further flow laterally along this layer this kind of generation process does not include other subsurface saturation that existed previously or was exchanged through the poorly permeable layer bogaard and greco 2016 argued that assumptions about the poor permeability of the bedrock and the fact that subsurface water triggering landslides originates exclusively from the ground surface could be a significant source of error in the present study we found that heterogeneous distribution of subsurface saturation contributed to the landslide occurrence based on the similar trendline slopes for the relationships between rainfall and the maximum ψ at all points and for the points classified in the four saturation generation frequencies fig 5a rainfall contributed almost equally to the increase in ψ at all points as well as the perennially or ephemerally saturated points in spite of the nearly equivalent rainfall the record high ψ at the site received a major contribution from the perennially saturated points mainly located at the downslope and within the landslide area figs 2 and 5a this may indicate that the landslide is also attributable to the heterogeneous distribution of subsurface saturation in particular the perennial saturation at the downslope characterized by frequent wet conditions and prone to failure in addition to all points and the always points the record high value of the mean ψ was also observed at the rarely points in the landslide event fig 5a the saturation ratio did not change substantially at the perennially saturated points but varied with the rainwater supply at the ephemerally saturated points fig 5b the center of the landslide area featured a raised area between two gullies that in general was rarely saturated fig 2 but became saturated when the landslide occurred fig 8 these results suggest that the ephemerally saturated points controlled the saturation ratio of the site and were likely related to the extent of the landslide area subsurface saturation at the perennially saturated points may be the main index for evaluating the slope stability and data from the ephemerally saturated points around the perennially saturated points could be another important index in a disaster warning system 4 2 generation patterns of subsurface saturation related to the landslide in the headwater at the study site the expansion patterns of subsurface saturation could be classified into four stages that were observed in the displacement and landslide events figs 6 7 and 8 and were detailed in our previous study liang and chan 2017 to summarize saturated zones were distributed in a fragmented and disconnected way and were mostly present at the downslope and rare at the upslope in the early period of a storm event stage 1 with an increase in rainwater supply stage 2 fragmentary saturated zones in upslope and downslope areas expanded downward and upward respectively after saturation interconnected from the upslope to the downslope stage 3 rainwater contributed to the amount of saturation in a highly linear way in the recession period stage 4 saturation disappeared in the middle area of the slope and the spatial distribution of saturation returned to a distribution similar to that at stage 2 or stage 1 thus the distribution of subsurface saturation at the soil bedrock interface in our headwater catchment changed from fragmentary to integrated during storm events then returned to fragmentary after the storm events based on the expansion patterns and point dependent saturation frequencies the heterogeneous distribution of subsurface saturation likely generated from different sources of vertical downward or downslope toward and vertical upward or upslope toward fluxes rather than the piezometric monitoring this study used tensiometric responses of negative and positive values of ψ at the soil bedrock interface to represent subsurface unsaturation and saturation although the origins could be verified using isotope chemical tracing techniques not conducted in this study we presume that these opposite fluxes likely resulted from vertical percolation of rainwater and an increase in groundwater which caused the generation of ephemeral and perennial saturation respectively as discussed in the previous section the landslides reported in the rare field observations were mainly induced by perched water from vertical percolation of rainwater anderson and kneale 1980 sidle and swanston 1982 bittelli et al 2012 montgomery et al 2002 indicated that the exfiltrating bedrock fracture flow would be connected to landslide initiation which could explain the wide variability in the occurrence of slope instability in topographically analogous locations unlike the relatively simple pattern of percolated rainwater accumulation subsurface seepage or groundwater may accelerate the timing or increase the extent of a shallow landslide occurrence a claim that has been researched using artificial seepage supplies harp et al 1990 kim et al 2018 although the exfiltration flux from the bedrock may also trigger a shallow landslide this was only discussed by the neighbor sites in previous studies brönnimann et al 2013 masaoka et al 2016 as a rare case montgomery et al 2009 monitored both infiltrating and exfiltrating gradients between colluvium and bedrock by a few piezometers when the middle of the hillslope hollow failed after the report of montgomery et al 2009 this study presents a rare case using extensive tensiometer measurements in which the recorded landslide was triggered by both vertically downward infiltrated water and an upward rise in groundwater these two sources of subsurface saturation interconnected around the soil bedrock interface at the unstable downslope where perennially produced surface runoff had accumulated headwater catchments should be characterized by at least two sources of subsurface saturation which cause a headwater to be most active hydrologically and erosionally among the various slope units tsukamoto and ohta 1988 to accurately predict the location and timing of shallow landslide occurrences in this type of headwater environment future stability analysis models must separately consider the generation processes of different origins of subsurface saturation e g ebel et al 2008 4 3 the influences of subsurface displacement on the landslide subsurface displacements can produce knickpoints or knicklines on surface or bedrock topography producing locations for landslide origination chigira 1992 sasaki et al 2000 in addition to modifying topographic or geological properties subsurface displacement might produce cracks or fissures within soil or bedrock layers that serve as preferential pathways and facilitate percolation krzeminska et al 2014 sidle and bogaard 2016 uhlemann et al 2017 such disturbances to subsurface properties promote hydrologic conditions that contribute to extended and elevated landslide susceptibility mirus et al 2017 in the present study the landslide triggered by the smaller event was also attributable to prior subsurface displacements that changed the responses of subsurface saturation the response of saturation generation was different for each of the four saturation generation frequencies for the events before and after the displacement events fig 10 for the events after the subsurface displacements the maximum saturation amount increased but the increase in saturation amount and runoff declined the tendencies were more obvious at the perennially saturated points data from those points indicated that the storage ability of groundwater increased and the perched water or discharge along the soil bedrock interface declined after the displacement events one possible mechanism for this could be that the subsurface displacements produce fissures or cracks around the soil bedrock interface or within bedrock layers this in turn would cause rainwater to percolate deeply and to recharge the groundwater more rather than temporarily perching or flowing out along the soil bedrock interface thus subsurface displacements would not only weaken the strength of the geological structure but also enlarge the amount of subsurface saturation at perennially saturated points all of which would reduce slope stability and therefore facilitate the occurrence of a landslide 5 conclusion this study presented the dynamics of pore water pressure ψ at the soil bedrock interface during a shallow landslide induced by a typhoon event this is a rare case recording the dynamics of both subsurface unsaturation and saturation with high resolution spatiotemporal data during a shallow landslide occurring in a natural forested headwater the two largest rainfall events in the observation period only caused subsurface displacements whereas a smaller rainfall event triggered a landslide at the downslope of the site the dominant factors triggering the landslide are summarized as follows 1 record high ψ at the soil bedrock interface the landslide occurred with a spatial mean ψ of 17 5 cmh2o and a saturation ratio of 0 89 at the site a record high and positive ψ was also observed at points where subsurface saturation rarely occurred the generation of record high saturation at the soil bedrock interface served as a sliding plane that was the main factor triggering the landslide 2 initially wet conditions the landslide event started in wet conditions with a mean ψ of 7 2 cmh2o and a saturation ratio of 0 47 this explains why the landslide occurred as a result of a smaller event but caused record high ψ in the observation period 3 heterogeneous distribution of subsurface saturation both perennial and ephemeral saturation was observed at the site although the rainfall contributed to nearly equivalent increases in ψ at all measurement points the downslope of the site where subsurface saturation perennially existed was prone to failure 4 influence of previous subsurface displacements the maximum amount of subsurface saturation increased in the event after the subsurface displacements in particular at the perennially saturated points the subsurface displacements not only weakened the strength of the geological structure but also enlarged the amount of perennial saturation all of which served to reduce slope stability and facilitate the landslide the occurrence of the shallow landslide not only depended on rainfall characteristics but was controlled by the responses of subsurface saturation at the sliding plane this study demonstrates that the landslide was triggered by record high subsurface saturation combined with heterogeneous distribution of perennial and ephemeral saturation we suggest that headwater catchments be characterized by at least two sources of subsurface saturation the different generation processes of different origins of subsurface saturation should be considered separately in stability analysis models or disaster warning systems declaration of

one of the most frequent natural disasters worldwide the increase in such a weather event flood is mainly caused by climate change hirabayashi et al 2013 cred and unisdr 2015 floods have a huge potential to damage natural and man made resources huang et al 2008 flood occurrences affect over 20 000 individuals per year worldwide sarhadi et al 2012 more than 90 of property loss and distressed means of livelihood in asia are caused by floods smith 2013 paul et al 2019 this natural disaster results in secondary disasters such as landslides different types of waterborne diseases and soil erosion cao et al 2016 floods occur when river water overtops the banks and inundate the adjacent lands of the river heavy down pouring within a short period is the most common cause of flood casale and margottini 1999 recently frequent flood occurrences have caused the loss of numerous lives and properties and have been aggravated due to anthropogenic intervention into the natural system christensen et al 2003 ahmadisharaf et al 2016 flash floods are the fast inundating of low lying areas in the mountainous regions they are induced either by the massive rainfall within the short period sudden failure of dam and levee or debris flow elkhrachy 2015 although a complete mitigation of flash flood is impossible a flash flood susceptibility map ffsm prepared through appropriate methods is a standard tool useful for the reduction of the detrimental impacts of flash floods and associated risks huang et al 2008 floods are the most devastating natural disaster in iran this phenomenon has caused approximately 1 7 million usd of economic loss in the past decade norouzi and taslimi 2012 the frequency of flood occurrences has increased due to the spatiotemporal alteration of climatic conditions population growth and urbanisation moreover life and property losses caused by floods have increased by 250 in iran norouzi and taslimi 2012 in the last six decades 3 700 flood events have been reported in iran jannati 2019 the northern part of iran is frequently affected by flash floods which cause a considerable loss of properties and human lives the gorgan basin is well known as a highly flood affected basin in iran safaripour et al 2012 as per records more than 120 floods have occurred in this river basin from 1991 to 2019 donya e eqtesad 2019 therefore addressing the problems caused by the flash floods of the watershed and preparing an ffsm using suitable methods are necessary for alerting the local inhabitants flood susceptibility is linked to various factors and the spatial prediction of flood hazards is pursued on the assumption that future floods could occur under similar circumstances that caused past floods youssef et al 2016 thus assessing the spatial association between a set of effective flood conditioning factors fcfs and previous flood occurrences is desirable kalantari et al 2014 applying proper methods with a satisfactorily correct delineation of possible flood prone areas is an important means of future flash flood mitigation bubeck et al 2012 to assess the relationship between previous flood conditions and prepare the ffsm researchers have created several methods soft computing methods have been used in the past decades to create flood susceptibility maps for different areas worldwide considering the different flood

and mentioned this model has high precision for flood susceptibility mapping paul et al 2019 used seven statistical methods and pointed out that the conditional probability and certainty factor have a good capability in preparing flood susceptibility maps for bansloi river basin in eastern india although the ability to predict the flood sensitivity of these methods is great the use of certain ensemble machine learning techniques can also be enhanced hybrid ensemble methods are currently considered being superior methods for hazard mapping because these ensemble methods use machine learning algorithms to enhance their performance pham et al 2016 ensemble approaches have been used recently to solve the problems of classification arabameri et al 2020 these hybrid ensemble approaches can improve the prediction accuracy of a base classifier chen et al 2019 these ensemble methods are rarely used in flash flood hazard susceptibility mapping however these ensembles have been used for landslide hazards pham et al 2017 and groundwater potentiality mapping rahmati et al 2018 after ensembling of these meta classifiers with the multilayer perceptron artificial neural network base classifier the prediction accuracy of the classification has increased pham et al 2017 functional tree ft and rotational forest are new ensemble techniques these techniques have been widely used in financial institutions chen et al 2015 information technology abawajy et al 2014 and medical purposes kelarev et al 2012 substantial research has also worked to improve the performance of predictions

ffs in iran s gorgan basin this research focuses on applying the three novel ensemble algorithms by combining bagging dagging and rotational forest meta classifiers with the functional tree for the flash flood spatial prediction here we tried to prepare new flash flood susceptibility models considering the functional tree as base classifier to categorize classes and ensemble with meta

measuring the relative importance of the effective factors after preparing the flash flood maps the rf model was applied to measure the contribution of effective factors influencing the area s susceptibility to flash floods e validation and comparison of the flash flood hazard susceptibility models the receiver operating characteristic roc curve and seed cell area index scai were used to appraise the performance of ffs models prepared through machine learning ensemble methods using testing dataset 3 2 data preparation 3 2 1 preparing the flood inventory map for the ffsm preparation flood locations were considered dependent variables whereas effective fcfs were selected as independent variables similarly preparing a flood inventory map is essential for the spatial prediction of flash flood probability to produce the flood inventory map we used the reports of the iranian water resources department iwrd from 2001 to 2019 iranian water resources department iwrd 2019 investigative reports on disaster management of the golestan province after collecting the information regarding the flood locations collected from different sources a field survey was conducted in the study area to verify the information regarding the flood locations in the study area a total of 426 flood sites are identified and randomly divided into two data sets i e training 70 and validation 30 datasets fig 1 reports state that the considerable loss of properties and lives is caused by flood occurrences 3 2 2 preparing the effective flood conditioning factors flash flood

environmental condition of the study area pradhan 2010 khosravi et al 2016 haghizadeh et al 2017 mojaddadi et al 2017 after selection of the flood conditioning factors based on the literature and geo environmental conditions of the study area multi collinearity problems were tested profile curvature was excluded from the model because of the multi collinearity problem information on fcfs was collected from different sources to prepare the thematic data layers that are mentioned in the table 2 to assess the relationship between selected effective flood conditioning factors and flood occurrences and their contribution to the susceptibility of these places to flash flood we conducted rf a detailed methodology of the rf model can be found in the work of arabameri et al 2019b the thematic layers of the topographical factors including the slope elevation plane curvature tpi tri twi ci and spi of the study area were prepared using the palsar dem with 12 5 m partial resolution arabameri et al 2019a in an arcgis environment elevation amongst different flood determining factors altitude is one of the most important factors affecting flood occurrences bui et al 2016 the relationship between flood and altitude is reciprocal in nature areas with low altitude is more flood susceptible than areas with higher altitudes khosravi et al 2016 the study area s altitude ranges from 64 m to 3686 m fig 4 a slope the surface slope of a region fig 4b is an important controller of flash flood occurrences given that the steep slopes have the lowest time for rainwater to be infiltrated tehrany et al 2015a plan curvature plan curvature a morphological factor arabameri et al 2018a controls flood susceptibility by controlling the flow of water on the surface of a region lee

flood susceptibility of a watershed tehrany et al 2015 twi is calculated using eq 1 1 twi i n a s tan β where as represents the area of catchment m2 m and β is the slope gradient degrees twi varies from 0 55 to 24 09 fig 4f in this study area terrain ruggedness index tri the terrain ruggedness index tri was introduced by riley et al 1999 it is regarded as the differentiation in the height between the adjacent cells of a digital elevation grid tri also measures the concavity and convexity of land kalantari et al 2017 it is calculated using eq 2 2 tri abs max 2 min 2 in this study max

and the average altitude z around a specific radius r weiss 2001 tpi is calculated using eqs 3 and 4 3 tpi z 0 z 4 z 1 n r i r z i a positive tpi indicates that the central point is located at a higher altitude whereas a negative tpi demonstrates the lower altitude of the central point the tpi value depends on the landscape unit r the small r valley indicates minor valleys and ridges the value of tpi of the study area ranges from 142 59 to 152 29 fig 4d convergence index ci convergence index is an important terrain factor which is composed of a set of channels and ridges relief structures it was introduced by kiss 2004 the convergence index ci is calculated using eq 5 5 ci 1 8 i 1 8 θ i 90 0 where θ represents the average angle between the adjacent cell aspect and the central cell direction the value of ci ranges from 100 to 100 fig 4g stream power index spi spi expresses the erodability of flowing water on the surface moore et al 1991 and it greatly influences the flood occurrences khosravi et al 2018 spi was derived from dem using eq 6 6 spi a s tan β where as is the area contributed by upstream and β is the slope gradient in degrees spi s spatial distribution in the study area varies from 6 27 to 26 35 fig 4h distance to stream euclidean distance buffer tool was applied to extract the stream buffer map in arcgis the adjacent parts of the main river are more vulnerable to flash flooding opperman et al 2009 in the present study the distance from river map fig 4j was prepared using the euclidean distance tool in a gis environment drainage density dd drainage density fig 4i is calculated from dem using the line density tool in arcgis and has strong control over the flood occurrences in a watershed sajedi hosseini et al 2018 poor drainage systems lead to the frequent overflow of water and continuous flooding rainfall the long term average rainfall of the study area was also considered in modelling ffs the kringing interpolation method was applied to prepare a rainfall map fig 4k of the study area in gis environment in a flood occurrence within a region or basin the role of rainwater is vital pradhan 2010 lithology soil the lithology and soil of an area control flood occurrence in a watershed by controlling the runoff and through infiltration khosravi et al 2018 through the digitisation process the lithological and soil maps fig 4l o of the study area were prepared from the available geological map collected from the geological survey of iran 1 100 000 and soil map 1 250000 taken from agricultural and natural resources research center golestan and 10 lithological units were identified the description of each lithology unit is shown in table 1 lund use land cover ndvi landsat 8 oli images were used to prepare the lu lc and ndvi maps fig 4m n in arcgis lu lc bared and concretised that land surfaces increase the overland flow whereas vegetation density and forest reduce overland flow thus lu lc and ndvi influence the flood susceptibility of a region khosravi et al 2016 the lu lc of the study area has been prepared using the maximum livelihood method after collecting the signature from the google earth image for the evaluation of the classification accuracy of the lu lc map 632 ground control points were used the overall accuracy of the lulc map is 97 23 kappa coefficient 0 972 which is well acceptable 3 3 assessing the multicollinearity problem of the factors johnston et al 2018 suggested standard criteria for excluding the collinear factors and selecting the effective factors to model the probability if the factors exhibit variance inflation factors vif value more than 5 and tolerance value 0 1 then these factors indicate a multicollinearity problem saha 2017 johnston et al 2018 sixteen fcfs including elevation slope plan curvature tpi tri twi ci lithology dd distance to stream and rainfall lu lc normalised ndvi and soil type were selected for the spatial prediction of flash flood probability to assess the multicollinearity problem of these selected factors two indices i e tolerance and vif are calculated using eqs 7 and 8 7 tolerance 1 r 2 j vif 1 tolerence 8 where r2j is the regression coefficient of determination of independent variable j 3 4 description of models 3 4 1 application of ft classifier various algorithms of decision tree including ft classifier classification and regression trees chi square automatic interaction detector decision trees c4 5 or j48 alternating decision tree adtree rf and logistic model trees lmtree are widely used for mapping landslide susceptibility and groundwater potentiality mapping bui et al 2016 chen et al 2019 choubin et al 2018 in the ft in tree leaves or internal nodes the combinations of variables are used a training dataset d with n number of samples is considered xi yi and x i r n y i 1 0 xi is an input independent variable composed of 15 fcfs elevation slope convergence index topographic wetness index topographic position index topographic ruggedness index stream power index sediment transportation index rainfall lithology soil type lu lc ndvi dd and distance to stream yi is the output of classes such as flood and non flood ft s goal is to build a decision tree that splits the target variable from the mentioned training data set into two classes the main advantages of ft are stated as follows it uses the functions of logistic regression to isolate the internal nodes known as oblique split and predict at the leaves witten et al 2011 by contrast classification tree nodes are being implemented by simply contrasting the values of certain input attributes to a constant the ft technique has three essential parts 1 for internal nodes and leaves the regression model rm is used in ft 2 for the inner nodes inner ft uses the rms 3 for only leaves ft leaves use rm in this analysis ft leaves were utilised ft also used 1 the gain ratio as the criterion for separation to choose the input attribute to separate on 2 c4 5 pruning to stop over fitting problem and 3 the logit boost iterative reweighting to match the leaves with the least squares according to the logistic regression functions quinlan 1996 doetsch et al 2009 for each class yi eq 3 9 f y i x i 1 10 β i x i β 0 where p x is the predicted value of probability and βi is i th component s coefficient in the input vector

is one of the ensembles machine learning method bagging is used to obtain accurate and appropriate flash flood susceptibility mapping this ensemble is selected given that a small change in the training data reflects and increases the prediction capability chen et al 2019 bui et al 2016 bagging comprises three steps 1 random selection of bootstrap samples from the training dataset to come up with a set of training subsets 2 preparation of multiple classifier models based on the subset datasets and 3 production of the final model by aggregating all the classifier models bui et al 2016 let a learning set of t comprise data t xn yn n 1 2 n where y is the class labels in this study xn is the flood conditioning parameters and yn is the flood locations and non flood locations non flood locations are manually selected with the same number of the flood locations where there is no possibility for the existence of flood here assume that a producer for training the learning set from a predictor h x t is available then assume that an order of learning sets ti exists each containing n independent observations with the same original distribution as t the purpose is to practice ti to obtain a better predictor than the single learning set of predictors h x t the bagging type hybrid ensemble method improves the results of each set of classifiers by summing them to the original feature system for bagging the categorization procedure approximately one third of the examples in the initial training system are not caught up in all bootstrap trials breiman breiman 1996 considered these examples as out of bag samples 3 4 3 rotational forest rtf rotation forest rtf is an ensemble system initially proposed to be categorised rodriguez et al 2006 and developed with independent decision trees rodriguez 2007 the individual tree is organised in rtf with a comprehensive dataset associated with a rotated space of a feature in this study s s 1 s 2 s n is the vector of fcfs y y 1 y 2 is the flood and non flood categories of a target variable d represents the training data f 1 f 2 f n are classified in the ensemble arrangement t defines a set of fcfs t is separated into different k subclasses the number of parameters that belong to a subset can be determined as t n k for the fi classifier tij should be the jth given that j 1 2 k is a subset of contributing parameters the number of contributing parameters can be determined eij shows fcfs in tij from e through the bootstrap method e ij is elected randomly from eij e ij should be transformed at this time to achieve the constants of r i 1 1 r i 1 2 r i 1 t 1 where the r i 1 size is t 1 ensemble rf is then created in relation to the rotation matrix produced by the basic method of classification and transformation r i α is the rotation matrix obtained through the reorganisation of the ri matrix that can be defined as eq 5 11 r i r i 1 1 r i 1 2 r i 1 s 1 0 0 0 r i 1 1 r i 1 2 r i 1 s 2 0 0 0 0 r i 1 1 r i 1 2 r i 1 s k moreover through the average combination technique as in eq 6 a sparse rotation matrix called ri is ordered by the obtained coefficients that are built for each individual class 12 ξ k ε 1 n i 1 n α i k α r i α k 1 2 c where α i k α r i α illustrates the produced probability by the ci classifier to the hypothesis in which ε capacitates the k class lastly ε is due to the largest confidence group 3 4 4 dagging dagging was proposed by ting and witten in 1997 dagging is used for numerous disjoint samples as a substitute for bootstrap samples to obtain the base classifiers ting and witten 1997 dagging creates a number of disjoint stratified folds out of the data and feeds each chunk of data to a copy of the supplied base learner it is a re sampling ensemble method to combine various classifiers to obtain an improved predictive accuracy of base classifiers depending on the majority vote since all the generated base classifiers are put into the vote meta classifier it is useful for base classifiers that are quadratic or worse in time behaviour regarding a number of instances in the training data govindarajan 2016 3 5 validating techniques the roc curve is a graphical plot revealing the diagnostic capacity of a binary classifier model as its threshold for discrimination differs egan 1975 roc is prepared by plotting the true positive value tp against the false positive rate fp at different thresholds the true positive rate tpr is defined as the sensitivity whereas false positive rate fpr is expressed with specificity or fall out or probability of false alarm in this study the training and validation datasets of flood inventory were used for the roc curve to chalk out the relationship between the positive and negative observations of the model s significance and appropriation in the validation sample a high tpr or sensitivity reflects the accuracy and significance of the models by contrast a high false positive rate fpr or specificity reflects the negative or error predictions of models in the area under curve auc the false positive rate specificity is shown in the x axis whereas fpr sensitivity is shown in the y axis where tn true negative fp false positive tp true positive and fn false negative the quantitative qualitative relationships between auc and predictive precision which range from 0 to 1 are as follows 0 9 1 excellent 0 8 0 9 very good 0 7 0 8 good 0 6 0 7 moderate and 0 5 0 6 weak yesilnacar and topal 2005 the roc curve was utilised for the accuracy measurement of different models including landslide susceptibility mapping soil and gully erosion susceptibility mapping and groundwater potentiality mapping roy and saha 2019 chen et al 2018 rahmati et al 2018 among these validation techniques higher value of efficiency e true

to assess the robustness of the models equations used for calculating these evaluation matrices have been mentioned in table 3 scai is an important validation method ilinca and gheuca 2011 which is commonly applied to evaluate the correctness of ffs models for an excellent model the scai value should be high for very high susceptibility class and low for low susceptibility class arabameri et al 2019a the reverse distribution of scai values indicates the negative prediction and error judgment of a model 4 result 4 1 assessing the multicollinearity of effective factors in consideration of tolerance and vif the multicollinearity problem of the effective factors was tested the highest tolerance value depicts the lowest vif in this study highest tolerance and lowest vif values were found in the case of slope and lu lc table 4 the profile curvature was excluded from the model given that the value of vif is greater than 10 except for the profile curvature other effective flash flood conditioning factors had no multicollinearity problem 4 2 flash flood susceptibility models the flood and non flood points containing the values of flash flood conditioning factors fcfs were used as input datasets in r program to build up flash flood susceptibility ffs models the rt tree islr iprad and cran packages were utilised to perform the functional tree ft bagging dagging rf and random forest models the susceptibility values generated by ft bagging functional tree bft dagging functional tree dft and rotational forest functional tree rft were used to build ffs maps in a gis environment fig 5 a 5d respectively ffs maps are classified into five categories very low low medium high and very high ffs classes based on the natural break classification method the ffs map produced by ft showed that the areas covered by the very high and high ffs zones were 1 66 and 3 57 of the basin respectively the moderate low and very low ffs zones accounted for 6 73 16 01 and 72 03 of the study area respectively fig 6 the dft ensemble model produced ffs values ranging from 0 to 1 this model showed that 9 73 and 11 91 of the gorgan basin have very high and high flash flood susceptibility the very low low and moderate ffs zones accounted for 14 61 21 97 and 41 78 of the study area respectively fig 6 the bft machine learning ensemble model classified the basin into very high 1 99 high 5 41 moderate 1 47 low 15 29 and very low 76 14 ffs zones fig 6 ffs values generated by the rft model ranging from 0 to 1 delineated 1 33 and 7 60 of the gorgan basin as very high and high ffs zones fig 6 the moderate low and very low ffs zones covered 11 63 29 74 and 49 70 of the basin respectively evidently the south western part of the basin exhibited a high potential for flash flood occurrences compared with the rest of the basin 4 3 predicting capability of flood conditioning factors by rf the rf model which was implemented by breiman 2001 by compiling the algorithms of a decision tree chen and liu 2005 zang et al 2017 is useful for predicting data and identifying the individual predisposing factors contributions to the prediction in the present study the rf model was used to assess the contribution of individual effective flood conditioning factors in the area s susceptibility to flash floods the confusion matrix for the rf model is shown in table 5 in this case the confusion matrix reflected binary values such as 0 and 1 wherein 0 indicates flood absence and 1 indicates flood presence the rf model with an out of bag error rate 9 21 was applied in r using the caret package this scenario implies that the accuracy of the model is equal to 90 79 table 5 exhibits the results of the confusion matrix according to results from 212 non flood locations observed 143 67 45 are predicted as non flood erosion and 39 18 39 are predicted as flood from 191 observed flood locations 15 7 85 are predicted as non flood and 176 92 14 are predicted as flood moreover fig 7

comparison the flash flood susceptibility ffs maps by functional tree ft bagging functional tree bft dagging functional tree dft and rotational forest functional tree rft were justified by the receiver operating characteristics roc curve and seed cell area index scai figs 8 and 9 to validate the ffs maps using roc we used the training and validation datasets based on the training datasets the area under curve auc values of ft dagging functional tree bagging functional tree and rotational forest functional tree were 0 888 0 933 0 924 and 0 926 respectively table 7 the efficiency e

functional tree and rft models were 0 68 0 71 0 72 and 0 69 respectively moreover auc roc efficiency and tss criteria indicated a good conformity between the trained models and actuality the validation datasets were used to assess the predictability of the four models in the validation dataset context the auc values of the functional tree dagging functional tree bagging functional tree and rotational forest functional tree models were 0 855 0 936 0 959 and 0 945 respectively table 7 this finding represented a very good to excellent predictability of these models according to the roc

ffs maps by the functional tree dagging functional tree bagging functional tree and rft models the scai values of the ffs maps prepared through the functional tree dagging functional tree bft and rft models decreased from very low to very high ffs classes this finding indicated an improved performance of the models in terms of ffs mapping the scai and roc methods have good capability to judge the performance of the models used for flood susceptibility determination according to the correctness assessment results the rft and bft models showed outstanding predictive ability moreover the functional tree and dagging functional tree models could predict the ffs of an area well 5 discussion flood a critical geomorphological hazard is one of the major concerns of applied research flood can take away and destroy human lives and numerous properties and weaken the financial capability of a region given the impact of large floods restoration and rehabilitation are costly and can interrupt sustainable development keesstra et al 2018 thus ffs mapping is crucial it is a vital and efficient tool which can help prevent and control future flood occurrences wuet al 2010 although various methods and techniques have been developed and executed around the world for spatial forecasting of natural hazards the goals of all these methods are the same preparing a rational and accurate susceptibility map of natural hazards is a controversial issue amongst environmental researchers recently machine learning techniques have attracted considerable attention from the scientific community on environmental modelling because these techniques are useful in effectively describing the complex relationship between environmental predictors and responses such as flood tien bui et al 2019 wildfire jaafari et al 2019 gully erosion gayen et al 2019 landslide nguyen et al 2019 sinkhole taheri et al 2019 and drought roodposhti et al 2017 considerable research has also attempted to improve the prediction performance and interpretability of machine learning models by applying different ensembles hybrid algorithms thus this work aims to introduce a new hybrid artificial intelligence for ffs mapping in the gorgan basin of iran this study focuses on implementing the three novel ensemble algorithms by integrating bagging dagging and rf meta classifiers with the ft base classifier for flash flood spatial prediction fifteen fcfs elevation slope plan curvature tpi tri twi ci spi dd distance to stream rainfall lithology lu lc ndvi and soil type are selected to be used in the modelling process and in the evaluation of the goodness of fit and performance of the ensemble models however the profile curvature has a multicollinearity problem according to the multicollinearity technique thus this factor is excluded from the models whereas the other factors are effective and used in the final process based on a random forest model elevation distance to stream normalized differential vegetation index slope land use land cover lu lc rainfall drainage density and topographical positioning index twi contribute markedly to flash flood susceptibility zou et al 2013 youssef et al 2016 hosseini et al 2019 elevation slope and distance to stream have key roles amongst the effective factors used in modelling ffs naturally the areas with low elevations and slopes and those close to streams have a high probability of flood events botzen et al 2012 choubin et al 2019 ndvi and lu lc are the most effective factors in runoff and infiltration generation csáfordi et al 2012 similarly surface runoff generation rainfall and twi characteristics are important nampak et al 2014 drainage density is correlated with lithology and topographical factors such as slope and elevation which may show high runoff and low infiltration rate at their higher values prasad and sangita 2008 and control the flood condition of the region the most interesting finding was that the bft auc of src 0 933 auc of prc 0 959 e 0 76 and tss 0 72 was identified as the best model in terms of both goodness of fit and robustness for predicting flash flood susceptibility in this scenario bagging increases the consistency of the ft base classifier model by utilizing the rbf kernel feature bagging is an important tool to boost a single classifier s prediction accuracy by using variance and bias reduction in the creation of an ensemble learning classifier bootstrap sampling could reduce the sensitivity of a single classifier to noise in a data set resulting in a corresponding decrease in the variance of the classification model breiman 1996 moreover the ft base classifier is an interpretable and reliable algorithm against noise and it greatly improves the classification error hong et al 2017 ft has a measure of confidence that is regarded as the classification margin in relation to a classification system hong et al 2017 another important finding is that the meta classifiers bagging dagging and rf have strengthened the goodness of fit and increased the predictive accuracy of base classifiers ft our results are rational as the ensemble classifiers minimise bias variance and over fitting issues in ffs modelling to improve base classifier efficiency hong et al 2018 furthermore the application of ft dft and rft models for predicting flash flood susceptibility has been successfully demonstrated in the case of dft and rft models theirefficiencieshave been tested successfully in other fields of geospatial modeling such as susceptibility to landslides and are compatible with the results of this research pham et al 2017 this study corroborates the works of chen et al 2018 hong et al 2017 2018 jebur et al 2014 pham et al 2017 which showed that hybrid ensemble models result in better accuracy than single models the findings of the current research have also demonstrated that the bft model has provided consistent results in terms of precision and robustness considering the natural break method flash flood susceptibility maps of the study area were classified into five susceptibility classes such as very low low moderate and very high the flash flood susceptibility maps produced by the ft dft bft and rft showed that 1 66 9 73 1 99 and 1 33 respectively are very highly susceptible for the flash flood avoiding or solving the problem of over fitting is difficult several reasons are stated as follows firstly the non flooded area is selected in the case of this study to be the same as the flooded area although the actual non flooded area is larger than the flooded area secondly the training and testing datasets are defined by the sampling ratio of 70 30 without performing a sampling ratio accuracy test thirdly despite the multicollinearity test noise is still included in the flash flood conditioning factors fcfs used in this study a major advantage of the machine learning algorithms applied in this study is that they automate the process of investigating multiple databases to gather important information these algorithms can account for unique assumptions that can be used to help to plan decisions along with the automatic analysis of large datasets however several drawbacks of such machine learning algorithms are also observed for example before being used as an input into the chosen algorithm data should be processed given that the processing technique can have a huge effect on the outcome in addition preparing data before classification using machine learning algorithms is time consuming the following should be conducted in future studies to enhance ffs accuracy 1 effective analysis of the flooded to non flooded area ratio 2 evaluation of the training and validation dataset sampling ratio 3 consideration of the differences between different methods of feature selection and 4 model performance analysis using additional ensemble approaches 6 conclusion at present ffsm is widely used as a tool for managing flood hazards in this study four machine learning hybrid ensemble techniques ft bft dft and rft were effectively used to assess ffs in consideration of the 15 flash flood

techniques used for ffs modelling in this basin performed well the predicting capability of the bft is the best amongst the models the random forest model showed that elevation distance to stream and ndvi play major roles in making the area susceptible to flash floods the present study shows that the machine learning ensemble models used for ffs modelling have promising accuracy furthermore the findings of this work could be helpful for flood management in order to deal with the existing uncertain situation and know diverse aspects which influence ffs with more accuracy in addition as a suggestion for future research this methodology could be applied to analyze vulnerability of flood hazard to climate change i e as a regional resource management tool in order to enhance accuracy and reduce the uncertainties in the models hybrid modelling can be recommended which decreases some problems in classification models such as over fitting these models may be applied for ffs evaluation in

5446,the present research aims to assess and judge the capability of flash flood susceptibility ffs models considering hybrid machine learning ensemble techniques for the ffs assessment in the gorgan basin in iran three novel intelligence approaches namely bagging functional tree bft dagging functional tree and rotational forest functional tree are used for modelling with consideration to 15 flood conditioning factors fcfs as independent variables and 426 flood locations as dependent variables three threshold dependent and independent approaches are used to evaluate the goodness of fit and prediction capability of the ensemble models with a single functional tree ft these approaches include the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the success rate curve src and prediction rate curve prc efficiency e and true skill statistics tss the random forest model is used to determine the relative importance of fcfs elevation stream distance and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi have crucial roles in the study area during flash flood occurrences according to the results of all threshold dependent and independent approaches auc of src 0 933 auc of prc 0 959 e 0 76 and tss 0 72 the bft ensemble model has the greatest accuracy in terms of modelling ffs results also show that the performance of the ft model is enhanced by three meta classifiers the seed cell area index technique is also used to check model classification accuracy and reliability results of this technique show that all the models demonstrate good performance and reliability however the ffs maps prepared by machine learning ensemble techniques have excellent accuracy and reliability as per the results of validation methods thus these ffs maps can be used as a convenient tool to

one of the most frequent natural disasters worldwide the increase in such a weather event flood is mainly caused by climate change hirabayashi et al 2013 cred and unisdr 2015 floods have a huge potential to damage natural and man made resources huang et al 2008 flood occurrences affect over 20 000 individuals per year worldwide sarhadi et al 2012 more than 90 of property loss and distressed means of livelihood in asia are caused by floods smith 2013 paul et al 2019 this natural disaster results in secondary disasters such as landslides different types of waterborne diseases and soil erosion cao et al 2016 floods occur when river water overtops the banks and inundate the adjacent lands of the river heavy down pouring within a short period is the most common cause of flood casale and margottini 1999 recently frequent flood occurrences have caused the loss of numerous lives and properties and have been aggravated due to anthropogenic intervention into the natural system christensen et al 2003 ahmadisharaf et al 2016 flash floods are the fast inundating of low lying areas in the mountainous regions they are induced either by the massive rainfall within the short period sudden failure of dam and levee or debris flow elkhrachy 2015 although a complete mitigation of flash flood is impossible a flash flood susceptibility map ffsm prepared through appropriate methods is a standard tool useful for the reduction of the detrimental impacts of flash floods and associated risks huang et al 2008 floods are the most devastating natural disaster in iran this phenomenon has caused approximately 1 7 million usd of economic loss in the past decade norouzi and taslimi 2012 the frequency of flood occurrences has increased due to the spatiotemporal alteration of climatic conditions population growth and urbanisation moreover life and property losses caused by floods have increased by 250 in iran norouzi and taslimi 2012 in the last six decades 3 700 flood events have been reported in iran jannati 2019 the northern part of iran is frequently affected by flash floods which cause a considerable loss of properties and human lives the gorgan basin is well known as a highly flood affected basin in iran safaripour et al 2012 as per records more than 120 floods have occurred in this river basin from 1991 to 2019 donya e eqtesad 2019 therefore addressing the problems caused by the flash floods of the watershed and preparing an ffsm using suitable methods are necessary for alerting the local inhabitants flood susceptibility is linked to various factors and the spatial prediction of flood hazards is pursued on the assumption that future floods could occur under similar circumstances that caused past floods youssef et al 2016 thus assessing the spatial association between a set of effective flood conditioning factors fcfs and previous flood occurrences is desirable kalantari et al 2014 applying proper methods with a satisfactorily correct delineation of possible flood prone areas is an important means of future flash flood mitigation bubeck et al 2012 to assess the relationship between previous flood conditions and prepare the ffsm researchers have created several methods soft computing methods have been used in the past decades to create flood susceptibility maps for different areas worldwide considering the different flood conditioning factors such methods include logistic regression nampak et al 2014 neuro fuzzy inference systems tien bui et al 2016 decision trees support vector machines tehrany et al 2015a evidential belief function arabameri et al 2019b artificial neural networks radmehr and araghinejad 2014 analytical hierarchy process and fuzzy logic zou et al 2013 frequency ratio paul et al 2019 conditional

al 2019b nampak et al 2014 were pointed out that logistic regression model has enough ability for mapping the flood susceptibility tien bui et al 2016 in his work used neuro fuzzy inference systems and mentioned this model has high precision for flood susceptibility mapping paul et al 2019 used seven statistical methods and pointed out that the conditional probability and certainty factor have a good capability in preparing flood susceptibility maps for bansloi river basin in eastern india although the ability to predict the flood sensitivity of these methods is great the use of certain ensemble machine learning techniques can also be enhanced hybrid ensemble methods are currently considered being superior methods for hazard mapping because these ensemble methods use machine learning algorithms to enhance their performance pham et al 2016 ensemble approaches have been used recently to solve the problems of classification arabameri et al 2020 these hybrid ensemble approaches can improve the prediction accuracy of a base classifier chen et al 2019 these ensemble methods are rarely used in flash flood hazard susceptibility mapping however these ensembles have been used for landslide hazards pham et al 2017 and groundwater potentiality mapping rahmati et al 2018 after ensembling of these meta classifiers with the multilayer perceptron artificial neural network base classifier the prediction accuracy of the classification has increased pham et al 2017 functional tree ft and rotational forest are new ensemble techniques these techniques have been widely used in financial institutions chen et al 2015 information technology abawajy et al 2014 and medical purposes kelarev et al 2012 substantial research has also worked to improve the performance of predictions and interpretability of machine learning models by introducing different ensembles hybrid algorithms arabameri et al 2018b in this work we introduced a new hybrid artificial intelligence for mapping ffs in iran s gorgan basin this research focuses on applying the three novel ensemble algorithms by combining bagging dagging and rotational forest meta classifiers with the functional tree for the flash flood spatial prediction here we tried to prepare new flash flood susceptibility models considering the functional tree as base classifier to categorize classes and ensemble with meta classifiers i e bagging dagging and rotational tree the current study is the first to explore the proposed ensemble models for flood modelling moreover random forest rf is used to evaluate the role of individual flash flood conditioning factors the assessment of flood data and model study of the gorgan basin of northern iran is performed using weka arcgis and r software 2 study area gorgan basin is the most flood prone watershed of northern iran it stretches from 36 25 to 38 15 n latitudes and 56 26 to 54 10 e longitudes and covers an area of 11 290 km2 this river basin fig 1 is located in the golestan province it runs from the eastern alborz mountains into the caspian sea this river basin belongs to semiarid semi humid humid and mediterranean climate with an approximate mean temperature of 17 8 c and mean annual rainfall of 500 mm irimo 2012 the regional slope of the basin stretches from the southeast to the western areas the study area s elevation ranges from 96 m asl to 3669 m asl cenozoic mesozoic paleozoic and proterozoic are the four lithological formations table 1 that have been identified by the national cartographic center and geographical survey of iran gsi 1997 in the last decade this river basin has faced some large floods on 11 august 2001 more than 500 people died due to a flood event which is the largest flood occurrence in this basin jannati 2019 on 17 march 2019 most cities including aqqala fig 2 and gomishan a minimum of 70 villages 12 000 houses infrastructures gardens and agricultural lands have been damaged donya e eqtesad 2019 thus the inhabitants point of view is important to obtain relief from these flood occurrences to some extent accordingly the preparation of ffsm through precise methods is crucial to reduce the damage intensity of these flood occurrences 3 material and methods 3 1 methodology the preparation of flash flood hazard susceptibility models that apply the novel hybrid machine learning ensemble techniques ft bagging ft dagging ft and rotational forest ft was performed in five major steps fig 3 ensemble models of functional tree and all the selected hybrid machine learning meta classifiers i e bagging dagging and rotational tree have been prepared for the preparation of these ensemble models the ft was selected as the base classifier of all these meta classifiers a collection of data and preparation of thematic data layers two types of data were collected for ffs prediction i e past flood locations dependent factor and flash flood conditioning factors independent factors fcfs elevation slope plan curvature topography position index tpi terrain ruggedness index tri topography wetness index twi convergence index ci stream power index spi drainage density dd distance to stream rainfall lithology land use land cover lu lc normalized differential vegetation index ndvi and soil type were considered for flash flood susceptibility model ffsm subsequently thematic data layers were created and sampled to prepare datasets training and testing for model construction and authentication b testing of the multicollinearity problem of the effective flood conditioning factors in this study after selecting the effective factors the multicollinearity problem was tested to exclude noise factors c preparation flash flood hazard susceptibility maps in consideration of the training dataset ensemble models were used for an improved management of the input data to construct ffs models then the base classifier of ft was applied on optimised input data to classify the classes for spatial ffsm d measuring the relative importance of the effective factors after preparing the flash flood maps the rf model was applied to measure the contribution of effective factors influencing the area s susceptibility to flash floods e validation and comparison of the flash flood hazard susceptibility models the receiver operating characteristic roc curve and seed cell area index scai were used to appraise the performance of ffs models prepared through machine learning ensemble methods using testing dataset 3 2 data preparation 3 2 1 preparing the flood inventory map for the ffsm preparation flood locations were considered dependent variables whereas effective fcfs were selected as independent variables similarly preparing a flood inventory map is essential for the spatial prediction of flash flood probability to produce the flood inventory map we used the reports of the iranian water resources department iwrd from 2001 to 2019 iranian water resources department iwrd 2019 investigative reports on disaster management of the golestan province after collecting the information regarding the flood locations collected from different sources a field survey was conducted in the study area to verify the information regarding the flood locations in the study area a total of 426 flood sites are identified and randomly divided into two data sets i e training 70 and validation 30 datasets fig 1 reports state that the considerable loss of properties and lives is caused by flood occurrences 3 2 2 preparing the effective flood conditioning factors flash flood occurrences are affected by various factors pradhan 2010 however no essential criteria exist for the selection of effective fcfs to produce ffsm fifteen effective flash flood conditioning factors i e elevation slope plan curvature profile curvature tpi tri twi ci spi dd distance to stream rainfall lithology lu lc ndvi and soil type were selected on the basis of previous literature and the geo environmental condition of the study area pradhan 2010 khosravi et al 2016 haghizadeh et al 2017 mojaddadi et al 2017 after selection of the flood conditioning factors based on the literature and geo environmental conditions of the study area multi collinearity problems were tested profile curvature was excluded from the model because of the multi collinearity problem information on fcfs was collected from different sources to prepare the thematic data layers that are mentioned in the table 2 to assess the relationship between selected effective flood conditioning factors and flood occurrences and their contribution to the susceptibility of these places to flash flood we conducted rf a detailed methodology of the rf model can be found in the work of arabameri et al 2019b the thematic layers of the topographical factors including the slope elevation plane curvature tpi tri twi ci and spi of the study area were prepared using the palsar dem with 12 5 m partial resolution arabameri et al 2019a in an arcgis environment elevation amongst different flood determining factors altitude is one of the most important factors affecting flood occurrences bui et al 2016 the relationship between flood and altitude is reciprocal in nature areas with low altitude is more flood susceptible than areas with higher altitudes khosravi et al 2016 the study area s altitude ranges from 64 m to 3686 m fig 4 a slope the surface slope of a region fig 4b is an important controller of flash flood occurrences given that the steep slopes have the lowest time for rainwater to be infiltrated tehrany et al 2015a plan curvature plan curvature a morphological factor arabameri et al 2018a controls flood susceptibility by controlling the flow of water on the surface of a region lee

from 0 55 to 24 09 fig 4f in this study area terrain ruggedness index tri the terrain ruggedness index tri was introduced by riley et al 1999 it is regarded as the differentiation in the height between the adjacent cells of a digital elevation grid tri also measures the concavity and convexity of land kalantari et al 2017 it is calculated using eq 2 2 tri abs max 2 min 2 in this study max and min are neighbouring cells abs largest and smallest values the tri index has some specific altitudinal ranges which indicate topographic characteristics i e level terrain 0 80 m nearly level 81 116 m slightly rugged 117 161 m intermediate rugged 162 239 m moderately rugged 240 497 m highly rugged 498 958 m and extremely rugged 959 4367 m surfaces the tri value of the study area ranges from 0 m to 136 m indicating a slightly rugged topographic region fig 4e topographic position index tpi topographic position index tpi is defined as the altitudinal difference between the central point z0 and the average altitude z around a specific radius r weiss 2001 tpi is calculated using eqs 3 and 4 3 tpi z 0 z 4 z 1 n r i r z i a positive tpi indicates that the central point is located at a higher altitude whereas a negative tpi demonstrates the lower altitude of the central point the tpi value depends on the landscape unit r the small r valley indicates minor valleys and ridges the value of tpi of the study area ranges from 142 59 to 152 29 fig 4d convergence index ci convergence index is an important terrain factor which is composed of a set of channels and ridges relief structures it was introduced by kiss 2004 the convergence index ci is calculated using eq 5 5 ci 1 8 i 1 8 θ i 90 0 where θ represents the average angle between the adjacent cell aspect and the central cell direction the value of ci ranges from 100 to 100 fig 4g stream power index spi spi expresses the erodability of flowing water on the surface moore et al 1991 and it greatly influences the flood occurrences khosravi et al 2018 spi was derived from dem using eq 6 6 spi a s tan β where as is the area contributed by upstream and β is the slope gradient in degrees spi s spatial distribution in the study area varies from 6 27 to 26 35 fig 4h distance to stream euclidean distance buffer tool was applied to extract the stream buffer map in arcgis the adjacent parts of the main river are more vulnerable to flash flooding opperman et al 2009 in the present study the distance from river map fig 4j was prepared using the euclidean distance tool in a gis environment drainage density dd drainage density fig 4i is calculated from dem using the line density tool in arcgis and has strong control over the flood occurrences in a watershed sajedi hosseini et al 2018 poor drainage systems lead to the frequent overflow of water and continuous flooding rainfall the long term average rainfall of the study area was also considered in modelling ffs the kringing interpolation method was applied to prepare a rainfall map fig 4k of the study area in gis environment in a flood occurrence within a region or basin the role of rainwater is vital pradhan 2010 lithology soil the lithology and soil of an area control flood occurrence in a watershed by controlling the runoff and through infiltration khosravi et al 2018 through the digitisation process the lithological and soil maps fig 4l o of the study area were prepared from the available geological map collected from the geological survey of iran 1 100 000 and soil map 1 250000 taken from agricultural and natural resources research center golestan and 10 lithological units were identified the description of each lithology unit is shown in table 1 lund use land cover ndvi landsat 8 oli images were used to prepare the lu lc and ndvi maps fig 4m n in arcgis lu lc bared and concretised that land surfaces increase the overland flow whereas vegetation density and forest reduce overland flow thus lu lc and ndvi influence the flood susceptibility of a region khosravi et al 2016 the lu lc of the study area has been prepared using the maximum livelihood method after collecting the signature from the google earth image for the evaluation of the classification accuracy of the lu lc map 632 ground control points were used the overall accuracy of the lulc map is 97 23 kappa coefficient 0 972 which is well acceptable 3 3 assessing the multicollinearity problem of the factors johnston et al 2018 suggested standard criteria for excluding the collinear factors and selecting the effective factors to model the probability if the factors exhibit variance inflation factors vif value more than 5 and tolerance value 0 1 then these factors indicate a multicollinearity problem saha 2017 johnston et al 2018 sixteen fcfs including elevation slope plan curvature tpi tri twi ci lithology dd distance to stream and rainfall lu lc normalised ndvi and soil type were selected for the spatial prediction of flash flood probability to assess the multicollinearity problem of these selected factors two indices i e tolerance and vif are calculated using eqs 7 and 8 7 tolerance 1 r 2 j vif 1 tolerence 8 where r2j is the regression coefficient of determination of independent variable j 3 4 description of models 3 4 1 application of ft classifier various algorithms of decision tree including ft classifier classification and regression trees chi square automatic interaction detector decision trees c4 5 or j48 alternating decision tree adtree rf and logistic model trees lmtree are widely used for mapping landslide susceptibility and groundwater potentiality mapping bui et al 2016 chen et al 2019 choubin et al 2018 in the ft in tree leaves or internal nodes the combinations of variables are used a training dataset d with n number of samples is considered xi yi and x i r n y i 1 0 xi is an input independent variable composed of 15 fcfs elevation slope convergence index topographic wetness index topographic position index topographic ruggedness index stream power index sediment transportation index rainfall lithology soil type lu lc ndvi dd and distance to stream yi is the output of classes such as flood and non flood ft s goal is to build a decision tree that splits the target variable from the mentioned training data set into two classes the main advantages of ft are stated as follows it uses the functions of logistic regression to isolate the internal nodes known as oblique split and predict at the leaves witten et al 2011 by contrast classification tree nodes are being implemented by simply contrasting the values of certain input attributes to a constant the ft technique has three essential parts 1 for internal nodes and leaves the regression model rm is used in ft 2 for the inner nodes inner ft uses the rms 3 for only leaves ft leaves use rm in this analysis ft leaves were utilised ft also used 1 the gain ratio as the criterion for separation to choose the input attribute to separate on 2 c4 5 pruning to stop over fitting problem and 3 the logit boost iterative reweighting to match the leaves with the least squares according to the logistic regression functions quinlan 1996 doetsch et al 2009 for each class yi eq 3 9 f y i x i 1 10 β i x i β 0 where p x is the predicted value of probability and βi is i th component s coefficient in the input vector xi the leave s posterior probabilities p x are calculated using eq 4 landwehr et al 2005 10 p x e 2 f y i x 1 e 2 f y i x 3 4 2 bagging developed by breiman 1996 bagging uses bootstrap aggregation and is one of the ensembles machine learning method bagging is used to obtain accurate and appropriate flash flood susceptibility mapping this ensemble is selected given that a small change in the training data reflects and increases the prediction capability chen et al 2019 bui et al 2016 bagging comprises three steps 1 random selection of bootstrap samples from the training dataset to come up with a set of training subsets 2 preparation of multiple classifier models based on the subset datasets and 3 production of the final model by aggregating all the classifier models bui et al 2016 let a learning set of t comprise data t xn yn n 1 2 n where y is the class labels in this study xn is the flood conditioning parameters and yn is the flood locations and non flood locations non flood locations are manually selected with the same number of the flood locations where there is no possibility for the existence of flood here assume that a producer for training the learning set from a predictor h x t is available then assume that an order of learning sets ti exists each containing n independent observations with the same original distribution as t the purpose is to practice ti to obtain a better predictor than the single learning set of predictors h x t the bagging type hybrid ensemble method improves the results of each set of classifiers by summing them to the original feature system for bagging the categorization procedure approximately one third of the examples in the initial training system are not caught up in all bootstrap trials breiman breiman 1996 considered these examples as out of bag samples 3 4 3 rotational forest rtf rotation forest rtf is an ensemble system initially proposed to be categorised rodriguez et al 2006 and developed with independent decision trees rodriguez 2007 the individual tree is organised in rtf with a comprehensive dataset associated with a rotated space of a feature in this study s s 1 s 2 s n is the vector of fcfs y y 1 y 2 is the flood and non flood categories of a target variable d represents the training data f 1 f 2 f n are classified in the ensemble arrangement t defines a set of fcfs t is separated into different k subclasses the number of parameters that belong to a subset can be determined as t n k for the fi classifier tij should be the jth given that j 1 2 k is a subset of contributing parameters the number of contributing parameters can be determined eij shows fcfs in tij from e through the bootstrap method e ij is elected randomly from eij e ij should be transformed at this time to achieve the constants of r i 1 1 r i 1 2 r i 1 t 1 where the r i 1 size is t 1 ensemble rf is then created in relation to the rotation matrix produced by the basic method of classification and transformation r i α is the rotation matrix obtained through the reorganisation of the ri matrix that can be defined as eq 5 11 r i r i 1 1 r i 1 2 r i 1 s 1 0 0 0 r i 1 1 r i 1 2 r i 1 s 2 0 0 0 0 r i 1 1 r i 1 2 r i 1 s k moreover through the average combination technique as in eq 6 a sparse rotation matrix called ri is ordered by the obtained coefficients that are built for each individual class 12 ξ k ε 1 n i 1 n α i k α r i α k 1 2 c where α i k α r i α illustrates the produced probability by the ci classifier to the hypothesis in which ε capacitates the k class lastly ε is due to the largest confidence group 3 4 4 dagging dagging was proposed by ting and witten in 1997 dagging is used for numerous disjoint samples as a substitute for bootstrap samples to obtain the base classifiers ting and witten 1997 dagging creates a number of disjoint stratified folds out of the data and feeds each chunk of data to a copy of the supplied base learner it is a re sampling ensemble method to combine various classifiers to obtain an improved predictive accuracy of base classifiers depending on the majority vote since all the generated base classifiers are put into the vote meta classifier it is useful for base classifiers that are quadratic or worse in time behaviour regarding a number of instances in the training data govindarajan 2016 3 5 validating techniques the roc curve is a graphical plot revealing the diagnostic capacity of a binary classifier model as its threshold for discrimination differs egan 1975 roc is prepared by plotting the true positive value tp against the false positive rate fp at different thresholds the true positive rate tpr is defined as the sensitivity whereas false positive rate fpr is expressed with specificity or fall out or probability of false alarm in this study the training and validation datasets of flood inventory were used for the roc curve to chalk out the relationship between the positive and negative observations of the model s significance and appropriation in the validation sample a high tpr or sensitivity reflects the accuracy and significance of the models by contrast a high false positive rate fpr or specificity reflects the negative or error predictions of models in the area under curve auc the false positive rate specificity is shown in the x axis whereas fpr sensitivity is shown in the y axis where tn true negative fp false positive tp true positive and fn false negative the quantitative qualitative relationships between auc and predictive precision which range from 0 to 1 are as follows 0 9 1 excellent 0 8 0 9 very good 0 7 0 8 good 0 6 0 7 moderate and 0 5 0 6 weak yesilnacar and topal 2005 the roc curve was utilised for the accuracy measurement of different models including landslide susceptibility mapping soil and

to assess the robustness of the models equations used for calculating these evaluation matrices have been mentioned in table 3 scai is an important validation method ilinca and gheuca 2011 which is commonly applied to evaluate the correctness of ffs models for an excellent model the scai value should be high for very high susceptibility class and low for low susceptibility class arabameri et al 2019a the reverse distribution of scai values indicates the negative prediction and error judgment of a model 4 result 4 1 assessing the multicollinearity of effective factors in consideration of tolerance and vif the multicollinearity problem of the effective factors was tested the highest tolerance value depicts the lowest vif in this study highest tolerance and lowest vif values were found in the case of slope and lu lc table 4 the profile curvature was excluded from the model given that the value of vif is greater than 10 except for the profile curvature other effective flash flood conditioning factors had no multicollinearity problem 4 2 flash flood susceptibility models the flood and non flood points containing the values of flash flood conditioning factors fcfs were used as input datasets in r program to build up flash flood susceptibility ffs models the rt tree islr iprad and cran packages were utilised to perform the functional tree ft bagging dagging rf and random forest models the susceptibility values generated by ft bagging functional tree bft dagging functional tree dft and rotational forest functional tree rft were used to build ffs maps in a gis environment fig 5 a 5d respectively ffs maps are classified into five categories very low low medium high and very high ffs classes based on the natural break classification method the ffs map produced by ft showed that the areas covered by the very high and high ffs zones were 1 66 and 3 57 of the basin respectively the moderate low and very low ffs zones accounted for 6 73 16 01 and 72 03 of the study area respectively fig 6 the dft ensemble model produced ffs values ranging from 0 to 1 this model showed that 9 73 and 11 91 of the gorgan basin have very high and high flash flood susceptibility the very low low and moderate ffs zones accounted for 14 61 21 97 and 41 78 of the study area respectively fig 6 the bft machine learning ensemble model classified the basin into very high 1 99 high 5 41 moderate 1 47 low 15 29 and very low 76 14 ffs zones fig 6 ffs values generated by the rft model ranging from 0 to 1 delineated 1 33 and 7 60 of the gorgan basin as very high and high ffs zones fig 6 the moderate low and very low ffs zones covered 11 63 29 74 and 49 70 of the basin respectively evidently the south western part of the basin exhibited a high potential for flash flood occurrences compared with the rest of the basin 4 3 predicting capability of flood conditioning factors by rf the rf model which was implemented by breiman 2001 by compiling the algorithms of a decision tree chen and liu 2005 zang et al 2017 is useful for predicting data and identifying the individual predisposing factors contributions to the prediction in the present study the rf model was used to assess the contribution of individual effective flood conditioning factors in the area s susceptibility to flash floods the confusion matrix for the rf model is shown in table 5 in this case the confusion matrix reflected binary values such as 0 and 1 wherein 0 indicates flood absence and 1 indicates flood presence the rf model with an out of bag error rate 9 21 was applied in r using the caret package this scenario implies that the accuracy of the model is equal to 90 79 table 5 exhibits the results of the confusion matrix according to results from 212 non flood locations observed 143 67 45 are predicted as non flood erosion and 39 18 39 are predicted as flood from 191 observed flood locations 15 7 85 are predicted as non flood and 176 92 14 are predicted as flood moreover fig 7

models decreased from very low to very high ffs classes this finding indicated an improved performance of the models in terms of ffs mapping the scai and roc methods have good capability to judge the performance of the models used for flood susceptibility determination according to the correctness assessment results the rft and bft models showed outstanding predictive ability moreover the functional tree and dagging functional tree models could predict the ffs of an area well 5 discussion flood a critical geomorphological hazard is one of the major concerns of applied research flood can take away and destroy human lives and numerous properties and weaken the financial capability of a region given the impact of large floods restoration and rehabilitation are costly and can interrupt sustainable development keesstra et al 2018 thus ffs mapping is crucial it is a vital and efficient tool which can help prevent and control future flood occurrences wuet al 2010 although various methods and techniques have been developed and executed around the world for spatial forecasting of natural hazards the goals of all these methods are the same preparing a rational and accurate susceptibility map of natural hazards is a controversial issue amongst environmental researchers recently machine learning techniques have attracted considerable attention from the scientific community on environmental modelling because these techniques are useful in effectively describing the complex relationship between environmental predictors and responses such as flood tien bui et al 2019 wildfire jaafari et al 2019 gully erosion gayen et al 2019 landslide nguyen et al 2019 sinkhole taheri et al 2019 and drought roodposhti et al 2017 considerable research has also attempted to improve the prediction performance and interpretability of machine learning models by applying different ensembles hybrid algorithms thus this work aims to introduce a new hybrid artificial intelligence for ffs mapping in the gorgan basin of iran this study focuses on implementing the three novel ensemble algorithms by integrating bagging dagging and rf meta classifiers with the ft base classifier for flash flood spatial prediction fifteen fcfs elevation slope plan curvature tpi tri twi ci spi dd distance to stream rainfall lithology lu lc ndvi and soil type are selected to be used in the modelling process and in the evaluation of the goodness of fit and performance of the ensemble models however the profile curvature has a multicollinearity problem according to the multicollinearity technique thus this factor is excluded from the models whereas the other factors are effective and used in the final process based on a random forest model elevation distance to stream normalized differential vegetation index slope land use land cover lu lc rainfall drainage density and topographical positioning index twi contribute markedly to flash flood susceptibility zou et al 2013 youssef et al 2016 hosseini et al 2019 elevation slope and distance to stream have key roles amongst the effective factors used in modelling ffs naturally the areas with low elevations and slopes and those close to streams have a high probability of flood events botzen et al 2012 choubin et al 2019 ndvi and lu lc are the most effective factors in runoff and infiltration generation csáfordi et al 2012 similarly surface runoff generation rainfall and twi characteristics are important nampak et al 2014 drainage density is correlated with lithology and topographical factors such as slope and elevation which may show high runoff and low infiltration rate at their higher values prasad and sangita 2008 and control the flood condition of the region the most interesting finding was that the bft auc of src 0 933 auc of prc 0 959 e 0 76 and tss 0 72 was identified as the best model in terms of both goodness of fit and robustness for predicting flash flood susceptibility in this scenario bagging increases the consistency of the ft base classifier model by utilizing the rbf kernel feature bagging is an important tool to boost a single classifier s prediction accuracy by using variance and bias reduction in the creation of an ensemble learning classifier bootstrap sampling could reduce the sensitivity of a single classifier to noise in a data set resulting in a corresponding decrease in the variance of the classification model breiman 1996 moreover the ft base classifier is an interpretable and reliable algorithm against noise and it greatly improves the classification error hong et al 2017 ft has a measure of confidence that is regarded as the classification margin in relation to a classification system hong et al 2017 another important finding is that the meta classifiers bagging dagging and rf have strengthened the goodness of fit and increased the predictive accuracy of base classifiers ft our results are rational as the ensemble classifiers minimise bias variance and over fitting issues in ffs modelling to improve base classifier efficiency hong et al 2018 furthermore the application of ft dft and rft models for predicting flash flood susceptibility has been successfully demonstrated in the case of dft and rft models theirefficiencieshave been tested successfully in other fields of geospatial modeling such as susceptibility to landslides and are compatible with the results of this research pham et al 2017 this study corroborates the works of chen et al 2018 hong et al 2017 2018 jebur et al 2014 pham et al 2017 which showed that hybrid ensemble models result in better accuracy than single models the findings of the current research have also demonstrated that the bft model has provided consistent results in terms of precision and robustness considering the natural break method flash flood susceptibility maps of the study area were classified into five susceptibility classes such as very low low moderate and very high the flash flood susceptibility maps produced by the ft dft bft and rft showed that 1 66 9 73 1 99 and 1 33 respectively are very highly susceptible for the flash flood avoiding or solving the problem of over fitting is difficult several reasons are stated as follows firstly the non flooded area is selected in the case of this study to be the same as the flooded area although the actual non flooded area is larger than the flooded area secondly the training and testing datasets are defined by the sampling ratio of 70 30 without performing a sampling ratio accuracy test thirdly despite the multicollinearity test noise is still included in the flash flood conditioning factors fcfs used in this study a major advantage of the machine learning algorithms applied in this study is that they automate the process of investigating multiple databases to gather important information these algorithms can account for unique assumptions that can be used to help to plan decisions along with the automatic analysis of large datasets however several drawbacks of such machine learning algorithms are also observed for example before being used as an input into the chosen algorithm data should be processed given that the processing technique can have a huge effect on the outcome in addition preparing data before classification using machine learning algorithms is time consuming the following should be conducted in future studies to enhance ffs accuracy 1 effective analysis of the flooded to non flooded area ratio 2 evaluation of the training and validation dataset sampling ratio 3 consideration of the differences between different methods of feature selection and 4 model performance analysis using additional ensemble approaches 6 conclusion at present ffsm is widely used as a tool for managing flood hazards in this study four machine learning hybrid ensemble techniques ft bft dft and rft were effectively used to assess ffs in consideration of the 15 flash flood

techniques used for ffs modelling in this basin performed well the predicting capability of the bft is the best amongst the models the random forest model showed that elevation distance to stream and ndvi play major roles in making the area susceptible to flash floods the present study shows that the machine learning ensemble models used for ffs modelling have promising accuracy furthermore the findings of this work could be helpful for flood management in order to deal with the existing uncertain situation and know diverse aspects which influence ffs with more accuracy in addition as a suggestion for future research this methodology could be applied to analyze vulnerability of flood hazard to climate change i e as a regional resource management tool in order to enhance accuracy and reduce the uncertainties in the models hybrid modelling can be recommended which decreases some problems in classification models such as over fitting these models may be applied for ffs evaluation in

5447,the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei at three different time scales i e spei 3 spei 6 and spei 12 from six meteorology stations located in turkey are modeled in this study to this end two types of classic time series models namely linear autoregressive ar and non linear bi linear bl are used furthermore the hybrid models are proposed by coupling the wavelet w and gene expression programming gep five various mother wavelets i e haar db4 symlet meyer and coifflet for the first time are employed and compared for implementing the hybrid w gep approach in drought modeling the modeling results of spei droughts via the time series models illustrated that the non linear bl performs slightly better than the linear ar moreover all the hybrid w gep models developed in the study region provide superior performances compared to the standalone gep in general db4 in spei 3 modeling and symlet for modeling the spei 6 and spei 12 of the studied locations are the optimal wavelets to develop the w gep finally the spei series at each target station is modeled through applying the spei data of the five neighboring stations it is found that the spei data of neighboring stations are appropriate for modeling the spei series of the target station when the spei data of the target station is not at hand for this case the performance of standalone gep for modeling the spei 3 and spei 6 of the stations is generally better than the case of utilizing the original spei data at each target station keywords drought modeling time series models hybrid models

impacts on water supply and quality public health agricultural productivity land degradation desertification famine etc madadgar and moradkhani 2014 li et al 2020 drought as one of the natural disasters is exacerbated by some elements including the rising water demand due to increasing population as well as atmospheric and hydrological processes mishra and singh 2010 beyaztas and yaseen 2019 in a general classification drought events are classified into four various categories namely meteorological hydrological agricultural and socio economic droughts wilhite and glantz 1985 khadr 2016 some of the well known and commonly used meteorological drought indicators in monitoring droughts consist of the palmer drought severity index pdsi reconnaissance drought index rdi standardized precipitation index spi and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei palmer 1965 tsakiris et al 2007 mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano et al 2010 given the significant role of evapotranspiration in water balance it is necessary to consider its effect when drought is studied in a particular region accordingly the spei which incorporates both precipitation and evapotranspiration can be taken into consideration as a reliable index for drought monitoring vicente serrano et al 2010 considering the importance of drought as a natural phenomenon in the hydrological and meteorological studies its monitoring and prediction through a suitable approach could be of significant the drought prediction plays a crucial role in risk management to mitigate the effects of droughts on available water resources and their optimal utilization the possibility of making rational decisions by decision makers to minimize the damages caused by droughts as well as to plan and manage water resources projects khadr 2016 madrigal et al 2018 beyaztas and yaseen 2019 time series models regression models artificial intelligence ai techniques and hybrid models can be applied for drought modeling mishra et al 2007 bacanli et al 2009 fernández et al 2009 madrigal et al 2018 among the aforementioned models the ai techniques are widely used than their alternatives in drought forecasting in the literature gene expression programming gep as one of the ai based approaches is a branch of evolutionary algorithms that has been extensively employed in the recent hydrological studies mehdizadeh et al 2017 2018 danandeh mehr 2018 mehdizadeh and kozekalani sales 2018 mehdizadeh et al 2019a 2020 sachindra et al 2018 chandrasekaran et al 2017 beside ai techniques classic linear time series models such as autoregressive ar moving average ma and autoregressive moving average arma were applied in the hydrological studies however the non linear time series models are less commonly used in the hydrological studies in this context bi linear bl is one the non linear time series models in addition using the wavelet is one of the popular approaches in hydrological science that has recently received remarkable attention in fact the wavelet is an efficient mathematical transformation technique so that it can increase the modeling accuracy of the hydrological processes the wavelet as one of the well known data preprocessing techniques is used to decompose the observational series into other components so that they are used as predictors to feed the ai models and therefore develop the hybrid w ai models 1 2 related works in recent decades the ai techniques are widely used for modeling the hydrological parameters time series such as drought studies for example the long term spi droughts of the awash river basin ethiopia were modeled by belayneh et al 2014 via coupling the wavelet w with the artificial neural networks ann and support vector regression svr models a conventional time series model namely the autoregressive integrated moving average arima was also used in the modeling the w ann models performed better than the other techniques used danandeh mehr et al 2014 proposed a wavelet linear genetic programming w lgp hybrid model for modeling the palmer s modified drought index pmdi of the texas state usa the estimation accuracy of proposed model was compared with the w ann and wavelet fuzzy wf methods the results demonstrated that the hybrid w lgp provided better results than the standalone lgp rhee and im 2017

reported that the mars and m5 tree methods gave the better prediction accuracy than the lssvm soh et al 2018 modeled the spei of six stations located at the langat river basin malaysia the applied models were wavelet adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system w anfis and w arima ann the estimated spei data of the w arima ann model were better than those of the w anfis tian et al 2018 evaluated the accuracy of svr in spei forecasting of the xiangjiang river basin china they reported that the svr is an effective tool for spei monitoring and forecasting ali et al 2018 introduced hybrid models namely committee extreme learning machine committee elm committee multi linear regression committee mlr and committee anfis optimized by particle swarm optimization pso for estimating the spi droughts of three stations in pakistan the outcomes revealed that the committee elm outperformed the other methods used mouatadid et al 2018 used the elm ann lssvm and mlr to forecast the spei of eastern australia the elm was found to present high capability for capturing the observed spei time series kisi et al 2019 improved the performance efficiency of an anfis via hybridizing it with four optimization algorithms including the pso genetic algorithm ga ant colony aco and butterfly optimization algorithm boa in the spi forecasting three stations in the semnan province of iran were considered in the study sites the results denoted the better forecast performance of the hybrid models than the standalone anfis the forecasting accuracy of spi for three stations located at pakistan was improved by ali et al 2019 through integrating the kernel ridge regression krr and rf with multivariate empirical mode decomposition memd and simulated annealing sa the hybrid memd sa krr was found to perform the best the spei droughts of 32 stations in shaanxi china were forecasted by zhang et al 2019 applying multi layer perceptron mlp type of the ann distributed lag nonlinear model dlnm and xgboost models the xgboost showed better forecast performance compared to the mlp rahmati et al 2020 employed six various types of ai approaches comprising of the mars rf svm boosted regression trees brt classification and regression trees cart and flexible discriminant analysis fda for modeling the agricultural droughts for south east queensland australia the mars and rf were found as the best performing models table 1 summarizes some of the detailed information of literature review mentioned above 1 3 research objectives the main objectives of this study are to 1 apply the linear ar and non linear bl time series models 2 implement the standalone gep and hybrid wavelet gep models using five various mother wavelets and 3 develop the standalone gep models under an external data analysis approach for modeling the spei 3 spei 6 and spei 12 of six stations located in the ankara province turkey to the best of the authors knowledge evaluating the performance of above mentioned time series models specifically the non linear bl as well as comparing their performances with the ai techniques used here i e gep and w gep under both local and external data analysis approaches and finally testing the performance of various mother wavelets when developing the w gep models in spei drought modeling have not been addressed in previous studies fig 1 schematically illustrates the different steps of the present study 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data used historical precipitation and temperature measurements in the period 1975 2016 from six meteorological stations see fig 2 were used in this study to calculate spei time series at each station regarding their spatial distribution the stations may represent the climatology of middle and northern parts of ankara table 2 tabulates the geographical information and statistical analysis of the spei data of the stations used in this study to obtain the spei time series in 3 month 6 month and 12 month i e precipitation and temperature conditions over the past 12 months time resolutions the spei package available in r library http sac csic es spei tools html is used the package uses thornthwaite method to calculate pet by default and we followed this initial setup more details about the climatology of the study area reader is referred to danandeh mehr et al 2020 2 2 spei the spei is rather a new meteorological drought index which combines the variability of precipitation and temperature to derive drought condition it has been offered to be more consistent for drought studies under climate change projections ahmadalipour et al 2017 danandeh mehr et al 2020 the index method first developed by vicente serrano et al 2010 where local temperature and precipitation p are used to estimate monthly potential evapotranspiration pet and deficit d i e water balance of the month i as 1 d i p i p e t i once di is estimated its standardized time series is fitted to a given probability distribution function e g log logistic function as suggested by vicente serrano et al 2010 and then the spei time series is calculated as the standardized values of cumulative probability of deficit using eq 2 as follows 2 spe i i w i 2 515517 0 802853 w i 0 010328 w i 2 1 1 432788 w i 0 189269 w i 2 0 001308 w i 3 w i 2 ln p f o r p 0 5 w i 2 ln 1 p f o r p 0 5 where p is the probability of exceeding a given deficit it is important to note that the sign of the calculated spei must be reversed for the cases of p 0 5 for more details about the spei the interested reader is referred to danandeh mehr et al 2020 2 3 modified mann kendall test non parametric approaches are commonly used to check the trends of the hydrological parameters time series the condition for using these tests is that there is no significant autocorrelation coefficient in the data series hamed and rao 1998 firstly investigated the effect of autocorrelation in trend analysis via non parametric techniques such as man kendall mk they then presented theoretical relationships to eliminate the effect of significant autocorrelation i e modified mk mmk which could lead to a reliable trend analysis compared to the classical mk readers can refer to khalili et al 2016 ahmadi et al 2018 and zamani et al 2018 for detailed information on the mathematical equations of the mmk test 2 4 kendall s τ rank correlation coefficient one of the fundamental issues in the hydrological events analysis is to evaluate dependencies between the different parameters studied the linear pearson s correlation coefficient is commonly used to measure the dependence relationship among two considered variables however this method includes some drawbacks one of its major flaws is that it is strongly affected by outlier data so that if x or y or both of them reach a power other than one the value of pearson s correlation coefficient changes but their rank correlations do not change nelsen 2006 to overcome the flaws of pearson s correlation the non parametric kendall s τ rank correlation coefficient can be used the kendall s τ is a rank correlation coefficient that could be of use in correlation analysis of hydrological parameters the kendall s τ ranges between 1 and 1 in which the values of 1 1 and 0 denote the concordant discordant and no any concordant between two pairs respectively for a given random sample of nbivariate observational data including x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x n y n the kendall s τ can be formulated as follows mirabbasi et al 2012 3 τ n 2 1 1 i j n sgn x i x j y i y j 4 sgn ψ 1 if ψ 0 0 if ψ 0 1 if ψ 0 where i j 1 2 n and sgn is the sign function the kendall s τ rank correlation is used in this study when assessing the correlations existing among the spei droughts of the considered stations as a pair under an external data analysis approach 2 5 models used 2 5 1 ar arma and bl time series based models given that the linear arma is the most commonly used model in hydrological time series modeling and it is a special type of the non linear bl model the general form of the arma is initially presented as follows 5 z t i 1 p φ i z t i j 1 q θ j ε t j ε t where zt is the standardized time series φ i is the coefficient of autoregressive ar model θ j is the coefficient of moving average ma model ε t is the stochastic time series p and q are the orders of ar and ma respectively in the above mentioned equation if q 0 the arma p q becomes the ar p the linear time series models are in fact the first order extension of the taylor series the basic idea behind the bl model is the non linearity of the second order extension of the taylor series the general form of the bl is as follows tsay 2002 6 z t i 1 p φ i z t i j 1 q θ j ε t j i 0 r j 1 s β ij z t i j ε t j ε t where zt is the intended time series p q r and s are the positive integers representing the order of bl model φ θ and β are the coefficients of bl model fitting a time series model including the linear ar p arma p q and non linear bl p q r s consists of a two step procedure the first step is to determine the orders of used models i e p in ar p q in arma p q r s in bl in this regard it was focused on the least corrected akaike information criterion aicc to select the optimal ar arma and bl orders then the coefficients of all the applied models including φ in ar φ θ in arma and φ θ β in bl are estimated 2 5 2 wavelet transform wavelet transform wt is used as an advanced mathematical tool in the data preprocessing recently this technique has received remarkable attention in various hydrological and environmental studies the basic idea of wt is derived from the fourier and short time fourier transforms daubechies 1992 the wt is a practical method of signal analysis that performs well the time scale frequency localization labat 2005 this technique transmits a signal or time series into a three dimensional space comprising of the time scale frequency and magnitude lafreniere and sharp 2003 in the wt the basic functions are translations and dilations of a function named the mother wavelet which can be described as follows 7 φ t d t 0 wt can be used in two forms including the continuous wt cwt and discrete wt dwt the dwt compared to the cwt is simpler to execute and its computation takes less time in this study the mallat algorithm or multi resolution analysis is used to develop the dwt the optimal level of decomposition should be taken into consideration when coupling wt on the ai models an appropriate decomposition level can be obtained via the following formula 8 l i n t l o g n where l is the number of allowed decomposition levels n is the total number of observational values and int is the integer operator wang and ding 2003 the present study applies five different mother wavelets and then compares their performances to improve the spei droughts modeling when implementing the hybrid w gep models 2 5 3 gep in continuous evolution of ai based models ferreira 2001 developed gep as an evolutionary algorithm successful application of gep in hydrological modeling was reviewed by danandeh mehr et al 2018 it derives its own properties from two techniques including genetic programming and genetic algorithm first of all a primary population is randomly generated in the gep chromosomes are then created from the initial population next generated chromosomes are encoded in the forms of expression trees the obtained outcomes are finally assessed by a fitness function to detect whether the solution is appropriate or not if the obtained solution was found to be the best evolution procedure will be terminated otherwise the optimal solution obtained in the previous generation is transferred to the subsequent generation in this regard chromosomes are modified through the genetic operators the evolution will be repeated until the best solution is found modeling procedure via the gep consists of five main steps as 1 defining a fitness function 2 introducing the terminals and functions sets to the model 3 assigning the chromosomal architecture 4 determining a linking function and 5 assigning the rates of various genetic operators the default parameters of gep were used in running the gep models for modeling the spei droughts mehdizadeh et al 2020 2 6 performance assessment indicators three statistical measures namely the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and correlation coefficient r are employed for evaluating the efficiencies of all the models developed in this study as follows 9 rmse i 1 n spe i o i s p e i m i 2 n 10 mae i 1 n spe i o i s p e i m i n 11 r i 1 n spe i o i spe i o spe i m i spe i m i 1 n spe i o i spe i o 2 i 1 n spe i m i spe i m 2 where spe i o i spe i m i spe i o spe i m and n denote the observed spei the modeled spei the average of observed spei data the average of modeled spei data and the total number of observations respectively it is apparent that a lower value for the rmse and mae metrics and a higher value for the r illustrate the high accuracy of any applied models 3 results in the current study the meteorological droughts of the spei at three time scale including spei 3 spei 6 and spei 12 are modeled for the six stations located in the ankara province turkey for this the standalone time series based ar and bl as well as the ai based gep are used as the modeling approaches besides the aforementioned models the hybrid models are developed by coupling the wavelet and gep to this end five various types of the mother wavelets containing two decomposition levels are used to implement the hybrid w gep models finally the performance of standalone gep is assessed for modeling the spei droughts of the considered stations under an external evaluation type before fitting the time series based ar and bl models the trends of the spei drought data were analyzed since the absence of any trends in the data is an essential requirement for the use of time series models the values of modified mann kendall i e mkk statistic calculated for the spei 3 spei 6 and spei 12 at the study sites are shown schematically in fig 3 as seen the absolute values of the mmk statistic are lower than the critical value at 95 confidence level i e 1 96 so there are no any trends in the observed spei droughts of the stations the time series are therefore allowed to be used in this study therefore different ar and bl models were initially fitted to the observed spei 3 spei 6 and spei 12 of the study sites in the applications the first 384 data and the last 120 data are used as the train and test datasets respectively the optimal ar and bl models were selected focusing on the least values for the aicc the error metrics obtained for the six considered stations during both the train and test stages are tabulated in tables 3 8 as an example ar 8 ar 13 and arma 1 1 are the best performing ar based models at the kizilcahamam station for modeling the spei 3 spei6 and spei12 respectively see table 6 additionally the optimal bl models at this station are respectively bl 8 0 1 1 bl 13 0 1 1 and bl 1 1 1 1 the values of statistical metrics achieved for the spei 3 modeling at kizilcahamam station are as rmse 0 712 r 0 649 mae 0 564 train period rmse 0 788 mae 0 651 r 0 699 test period by the ar 8 as well as rmse 0 701 mae 0 553 r 0 661 train period rmse 0 732 mae 0 591 r 0 746 test period by the bl 8 0 1 1 the error statistics obtained for the other stations are visible in tables 3 8 it is worth mentioning that the arma models are fitted instead of the ar at some of the studied regions and the spei droughts at three different time scales the reason is that the order of ar is decreased by using the ma model along with the ar i e arma so lower orders for p and q i e a few parameters are used in the modeling procedure compared to a single ar the point that can be clearly seen in the tables 3 8 is that the performance of the times series models implemented at whole the study locations is improved with increasing the time scale of calculating the spei in this regard the spei 3 and spei 12 illustrate the worst and best modeling performances respectively afterwards the ai based gep model was used for modeling the spei droughts of the considered stations in this context the antecedent spei data i e one month antecedent data are applied for spei modeling of each month the ability of standalone gep for modeling the spei droughts of the locations in terms of rmse mae and r error statistics are tabulated in tables 3 8 the results illustrate the capability of standalone gep to model the spei utilizing the antecedent spei data in addition to the application of standalone gep this study aims to improve the modeling accuracy of the gep through coupling it with the wavelet analysis accordingly the hybrid wavelet gep i e w gep is proposed it has to be emphasized that five various types of the mother wavelets consisting of the haar db4 symlet meyer and coifflet are considered for developing the hybrid w gep models moreover two decomposition levels are used for the wavelet analysis since the allowed numbers for the decomposition levels of the wavelet analysis in this study are l i n t l o g 504 2 the hybrid w gep models are named as w wavelet type decomposition level gep for an example the hybrid w symlet 1 gep means that the hybrid w gep is developed through the symlet wavelet using one decomposition level a performance assessment of the standalone gep and hybrid w gep models with error metrics tabulated in tables 3 8 demonstrate that all the hybrid models implemented at the study locations perform better than the standalone gep for modeling the spei droughts given the values of statistical errors provided in table 5 for the kecioren station it can be seen that the rmse mae and r of standalone gep as 0 731 0 584 and 0 632 train period 0 823 0 659 and 0 671 test period improve to 0 628 0 488 and 0 746 train period 0 646 0 518 and 0 810 test period in the best performing hybrid model i e w db4 2 gep for the spei 3 modeling similar conclusions were also observed for modeling the spei droughts of other stations considered additionally the same results achieved for the time series based ar and bl are also concluded for the standalone gep and hybrid w gep models in this regard the accuracy of spei modeling by the ai based models is increased with increasing the time scale of computing the spei this point is clearly visible in the scatter plots drawn between the observed and modeled spei data figs 4 9 in terms of having lesser dispersions around the perfect line i e y x in spei 12 than those of spei 3 and spei 6 it should be noted that the best performing hybrid models during the test phase with bolded error statistics in tables 3 8 are applied to prepare the comparison plots in addition the time series plots shown in figs 4 9 clearly demonstrate that the optimal hybrid models present superior performances to capture the observed time series of the spei 12 droughts at all the studied sites than those of spei 3 and spei 6 drought data alongside modeling the spei droughts of each target site using the antecedent spei data of the same site the spei data of any target station are also modeled by the standalone gep through applying the nearby stations spei data this type of analysis is named as the external evaluation approach the six studied stations are located in the ankara province turkey therefore they are considered as the neighboring stations as previously mentioned to figure out the correlations existing between the spei data of nearby stations the pearson s correlation coefficient was not used as it considers a linear relationship for the data alternatively another non parametric approach namely the kendall s τ rank correlation has been used the kendall s τ rank correlations among the spei droughts of the studied locations are given in table 9 as is apparent the kendall s τ rank correlation for both the adjacent stations as a pair is generally decreased with increasing the time scales of calculating the spei the highest correlations are related to the polatli and kecioren and followed by esenboga and kecioren beypazari and kecioren the statistical results of the standalone gep under an external evaluation analysis are summarized in table 10 as clearly can be seen the spei data of neighboring locations can be used for modeling the spei droughts of any target location via the standalone gep finally the modeling performance of all the implemented models including the standalone time series based ar and bl the standalone gep and hybrid w gep models as well as the standalone gep under an external evaluation approach is compared with each other in this section comparing the modeling accuracy of the standalone ar or arma for some cases and bl in tables 3 8 demonstrates that the non linear bl models developed for all the study sites perform better than the linear ar arma also as it was concluded all the hybrid w gep models obtain better results compared to the standalone gep when modeling the spei 3 spei 6 and spei 12 among the various types of mother wavelets used in the present study db4 and symlet are found generally the best wavelets for improving the performance of standalone gep in spei modeling on the other side the performance of haar and coifflet wavelets is slightly lower than the other wavelets in addition increasing the decomposition levels from 1 to 2 leads to the better estimates of the spei droughts at the considered time scales the best performing hybrid model at all the studied stations is the w db4 2 gep when modeling the spei 3 however the hybrid w symlet 2 gep presents superior performance than the other hybrid models developed for the studied sites in modeling the spei 6 and spei 12 except for the kecioren station in spei 6 when modeling the spei 6 of the kecioren station the hybrid w db4 2 gep is found as the superior model a performance evaluation of the time series based ar and bl with the standalone gep demonstrates that the ar arma and bl models generally present better performances in comparison with the standalone gep in modeling the spei 3 and spei 6 except for some cases specifically spei 3 and spei 6 of the esenboga station additionally the different hybrid w gep models achieve higher accuracies than the ar arma and bl time series based models in modeling the spei droughts of the stations at three various time scales at the end the performance of standalone gep is evaluated under both the local and external analysis types in general external results of the standalone gep table 10 are better than the corresponding models at the local analysis the standalone gep results in tables 3 8 except for modeling the spei 12 at the test phase of kecioren spei 12 at the beypazari spei 12 at the test phase of polatli spei 6 and spei 12 at the kizilcahamam spei 12 at the test phase of esenboga spei 6 and spei 12 at nallihan therefore it can be generally concluded that the local performances of the standalone gep models are superior to the external performances of the relevant gep for modeling the long term spei i e spei 12 it can be attributed to the least kendall s τ correlations between the neighboring stations in spei 12 than that of spei 3 and spei 6 see table 10 however as a general conclusion the spei drought data at the neighboring stations can be applied for modeling the spei droughts of any target location when the target station drought data are not available 4 discussion the standalone and hybrid models developed at the studied sites showed the worst and best performances for modeling the spei 3 and spei 12 respectively it can be justified considering the fact that the number of months used to calculate the spei drought data at different time scales are increased with increasing the time scale i e from spei 3 to spei 12 therefore the performance of spei modeling increases from spei 3 to spei 12 due to the increased autocorrelations in the data series it was found that the non linear bl presented slightly better performances compared to the linear ar arma the spei drought is expected to illustrate a non linear behavior as it is calculated using two terms of precipitation and evapotranspiration that include a non linear nature behavior therefore the spei drought data of the studied locations can be well modeled via the non linear bl than that of the linear ar arma literature review in the hydrological science shows that the performance of different mother wavelets has not been usually assessed to develop the hybrid w ai models results of this study illustrated that different mother wavelets could provide various performances when coupling on the ai based models so that db4 and symlet were introduced as the best performing mother wavelets therefore the accuracy of various mother wavelets must be carefully considered and tested when modeling the hydrological parameters time series the applicability of neighboring stations data to model the hydrological variables at target station under the external analysis approach is confirmed by some scholars for example mehdizadeh 2018 estimated daily reference evapotranspiration of each target station through the weather data of nearby station containing the same climate the external performance of two types of the anfis was evaluated by sanikhani and kisi 2012 for estimation of monthly streamflow of two hydrometric stations in turkey mehdizadeh et al 2019b developed the ai based mars and gep for estimating the monthly streamflow of two hydrometric stations in iran and two other ones in canada they utilized the streamflow of neighboring station to estimate the streamflow of target station deo et al 2018 developed the standalone mlp and its hybrid with the firefly optimization algorithm in order to model the wind speed of each target location by using the wind speed data of five neighboring location located in iran further studies such as lu et al 2018 wu et al 2019 and fan et al 2019 have also been reported on the use of data from the adjacent stations for modeling the pan evaporation and reference evapotranspiration of each target site the results of above mentioned studies verify the possibility of use of the data of nearby stations under an external analysis approach which are in agreement with the outcomes of the present work the ai based models such as standalone gep and its hybrid with the wavelet analysis applied in this study may illustrate some disadvantages one of the most important of these flaws could be overfitting problem an ai based model that includes overfitting represents satisfactory results in the train period while its performance is relatively poor in the test period when comparing the accuracy of both the train and test stages fathian et al 2019 however whole the standalone gep and hybrid w gep models are not expected to illustrate overfitting issue indeed the hydrological parameters time series like droughts include two stochastic and deterministic components mehdizadeh 2020 the time series and ai models are respectively able to capturing the stochastic and deterministic segments in other words they focus only on one term in modeling the hydrological events while a precise modeling technique should consider both terms in the modeling process in this context hybrid ai time series models can be recommended it is apparent that the performance of any modeling technique could be improved via the data pre processing this study applied the wavelet analysis as a popular data pre processing approach for developing the hybrid w gep models other data pre processing methods including the empirical mode decomposition emd ensemble emd eemd variational mode decomposition vmd etc could also be suggested to increase the accuracy of ai based models when modeling the hydrological phenomena such as drought 5 conclusions this study aimed to modeling the spei droughts at three time scales including the spei 3 spei 6 and spei 12 for six stations distributed across ankara turkey to achieve this goal three types of the models were applied consisting of the time series i e the linear ar arma and non linear bl standalone gep and hybrid w gep five mother wavelets i e haar db4 symlet meyer and coifflet under two decomposition levels were used when developing the hybrid w gep models it was found that the non linear bl presented higher modeling accuracy than the linear ar arma at all the considered time scales and stations studied a comparative assessment of the standalone gep and hybrid w gep models revealed that all the developed hybrid models outperformed the standalone ones among the various mother wavelets used in this study db4 for modeling the spei 3 and symlet for modeling the spei 6 and spei 12 were found as the best wavelets given two decomposition levels the performance of all the hybrid w gep models was better than that of considering one decomposition level in general the hybrid w gep models illustrated the best performance among the three different types of models developed at the studied locations furthermore all the implemented models provided the highest and least modeling accuracy for spei 12 and spei 3 respectively finally the spei droughts of each station were modeled using the neighboring stations spei data through the standalone gep under an external analysis a performance evaluation of the standalone gep under both local and external conditions indicated that the external approach generally yielded better estimation of the spei 3 and spei 6 compared to the local approach while the developed standalone gep models under a local approach performed better than the external approach for modeling the spei 12 droughts of the studied locations literature review in the field of hydrological parameters modeling shows that the hybrid models developed via combining the wavelet and ai techniques have been usually implemented using a particular mother wavelet however the results of the current study demonstrated that different results may be achieved using the various mother wavelets hence it is recommended that the best wavelet with the highest level of accuracy be selected when developing the hybrid w ai models this study applied the linear ar arma and non linear bl standalone gep and hybrid w gep models future research works could be focused on developing other models including the time series based linear arima and fractionally arima non linear autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity arch and self exciting threshold autoregressive setar as well as hybrid models via combining the wavelet with various ai approaches such as ann anfis svm etc moreover the methodologies presented in this study are recommended to be used for modeling the other hydrological parameters including the precipitation evaporation streamflow and so on credit authorship contribution statement saeid mehdizadeh conceptualization methodology

5447,the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei at three different time scales i e spei 3 spei 6 and spei 12 from six meteorology stations located in turkey are modeled in this study to this end two types of classic time series models namely linear autoregressive ar and non linear bi linear bl are used furthermore the hybrid models are proposed by coupling the wavelet w and gene expression programming gep five various mother wavelets i e haar db4 symlet meyer and coifflet for the first time are employed and compared for implementing the hybrid w gep approach in drought modeling the modeling results of spei droughts via the time series models illustrated that the non linear bl performs slightly better than the linear ar moreover all the hybrid w gep models developed in the study region provide superior performances compared to the standalone gep in general db4 in spei 3 modeling and symlet for modeling the spei 6 and spei 12 of the studied locations are the optimal wavelets to develop the w gep finally the spei series at each target station is modeled through applying the spei data of the five neighboring stations it is found that the spei data of neighboring stations are appropriate for modeling the spei series of the target station when the spei data of the target station is not at hand for this case the performance of standalone gep for modeling the spei 3 and spei 6 of the stations is generally better than the case of utilizing the original spei data at each target station keywords drought modeling time series models hybrid models

impacts on water supply and quality public health agricultural productivity land degradation desertification famine etc madadgar and moradkhani 2014 li et al 2020 drought as one of the natural disasters is exacerbated by some elements including the rising water demand due to increasing population as well as atmospheric and hydrological processes mishra and singh 2010 beyaztas and yaseen 2019 in a general classification drought events are classified into four various categories namely meteorological hydrological agricultural and socio economic droughts wilhite and glantz 1985 khadr 2016 some of the well known and commonly used meteorological drought indicators in monitoring droughts consist of the palmer drought severity index pdsi reconnaissance drought index rdi standardized precipitation index spi and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei palmer 1965 tsakiris et al 2007 mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano et al 2010 given the significant role of evapotranspiration in water balance it is necessary to consider its effect when drought is studied in a particular region accordingly the spei which incorporates both precipitation and evapotranspiration can be taken into consideration as a reliable index for drought monitoring vicente serrano et al 2010 considering the importance of drought as a natural phenomenon in the hydrological and meteorological studies its monitoring and prediction through a suitable approach could be of significant the drought prediction plays a crucial role in risk management to mitigate the effects of droughts on available water resources and their optimal utilization the possibility of making rational decisions by decision makers to minimize the damages caused by droughts as well as to plan and manage water resources projects khadr 2016 madrigal et al 2018 beyaztas and yaseen 2019 time series models regression models artificial intelligence ai techniques and hybrid models can be applied for drought modeling mishra et al 2007 bacanli et al 2009 fernández et al 2009 madrigal et al 2018 among the aforementioned models the ai techniques are widely used than their alternatives in drought forecasting in the literature gene expression programming gep as one of the ai based approaches is a branch of evolutionary algorithms that has been extensively employed in the recent hydrological studies mehdizadeh et al 2017 2018 danandeh mehr 2018 mehdizadeh and kozekalani sales 2018 mehdizadeh et al 2019a 2020 sachindra et al 2018 chandrasekaran et al 2017 beside ai techniques classic linear time series models such as autoregressive ar moving average ma and autoregressive moving average arma were applied in the hydrological studies however the non linear time series models are less commonly used in the hydrological studies in this context bi linear bl is one the non linear time series models in addition using the wavelet is one of the popular approaches in hydrological science that has recently received remarkable attention in fact the wavelet is an efficient mathematical transformation technique so that it can increase the modeling accuracy of the hydrological processes the wavelet as one of the well known data preprocessing techniques is used to decompose the observational series into other components so that they are used as predictors to feed the ai models and therefore develop the hybrid w ai models 1 2 related works in recent decades the ai techniques are widely used for modeling the hydrological parameters time series such as drought studies for example the long term spi droughts of the awash river basin ethiopia were modeled by belayneh et al 2014 via coupling the wavelet w with the artificial neural networks ann and support vector regression svr models a conventional time series model namely the autoregressive integrated moving average arima was also used in the modeling the w ann models performed better than the other techniques used danandeh mehr et al 2014 proposed a wavelet linear genetic programming w lgp hybrid model for modeling the palmer s modified drought index pmdi of the texas state usa the estimation accuracy of proposed model was compared with the w ann and wavelet fuzzy wf methods the results demonstrated that the hybrid w lgp provided better results than the standalone lgp rhee and im 2017

reported that the mars and m5 tree methods gave the better prediction accuracy than the lssvm soh et al 2018 modeled the spei of six stations located at the langat river basin malaysia the applied models were wavelet adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system w anfis and w arima ann the estimated spei data of the w arima ann model were better than those of the w anfis tian et al 2018 evaluated the accuracy of svr in spei forecasting of the xiangjiang river basin china they reported that the svr is an effective tool for spei monitoring and forecasting ali et al 2018 introduced hybrid models namely committee extreme learning machine committee elm committee multi linear regression committee mlr and committee anfis optimized by particle swarm optimization pso for estimating the spi droughts of three stations in pakistan the outcomes revealed that the committee elm outperformed the other methods used mouatadid et al 2018 used the elm ann lssvm and mlr to forecast the spei of eastern australia the elm was found to present high capability for capturing the observed spei time series kisi et al 2019 improved the performance efficiency of an anfis via hybridizing it with four optimization algorithms including the pso genetic algorithm ga ant colony aco and butterfly optimization algorithm boa in the spi forecasting three stations in the semnan province of iran were considered in the study sites the results denoted the better forecast performance of the hybrid models than the standalone anfis the forecasting accuracy of spi for three stations located at pakistan was improved by ali et al 2019 through integrating the kernel ridge regression krr and rf with multivariate empirical mode decomposition memd and simulated annealing sa the hybrid memd sa krr was found to perform the best the spei droughts of 32 stations in shaanxi china were forecasted by zhang et al 2019 applying multi layer perceptron mlp type of the ann distributed lag nonlinear model dlnm and xgboost models the xgboost showed better forecast performance compared to the mlp rahmati et al 2020 employed six various types of ai approaches comprising of the mars rf svm boosted regression trees brt classification and regression trees cart and flexible discriminant analysis fda for modeling the agricultural droughts for south east queensland australia the mars and rf were found as the best performing models table 1 summarizes some of the detailed information of literature review mentioned above 1 3 research objectives the main objectives of this study are to 1 apply the linear ar and non linear bl time series models 2 implement the standalone gep and hybrid wavelet gep models using five various mother wavelets and 3 develop the standalone gep models under an external data analysis approach for modeling the spei 3 spei 6 and spei 12 of six stations located in the ankara province turkey to the best of the authors knowledge evaluating the performance of above mentioned time series models specifically the non linear bl as well as comparing their performances with the ai techniques used here i e gep and w gep under both local and external data analysis approaches and finally testing the performance of various mother wavelets when developing the w gep models in spei drought modeling have not been addressed in previous studies fig 1 schematically illustrates the different steps of the present study 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data used historical precipitation and temperature measurements in the period 1975 2016 from six meteorological stations see fig 2 were used in this study to calculate spei time series at each station regarding their spatial distribution the stations may represent the climatology of middle and northern parts of ankara table 2 tabulates the geographical information and statistical analysis of the spei data of the stations used in this study to obtain the spei time series in 3 month 6 month and 12 month i e precipitation and temperature conditions over the past 12 months time resolutions the spei package available in r library http sac csic es spei tools html is used the package uses thornthwaite method to calculate pet by default and we followed this initial setup more details about the climatology of the study area reader is referred to danandeh mehr et al 2020 2 2 spei the spei is rather a new meteorological drought index which combines the variability of precipitation and temperature to derive drought condition it has been offered to be more consistent for drought studies under climate change projections ahmadalipour et al 2017 danandeh mehr et al 2020 the index method first developed by vicente serrano et al 2010 where local temperature and precipitation p are used to estimate monthly potential evapotranspiration pet and deficit d i e water balance of the month i as 1 d i p i p e t i once di is estimated its standardized time series is fitted to a given probability distribution function e g log logistic function as suggested by vicente serrano et al 2010 and then the spei time series is calculated as the standardized values of cumulative probability of deficit using eq 2 as follows 2 spe i i w i 2 515517 0 802853 w i 0 010328 w i 2 1 1 432788 w i 0 189269 w i 2 0 001308 w i 3 w i 2 ln p f o r p 0 5 w i 2 ln 1 p f o r p 0 5 where p is the probability of exceeding a given deficit it is important to note that the sign of the calculated spei must be reversed for the cases of p 0 5 for more details about the spei the interested reader is referred to danandeh mehr et al 2020 2 3 modified mann kendall test non parametric approaches are commonly used to check the trends of the hydrological parameters time series the condition for using these tests is that there is no significant autocorrelation coefficient in the data series hamed and rao 1998 firstly investigated the effect of autocorrelation in trend analysis via non parametric techniques such as man kendall mk they then presented theoretical relationships to eliminate the effect of significant autocorrelation i e modified mk mmk which could lead to a reliable trend analysis compared to the classical mk readers can refer to khalili et al 2016 ahmadi et al 2018 and zamani et al 2018 for detailed information on the mathematical equations of the mmk test 2 4 kendall s τ rank correlation coefficient one of the fundamental issues in the hydrological events analysis is to evaluate dependencies between the different parameters studied the linear pearson s correlation coefficient is commonly used to measure the dependence relationship among two considered variables however this method includes some drawbacks one of its major flaws is that it is strongly affected by outlier data so that if x or y or both of them reach a power other than one the value of pearson s correlation coefficient changes but their rank correlations do not change nelsen 2006 to overcome the flaws of pearson s correlation the non parametric kendall s τ rank correlation coefficient can be used the kendall s τ is a rank correlation coefficient that could be of use in correlation analysis of hydrological parameters the kendall s τ ranges between 1 and 1 in which the values of 1 1 and 0 denote the concordant discordant and no any concordant between two pairs respectively for a given random sample of nbivariate observational data including x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x n y n the kendall s τ can be formulated as follows mirabbasi et al 2012 3 τ n 2 1 1 i j n sgn x i x j y i y j 4 sgn ψ 1 if ψ 0 0 if ψ 0 1 if ψ 0 where i j 1 2 n and sgn is the sign function the kendall s τ rank correlation is used in this study when assessing the correlations existing among the spei droughts of the considered stations as a pair under an external data analysis approach 2 5 models used 2 5 1 ar arma and bl time series based models given that the linear arma is the most commonly used model in hydrological time series modeling and it is a special type of the non linear bl model the general form of the arma is initially presented as follows 5 z t i 1 p φ i z t i j 1 q θ j ε t j ε t where zt is the standardized time series φ i is the coefficient of autoregressive ar model θ j is the coefficient of moving average ma model ε t is the stochastic time series p and q are the orders of ar and ma respectively in the above mentioned equation if q 0 the arma p q becomes the ar p the linear time series models are in fact the first order extension of the taylor series the basic idea behind the bl model is the non linearity of the second order extension of the taylor series the general form of the bl is as follows tsay 2002 6 z t i 1 p φ i z t i j 1 q θ j ε t j i 0 r j 1 s β ij z t i j ε t j ε t where zt is the intended time series p q r and s are the positive integers representing the order of bl model φ θ and β are the coefficients of bl model fitting a time series model including the linear ar p arma p q and non linear bl p q r s consists of a two step procedure the first step is to determine the orders of used models i e p in ar p q in arma p q r s in bl in this regard it was focused on the least corrected akaike information criterion aicc to select the optimal ar arma and bl orders then the coefficients of all the applied models including φ in ar φ θ in arma and φ θ β in bl are estimated 2 5 2 wavelet transform wavelet transform wt is used as an advanced mathematical tool in the data preprocessing recently this technique has received remarkable attention in various hydrological and environmental studies the basic idea of wt is derived from the fourier and short time fourier transforms daubechies 1992 the wt is a practical method of signal analysis that performs well the time scale frequency localization labat 2005 this technique transmits a signal or time series into a three dimensional space comprising of the time scale frequency and magnitude lafreniere and sharp 2003 in the wt the basic functions are translations and dilations of a function named the mother wavelet which can be described as follows 7 φ t d t 0 wt can be used in two forms including the continuous wt cwt and discrete wt dwt the dwt compared to the cwt is simpler to execute and its computation takes less time in this study the mallat algorithm or multi resolution analysis is used to develop the dwt the optimal level of decomposition should be taken into consideration when coupling wt on the ai models an appropriate decomposition level can be obtained via the following formula 8 l i n t l o g n where l is the number of allowed decomposition levels n is the total number of observational values and int is the integer operator wang and ding 2003 the present study applies five different mother wavelets and then compares their performances to improve the spei droughts modeling when implementing the hybrid w gep models 2 5 3 gep in continuous evolution of ai based models ferreira 2001 developed gep as an evolutionary algorithm successful application of gep in hydrological modeling was reviewed by danandeh mehr et al 2018 it derives its own properties from two techniques including genetic programming and genetic algorithm first of all a primary population is randomly generated in the gep chromosomes are then created from the initial population next generated chromosomes are encoded in the forms of expression trees the obtained outcomes are finally assessed by a fitness function to detect whether the solution is appropriate or not if the obtained solution was found to be the best evolution procedure will be terminated otherwise the optimal solution obtained in the previous generation is transferred to the subsequent generation in this regard chromosomes are modified through the genetic operators the evolution will be repeated until the best solution is found modeling procedure via the gep consists of five main steps as 1 defining a fitness function 2 introducing the terminals and functions sets to the model 3 assigning the chromosomal architecture 4 determining a linking function and 5 assigning the rates of various genetic operators the default parameters of gep were used in running the gep models for modeling the spei droughts mehdizadeh et al 2020 2 6 performance assessment indicators three statistical measures namely the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and correlation coefficient r are employed for evaluating the efficiencies of all the models developed in this study as follows 9 rmse i 1 n spe i o i s p e i m i 2 n 10 mae i 1 n spe i o i s p e i m i n 11 r i 1 n spe i o i spe i o spe i m i spe i m i 1 n spe i o i spe i o 2 i 1 n spe i m i spe i m 2 where spe i o i spe i m i spe i o spe i m and n denote the observed spei the modeled spei the average of observed spei data the average of modeled spei data and the total number of observations respectively it is apparent that a lower value for the rmse and mae metrics and a higher value for the r illustrate the high accuracy of any applied models 3 results in the current study the meteorological droughts of the spei at three time scale including spei 3 spei 6 and spei 12 are modeled for the six stations located in the ankara province turkey for this the standalone time series based ar and bl as well as the ai based gep are used as the modeling approaches besides the aforementioned models the hybrid models are developed by coupling the wavelet and gep to this end five various types of the mother wavelets containing two decomposition levels are used to implement the hybrid w gep models finally the performance of standalone gep is assessed for modeling the spei droughts of the considered stations under an external evaluation type before fitting the time series based ar and bl models the trends of the spei drought data were analyzed since the absence of any trends in the data is an essential requirement for the use of time series models the values of modified mann kendall i e mkk statistic calculated for the spei 3 spei 6 and spei 12 at the study sites are shown schematically in fig 3 as seen the absolute values of the mmk statistic are lower than the critical value at 95 confidence level i e 1 96 so there are no any trends in the observed spei droughts of the stations the time series are therefore allowed to be used in this study therefore different ar and bl models were initially fitted to the observed spei 3 spei 6 and spei 12 of the study sites in the applications the first 384 data and the last 120 data are used as the train and test datasets respectively the optimal ar and bl models were selected focusing on the least values for the aicc the error metrics obtained for the six considered stations during both the train and test stages are tabulated in tables 3 8 as an example ar 8 ar 13 and arma 1 1 are the best performing ar based models at the kizilcahamam station for modeling the spei 3 spei6 and spei12 respectively see table 6 additionally the optimal bl models at this station are respectively bl 8 0 1 1 bl 13 0 1 1 and bl 1 1 1 1 the values of statistical metrics achieved for the spei 3 modeling at kizilcahamam station are as rmse 0 712 r 0 649 mae 0 564 train period rmse 0 788 mae 0 651 r 0 699 test period by the ar 8 as well as rmse 0 701 mae 0 553 r 0 661 train period rmse 0 732 mae 0 591 r 0 746 test period by the bl 8 0 1 1 the error statistics obtained for the other stations are visible in tables 3 8 it is worth mentioning that the arma models are fitted instead of the ar at some of the studied regions and the spei droughts at three different time scales the reason is that the order of ar is decreased by using the ma model along with the ar i e arma so lower orders for p and q i e a few parameters are used in the modeling procedure compared to a single ar the point that can be clearly seen in the tables 3 8 is that the performance of the times series models implemented at whole the study locations is improved with increasing the time scale of calculating the spei in this regard the spei 3 and spei 12 illustrate the worst and best modeling performances respectively afterwards the ai based gep model was used for modeling the spei droughts of the considered stations in this context the antecedent spei data i e one month antecedent data are applied for spei modeling of each month the ability of standalone gep for modeling the spei droughts of the locations in terms of rmse mae and r error statistics are tabulated in tables 3 8 the results illustrate the capability of standalone gep to model the spei utilizing the antecedent spei data in addition to the application of standalone gep this study aims to improve the modeling accuracy of the gep through coupling it with the wavelet analysis accordingly the hybrid wavelet gep i e w gep is proposed it has to be emphasized that five various types of the mother wavelets consisting of the haar db4 symlet meyer and coifflet are considered for developing the hybrid w gep models moreover two decomposition levels are used for the wavelet analysis since the allowed numbers for the decomposition levels of the wavelet analysis in this study are l i n t l o g 504 2 the hybrid w gep models are named as w wavelet type decomposition level gep for an example the hybrid w symlet 1 gep means that the hybrid w gep is developed through the symlet wavelet using one decomposition level a performance assessment of the standalone gep and hybrid w gep models with error metrics tabulated in tables 3 8 demonstrate that all the hybrid models implemented at the study locations perform better than the standalone gep for modeling the spei droughts given the values of statistical errors provided in table 5 for the kecioren station it can be seen that the rmse mae and r of standalone gep as 0 731 0 584 and 0 632 train period 0 823 0 659 and 0 671 test period improve to 0 628 0 488 and 0 746 train period 0 646 0 518 and 0 810 test period in the best performing hybrid model i e w db4 2 gep for the spei 3 modeling similar conclusions were also observed for modeling the spei droughts of other stations considered additionally the same results achieved for the time series based ar and bl are also concluded for the standalone gep and hybrid w gep models in this regard the accuracy of spei modeling by the ai based models is increased with increasing the time scale of computing the spei this point is clearly visible in the scatter plots drawn between the observed and modeled spei data figs 4 9 in terms of having lesser dispersions around the perfect line i e y x in spei 12 than those of spei 3 and spei 6 it should be noted that the best performing hybrid models during the test phase with bolded error statistics in tables 3 8 are applied to prepare the comparison plots in addition the time series plots shown in figs 4 9 clearly demonstrate that the optimal hybrid models present superior performances to capture the observed time series of the spei 12 droughts at all the studied sites than those of spei 3 and spei 6 drought data alongside modeling the spei droughts of each target site using the antecedent spei data of the same site the spei data of any target station are also modeled by the standalone gep through applying the nearby stations spei data this type of analysis is named as the external evaluation approach the six studied stations are located in the ankara province turkey therefore they are considered as the neighboring stations as previously mentioned to figure out the correlations existing between the spei data of nearby stations the pearson s correlation coefficient was not used as it considers a linear relationship for the data alternatively another non parametric approach namely the kendall s τ rank correlation has been used the kendall s τ rank correlations among the spei droughts of the studied locations are given in table 9 as is apparent the kendall s τ rank correlation for both the adjacent stations as a pair is generally decreased with increasing the time scales of calculating the spei the highest correlations are related to the polatli and kecioren and followed by esenboga and kecioren beypazari and kecioren the statistical results of the standalone gep under an external evaluation analysis are summarized in table 10 as clearly can be seen the spei data of neighboring locations can be used for modeling the spei droughts of any target location via the standalone gep finally the modeling performance of all the implemented models including the standalone time series based ar and bl the standalone gep and hybrid w gep models as well as the standalone gep under an external evaluation approach is compared with each other in this section comparing the modeling accuracy of the standalone ar or arma for some cases and bl in tables 3 8 demonstrates that the non linear bl models developed for all the study sites perform better than the linear ar arma also as it was concluded all the hybrid w gep models obtain better results compared to the standalone gep when modeling the spei 3 spei 6 and spei 12 among the various types of mother wavelets used in the present study db4 and symlet are found generally the best wavelets for improving the performance of standalone gep in spei modeling on the other side the performance of haar and coifflet wavelets is slightly lower than the other wavelets in addition increasing the decomposition levels from 1 to 2 leads to the better estimates of the spei droughts at the considered time scales the best performing hybrid model at all the studied stations is the w db4 2 gep when modeling the spei 3 however the hybrid w symlet 2 gep presents superior performance than the other hybrid models developed for the studied sites in modeling the spei 6 and spei 12 except for the kecioren station in spei 6 when modeling the spei 6 of the kecioren station the hybrid w db4 2 gep is found as the superior model a performance evaluation of the time series based ar and bl with the standalone gep demonstrates that the ar arma and bl models generally present better performances in comparison with the standalone gep in modeling the spei 3 and spei 6 except for some cases specifically spei 3 and spei 6 of the esenboga station additionally the different hybrid w gep models achieve higher accuracies than the ar arma and bl time series based models in modeling the spei droughts of the stations at three various time scales at the end the performance of standalone gep is evaluated under both the local and external analysis types in general external results of the standalone gep table 10 are better than the corresponding models at the local analysis the standalone gep results in tables 3 8 except for modeling the spei 12 at the test phase of kecioren spei 12 at the beypazari spei 12 at the test phase of polatli spei 6 and spei 12 at the kizilcahamam spei 12 at the test phase of esenboga spei 6 and spei 12 at nallihan therefore it can be generally concluded that the local performances of the standalone gep models are superior to the external performances of the relevant gep for modeling the long term spei i e spei 12 it can be attributed to the least kendall s τ correlations between the neighboring stations in spei 12 than that of spei 3 and spei 6 see table 10 however as a general conclusion the spei drought data at the neighboring stations can be applied for modeling the spei droughts of any target location when the target station drought data are not available 4 discussion the standalone and hybrid models developed at the studied sites showed the worst and best performances for modeling the spei 3 and spei 12 respectively it can be justified considering the fact that the number of months used to calculate the spei drought data at different time scales are increased with increasing the time scale i e from spei 3 to spei 12 therefore the performance of spei modeling increases from spei 3 to spei 12 due to the increased autocorrelations in the data series it was found that the non linear bl presented slightly better performances compared to the linear ar arma the spei drought is expected to illustrate a non linear behavior as it is calculated using two terms of precipitation and evapotranspiration that include a non linear nature behavior therefore the spei drought data of the studied locations can be well modeled via the non linear bl than that of the linear ar arma literature review in the hydrological science shows that the performance of different mother wavelets has not been usually assessed to develop the hybrid w ai models results of this study illustrated that different mother wavelets could provide various performances when coupling on the ai based models so that db4 and symlet were introduced as the best performing mother wavelets therefore the accuracy of various mother wavelets must be carefully considered and tested when modeling the hydrological parameters time series the applicability of neighboring stations data to model the hydrological variables at target station under the external analysis approach is confirmed by some scholars for example mehdizadeh 2018 estimated daily reference evapotranspiration of each target station through the weather data of nearby station containing the same climate the external performance of two types of the anfis was evaluated by sanikhani and kisi 2012 for estimation of monthly streamflow of two hydrometric stations in turkey mehdizadeh et al 2019b developed the ai based mars and gep for estimating the monthly streamflow of two hydrometric stations in iran and two other ones in canada they utilized the streamflow of neighboring station to estimate the streamflow of target station deo et al 2018 developed the standalone mlp and its hybrid with the firefly optimization algorithm in order to model the wind speed of each target location by using the wind speed data of five neighboring location located in iran further studies such as lu et al 2018 wu et al 2019 and fan et al 2019 have also been reported on the use of data from the adjacent stations for modeling the pan evaporation and reference evapotranspiration of each target site the results of above mentioned studies verify the possibility of use of the data of nearby stations under an external analysis approach which are in agreement with the outcomes of the present work the ai based models such as standalone gep and its hybrid with the wavelet analysis applied in this study may illustrate some disadvantages one of the most important of these flaws could be overfitting problem an ai based model that includes overfitting represents satisfactory results in the train period while its performance is relatively poor in the test period when comparing the accuracy of both the train and test stages fathian et al 2019 however whole the standalone gep and hybrid w gep models are not expected to illustrate overfitting issue indeed the hydrological parameters time series like droughts include two stochastic and deterministic components mehdizadeh 2020 the time series and ai models are respectively able to capturing the stochastic and deterministic segments in other words they focus only on one term in modeling the hydrological events while a precise modeling technique should consider both terms in the modeling process in this context hybrid ai time series models can be recommended it is apparent that the performance of any modeling technique could be improved via the data pre processing this study applied the wavelet analysis as a popular data pre processing approach for developing the hybrid w gep models other data pre processing methods including the empirical mode decomposition emd ensemble emd eemd variational mode decomposition vmd etc could also be suggested to increase the accuracy of ai based models when modeling the hydrological phenomena such as drought 5 conclusions this study aimed to modeling the spei droughts at three time scales including the spei 3 spei 6 and spei 12 for six stations distributed across ankara turkey to achieve this goal three types of the models were applied consisting of the time series i e the linear ar arma and non linear bl standalone gep and hybrid w gep five mother wavelets i e haar db4 symlet meyer and coifflet under two decomposition levels were used when developing the hybrid w gep models it was found that the non linear bl presented higher modeling accuracy than the linear ar arma at all the considered time scales and stations studied a comparative assessment of the standalone gep and hybrid w gep models revealed that all the developed hybrid models outperformed the standalone ones among the various mother wavelets used in this study db4 for modeling the spei 3 and symlet for modeling the spei 6 and spei 12 were found as the best wavelets given two decomposition levels the performance of all the hybrid w gep models was better than that of considering one decomposition level in general the hybrid w gep models illustrated the best performance among the three different types of models developed at the studied locations furthermore all the implemented models provided the highest and least modeling accuracy for spei 12 and spei 3 respectively finally the spei droughts of each station were modeled using the neighboring stations spei data through the standalone gep under an external analysis a performance evaluation of the standalone gep under both local and external conditions indicated that the external approach generally yielded better estimation of the spei 3 and spei 6 compared to the local approach while the developed standalone gep models under a local approach performed better than the external approach for modeling the spei 12 droughts of the studied locations literature review in the field of hydrological parameters modeling shows that the hybrid models developed via combining the wavelet and ai techniques have been usually implemented using a particular mother wavelet however the results of the current study demonstrated that different results may be achieved using the various mother wavelets hence it is recommended that the best wavelet with the highest level of accuracy be selected when developing the hybrid w ai models this study applied the linear ar arma and non linear bl standalone gep and hybrid w gep models future research works could be focused on developing other models including the time series based linear arima and fractionally arima non linear autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity arch and self exciting threshold autoregressive setar as well as hybrid models via combining the wavelet with various ai approaches such as ann anfis svm etc moreover the methodologies presented in this study are recommended to be used for modeling the other hydrological parameters including the precipitation evaporation streamflow and so on credit authorship contribution statement saeid mehdizadeh conceptualization methodology

5448,hazard mapping is essential for risk assessment and mitigation measurement design in flood prone areas in europe long term fluvial stage data acquired since the 18th century represent a resource of fundamental importance in this perspective especially where rivers monitoring is completed by multiple stations distributed along the course in these conditions a major challenge is represented by the possibility of incorporating multiple probability models representative of river dynamics at different distance from the mouth in flood hazard estimation over so large areas in this paper we propose a new procedure of hazard estimation based on lidar derived flood inundation model and multiple hydrometric time series that using a specifically developed algorithm code of interpolation assignation of multiple probability models has the potential to work at local to national scale providing reliable estimation also in presence of urban areas we applied the developed procedure and associated algorithm code to a selected study area in southern italy recently hit by a destructive flood event and quantitatively evaluate model performance confidence interval computation provides an overview of uncertainty related to flood magnitude estimation by extreme value analysis indicating a substantial uncertainty related to 500 years flood magnitude estimation sensitivity analysis indicates a high degree of robustness of the developed procedure result validation through comparison against the observed 2015 flood event indicates that the method has the potential to support flood hazard analysis at regional to national scale limits of method application are related to the basic assumption of stationarity of hydrologic time series that might be considered too simplicistic in a changing climate also related to the limited length of some time series that only in few cases have no discontinuities the absence of propagation modelling as part of the estimation procedure might be considered as an additional limit since in complex topographic and hydrological conditions it might provide a better evaluation of flood hazard however comparison of the 500 years flood derived from our procedure and 500 years flood scenarios derived by 2d hydraulic simulations indicate the capabilities of our procedure in identifying area floodable by specific events with only local overestimation that generally increase safety in human life protection perspective this confirms the potential of considering multiple probability models distributed along the river course in flood hazard estimation perspective and indicate that our procedure can be a valid alternative to simulation based flood hazard estimation procedures keywords flood hazard probability analysis interpolation lidar 2d hydraulic modelling 1 introduction in 2007 the european parliament enacted the floods directive 60 ec on the assessment and management of flood risk with the aim of providing a new approach to manage flood risk and protecting urban and rural communities from the increasing impact of floods i e frequency magnitude and losses e g knox 1993 the article 6 of this directive underlines the need of providing for each member state flood hazard and risk maps for identified flood prone areas evaluating flood hazard requires the production of flood inundation maps showing the water depth during flood events of specific magnitudes and the definition of a reference flood scenario that represents the boundary condition of the analysis i e design or extreme event e g woo and waylen 1986 flood hazard is often evaluated on the basis of the outcome of physically based models that simulating the water movement across the floodplain produce multiple inundation scenarios e g bates and de roo 2000 di baldassarre et al 2010 de risi et al 2015 gonçalves et al 2015 teng et al 2017 toda et al 2017 for regions where fluvial stage records and topographic data are available flood hazard can be evaluated using simple statistical models or more complex machine learning algorithms associated with gis processing e g wang et al 2015 alfonso et al 2016 nuswantoro et al 2016 for instance hazard maps of urban and suburban areas can be obtained from high resolution inundation models and probability analysis of hydrometric time series e g guerriero et al 2018 long term rainfall time series can be a good source of information that incorporated into gis frameworks provides a basis for flood hazard map production e g toosi et al 2019 in absence of monitoring data flood hazard assessment and flood inundation map production can be completed on the basis of historical information provided by locals and or geomorphological observations analyses hosking and wallis 1986 furdada et al 2008 magliulo and valente 2014 manfreda et al 2014 montané et al 2017 ideally a flood inundation map indicating the floodable area in relation to a specific fluvial stage should be produced using numerical floodplain models developed on the basis of lidar data montané et al 2017 this would make the floodplain zonation as accurate as expected for land planning purposes especially in the presence of urban areas evaluating flood hazard in urban areas can be a very challenging task due to the complex interaction between human activities and fluvial dynamics e g di baldassarre et al 2013 especially in presence of mitigation measurements on the long term protection levees can affect flood hazard inducing an increase comparable to that caused by the ongoing climate change in fact a number of studies suggest that flood losses are increasing due to the rapid growing of the exposure and wealth in protected floodplain sectors where the presence of protecting levees alters the hazard perception i e levee effect tobin 1995 encouraging new human settlements in areas potentially subject to extreme events e g barredo 2009 domeneghetti et al 2015 that s why the choice of the reference event for both protection levees design and flood hazard evaluation has to be accurately determined the reference flood scenario representing the boundary condition of the analysis should be defined on the basis of long and continuous records of fluvial stage data e g sutcliffe 1987 even though it can be a very challenging task depending on the availability the length the reliability and the continuity of monitoring records e g hosking and wallis 1986 in absence of fluvial stage data and reliable historical information the reference flood scenario could correspond to a well known event selected because of the society wants to protect itself from against an event of corresponding magnitude garry and graszk 1999 in italy the guidelines of the ministero dell ambiente e della tutela del territorio e del mare in english ministry of environment and land protection https www minambiente it indicates as reference extreme event or in other words the largest boundary of the hazard zonation an event of magnitude corresponding to that of a 300 500 year flood typically a 500 year flood is considered since the 18th century the european rivers have been monitored through repeated human observations of water level readings on staff gauges first and subsequently through modern hydrometers that continuously record river stages see for instance http www bafg de grdc en home homepage node html similarly since 1918 the italian fluvial network has been monitored by an increasing number of hydrometers nowadays hundreds of stations water level readings observed at selected locations were made available in the form of bollettini idrografici i e monitoring bulletins before 1927 and in the form of annali idrologici in italian http www acq isprambiente it annalipdf after 1927 in 2000 most of the monitoring network has been modernized through the installation of continuous recording gauges managed by specific centri funzionali regionali in english regional authorities www centrofunzionale regione campania it although hydrometric time series are often discontinuous and in a number of cases cover only a limited time period a so large database represents a resource of basic importance for flood hazard and risk analysis across large areas e g domeneghetti et al 2015 particularly many river courses are monitored by multiple stations installed at different distances from the mouth since river dynamic and flood potential is related to the extent and topography of the contributing drainage area the use of multiple probability models would make the hazard evaluation more reliable and able to support policy decision oriented to flood mitigation e g recommended uses occupation restrictions and flood insurance plan development e g linnenluecke and griffiths 2010 ghizzoni et al 2012 however the consideration of multiple probability models in flood hazard represents a very challenging task because of the complexity related to the spatialization of multiple probability models representative of the river dynamic at specific locations in a high dimensionality framework and the joint production of a flood hazard map e g ghizzoni et al 2012 on this basis and in order to provide a new tool for flood hazard mapping able to take advantage of such amount of information we developed and tested a new simplified practice and associated algorithm and related code for flood hazard mapping in presence of multiple gauging stations the proposed practice based on the use of high resolution lidar derived digital topography and discontinuous hydrometric data registered by multiple monitoring stations would solve in a simplified manner challenges related to probability models fusion making the approach suitable for both local to national high resolution flood hazard mapping in this perspective the basic assumption of stationarity of extreme value statistics is considered we demonstrate its suitability in hazard evaluation and discuss advantages and drawbacks through an application to the lower course of the calore river in southern italy and associated tributary reaches i e ufita tammaro and sabato rivers and a segment of the volturno river fig 1 to support our interpretation of the potential of the proposed method we completed multiple 2d hydraulic simulation to derive 500 year flood scenarios and compared results from these simulations with the corresponding scenario provided by our hazard model 2 study area the study area extends across the benevento avellino and caserta provinces of southern italy and includes the lower course of the calore river and a number of reaches belonging to the ufita tammaro sabato and volturno rivers fig 1 the ufita tammaro and sabato rivers are tributary of the calore river while the calore river is the main tributary of the volturno river in this area a total of 8 hydrometric stations are actively registering fluvial stages table 1 see black symbols of fig 1 for position stations installation was completed between 1924 and 2001 those installed before 1999 consisted of a staff gauge and water stage data were acquired using the observational method since 2000 visual staff gauges were discontinued and replaced with continuous recording stations equipped with ultrasonic water level sensors the study area comprises a 60 km long valley reach of the calore river characterized by a single active channel and a pseudo meandering configuration with an average calculated sinuosity of 1 4 the length of the valley segments of the calore s tributaries considered in the analysis variates between 3 km of the ufita river and 11 km of the sabato river and the sinuosity variates between the 1 25 of the sabato river and the 1 42 of the ufita river the valley geometry of the calore river and its tributaries is strongly controlled by tectonics and the northern side of its lower reach is dominated by the remnant of a glacis and five orders of middle pleistocene to holocene river terraces magliulo et al 2007 the southern side is conversely characterized by telescopically arranged alluvial fans forming the northern foothill of the camposauro mount magliulo et al 2007 the length of the valley reach of the volturno river considered in the analysis is approximately 14 km its sinuosity is around 1 4 and has a pseudo meandering configuration in this area the landscape has a predominantly agricultural use with diffuse vineyards and olive groves this area has been recently affected by a destructive flood on october 15th 2015 the overflow of the tammaro and calore rivers hit the town of benevento in southern italy and the central sector of its province grelle et al 2019 revellino et al 2019 the event caused two deaths and severe damage to infrastructures buildings and local agriculture and most of the protection embankments i e artificial levees built along the calore river in the 20th century were surmounted and or failed inundating otherwise protected areas this event has a number of historical precedents in this area e g guerriero et al 2018 for instance in october 1949 a storm induced a destructive flood that has been remembered for its impact on the society and territory it was responsible for 47 fatalities and severe damage to buildings infrastructure and service lines 3 materials and methods 3 1 materials for our practice development and its application we used multiple fluvial stage time series and a 4 4 m digital surface model dsm water level time series in the form of annual maxima were derived by daily measurements recorded between 1924 and 2018 at 8 monitoring stations installed within the study area that comprises the lower course of the calore river reaches of its lower tributaries i e ufita tammaro and sabato rivers and a reach of the volturno river fig 1 the size of the samples varies from 19 to 68 values and shorter series have no discontinuities see table 1 for details the 4 4 m dsm was resampled from a 1 1 m lidar dsm acquired between 2011 and 2012 across the italian national territory http www pcn minambiente it mattm progetto pst dati lidar the vertical accuracy of the lidar data has been estimated in 0 25 m resampling was completed using cubic convolution e g wu et al 2008 3 2 probability analysis and reference flood scenario as first step of our analysis the workflow is reported in fig 2 we completed univariate statistical analyses of available time series fig 2 step 1a and subsequently used a generalized extreme value parametric distribution function gev e g hosking and wallis 1986 to fit the annual maxima time series i e discontinuous complementary cumulative distribution function ccdf registered at the hydrometric stations located in the study area table 1 see fig 1 for position and estimate the probability of exceedance p of each specific fluvial stage x in the range of interest and related return periods fig 2 step 2a the gev function has the following form 1 f x e x p 1 ξ x μ σ 1 ξ f o r ξ 0 where ξ is the shape parameter σ is the scale parameter and µ is the location parameter gev distribution functions parameterization was automatically completed using the distribution fitter tool implemented in matlab see table 2 for models parameters overall residual analysis indicates a very high goodness of fit of the probability models r2 0 97 for the gev functions fig 3 for our development we considered a 500 year flood estimated in terms of magnitude i e water depth using the gev distribution functions i e probability models this choice is consistent with the guideline of the italian ministry of environment and land protection suggesting that a 300 500 year event should be considered as reference flood scenario in hazard evaluation perspective furthermore flooding events with return periods shorter than 100 years should not be considered as reference for hazard analysis even if they represent a well known event that society wants to protect itself from garry and graszk 1999 our models indicate that the 500 year event has an estimated magnitude that ranges between 5 m of the chianche station and 11 m of the solopaca hydrometric station for the calore river and its tributaries and between 5 m of the amorosi and 7 5 m of the ponte limatola stations for the segment of the volturno river since it is not possible to reliably evaluate the long term effect caused by climate change and human action over the study area i e nonlinearity e g bayazit 2015 these estimations are completed in the assumptions of stationary of hydrologic time series this assumption the limited length of records that in some cases is below the recommended sample size of 30 years e g li et al 2018 and the potential presence of discontinuities are sources of epistemic uncertainty in flood frequency analysis based on extreme values statistics e g merz and thieken 2005 2009 on this basis and in order to describe uncertainty related to flood magnitude estimation we derived the 95 confidence intervals using the maximum likelihood estimator mle implemented in matlab e g rust et al 2008 the choice of this estimator was consistent with the concept of reduced complexity behind the overall developed procedure the obtained probability distributions gev models were used as basis to prepare a probability of exceedance database fig 2 step 3a this database contains probability of exceedance of fluvial stages in the range between 0 and the overall maximum estimated magnitude of the reference flood event in the study area i e the 11 m of the solopaca hydrometric station particularly each line of the database contains the reference fluvial stage in the first column and the probability of exceedance of that stage at the considered stations 1 8 in the second third and ninth columns a column for each considered station fig 2 step 3a 3 3 gis processing probability models fusion and hazard mapping as a second step of our analysis the workflow is reported in fig 2 we derived a flood inundation model of the study area and used an interpolation substitution routine implemented in matlab to spatialize the probability of exceedance of each specific fluvial stage at each station and assign the obtained probability values i e probability raster cells to each corresponding cell of the inundation model i e cell with the same x and y coordinates and same fluvial stage the flood inundation model i e relative elevation above the river fig 2 step 3b was computed as a difference between a bare earth airborne 4 4 m lidar derived digital surface model fig 2 step 1b and a digital elevation model of the water surface wdem fig 2 step 2b the wdem was computed through the interpolation of a triangulated irregular network of the water elevation data at cross sections constructed along the river reaches following cook and merwade 2009 cross sections position and shape were consistently defined as function of the geometry of the river course see fig 1 for details the overall maximum estimated 500 year flood magnitude was considered for flood inundation model normalization i e fig 2 step 4b in other words this value i e the 11 m of the solopaca hydrometric station was used as maximum height of the resulting model normalization was completed in order to decrease the overall size of the model making the analysis runnable on a consumer grade pc once obtained the normalized flood inundation model i e fig 2 step 4b was used as basis for deriving a flood hazard map using multiple probability models especially after data acquisition and pre processing the developed interpolation assignment routine represented by the purple circle in the workflow scheme of fig 2 was run and the flood hazard map derived from multiple probability models fusion was created the developed algorithm and associated matlab code iteratively extracts each line of the probability database containing the reference fluvial stage and associated probability for each considered station and interpolates probability values across the study area on the basis of the utm position of each station creating a probability raster e g int e1 of fig 2 interpolation is completed using the bi harmonic method implemented in matlab this method has been chosen because of its capability of automatically working across the entire study area rather than the convex hull of data once spatialized the interpolated values of probability of exceedance are iteratively assigned to corresponding cells in terms of x and y coordinated of the inundation model that contains the modeled fluvial stages the routine ends after completing the assignment of the interpolated probability values associated to the maximum modeled fluvial stage i e int e11 where 11 correspond to the maximum magnitude in meters of the 500 year flood for our study area this algorithm was coded in matlab environment and the salient parts of the code are reported in fig 2 the flood hazard map is subsequently classified to better depict probability of flood on annual basis between 1 and 0 002 corresponding to a return period of 1 500 years in addition the hazard map is classified to depict floodplain zonation in flood perspective it is completed identifying four zones each corresponding to a specific hazard range these zones are selected on the basis of floodplain morphology and in accordance with guidelines of the distretti idrografici in english hydrographic district authorities https www minambiente it direttive distretti idrografici especially we identified a i very high hazard zone floodable by a 1 5 year floods a ii high hazard zone floodable by a 5 30 year floods a iii medium hazard zone floodable by a 30 100 year floods and a iv low hazard zone floodable by a 100 500 year floods flood magnitude for each specific return period is derived from probability analysis considering that the theoretical return period is the inverse of the probability of exceedance 3 4 sensitivity analysis and procedure validation to evaluate the robustness of the developed procedure algorithm we run a specific sensitivity analysis excluding a selected station of the study area once obtained the hazard map and the topography based inundation model were used as a basis to reconstruct a probability model for the area around the selected station for our application we chose the ponte valentino station n 3 of fig 1 in the eastern part of the study area and the corresponding time series probability model model reconstruction for comparison and accuracy evaluation was completed considering both elevation above the river and associate probability of flooding i e probability of exceedance of that elevation above the river or stage across an arbitrary selected area around the station position a dataset composed of values of elevation above the river i e stage and associated probability was derived and subsequently fitted with a three terms gaussian model r2 0 997 this model was then compared with the probability model derived by the application of the gev distribution function for comparison purpose we used the r2 coefficient to show the degree of correctness of the model subsequently in order to validate results from our application we completed a comparative analysis of the 125 and 200 years floods extent predicted by our hazard model and that observed during the event of october 2015 across the lower sector of the calore river by guerriero et al 2018 see fig 1 the choice of the 125 and 200 years flood predicted by our hazard model is related to the estimation completed by guerriero et al 2018 especially they modeled a return period of the october 2015 event of 125 years in relation to the solopaca time series and a return period of 200 years in relation to the benevento time series to validate the model we considered the degree of matching of the observed vs predicted flooded areas across this part of the study area e g molinari et al 2019 in addition in order to understand the capability of our method to simulate low frequency events and compare our approach with deterministic hydrodynamic models that might better depict flood behaviour over complex topography we used a 2d simulation of flood propagation to derive 500 years flood inundation scenarios in this perspective we used the river stages corresponding to that of a 500 years flood estimated by our probability models to evaluate the corresponding peck of discharge since this analysis was completed across the lower sector of the calore river for which rating curve data were available this evaluation was completed considering the rating curve of the solopaca station for the calore river and that of the amorosi station for the volturno river the rating curves of the solopaca and amorosi stations derived by fitting specific data reported in the annali idrologici http www acq isprambiente it annalipdf with a power law fig 3a b indicate a 500 years discharge of 2310 and 1139 m3 s respectively once evaluated the estimated discharges were used to construct a number of simplified synthetic hydrographs having a consistent symmetric triangular shape and peak of discharge and durations equal to 12 24 and 48 h respectively i e different flood volumes fig 3c each set of synthetic hydrographs was used to run a flo 2d hydraulic model to compute flow velocity depth and extent of the inundation area e g peña and nardi 2018 in this perspective a 10 10 m dem resampled from a 1 1 m lidar derived dem was used to support computational grid generation across the areas of interest for our application we used a 20 20 m grid the analyses were preformed across the area considered for result validation purpose see fig 1 as boundary conditions we selected an inflow element for calore river and an inflow element for the volturno river and a number of outflow elements distributed along the lower boundary of the area next to the confluence between the calore and volturno rivers flood scenarios obtained by 2d flood simulation were then compared with the 500 years flood scenario obtained with the developed procedure 4 results and discussions 4 1 probability of floods fig 4 reports univariate statistics and generalized extreme value probability models used for flood hazard map computation through the proposed fusion procedure and associated matlab code boxplots of fig 4a c e g i k m and o show the univariate statistics of time series registered at the selected hydrometric stations see also table 1 graphs a c e g and k depicting the dynamic of the calore river show maximum values of fluvial stage that consistently increase toward the confluence with the volturno river for instance while the maximum registered value of fluvial stage at the station of ponte calore is of approximately 4 3 m the maximum at the station of solopaca is of approximately 10 m as well the median of the series shows a similar spatial trend excepting for the station of apice that is represented by a slightly lower value in comparison with the median of the ponte calore station the chianche station installed along the sabato river shows a maximum around 4 5 m and a median of approximately 1 5 m the stations installed along the considered segment of the volturno river show similar maxima around 4 7 m and median values between 2 5 and 2 9 m probability graphs of fig 4b d f h j l n and p show relative frequency distributions and gev models that fit the theoretical probability of exceedance of fluvial stages forming registered time series on annual basis most of the time series have been best fitted by type iii ξ 0 generalized extreme value functions an exception is the time series registered at the apice station that has been best fitted by a type ii generalized extreme value functions ξ 0 probability models indicate along the reach of the calore river considered in the analysis a magnitude of the 10 year flood variable between approximately 3 8 and 7 1 m and a magnitude of the 100 year flood between approximately 4 5 and 9 5 m along the volturno river the magnitude of the 10 year flood has been estimated by our models in approximately 4 m while the magnitude of the 100 year flood variates between 4 7 and 6 1 m at the chianche station magnitudes of 2 7 and 4 2 m were estimated for the 10 and 100 year floods respectively the uncertainty related to this estimation is depicted in the graphs by 95 confidence intervals dashed lines overall time series registered along the upper course of the calore river i e ponte calore apice and ponte valentino show a larger uncertainty range in the estimation for instance the magnitude of the 500 years flood shows a maximum range of uncertainty of approximately 15 m at the apice station lower uncertainties are associated to the estimation derived by the analysis of time series registered along the lower course of the calore river the sabato and the volturno rivers especially a maximum of approximately 10 m has been estimated at the solopaca station 9 m at the chianche station and 5 m at the ponte limatola station as indicated by coles 2001 although the generalized extreme value probability function is suitable to describe the statistical behaviour of annual maxima it has the disadvantage of underestimating the intensity of very high return period events to mitigate this drawback guerriero et al 2018 used this probability model in combination with a gamma function that has the potential to better estimate the intensity of very high return period events in particular models combination was completed on the basis of univariate statistics of selected time series in addition rust et al 2008 indicate that in presence of limited samples the mle estimator tends to underestimate the magnitude of 95 confidence interval that needs to be carefully determined as a measure of uncertainty associated to flood hazard and risk evaluation e g apel et al 2004 to mitigate this drawback a bayesian approach is often preferred to a classical statistics approach e g parkers and demeritt 2016 in this case since the main goal of the paper is to present a procedure of flood hazard evaluation that allow to merge multiple probability models over large areas rather than optimize probability model performance we represent river behaviour using only the gev models this also support the choice of the basic assumption of stationarity of the hydrologic time series in addition time series used for model development have been registered at instrumented sections typically corresponding to bridge basement in this condition fluvial stages series do not account for the mid and long term natural variability in river cross sectional geometry this condition represents a simplification in the analysis that should be taken into account in results evaluation e g magliulo et al 2013 4 2 flood hazard maps fig 5 reports the hazard maps derived by the developed practice accounting for multiple probability models fusion through a specifically developed algorithm and related matlab code fig 5a depicts the probability of exceedance while fig 5b depicts the zonation in flood perspective the probability of exceedance map of the study area fig 5a comprising the lower course of the calore river reaches of its major tributaries and a segment of the volturno river is a quantitative interpretation of the hazard level across the corresponding floodplains connected to the occurrence of storm induced floods of different magnitudes the map is a simple tools suitable for identifying the hazard level of each human structure located within the analysed floodplains on annual basis and represent a first step toward the evaluation of flood risk for this area being estimated on the basis of a flood inundation model derived by a high resolution topography high values of hazard in flood perspective dominate in zones with a low relative elevation above the river e g guerriero et al 2018 for the area of study flood hazard decrease as function of the distance from the river and spatial variation is controlled by the cross sectional geometry of the river valley especially in case of rapid variation in elevation between the river bed and the adjoining floodplain flood hazard quickly variate form very high to low values the use of multiple fluvial stage based probability models to estimate flood hazard make the proposed procedure code able to work at basin scale and has the potential to support hazard evaluation in flood perspective at regional and national scale a number of authors have used multiple probability models for flood hazard and risk assessment e g ghizzoni et al 2012 daneshkhah et al 2016 however in most of the cases the hazard evaluation provides only an estimation of magnitude and frequency of floods a final map suitable for effective land planning is not developed enhancing the complexity of the spatialization of multiple probability models that our simplified method completes in a simple manner in other cases rainfall time series registered at multiple gauging stations have been incorporated into gis based analysis for flood hazard spatialization purpose e g england et al 2014 wang et al 2015 toosi et al 2019 the hazard zonation map of fig 5b show four zones of the floodplains that can be flooded by events with specific return periods this map provides an overview on the hydrologic response of the floodplain in flood perspective and is a basis for future land planning guiding recommendation of uses occupation restrictions and flood insurance plan development e g linnenluecke and griffiths 2010 ghizzoni et al 2012 especially most of the analysed floodplains have a high to very high hazard and zones of medium to low hazard are poorly developed an exception is the industrial area of benevento and the lower sector of the segment of the volturno river considered in the analysis where a large zone floodable by a 100 500 year event is depicted in the map fig 5b fig 6 reports local magnifications of mapped flood hazard using the developed practice three zones of particular complexity in term of hydrologic behaviour of rivers and presence of human settlements are depicted 1 the industrial area of benevento fig 6a and b respectively 2 a sector of the urban and sub urban area of benevento fig 6c and d respectively and 3 the confluence between the calore and the volturno rivers fig 6e and f respectively in these zones the complex interaction between human activities and fluvial dynamics e g di baldassarre et al 2013 is interpreted by the proposed procedure without considering the presence of mitigation measurements i e artificial levees although this is a limitation of the procedure that might be implemented in the future it should affect only the hazard evaluation for events of return period lower than 125 200 years in fact during the flood event of the october 2015 characterized by a return period estimated in 125 200 years most of the embankments protecting the occupied floodplains were surmounted or destroyed e g revellino et al 2019 in this perspective the map represents a cautionary scenario that might be considered as acceptable since it is oriented to human protection having say that in case of embankments tall enough to contain a 500 year flood like some of those protecting the urban area of benevento the method provide a reliable estimation of the hazard level a further simplification derives by the adoption of a simple elevation based approach for the inundation model production e g teng et al 2017 while the use of high resolution lidar derived topography is a way to guarantee the reliability of the final hazard model brandt and lim 2012 this approach tends to classify areas topographically disconnected from the river course and or the flood plain as floodable in this case a preliminary identification of the area connected or connectable to the river is needed in addition although the hazard map in not fully comparable with any event map being computed on the basis of fluvial stage data it is able to simulate or be reliable for different flooding scenarios of same magnitude but generated by different rainfall spatial distribution e g guerriero et al 2018 this advantage is connected to the simplicity of the flood hazard model that being based on the relation between floodplain topography and fluvial stage is not related to a single rainfall event and consequent river discharge this makes the method able to work over large areas e g domeneghetti et al 2015 4 3 method sensitivity and results validation fig 7 shows the sensitivity analysis dataset and the result of its comparison with the ponte valentino station probability model especially the training dataset black symbols consists of approximately 26 000 values of both elevation above the river i e fluvial stage and associated probability the purple line is the gaussian function that best fit the dataset and is used for comparison purpose with the developed gev probability model the calculation of the r2 coefficient between the probability distribution derived by the flood hazard model obtained for sensitivity estimation i e the gaussian fit of the dataset and the gev model depicting the probability of exceedance derived by the ponte valentino time series suggests a very high degree of robustness of the model indicating that the logic of interpolating multiple probability values for flood hazard spatialization and mapping is a good approach for taking into account multiple probability models in addition the visual analysis of the curves suggests that while the proposed procedure tends to underestimate the probability of low magnitude events it tends to overestimate the probability of high magnitude flood this might be considered acceptable since it tends to favour human safety fig 8 a shows results from validation analysis completed on the basis of the comparison between the estimated 125 and 200 years flood scenarios and data by guerriero et al 2018 representative of the area affected by the flood event of october 2015 the map shows that the area floodable by estimated 125 and 200 years floods has a higher degree of matching with that affected by the 2015 flood especially the comparison indicates a degree of matching of 95 and 98 respectively major differences are observable at the confluence between the clore and the volturno rivers and where the morphology of the river valley is particularly complex as at the beginning of the area selected for the validation in addition at specific location the hazard model tends to slightly overestimate the extent of the flooded area i e false positive we consider this index as representative of the high accuracy of our procedure fig 8b and c shows results from flo 2d hydraulic simulation of multiple 500 years flood scenarios in terms of both extent of the flooded areas b and flow depth c derived by the 24 h flood simulation results of our modelling indicate that overall the obtained scenarios are very similar in terms of both extent of the flooded area and flood depth this motivated us to show only a single flood depth map a comparison between results of 2d hydraulic simulation and the 500 years flood derived by our procedure indicate mostly a high degree of correspondence with minor differences located at upstream area of the computational area along the right side of the valley and at the confluence with the volturno river overall the extent of the area derived by the proposed practice is larger than that indicated by hydraulic simulations even if this represents an error of estimation the consideration of a larger area corresponds to a safer condition in human life protection perspective thus it can be considered acceptable in addition the maximum flow depth derived by 2d simulation has a high degree of correspondence with that derived by probability modelling and used for deriving the 500 years discharge from rating curves 10 4 vs 10 9 m this suggests the correctness of our estimation through probability analysis and hydraulic modelling on this basis and considering that our procedure is based on high resolution topographic data that increase the reliability of this kind of analysis brandt and lim 2012 the use of multiple probability models trough the developed procedure can be considered a very important tool in flood hazard estimation that has the potential to work over large areas 5 conclusions in this paper we propose a procedure and related algorithm coded in matlab to evaluate flood hazard considering multiple probability models and high resolution topographic data that make it able to work over large areas and in presence of urban settlements it is based on a specifically developed interpolation assignation routine that spatializing probability of exceedance of fluvial stages and assigning it to corresponding cells of the topography derived flood inundation model provides a flood hazard map suitable for land planning purpose in this way the presented procedure has the potential to be applied in many fluvial contexts for which fluvial stage and topographic data are available and has no limitation to work at different scales from local to regional in particular since the italian fluvial network is monitored by hundreds of hydrometric stations this procedure has the potential to support also the evaluation of flood hazard at national scale we applied the procedure to a study area comprising the lower reach of the calore river its major tributaries and a segment of the volturno river in southern italy produced hazard maps provide an overview of the flood hazard in this area already hit by a number of destructive flood events and represent the first step toward an evaluation of flood risk especially being developed on the basis of a very high resolution topography they allow to estimate the specific hazard level for each human structure located across the analysed floodplains in this way we trained the procedure over a very heterogeneous area with diffused urban settlements with results that underline the flexibility of the procedure the robustness of the algorithm and the correctness of estimation at least for low to medium return period floods major limits of the procedure as applied to the selected area derive from the assumption of stationarity of hydrologic time series and from the choice of using a gev distribution as representative of the long term hydrologic behaviour of the river system especially in a rapidly changing environment the assumption of stationarity of hydrologic time series is reasonable in case of impossibility of reliably estimating the long term effect of the ongoing climate change and human action in this case some time series considered for our development have a limited length preventing the adoption of a nonstationary approach these limitations are responsible for substantial uncertainty related to high return period flood magnitude estimation as indicated by computed confidence level in this context it is important to notice that these limitations can be mitigated using a different probability model adopting a bayesian confidence level estimator and accounting for non stationarity of time series especially a prospective analysis of flood hazard for this area accounting for non stationarity of time series will be presented in a forthcoming paper selecting only suitable time series the absence of propagation modelling as part of the estimation procedure might be considered as an additional limit since in complex topographic and hydrological conditions it might provide a better evaluation of flood hazard having say that 2d simulation completed to supplement our interpretation of the potential of the proposed procedure indicate a high degree of correspondence with local overestimation of the floodable area by the model derived by the proposed procedure since this effect increases safety in human life protection perspective it can be considered acceptable on this basis the proposed procedure can be considered an alternative to complex hydraulic simulation based flood hazard

5448,hazard mapping is essential for risk assessment and mitigation measurement design in flood prone areas in europe long term fluvial stage data acquired since the 18th century represent a resource of fundamental importance in this perspective especially where rivers monitoring is completed by multiple stations distributed along the course in these conditions a major challenge is represented by the possibility of incorporating multiple probability models representative of river dynamics at different distance from the mouth in flood hazard estimation over so large areas in this paper we propose a new procedure of hazard estimation based on lidar derived flood inundation model and multiple hydrometric time series that using a specifically developed algorithm code of interpolation assignation of multiple probability models has the potential to work at local to national scale providing reliable estimation also in presence of urban areas we applied the developed procedure and associated algorithm code to a selected study area in southern italy recently hit by a destructive flood event and quantitatively evaluate model performance confidence interval computation provides an overview of uncertainty related to flood magnitude estimation by extreme value analysis indicating a substantial uncertainty related to 500 years flood magnitude estimation sensitivity analysis indicates a high degree of robustness of the developed procedure result validation through comparison against the observed 2015 flood event indicates that the method has the potential to support flood hazard analysis at regional to national scale limits of method application are related to the basic assumption of stationarity of hydrologic time series that might be considered too simplicistic in a changing climate also related to the limited length of some time series that only in few cases have no discontinuities the absence of propagation modelling as part of the estimation procedure might be considered as an additional limit since in complex topographic and hydrological conditions it might provide a better evaluation of flood hazard however comparison of the 500 years flood derived from our procedure and 500 years flood scenarios derived by 2d hydraulic simulations indicate the capabilities of our procedure in identifying area floodable by specific events with only local overestimation that generally increase safety in human life protection perspective this confirms the potential of considering multiple probability models distributed along the river course in flood hazard estimation perspective and indicate that our procedure can be a valid alternative to simulation based flood hazard estimation procedures keywords flood hazard probability analysis interpolation

to manage flood risk and protecting urban and rural communities from the increasing impact of floods i e frequency magnitude and losses e g knox 1993 the article 6 of this directive underlines the need of providing for each member state flood hazard and risk maps for identified flood prone areas evaluating flood hazard requires the production of flood inundation maps showing the water depth during flood events of specific magnitudes and the definition of a reference flood scenario that represents the boundary condition of the analysis i e design or extreme event e g woo and waylen 1986 flood hazard is often evaluated on the basis of the outcome of physically based models that simulating the water movement across the floodplain produce multiple inundation scenarios e g bates and de

be evaluated using simple statistical models or more complex machine learning algorithms associated with gis processing e g wang et al 2015 alfonso et al 2016 nuswantoro et al 2016 for instance hazard maps of urban and suburban areas can be obtained from high resolution inundation models and probability analysis of hydrometric time series e g guerriero et al 2018 long term rainfall time series can be a good source of information that incorporated into gis frameworks provides a basis for flood hazard map production e g toosi et al 2019 in absence of monitoring data flood hazard assessment and flood inundation map production can be completed on the basis of historical information provided by locals and or geomorphological observations analyses hosking and wallis 1986 furdada et al 2008 magliulo and valente 2014 manfreda et al 2014 montané et al 2017 ideally a flood inundation map indicating the floodable area in relation to a specific fluvial stage should be produced using numerical floodplain models developed on the basis of lidar data montané et al 2017 this would make the floodplain zonation as accurate as expected for land planning purposes especially in the presence of urban areas evaluating flood hazard in urban areas can be a very challenging task due to the complex interaction between human activities and fluvial dynamics e g di baldassarre et al 2013 especially in presence of mitigation measurements on the long term protection levees can affect flood hazard inducing an increase comparable to that caused by the ongoing climate change in fact a number of studies suggest that flood losses are increasing due to the rapid growing of the exposure and wealth in protected floodplain sectors where the presence of protecting levees alters the hazard perception i e

of the society wants to protect itself from against an event of corresponding magnitude garry and graszk 1999 in italy the guidelines of the ministero dell ambiente e della tutela del territorio e del mare in english ministry of environment and land protection https www minambiente it indicates as reference extreme event or in other words the largest boundary of the hazard zonation an event of magnitude corresponding to that of a 300 500 year flood typically a 500 year flood is considered since the 18th century the european rivers have been monitored through repeated human observations of water level readings on staff gauges first and subsequently through modern hydrometers that continuously record river stages see for instance http www bafg de grdc en home homepage node html similarly since 1918 the italian fluvial network has been monitored by an increasing number of hydrometers nowadays hundreds of stations water level readings observed at selected locations were made available in the form of bollettini idrografici i e monitoring bulletins before 1927 and in the form of annali idrologici in italian http www acq isprambiente it annalipdf after 1927 in 2000 most of the monitoring network has been modernized through the installation of continuous recording gauges managed by specific centri funzionali regionali in english regional authorities www centrofunzionale regione campania it although hydrometric time series are often discontinuous and in a number of cases cover only a limited time period a so large database represents a resource of basic importance for flood hazard and risk analysis across large areas e g domeneghetti et al 2015 particularly many river courses are monitored by multiple stations installed at different distances from the mouth since river dynamic and flood potential is related to the extent and topography of the contributing drainage area the use of multiple probability models would make the hazard evaluation more reliable and able to support policy decision oriented to flood mitigation e g recommended uses occupation restrictions and flood insurance plan development e g linnenluecke and griffiths 2010 ghizzoni et al 2012 however the consideration of multiple probability models in flood hazard represents a very challenging task because of the complexity related to the spatialization of multiple probability models representative of the river dynamic at specific locations in a high dimensionality framework and the joint production of a flood hazard map e g ghizzoni et al 2012 on this basis and in order to provide a new tool for flood hazard mapping able to take advantage of such amount of information we developed and tested a new simplified practice and associated algorithm and related code for flood hazard mapping in presence of multiple gauging stations the proposed practice based on the use of high resolution lidar derived digital topography and discontinuous hydrometric data registered by multiple monitoring stations would solve in a simplified manner challenges related to probability models fusion making the approach suitable for both local to national high resolution flood hazard mapping in this perspective the basic assumption of stationarity of extreme value statistics is considered we demonstrate its suitability in hazard evaluation and discuss advantages and drawbacks through an application to the lower course of the calore river in southern italy and associated tributary reaches i e ufita tammaro and sabato rivers and a segment of the volturno river fig 1 to support our interpretation of the potential of the proposed method we completed multiple 2d hydraulic simulation to derive 500 year flood scenarios and compared results from these simulations with the corresponding scenario provided by our hazard model 2 study area the study area extends across the benevento avellino and caserta provinces of southern italy and includes the lower course of the calore river and a number of reaches belonging to the ufita tammaro sabato and volturno rivers fig 1 the ufita tammaro and sabato rivers are tributary of the calore river while the calore river is the main tributary of the volturno river in this area a total of 8 hydrometric stations are actively registering fluvial stages table 1 see black symbols of fig 1 for position stations installation was completed between 1924 and 2001 those installed before 1999 consisted of a staff gauge and water stage data were acquired using the observational method since 2000 visual staff gauges were discontinued and replaced with continuous recording stations equipped with ultrasonic water level sensors the study area comprises a 60 km long valley reach of the calore river characterized by a single active channel and a pseudo meandering configuration with an average calculated sinuosity of 1 4 the length of the valley segments of the calore s tributaries considered in the analysis variates between 3 km of the ufita river and 11 km of the sabato river and the sinuosity variates between the 1 25 of the sabato river and the 1 42 of the ufita river the valley geometry of the calore river and its tributaries is strongly controlled by tectonics and the northern side of its lower reach is dominated by the remnant of a glacis and five orders of middle pleistocene to holocene river terraces magliulo et al 2007 the southern side is conversely characterized by telescopically arranged alluvial fans forming the northern foothill of the camposauro mount magliulo et al 2007 the length of the valley reach of the volturno river considered in the analysis is approximately 14 km its sinuosity is around 1 4 and has a pseudo meandering configuration in this area the landscape has a predominantly agricultural use with diffuse vineyards and olive groves this area has been recently affected by a destructive flood on october 15th 2015 the overflow of the tammaro and calore rivers hit the town of benevento in southern italy and the central sector of its province grelle et al 2019 revellino et al 2019 the event caused two deaths and severe damage to infrastructures buildings and local agriculture and most of the protection embankments i e artificial levees built along the calore river in the 20th century were surmounted and or failed inundating otherwise protected areas this event has a number of historical precedents in this area e g guerriero et al 2018 for instance in october 1949 a storm induced a destructive flood that has been remembered for its impact on the society and territory it was responsible for 47 fatalities and severe damage to buildings infrastructure and service lines 3 materials and methods 3 1 materials for our practice development and its application we used multiple fluvial stage time series and a 4 4 m digital surface model dsm water level time series in the form of annual maxima were derived by daily measurements recorded between 1924 and 2018 at 8 monitoring stations installed within the study area that comprises the lower course of the calore river reaches of its lower tributaries i e ufita tammaro and sabato rivers and a reach of the volturno river fig 1 the size of the samples varies from 19 to 68 values and shorter series have no discontinuities see table 1 for details the 4 4 m dsm was resampled from a 1 1 m lidar dsm acquired between 2011 and 2012 across the italian national territory http www pcn minambiente it mattm progetto pst dati lidar the vertical accuracy of the lidar data has been estimated in 0 25 m resampling was completed using cubic convolution e g wu et al 2008 3 2 probability analysis and reference flood scenario as first step of our analysis the workflow is reported in fig 2 we completed univariate statistical analyses of available time series fig 2 step 1a and subsequently used a generalized extreme value parametric distribution function gev e g hosking and wallis 1986 to fit the annual maxima time series i e discontinuous complementary cumulative distribution function ccdf registered at the hydrometric stations located in the study area table 1 see fig 1 for position and estimate the probability of exceedance p of each specific fluvial stage x in the range of interest and related return periods fig 2 step 2a the gev function has the following form 1 f x e x p 1 ξ x μ σ 1 ξ f o r ξ 0 where ξ is the shape parameter σ is the scale parameter and µ is the location parameter gev distribution functions parameterization was automatically completed using the distribution fitter tool implemented in matlab see table 2 for models parameters overall residual analysis indicates a very high goodness of fit of the probability models r2 0 97 for the gev functions fig 3 for our development we considered a 500 year flood estimated in terms of magnitude i e water depth using the gev distribution functions i e probability models this choice is consistent with the guideline of the italian ministry of environment and land protection suggesting that a 300 500 year event should be considered as reference flood scenario in hazard evaluation perspective furthermore flooding events with return periods shorter than 100 years should not be considered as reference for hazard analysis even if they represent a well known event that society wants to protect itself from garry and graszk 1999 our models indicate that the 500 year event has an estimated magnitude that ranges between 5 m of the chianche station and 11 m of the solopaca hydrometric station for the calore river and its tributaries and between 5 m of the amorosi and 7 5 m of the ponte limatola stations for the segment of the volturno river since it is not possible to reliably evaluate the long term effect caused by climate change and human action over the study area i e nonlinearity e g bayazit 2015 these estimations are completed in the assumptions of stationary of hydrologic time series this assumption the limited length of records that in some cases is below the recommended sample size of 30 years e g li et al 2018 and the potential presence of discontinuities are sources of epistemic uncertainty in flood frequency analysis based on extreme values statistics e g merz and thieken 2005 2009 on this basis and in order to describe uncertainty related to flood magnitude estimation we derived the 95 confidence intervals using the maximum likelihood estimator mle implemented in matlab e g rust et al 2008 the choice of this estimator was consistent with the concept of reduced complexity behind the overall developed procedure the obtained probability distributions gev models were used as basis to prepare a probability of exceedance database fig 2 step 3a this database contains probability of exceedance of fluvial stages in the range between 0 and the overall maximum estimated magnitude of the reference flood event in the study area i e the 11 m of the solopaca hydrometric station particularly each line of the database contains the reference fluvial stage in the first column and the probability of exceedance of that stage at the considered stations 1 8 in the second third and ninth columns a column for each considered station fig 2 step 3a 3 3 gis processing probability models fusion and hazard mapping as a second step of our analysis the workflow is reported in fig 2 we derived a flood inundation model of the study area and used an interpolation substitution routine implemented in matlab to spatialize the probability of exceedance of each specific fluvial stage at each station and assign the obtained probability values i e probability raster cells to each corresponding cell of the inundation model i e cell with the same x and y coordinates and same fluvial stage the flood inundation model i e relative elevation above the river fig 2 step 3b was computed as a difference between a bare earth airborne 4 4 m lidar derived digital surface model fig 2 step 1b and a digital elevation model of the water surface wdem fig 2 step 2b the wdem was computed through the interpolation of a triangulated irregular network of the water elevation data at cross sections constructed along the river reaches following cook and merwade 2009 cross sections position and shape were consistently defined as function of the geometry of the river course see fig 1 for details the overall maximum estimated 500 year flood magnitude was considered for flood inundation model normalization i e fig 2 step 4b in other words this value i e the 11 m of the solopaca hydrometric station was used as maximum height of the resulting model normalization was completed in order to decrease the overall size of the model making the analysis runnable on a consumer grade pc once obtained the normalized flood inundation model i e fig 2 step 4b was used as basis for deriving a flood hazard map using multiple probability models especially after data acquisition and pre processing the developed interpolation assignment routine represented by the purple circle in the workflow scheme of fig 2 was run and the flood hazard map derived from multiple probability models fusion was created the developed algorithm and associated matlab code iteratively extracts each line of the probability database containing the reference fluvial stage and associated probability for each considered station and interpolates probability values across the study area on the basis of the utm position of each station creating a probability raster e g int e1 of fig 2 interpolation is completed using the bi harmonic method implemented in matlab this method has been chosen because of its capability of automatically working across the entire study area rather than the convex hull of data once spatialized the interpolated values of probability of exceedance are iteratively assigned to corresponding cells in terms of x and y coordinated of the inundation model that contains the modeled fluvial stages the routine ends after completing the assignment of the interpolated probability values associated to the maximum modeled fluvial stage i e int e11 where 11 correspond to the maximum magnitude in meters of the 500 year flood for our study area this algorithm was coded in matlab environment and the salient parts of the code are reported in fig 2 the flood hazard map is subsequently classified to better depict probability of flood on annual basis between 1 and 0 002 corresponding to a return period of 1 500 years in addition the hazard map is classified to depict floodplain zonation in flood perspective it is completed identifying four zones each corresponding to a specific hazard range these zones are selected on the basis of floodplain morphology and in accordance with guidelines of the distretti idrografici in english hydrographic district authorities https www minambiente it direttive distretti idrografici especially we identified a i very high hazard zone floodable by a 1 5 year floods a ii high hazard zone floodable by a 5 30 year floods a iii medium hazard zone floodable by a 30 100 year floods and a iv low hazard zone floodable by a 100 500 year floods flood magnitude for each specific return period is derived from probability analysis considering that the theoretical return period is the inverse of the probability of exceedance 3 4 sensitivity analysis and procedure validation to evaluate the robustness of the developed procedure algorithm we run a specific sensitivity analysis excluding a selected station of the study area once obtained the hazard map and the topography based inundation model were used as a basis to reconstruct a probability model for the area around the selected station for our application we chose the ponte valentino station n 3 of fig 1 in the eastern part of the study area and the corresponding time series probability model model reconstruction for comparison and accuracy evaluation was completed considering both elevation above the river and associate probability of flooding i e probability of exceedance of that elevation above the river or stage across an arbitrary selected area around the station position a dataset composed of values of elevation above the river i e stage and associated probability was derived and subsequently fitted with a three terms gaussian model r2 0 997 this model was then compared with the probability model derived by the application of the gev distribution function for comparison purpose we used the r2 coefficient to show the degree of correctness of the model subsequently in order to validate results from our application we completed a comparative analysis of the 125 and 200 years floods extent predicted by our hazard model and that observed during the event of october 2015 across the lower sector of the calore river by guerriero et al 2018 see fig 1 the choice of the 125 and 200 years flood predicted by our hazard model is related to the estimation completed by guerriero et al 2018 especially they modeled a return period of the october 2015 event of 125 years in relation to the solopaca time series and a return period of 200 years in relation to the benevento time series to validate the model we considered the degree of matching of the observed vs predicted flooded areas across this part of the study area e g molinari et al 2019 in addition in order to understand the capability of our method to simulate low frequency events and compare our approach with deterministic hydrodynamic models that might better depict flood behaviour over complex topography we used a 2d simulation of flood propagation to derive 500 years flood inundation scenarios in this perspective we used the river stages corresponding to that of a 500 years flood estimated by our probability models to evaluate the corresponding peck of discharge since this analysis was completed across the lower sector of the calore river for which rating curve data were available this evaluation was completed considering the rating curve of the solopaca station for the calore river and that of the amorosi station for the volturno river the rating curves of the solopaca and amorosi stations derived by fitting specific data reported in the annali idrologici http www acq isprambiente it annalipdf with a power law fig 3a b indicate a 500 years discharge of 2310 and 1139 m3 s respectively once evaluated the estimated discharges were used to construct a number of simplified synthetic hydrographs having a consistent symmetric triangular shape and peak of discharge and durations equal to 12 24 and 48 h respectively i e different flood volumes fig 3c each set of synthetic hydrographs was used to run a flo 2d hydraulic model to compute flow velocity depth and extent of the inundation area e g peña and nardi 2018 in this perspective a 10 10 m dem resampled from a 1 1 m lidar derived dem was used to support computational grid generation across the areas of interest for our application we used a 20 20 m grid the analyses were preformed across the area considered for result validation purpose see fig 1 as boundary conditions we selected an inflow element for calore river and an inflow element for the volturno river and a number of outflow elements distributed along the lower boundary of the area next to the confluence between the calore and volturno rivers flood scenarios obtained by 2d flood simulation were then compared with the 500 years flood scenario obtained with the developed procedure 4 results and discussions 4 1 probability of floods fig 4 reports univariate statistics and generalized extreme value probability models used for flood hazard map computation through the proposed fusion procedure and associated matlab code boxplots of fig 4a c e g i k m and o show the univariate statistics of time series registered at the selected hydrometric stations see also table 1 graphs a c e g and k depicting the dynamic of the calore river show maximum values of fluvial stage that consistently increase toward the confluence with the volturno river for instance while the maximum registered value of fluvial stage at the station of ponte calore is of approximately 4 3 m the maximum at the station of solopaca is of approximately 10 m as well the median of the series shows a similar spatial trend excepting for the station of apice that is represented by a slightly lower value in comparison with the median of the ponte calore station the chianche station installed along the sabato river shows a maximum around 4 5 m and a median of approximately 1 5 m the stations installed along the considered segment of the volturno river show similar maxima around 4 7 m and median values between 2 5 and 2 9 m probability graphs of fig 4b d f h j l n and p show relative frequency distributions and gev models that fit the theoretical probability of exceedance of fluvial stages forming registered time series on annual basis most of the time series have been best fitted by type iii ξ 0 generalized extreme value functions an exception is the time series registered at the apice station that has been best fitted by a type ii generalized extreme value functions ξ 0 probability models indicate along the reach of the calore river considered in the analysis a magnitude of the 10 year flood variable between approximately 3 8 and 7 1 m and a magnitude of the 100 year flood between approximately 4 5 and 9 5 m along the volturno river the magnitude of the 10 year flood has been estimated by our models in approximately 4 m while the magnitude of the 100 year flood variates between 4 7 and 6 1 m at the chianche station magnitudes of 2 7 and 4 2 m were estimated for the 10 and 100 year floods respectively the uncertainty related to this estimation is depicted in the graphs by 95 confidence intervals dashed lines overall time series registered along the upper course of the calore river i e ponte calore apice and ponte valentino show a larger uncertainty range in the estimation for instance the magnitude of the 500 years flood shows a maximum range of uncertainty of approximately 15 m at the apice station lower uncertainties are associated to the estimation derived by the analysis of time series registered along the lower course of the calore river the sabato and the volturno rivers especially a maximum of approximately 10 m has been estimated at the solopaca station 9 m at the chianche station and 5 m at the ponte limatola station as indicated by coles 2001 although the generalized extreme value probability function is suitable to describe the statistical behaviour of annual maxima it has the disadvantage of underestimating the intensity of very high return period events to mitigate this drawback guerriero et al 2018 used this probability model in combination with a gamma function that has the potential to better estimate the intensity of very high return period events in particular models combination was completed on the basis of univariate statistics of selected time series in addition rust et al 2008 indicate that in presence of limited samples the mle estimator tends to underestimate the magnitude of 95 confidence interval that needs to be carefully determined as a measure of uncertainty associated to flood hazard and risk evaluation e g apel et al 2004 to mitigate this drawback a bayesian approach is often preferred to a classical statistics approach e g parkers and demeritt 2016 in this case since the main goal of the paper is to present a procedure of flood hazard evaluation that allow to merge multiple probability models over large areas rather than optimize probability model performance we represent river behaviour using only the gev models this also support the choice of the basic assumption of stationarity of the hydrologic time series in addition time series used for model development have been registered at instrumented sections typically corresponding to bridge basement in this condition fluvial stages series do not account for the mid and long term natural variability in river cross sectional geometry this condition represents a simplification in the analysis that should be taken into account in results evaluation e g magliulo et al 2013 4 2 flood hazard maps fig 5 reports the hazard maps derived by the developed practice accounting for multiple probability models fusion through a specifically developed algorithm and related matlab code fig 5a depicts the probability of exceedance while fig 5b depicts the zonation in flood perspective the probability of exceedance map of the study area fig 5a comprising the lower course of the calore river reaches of its major tributaries and a segment of the volturno river is a quantitative interpretation of the hazard level across the corresponding floodplains connected to the occurrence of storm induced floods of different magnitudes the map is a simple tools suitable for identifying the hazard level of each human structure located within the analysed floodplains on annual basis and represent a first step toward the evaluation of flood risk for this area being estimated on the basis of a flood inundation model derived by a high resolution topography high values of hazard in flood perspective dominate in zones with a low relative elevation above the river e g guerriero et al 2018 for the area of study flood hazard decrease as function of the distance from the river and spatial variation is controlled by the cross sectional geometry of the river valley especially in case of rapid variation in elevation between the river bed and the adjoining floodplain flood hazard quickly variate form very high to low values the use of multiple fluvial stage based probability models to estimate flood hazard make the proposed procedure code able to work at basin scale and has the potential to support hazard evaluation in flood perspective at regional and national scale a number of authors have used multiple probability models for flood hazard and risk assessment e g ghizzoni et al 2012 daneshkhah et al 2016 however in most of the cases the hazard evaluation provides only an estimation of magnitude and frequency of floods a final map suitable for effective land planning is not developed enhancing the complexity of the spatialization of multiple probability models that our simplified method completes in a simple manner in other cases rainfall time series registered at multiple gauging stations have been incorporated into gis based analysis for flood hazard spatialization purpose e g england et al 2014 wang et al 2015 toosi et al 2019 the hazard zonation map of fig 5b show four zones of the floodplains that can be flooded by events with specific return periods this map provides an overview on the hydrologic response of the floodplain in flood perspective and is a basis for future land planning guiding recommendation of uses occupation restrictions and flood insurance plan development e g linnenluecke and griffiths 2010 ghizzoni et al 2012 especially most of the analysed floodplains have a high to very high hazard and zones of medium to low hazard are poorly developed an exception is the industrial area of benevento and the lower sector of the segment of the volturno river considered in the analysis where a large zone floodable by a 100 500 year event is depicted in the map fig 5b fig 6 reports local magnifications of mapped flood hazard using the developed practice three zones of particular complexity in term of hydrologic behaviour of rivers and presence of human settlements are depicted 1 the industrial area of benevento fig 6a and b respectively 2 a sector of the urban and sub urban area of benevento fig 6c and d respectively and 3 the confluence between the calore and the volturno rivers fig 6e and f respectively in these zones the complex interaction between human activities and fluvial dynamics e g di baldassarre et al 2013 is interpreted by the proposed procedure without considering the presence of mitigation measurements i e artificial levees although this is a limitation of the procedure that might be implemented in the future it should affect only the hazard evaluation for events of return period lower than 125 200 years in fact during the flood event of the october 2015 characterized by a return period estimated in 125 200 years most of the embankments protecting the occupied floodplains were surmounted or destroyed e g revellino et al 2019 in this perspective the map represents a cautionary scenario that might be considered as acceptable since it is oriented to human protection having say that in case of embankments tall enough to contain a 500 year flood like some of those protecting the urban area of benevento the method provide a reliable estimation of the hazard level a further simplification derives by the adoption of a simple elevation based approach for the inundation model production e g teng et al 2017 while the use of high resolution lidar derived topography is a way to guarantee the reliability of the final hazard model brandt and lim 2012 this approach tends to classify areas topographically disconnected from the river course and or the flood plain as floodable in this case a preliminary identification of the area connected or connectable to the river is needed in addition although the hazard map in not fully comparable with any event map being computed on the basis of fluvial stage data it is able to simulate or be reliable for different flooding scenarios of same magnitude but generated by different rainfall spatial distribution e g guerriero et al 2018 this advantage is connected to the simplicity of the flood hazard model that being based on the relation between floodplain topography and fluvial stage is not related to a single rainfall event and consequent river discharge this makes the method able to work over large areas e g domeneghetti et al 2015 4 3 method sensitivity and results validation fig 7 shows the sensitivity analysis dataset and the result of its comparison with the ponte valentino station probability model especially the training dataset black symbols consists of approximately 26 000 values of both elevation above the river i e fluvial stage and associated probability the purple line is the gaussian function that best fit the dataset and is used for comparison purpose with the developed gev probability model the calculation of the r2 coefficient between the probability distribution derived by the flood hazard model obtained for sensitivity estimation i e the gaussian fit of the dataset and the gev model depicting the probability of exceedance derived by the ponte valentino time series suggests a very high degree of robustness of the model indicating that the logic of interpolating multiple probability values for flood hazard spatialization and mapping is a good approach for taking into account multiple probability models in addition the visual analysis of the curves suggests that while the proposed procedure tends to underestimate the probability of low magnitude events it tends to overestimate the probability of high magnitude flood this might be considered acceptable since it tends to favour human safety fig 8 a shows results from validation analysis completed on the basis of the comparison between the estimated 125 and 200 years flood scenarios and data by guerriero et al 2018 representative of the area affected by the flood event of october 2015 the map shows that the area floodable by estimated 125 and 200 years floods has a higher degree of matching with that affected by the 2015 flood especially the comparison indicates a degree of matching of 95 and 98 respectively major differences are observable at the confluence between the clore and the volturno rivers and where the morphology of the river valley is particularly complex as at the beginning of the area selected for the validation in addition at specific location the hazard model tends to slightly overestimate the extent of the flooded area i e false positive we consider this index as representative of the high accuracy of our procedure fig 8b and c shows results from flo 2d hydraulic simulation of multiple 500 years flood scenarios in terms of both extent of the flooded areas b and flow depth c derived by the 24 h flood simulation results of our modelling indicate that overall the obtained scenarios are very similar in terms of both extent of the flooded area and flood depth this motivated us to show only a single flood depth map a comparison between results of 2d hydraulic simulation and the 500 years flood derived by our procedure indicate mostly a high degree of correspondence with minor differences located at upstream area of the computational area along the right side of the valley and at the confluence with the volturno river overall the extent of the area derived by the proposed practice is larger than that indicated by hydraulic simulations even if this represents an error of estimation the consideration of a larger area corresponds to a safer condition in human life protection perspective thus it can be considered acceptable in addition the maximum flow depth derived by 2d simulation has a high degree of correspondence with that derived by probability modelling and used for deriving the 500 years discharge from rating curves 10 4 vs 10 9 m this suggests the correctness of our estimation through probability analysis and hydraulic modelling on this basis and considering that our procedure is based on high resolution topographic data that increase the reliability of this kind of analysis brandt and lim 2012 the use of multiple probability models trough the developed procedure can be considered a very important tool in flood hazard estimation that has the potential to work over large areas 5 conclusions in this paper we propose a procedure and related algorithm coded in matlab to evaluate flood hazard considering multiple probability models and high resolution topographic data that make it able to work over large areas and in presence of urban settlements it is based on a specifically developed interpolation assignation routine that spatializing probability of exceedance of fluvial stages and assigning it to corresponding cells of the topography derived flood inundation model provides a flood hazard map suitable for land planning purpose in this way the presented procedure has the potential to be applied in many fluvial contexts for which fluvial stage and topographic data are available and has no limitation to work at different scales from local to regional in particular since the italian fluvial network is monitored by hundreds of hydrometric stations this procedure has the potential to support also the evaluation of flood hazard at national scale we applied the procedure to a study area comprising the lower reach of the calore river its major tributaries and a segment of the volturno river in southern italy produced hazard maps provide an overview of the flood hazard in this area already hit by a number of destructive flood events and represent the first step toward an evaluation of flood risk especially being developed on the basis of a very high resolution topography they allow to estimate the specific hazard level for each human structure located across the analysed floodplains in this way we trained the procedure over a very heterogeneous area with diffused urban settlements with results that underline the flexibility of the procedure the robustness of the algorithm and the correctness of estimation at least for low to medium return period floods major limits of the procedure as applied to the selected area derive from the assumption of stationarity of hydrologic time series and from the choice of using a gev distribution as representative of the long term hydrologic behaviour of the river system especially in a rapidly changing environment the assumption of stationarity of hydrologic time series is reasonable in case of impossibility of reliably estimating the long term effect of the ongoing climate change and human action in this case some time series considered for our development have a limited length preventing the adoption of a nonstationary approach these limitations are responsible for substantial uncertainty related to high return period flood magnitude estimation as indicated by computed confidence level in this context it is important to notice that these limitations can be mitigated using a different probability model adopting a bayesian confidence level estimator and accounting for non stationarity of time series especially a prospective analysis of flood hazard for this area accounting for non stationarity of time series will be presented in a forthcoming paper selecting only suitable time series the absence of propagation modelling as part of the estimation procedure might be considered as an additional limit since in complex topographic and hydrological conditions it might provide a better evaluation of flood hazard having say that 2d simulation completed to supplement our interpretation of the potential of the proposed procedure indicate a high degree of correspondence with local overestimation of the floodable area by the model derived by the proposed procedure since this effect increases safety in human life protection perspective it can be considered acceptable on this basis the proposed procedure can be considered an alternative to complex hydraulic simulation based flood hazard

5449,current urban water security studies failed to incorporate sustainability concerns and the objectives of urban water management practices china s municipalities namely shanghai beijing tianjin and chongqing have faced great pressure on water security however literature has not yet investigated their features and concerns of urban water security to address these challenges this study suggested a water security assessment framework which incorporates the features of urban water management transitions and sustainability aspects to analyze the urban water security condition of the four municipalities during 2011 2017 in addition the criteria importance through intercriteria correlation critic method was employed to detect the weights of indicators without incorporating personal value judgements to enhance the results robustness the results point out that beijing has had the best water security condition followed by tianjin shanghai and chongqing in addition shanghai has had the largest improvement of water security condition among the municipalities during the investigated period the condition of water use efficiency river quality pollutant discharge wastewater treatment capacity green covered area and crop area affected by droughts and floods has showed a great variation between the four municipalities river quality improvement and mitigation of droughts and floods damages have remained top priority in tianjin and beijing the shanghai government should lay a particular concern on water use reduction and the regulation of wastewater and pollutant discharges the chongqing government should reinforce the coverage of sewage and drainage infrastructure advance water use efficiency and balance water intensity of economic activities to avoid long term damages on water security the assessment framework and approach are conducive to investigate and communicate water security condition of cities and can assist tailoring policy measurements to cities in different water security contexts keywords urban water security urban water management sustainable development the criteria importance through intercriteria correlation critic method municipalities 1 introduction according to the working definition of water security proposed by un water un water 2013 urban water security can be specified as the capacity of an urban population to safeguard sustainable access to adequate quantities of acceptable quality water for sustaining livelihoods human well being and socio economic development for ensuring protection against water borne pollution and water related disasters and for preserving ecosystems in a climate of peace and political stability the definition illustrates a generalized scope of urban water security and captures the balance between water resources protection and socio economic needs urban water security has been recognized as a crucial factor to achieve sustainable development united nations published the agenda 2030 for sustainable development and announced 15 sustainable development goals sdgs to call for global awareness and to urge all governments for enhancing their sustainability practices united nations 2015 urban water security directly connects two sdgs namely sdg6 clean water and sanitation and sdg11 sustainable cities and communities this shows its importance in achieving sustainable development united nations 2015 to date more than half of the global population live in urban area and that proportion is expected to increase to two thirds by 2050 united nations 2017 united nations 2018 world economic forum 2019 once urban water security deteriorates large urban populations bear the influences and the whole society will pay a high price in terms of financial and social resources chen and shi 2016 jensen and wu 2018 romero lankao and gnatz 2016 this significance highlights the need for protecting urban water security and has fostered the research on urban water security 1 1 literature review urban water security has strong linkages to sustainability however literature has seldom systematically and clearly brought the connection into urban water security assessments gain et al 2016 nazemi and madani 2018 nie et al 2018 romero lankao and gnatz 2016 sustainability topics have been more often considered in the evaluation of water system services and water management than in the investigation of water security gohar et al 2019 hellström et al 2000 koop and van leeuwen 2015 li et al 2017 lundin and morrison 2002 marques et al 2015 rijsberman and van de ven 2000 van leeuwen et al 2012 several water security studies have integrated the indicators associated with socio economic condition or government responses in the assessment arfanuzzaman and atiq rahman 2017 chen and shi 2016 chen et al 2013 ghosh et al 2019 huang and yang 2017 jia et al 2015 van ginkel et al 2018 nevertheless they have only addressed single or few sustainability dimensions in the evaluation until recently urban water security studies have comprehensively incorporated sustainability topics into the assessment frameworks for instance gain et al 2016 romero lankao and gnatz 2016 srinivasan et al 2017 and nie et al 2018 emphasized the multi dimensional nature of water security and urged the needs to address sustainability topics in water security assessment moreover daniell et al 2015 clearly illustrated the interaction between the sustainability domains and urban water security to stress the relevance of sustainability to urban water security assessment however the comprehensive inclusion of sustainability topics in urban water security research has not received enough attention gain et al 2016 in addition the objectives and needs of urban water management practice have been barely considered in current urban water security studies the objectives and needs vary with changing urban development progress some studies have urged the consideration of urban water management transitions to analyze water conditions in cities brown et al 2009 daniell et al 2015 hoekstra et al 2018 brown et al 2009 firstly illustrated the six stages of urban water management transitions namely the water supply city the sewered city the drained city the waterways city the water cycle city and the water sensitive city the targets and measures of water management gradually go beyond the basic concerns e g water supply during city development the transitions are pushed by social political economic drives and attendant new objectives of urban water management are added in each stage to date several studies have adopted the concept of urban water management transitions in urban water planning research but only focused on specific phases e g the water sensitive city daniell et al 2015 sullivan et al 2017 and the water sensitive urban design hussey and kay 2015 madonsela et al 2019 wong and brown 2011 those features of urban water management transitions shall be used to establish a more suitable realistic scope of urban water security assessment brown et al 2009 hoekstra et al 2018 urban water security is a relative concept without a standardized quantitative yardstick and the status can thus hardly be measured in an absolute value it addresses interdisciplinary topics with different research methods such as the indicator methods gong and jin 2014 huang et al 2015 jensen and nair 2019 jensen and wu 2018 lu et al 2016 nie et al 2018 the pressure state response methods ghosh et al 2019 arfanuzzaman and atiq rahman 2017 chen and shi 2016 chen et al 2013 huang and yang 2017 jia et al 2015 van ginkel et al 2018 the system dynamic methods sahin et al 2017 su et al 2017 xiong et al 2018 the water footprint methods cheng 2019 deng et al 2014 the risk based water management methods hall and borgomeo 2013 nie et al 2018 and the vulnerability methods li et al 2009 zhi and xue 2018 among the methods the indicator methods have been widely applied since they allow a comprehensive assessment by tackling multi dimensional indicators relevant to urban water security into frameworks li et al 2019 multi criteria decision analysis mcda models have been frequently used to support the indicator method by incorporating a variety of indicators into composite indices or frameworks of urban water security chen and shi 2016 chen et al 2013 el gafy 2018 huang and yang 2017 huang et al 2015 jensen and wu 2018 koop and van leeuwen 2015 li et al 2009 2019 lu et al 2016 nie et al 2018 peng et al 2016 romero lankao and gnatz 2016 shalamzari and zhang 2018 van leeuwen et al 2012 wang et al 2016 through the general approach of mcda models indicator normalization weighting determination and aggregation oecd 2008 singh et al 2012 velasquez and hester 2013 the summarized results can provide a general picture of urban water security status in a quantitative manner and benefit policy making and communication however aggregated results can be affected by the weights of indicators among the available weighting methods the panel methods in which people are asked to assign weights to indicators have been intensively applied in water resource management and water security studies chen et al 2013 huang et al 2015 li et al 2009 lu et al 2016 nie et al 2018 zardari et al 2015 rowley et al 2012 the panel methods can be performed by applying different approaches e g questionnaires and interviews panel compositions e g experts and stakeholders and procedures e g delphi rowley et al 2012 nevertheless the weights determined by the panel methods can be greatly varied depending on the value choices of researchers and stakeholders and thus increase the uncertainty of analytical results to lower the uncertainty the data driven methods that detect a weighting scheme inherent to the dataset itself by solving mathematical models without a consideration of the stakeholders value choices have been increasingly applied harmancioglu et al 2008 narayanamoorthy et al 2019 rowley et al 2012 zardari et al 2015 the entropy method shannon 1948 and the criteria importance through intercriteria correlation critic method diakoulaki et al 1995 are recognized as two of the popular data driven methods zardari et al 2015 the entropy method quantifies the contrast intensity i e the divergence of indicator values to derive indicator weights it assigns higher weights the more differentiated the values of the examined indicators are diakoulaki et al 1995 shannon 1948 zardari et al 2015 in addition to the consideration of contrast intensity the critic method addresses the conflict between indicators to cope with the interdependency of indicators the critic method explicitly suits mcda studies since it can capture more information embedded in and between indicators and has been applied in water management research harmancioglu et al 2008 narayanamoorthy et al 2019 zardari et al 2015 1 2 research objectives china s mega cities especially the municipalities namely shanghai beijing tianjin and chongqing have faced a dramatically intensive economic growth and social development and the expected pressures e g water pollutions and depletion on urban water security have greatly increased the location of the municipalities is shown in fig 1 the municipalities are directly controlled under the central government and have political economic and cultural importance throughout the country due to the unique position they have attracted a large population regrading residence commuting tourism and business purposes and fostered regional and even national economic development in this context the pursuit of water security in municipalities has been more urgent compared to other mega cities however the literature has not yet investigated and compared the performance and features of urban water security of china s municipalities several studies evaluated the condition of water security for a specific mega city such as chengdu chen and shi 2016 huang and yang 2017 li et al 2009 and dalian huang et al 2015 or a city based administrative region like hongkong jensen and nair 2019 hence this study defined china s municipalities as the research objects and carried out an investigation of their development and hotspots of water security in order to improve current urban water security assessment this study demonstrated an urban water security assessment framework that integrates sustainability dimensions and the features of urban water management transitions and analyzed the status characteristics and challenges of water security of the four municipalities in china during 2011 2017 the study also employed the critic method to assign weights to indicators without considering personal value choices to improve the results robustness this study can be a foundation to develop urban water security assessment frameworks that address sustainable development and urban water management practice allowing for both methodological and application development in water security discipline moreover the analytical results can support the municipal governments tailoring the policies and strategies to enhance water security the remainder of this paper is organized as below section 2 introduces the background of the municipalities the assessment framework and the estimation approach of urban water security section 3 provides a detailed analysis of urban water security condition between the municipalities discusses policy implications and indicates limitations based on the findings followed by a concluding fourth section 2 methods and data this section presents the method to analyze water security condition of china s municipalities section 2 1 describes the background of study area i e the municipalities section 2 2 illustrates the urban water security assessment framework based on the features of urban water management transitions and sustainability dimensions the calculation approach including indicator normalization weighting and aggregation in order to summarize annual water security condition of the municipalities is presented in section 2 3 2 1 study area 2 1 1 shanghai shanghai is a coastal city

steps namely identifying indicator categories selecting indicators and collecting data to better respond to the proposed definition of urban water security we suggested the urban water security assessment framework by considering the six stages of urban water management transitions and the four sustainability dimensions as a backbone of the framework to our knowledge there is no literature specifying urban water management transitions and sustainability topics together in the evaluation of urban water security the concept of urban water management transitions and sustainability dimensions associated with urban water security is illustrated in section 2 2 1 and section 2 2 2 respectively then indicator selection and data collection are presented in section 2 2 3 2 2 1 concept of urban water management transitions the features of urban water management transitions should be considered to establish a comprehensive as well as realistic scope for urban water security assessment brown et al 2009 firstly introduced the six stages of urban water management transitions to reflect the features of urban water management practice the six stages are 1 the water supply city 2 the sewered city 3 the drained city 4 the waterways city 5 the water cycle city and 6 the water sensitive city brown et al 2009 daniell et al 2015 the six stages of urban water management transitions were applied as six indicator categories of the assessment framework the objectives and concerns of each stage are presented as below the water supply city ensures the availability and accessibility of water resources to residents and economic activities the objectives are to secure sufficient water supply and to keep water resources widely accessed the sewered city focuses on the provision of a wide coverage of sewage infrastructure to support public health by eradicating waterborne disease the drained city aims to enhance the coverage of drainage infrastructure to avoid the damage from flood the waterways city lays stress on improving water quality and amenity resulted from clean water bodies pollution treatment and prevention are the measures to support the aim the water cycle city emphasizes an efficient water resources consumption and urges the close loop of water use the water sensitive city enhances the resilience and adaptivity of disasters and climate change and supports sustainability and livability of cities these added objectives and concerns can promote urban water management towards a more integrated adaptive coordinated and participatory mechanism and strengthen institutional capacity and water resilience daniell et al 2015 hoekstra et al 2018 fig 3 shows a general picture of urban water management transitions including the objectives and corresponding focuses and service delivery to reach a more comprehensive and advanced water management the management stages gradually move to other ones with added targets we want to underline that the transitions do not have to develop in a linear way for instance in addition to the fulfillment of secured water supply the governments could enhance infrastructure coverage to guarantee sufficient sewage for the sewered city and drainage for the drained city collection at the meantime 2 2 2 concept of sustainability in urban water security sustainable development has become the conclusive goal for governments and societies to pursue according to the brundtland report united nations 1987 sustainable development was defined as a development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs urban water security plays as an important role in achieving sustainable development in terms of water resources protection sustainable urban development and other sustainability associated aspects such as ensuring good health and wellbeing and sustainable energy li et al 2009 the four dimensions of sustainability i e environment economy society and institution european commission 2012 can be the context and drivers of urban water management transitions and in turn can be influenced by the transitions as drawn in fig 3 economic development economic aspect and population growth social aspect are key drivers of water consumption and they bring about water pollution and thus affect water quality environmental aspect at the meantime water depletion and pollutions will restrict the economic activities objectives and emphasis of urban water management practice have altered and transited over time as economic development patterns social needs behavior values and climate have been changing daniell et al 2015 hoekstra et al 2018 growing concerns on environmental issues from governments institutional aspect have also promoted the transitions we considered the four sustainability dimensions as four categories to identify indicators associated with urban water security topics relevant to the context and drivers of sustainability dimensions are conceptually presented in fig 3 2 2 3 indicators identification and data collection we defined the six stages of urban water management transitions and the four sustainability dimensions as ten indicator categories of the assessment framework see table 1 we then took several urban water security studies e g aboelnga et al 2019 el gafy 2018 and jensen and wu 2018 and reports e g asian development bank 2013 2016 as references to select indicators because the studies provided a summary of urban water security assessment frameworks or specified the indicators and aspects relevant to urban water security evaluation global water partnership 2014 as shown in table 1 we identified the indicators based on the listed references in total 24 indicators were chosen from the open access government statistical databases to build the urban water security assessment framework see table 1 15 indicators were selected in accordance with the six stages of urban water management transitions and described in the following text to support the water supply city keeping water available and accessible to populations is essential three indicators water resources per capita length of water supply pipelines per capita and water supply pervasion rate were used to present the status of water availability resources endowment infrastructure coverage and water supply pervasion accessibility respectively for developing the sewered and drained city intensive infrastructure coverage contributes to a better sewerage and drainage collection we chose length of sewers per capita and length of drainage pipelines per capita to measure the sufficiency of sewerage and drainage infrastructure to urban populations pollution regulation and treatment act as crucial measures to support waterways cities five indicators wastewater discharge per capita chemical oxygen demand cod discharge per capita ammonium nitrogen discharge per capita wastewater treatment capacity and wastewater treatment rate were used to evaluate wastewater discharge pollutant cod and ammonia nitrogen discharge treatment capacity and treatment coverage respectively the water use efficiency determines the degree of success of realizing a water system with a closed loop for constructing a water cycle city water use per capita was selected to estimate a general stress given by water demand the indicator water reuse and recycling rate shows the industrial water utilization pattern towards a closed loop water use in order to develop towards a water sensitive city the frequency of environmental events e g numbers of abrupt environmental events and the degree of disaster damage e g disaster affected area and population were selected to represent disaster vulnerability of cities nine indicators were selected in line with the four sustainability dimensions environment economy society and institution to describe the urban context that could influence or be affected by water security condition the indicators are described below for considering environmental sustainability favorable water quality in rivers and extremely inferior water quality in rivers can show the influence of human activities to water bodies and the potential ecosystem damage green covered area as percentage of urban area serves as a relevant indicator to indicate ecosystem vitality of cities concerning the economic context economic growth is a driver that could increase water demand and therefore rises the pressure to urban water security economic growth rate was thus selected to present the potential pressure in addition water intensity of economic activities was assessed by the indicator water use per ten thousand chinese yuan gdp to show the water dependency for supporting the local industry population growth rate indicates the potential increase of water demand in society and brings about the pressure on water supply moreover population having subsistence allowance was used as an indicator to presume the capacity for residents to consume water resources the larger the population is the weaker is the capacity governments support to environmental protection and water affairs can boost the effectiveness of water security governance and was assessed by two indicators governments investment in water conservancy and environmental protection and governments expenditure on land resources and meteorology affairs respectively to ensure the applicability of the framework we collected data for the indicators to describe the ten categories from the open access statistical databases and reports provided by the governments e g water resources bulletin of the municipal governments beijing water authority 2019 chongqing water resources bureau 2019 shanghai water authority 2019 tianjin water authority 2019 statistical yearbook of urban construction in china ministry of housing and urban rural development of the people s republic of china 2019 and china statistical yearbook series national bureau of statistics 2019 data for the selected indicators for the four municipalities were collected from those databases and reports the timeframe considered for the comparative assessment was limited to 2011 2017 due to the restriction of data availability as an initiative study for building the urban water security assessment framework that tackles sustainability and urban water management objectives we noticed that the consideration of indicators needs to be continuously refined though there can be interdependency between the selected indicators we applied a data driven weighting method namely the critic method to address the conflict between indicators see the following section 2 3 2 in weighting determination and thus ensure the robustness of weighting results 2 3 estimation approach of urban water security condition having the urban water security assessment framework we designed an estimation approach for indicator normalization see section 2 3 1 weighting determination see section 2 3 2 and aggregation see section 2 3 3 to illustrate annual water security condition of the four municipalities during 2011 2017 2 3 1 indicator normalization normalization transfers indicator values into a common scale to facilitate the aggregation of indicators into a summarized score oecd 2008 singh et al 2012 velasquez and hester 2013 in this study linear scaling was used as the normalization method to transform the indicator values into 0 1 scale linear scaling transformation requires two reference points minimum and maximum reference points for each indicator minimum and maximum reference points were determined in accordance to the lowest and the highest indicator values collected for an indicator among the four municipalities from 2011 to 2017 this setting allows a comparative assessment of water security condition across municipalities and years the normalized indicator scores were calculated based on the determined reference points depending on the type i e so called positive indicators and negative indicators of indicators the normalized indicator scores were calculated differently for positive indicators e g wastewater treatment rate a higher indicator value means a higher positive contribution to urban water security for negative indicators e g cod discharge per capita a higher indicator value means a higher negative influence on urban water security the normalized score s i i for a positive indicator i with data of a specific investigated municipality i was measured by equation 1 1 s i i v i i r m i r m i r m i v i i denotes the value for a positive indicator i of a specific municipality i r m i and r m i represent the maximum and minimum reference points for i respectively the normalized score s i i for a negative indicator i with data of a specific municipality i was measured according to eq 2 2 s i i r m i v i i r m i r m i v i i denotes the value for a negative indicator i of a specific municipality i r m i and r m i represent the maximum and minimum reference points for i respectively 2 3 2 the critic method for weights determination in this study a data driven method the critic the criteria importance through intercriteria correlation method was applied to determine indicator weights diakoulaki et al 1995 proposed the critic method that detects indicator weights by incorporating both contrast intensity and conflict based on the extraction of information contained in the indicators jahan et al 2012 the method can be easily converted into an algorithmic form and enables the incorporation of interdependent indicators jahan et al 2012 to identify indicator weights first vector x j of the normalized matrix was generated where x j indicates the normalized scores of an indicator j for the four municipalities with data during 2011 2017 x j was then characterized by the standard deviation σ j quantifying the contrast intensity of indicator j diakoulaki et al 1995 rostamzadeh et al 2018 tuş and aytaç adalı 2019 zardari et al 2015 afterwards linear correlation coefficients r jk between the vectors x j and x k were computed to construct a symmetric matrix with dimensions n n n denotes the number of indicators k 1 2 3 n if the value of r jk decreases this indicates that the indicators j and k are more discordant in this sense r jk represents the conflict embedded by indicator j with respect to the rest of the indicators diakoulaki et al 1995 rostamzadeh et al 2018 tuş and aytaç adalı 2019 zardari et al 2015 then the amount of information cj conveyed by indicator j was estimated by comprising the two measures i e the contrast intensity and conflict in equation 3 the higher the value cj is the larger is the amount of information transmitted by indicator j and the higher is its relative importance the weight wj of indicator j was determined by normalizing the value cj in to unity equation 4 diakoulaki et al 1995 rostamzadeh et al 2018 tuş and aytaç adalı 2019 zardari et al 2015 in this sense the weights of other indicators were derived by applying equations 3 and 4 as well 3 c j σ j k 1 n 1 r jk 4 w j c j j 1 n c k 1 2 3 3 aggregation approach in this study the weighted sum method was used to aggregate the indicators singh et al 2012 ehrgott 2005 based on the normalized scores s ij and the given weights of the indicators see sections 2 3 1 and 2 3 2 indicators were aggregated into a single score q i to represent the annual urban water security condition of the municipalities according to equation 5 5 q i j 1 n s ij w j as the normalized scores of indicators range between 0 and 1 see section 2 3 1 q i also ranges between 0 and 1 it is assumed that the higher q i is the better is the urban water security condition 3 results and discussion the following sections present the findings of the comparative assessment of annual urban water security condition of the municipalities section 3 1 and analyze the features concerns as well as policy implications of water security of each municipality section 3 2 research limitations and prospects are elaborated in section 3 3 3 1 general urban water security condition of china s municipalities indicator weights were detected according to the indictor normalization approach and the critic method see sections 2 3 1 and 2 3 2 table 2 lists the indicator weights and shows the ten highest weights in bold the indicator water reuse and recycling rate has the highest importance among the 24 indicators followed by water use per capita green covered area as percentage of urban area wastewater treatment capacity ammonia nitrogen discharge per capita proportion of crops affected area by flood and drought in total municipal area and others the higher the weight is the larger is the amount of information transmitted by the indicator therefore we recognized that there has been significant variated status of water use efficiency pollutant discharge wastewater treatment capacity green covered area river quality environmental events and crop affected area by flood and drought between the four municipalities in accordance with the aggregation approach section 2 3 3 the single scores that summarize annual water security condition of the four municipalities were then calculated listed in table 3 based on the single scores fig 4 illustrates the development of urban water security condition of the four municipalities it was found that water security condition of all municipalities has gradually enhanced from 2011 to 2017 in general tables a 1 a 4 listed in appendix a provide the raw data used in the assessment for the four municipalities and the normalized indicator scores the results point out that beijing has had the best water security condition in 2017 followed by tianjin shanghai and chongqing in addition table 3 shows that shanghai has had the largest improvement of the overall water security condition during the investigated period and beijing has showed the least among others in the following section we further specify the features and challenges of water security to each municipality 3 2 features and policy implications of water security condition of china s municipalities to give a closer look the features and challenges of water security condition of individual municipalities are described in the following sections 3 2 1 shanghai shanghai has the most intensive coverage of sewer infrastructure and sufficient wastewater treatment capacity among china s municipalities besides this residents and agricultural activities have been less affected by droughts and floods the proportion of rivers in inferior water quality has significantly reduced during the investigated period on the other hand shanghai has several weak points threating water security households and economic activities consume a great amount of water in 2017 water use per capita of shanghai has reached 433 cubic meters 2 38 times that of beijing 2 46 times that of tianjin and 1 71 times that of chongqing such massive water use alerts the criticality of water use efficiency and has brought about significant pressure on water security in addition shanghai has the largest wastewater and ammonia nitrogen discharge among the municipalities especially ammonia nitrogen discharge per capita has gone to 15 3 kg in 2017 1 35 2 68 times that of the other municipalities it points out that the local governments should pay attention to the regulation of wastewater and pollutant discharge in order to prevent the negative effect on human health and ecosystem despite the fact that droughts and floods have made relatively little damage to residents and economic activities abrupt environmental events have frequently occurred in shanghai from 2011 to 2017 the average number of abrupt environmental events in shanghai was six times that in beijing and chongqing and 95 times that in tianjin this underlines the great risks on urban water security caused by environmental events and therefore the local government should reinforce the capacity in disaster prevention and mitigation 3 2 2 beijing unlike the concerns in shanghai water use and pollutant i e cod and ammonia nitrogen discharge have been less critical the amount of water use and pollutant discharge has been the least in beijing among the municipalities during the investigated years nevertheless the degree of water reuse and recycling has been relatively low in beijing as a city with low rainfall and water resources like beijing local government and society should attach importance to the closed loop of water use beijing has the largest coverage of urban landscaping among the municipalities representing a relatively vital ecosystem concerning the economic context low water intensity indicates less water dependency for supporting economic activities reducing the pressure on water security regarding the social aspect a relatively low share of the population having subsistence allowance indicates that beijing residents have had better water consuming capacity compared to the other municipalities droughts and floods have brought about a negative effect on households and agricultural activities in beijing however government expenditure on land resources and meteorology affairs and the investment in fixed assets for water conservancy environment and public facilities have been in severe minority and thus insufficiently contributed to improving urban resilience it s worth noting that the share of favorable water quality of rivers has decreased during the investigated period local government should notice the deterioration of river quality and advance the supporting policy measures e g monitoring and levy 3 2 3 tianjin tianjin and beijing have several commons of water security because of their similar climate and geographic condition first though the comparative assessment points out that water use per capita has not been recognized as a tough water security topic water availability i e the amount of water resources per capita has been a difficult concern of tianjin and beijing and thus laid pressure on water security limited water resources could be caused by the relatively low rainfall this restriction may have resulted in an efficient water use behavior and economic patterns in low water intensity and thus decreased the water use per capita in the both municipalities second residents and agricultural activities in both municipalities have been largely affected by droughts and floods and the damages have greatly fluctuated during 2011 2017 unlike the beijing government the tianjin authorities have arranged a more sufficient fixed asset investment and expenditure for water conservancy environmental protection and resource management the arrangement can contribute to the reduction of disaster risks third river quality has not been enhanced in the both municipalities and tianjin has faced a lower water quality condition it is one of the biggest challenges for tianjin to address the low water quality since its rivers are black and odorous apart from the commons some dissimilarities have existed between tianjin and beijing for example tianjin has the best performance regarding water reuse and recycling among the municipalities and therefore it has the leading position with regard to water efficiency on the other side tianjin has shown the relatively low wastewater treatment capacity and limited coverage of urban landscaping the low water treatment capacity could be a factor that affects river quality 3 2 4 chongqing due to abundant water resource endowment and physiographic condition chongqing has the most plentiful water resources to support households and economic development and also has the best river quality among the considered municipalities nevertheless water use efficiency has been a relevant issue as well as a hidden danger in chongqing water use per capita and water reuse and recycling have been recognized as critical downsides that threat water security moreover chongqing has the highest water intensity among the municipalities in other words the economic activities have significantly depended on the water resources without proper industrial transformation technological upgrading and water saving management water security condition will be continuously damaged in the long run having a large population affected by floods over years the chongqing government has laid attention to supporting the land resources and meteorology affairs and the investment in fixed assets of water conservancy and public facilities to prevent flood damage improve water management capacity and advance infrastructure however chongqing has been the only municipality without complete water supply pervasion furthermore the intensity of sewers and drainage pipeline coverage has been the least sufficient among the four municipalities chongqing government should focus on the enhancement of infrastructure planning and construction wastewater discharge per capita in chongqing has been identified as the lowest of the four municipalities however the amount of pollutant cod and ammonia nitrogen discharge per capita has largely increased over years and could threat the water quality in the local and the lower reaches of the yangtze river last but not least chongqing has had the largest share of population having subsistence allowance among china s municipalities that means the water consumption capacity of residents can have been restricted in chongqing and the residents have been comparatively more vulnerable than in the other municipalities while carrying out water resources management practices the government should also pay attention to the water capacity and rights of vulnerable groups 3 3 research limitations and prospects apart from the findings and policy implications outlined in this study some limitations remain first some indicators e g the frequency of flood control training could be relevant to urban water security but were not considered in the framework at present due to the limited data availability as an initiative study the suggested framework will have to be refined and updated when additional indicators and data regarding urban water security become available cities could have a greatly diverse resource endowment social context and characteristics of water management researchers can moderately expand the framework by including additional indicators with regard to the features of cities the next steps of this study are establishing frameworks for individual groups of cities which have similar natural and social context for a better comparative assessment and suggesting roadmaps for different grouped cities to improve water security conditions this study linearly transformed the indicator values into 0 1 scale over the range of the maximum and minimum indicator values this indicator normalization approach has been widely applied in mcda studies singh et al 2012 nevertheless the linear scaling approach can bring about the loss of data proportionality rowley et al 2012 for example if the values of a given indicator are close in all municipalities the municipalities which perform slightly worse than the others will score 0 in the context of the linear scaling approach if that indicator is weighted highly then the slightly poor performing municipality may be greatly penalized rowley et al 2012 to lower the bias in result interpretation researchers should always provide the data in a transparent way and decision makers should understand the data and the meaning of indicators in water management practice the critic method was used to detect the indicator weights without considering personal judgements and thus increased scientific robustness of analysis however the data driven indicator weights may contradict to policy preferences or can not represent the level of potential impacts on society for example the indicator water supply pervasion rate was not assigned to a high weight compared to the other considered indicators but the differences of water supply pervasion rate between the municipalities imply that the large urban populations have been influenced by insufficient water supply condition decision makers should identify the improvement needs of urban water security not only referring to the indicator weights and aggregated results but also considering the original data and urban context in order to enhance policy practicality researchers can integrate different weighting approaches e g the panel methods and the data driven methods to incorporate local water management strategies i e policy preferences in the assessment 4 conclusions this study applied a water security assessment framework which incorporates the features of urban water management transitions and sustainability aspects to analyze the urban water security condition of china s municipalities namely shanghai beijing tianjin and chongqing during 2011 2017 beijing has had the best water security condition followed by tianjin shanghai and chongqing shanghai has shown the largest improvement of water security condition among the municipalities during the investigated period in addition the condition of water use efficiency river quality pollutant discharge green covered area wastewater treatment capacity abrupt environmental events and crop area affected by droughts and floods has shown a great variation between the municipalities furthermore this study is a leading paper to analyze the characteristics and weaknesses of water security specific to china s municipalities and points out the needs for policy improvement the outcome serves as a foundation to support tailoring policy measurements to cities in various water security

5449,current urban water security studies failed to incorporate sustainability concerns and the objectives of urban water management practices china s municipalities namely shanghai beijing tianjin and chongqing have faced great pressure on water security however literature has not yet investigated their features and concerns of urban water security to address these challenges this study suggested a water security assessment framework which incorporates the features of urban water management transitions and sustainability aspects to analyze the urban water security condition of the four municipalities during 2011 2017 in addition the criteria importance through intercriteria correlation critic method was employed to detect the weights of indicators without incorporating personal value judgements to enhance the results robustness the results point out that beijing has had the best water security condition followed by tianjin shanghai and chongqing in addition shanghai has had the largest improvement of water security condition among the municipalities during the investigated period the condition of water use efficiency river quality pollutant discharge wastewater treatment capacity green covered area and crop area affected by droughts and floods has showed a great variation between the four municipalities river quality improvement and mitigation of droughts and floods damages have remained top priority in tianjin and beijing the shanghai government should lay a particular concern on water use reduction and the regulation of wastewater and pollutant discharges the chongqing government should reinforce the coverage of sewage and drainage infrastructure advance water use efficiency and balance water intensity of economic activities to avoid long term damages on water security the assessment framework and approach are conducive to investigate and communicate water security condition of cities and can assist tailoring policy measurements to cities in different water security contexts keywords urban water security urban water management sustainable development the criteria importance through intercriteria correlation critic method municipalities 1 introduction according to the working definition of water security proposed by un water un water 2013 urban water security can be specified as the capacity of an urban population to safeguard sustainable access to adequate quantities of acceptable quality water for sustaining livelihoods human well being and socio economic development for ensuring protection against water borne pollution and water related disasters and for preserving ecosystems in a climate of peace and political stability the definition illustrates a generalized scope of urban water security and captures the balance between water resources protection and socio economic needs urban water security has been recognized as a crucial factor to achieve sustainable development united nations published the agenda 2030 for sustainable development and announced 15 sustainable development goals sdgs to call for global awareness and to urge all governments for enhancing their sustainability practices united nations 2015 urban water security directly connects two sdgs namely sdg6 clean water and sanitation and sdg11 sustainable cities and communities this shows its importance in achieving sustainable development united nations 2015 to date more than half of the global population live in urban area and that proportion is expected to increase to two thirds by 2050 united nations 2017 united nations 2018 world economic forum 2019 once urban water security deteriorates large urban populations bear the influences and the whole society will pay a high price in terms of financial and social resources chen and shi 2016 jensen and wu 2018 romero lankao and gnatz 2016 this significance highlights the need for protecting urban water security and has fostered the research on urban water security 1 1 literature review urban water security has strong linkages to sustainability however literature has seldom systematically and clearly brought the connection into urban water security assessments gain et al 2016 nazemi and madani 2018 nie et al 2018 romero lankao and gnatz 2016 sustainability topics have been more often considered in the evaluation of water system services and water management than in the investigation of water security gohar et al 2019 hellström et al 2000 koop and van leeuwen 2015 li et al 2017 lundin and morrison 2002 marques et al 2015 rijsberman and van de ven 2000 van leeuwen et al 2012 several water security studies have integrated the indicators associated with socio economic condition or government responses in the assessment arfanuzzaman and atiq rahman 2017 chen and shi 2016 chen et al 2013 ghosh et al 2019 huang and yang 2017 jia et al 2015 van ginkel et al 2018 nevertheless they have only addressed single or few sustainability dimensions in the evaluation until recently urban water security studies have comprehensively incorporated sustainability topics into the assessment frameworks for instance gain et al 2016 romero lankao and gnatz 2016 srinivasan et al 2017 and nie et al 2018 emphasized the multi dimensional nature of water security and urged the needs to address sustainability topics in water security assessment moreover daniell et al 2015 clearly illustrated the interaction between the sustainability domains and urban water security to stress the relevance of sustainability to urban water security assessment however the comprehensive inclusion of sustainability topics in urban water security research has not received enough attention gain et al 2016 in addition the objectives and needs of urban water management practice have been barely considered in current urban water security studies the objectives and needs vary with changing urban development progress some studies have urged the consideration of urban water management transitions to analyze water conditions in cities brown et al 2009 daniell et al 2015 hoekstra et al 2018 brown et al 2009 firstly illustrated the six stages of urban water management transitions namely the water supply city the sewered city the drained city the waterways city the water cycle city and the water sensitive city the targets and measures of water management gradually go beyond the basic concerns e g water supply during city development the transitions are pushed by social political economic drives and attendant new objectives of urban water management are added in each stage to date several studies have adopted the concept of urban water management transitions in urban water planning research but only focused on specific phases e g the water sensitive city daniell et al 2015 sullivan et al 2017 and the water sensitive urban design hussey and kay 2015 madonsela et al 2019 wong and brown 2011 those features of urban water management transitions shall be used to establish a more suitable realistic scope of urban water security assessment brown et al 2009 hoekstra et al 2018 urban water security is a relative concept without a standardized quantitative yardstick and the status can thus hardly be measured in an absolute value it addresses interdisciplinary topics with different research methods such as the indicator methods gong and jin 2014 huang et al 2015 jensen and nair 2019 jensen and wu 2018 lu et al 2016 nie et al 2018 the pressure state response methods ghosh et al 2019 arfanuzzaman and atiq rahman 2017 chen and shi 2016 chen et al 2013 huang and yang 2017 jia et al 2015 van ginkel et al 2018 the system dynamic methods sahin et al 2017 su et al 2017 xiong et al 2018 the water footprint methods cheng 2019 deng et al 2014 the risk based water management methods hall and borgomeo 2013 nie et al 2018 and the vulnerability methods li et al 2009 zhi and xue 2018 among the methods the indicator methods have been widely applied since they allow a comprehensive assessment by tackling multi dimensional indicators relevant to urban water security into frameworks li et al 2019 multi criteria decision analysis mcda models have been frequently used to support the indicator method by incorporating a variety of indicators into composite indices or frameworks of urban water security chen and shi 2016 chen et al 2013 el gafy 2018 huang and yang 2017 huang et al 2015 jensen and wu 2018 koop and van leeuwen 2015 li et al 2009 2019 lu et al 2016 nie et al 2018 peng et al 2016 romero lankao and gnatz 2016 shalamzari and zhang 2018 van leeuwen et al 2012 wang et al 2016 through the general approach of mcda models indicator normalization weighting determination and aggregation oecd 2008 singh et al 2012 velasquez and hester 2013 the summarized results can provide a general picture of urban water security status in a quantitative manner and benefit policy making and communication however aggregated results can be affected by the weights of indicators among the available weighting methods the panel methods in which people are asked to assign weights to indicators have been intensively applied in water resource management and water security studies chen et al 2013 huang et al 2015 li et al 2009 lu et al 2016 nie et al 2018 zardari et al 2015 rowley et al 2012 the panel methods can be performed by applying different approaches e g questionnaires and interviews panel compositions e g experts and stakeholders and procedures e g delphi rowley et al 2012 nevertheless the weights determined by the panel methods can be greatly varied depending on the value choices of researchers and stakeholders and thus increase the uncertainty of analytical results to lower the uncertainty the data driven methods that detect a weighting scheme inherent to the dataset itself by solving mathematical models without a consideration of the stakeholders value choices have been increasingly applied harmancioglu et al 2008 narayanamoorthy et al 2019 rowley et al 2012 zardari et al 2015 the entropy method shannon 1948 and the criteria importance through intercriteria correlation critic method diakoulaki et al 1995 are recognized as two of the popular data driven methods zardari et al 2015 the entropy method quantifies the contrast intensity i e the divergence of indicator values to derive indicator weights it assigns higher weights the more differentiated the values of the examined indicators are diakoulaki et al 1995 shannon 1948 zardari et al 2015 in addition to the consideration of contrast intensity the critic method addresses the conflict between indicators to cope with the interdependency of indicators the critic method explicitly suits mcda studies since it can capture more information embedded in and between indicators and has been applied in water management research harmancioglu et al 2008 narayanamoorthy et al 2019 zardari et al 2015 1 2 research objectives china s mega cities especially the municipalities namely shanghai beijing tianjin and chongqing have faced a dramatically intensive economic growth and social development and the expected pressures e g water pollutions and depletion on urban water security have greatly increased the location of the municipalities is shown in fig 1 the municipalities are directly controlled under the central government and have political economic and cultural importance throughout the country due to the unique position they have attracted a large population regrading residence commuting tourism and business purposes and fostered regional and even national economic development in this context the pursuit of water security in municipalities has been more urgent compared to other mega cities however the literature has not yet investigated and compared the performance and features of urban water security of china s municipalities several studies evaluated the condition of water security for a specific mega city such as chengdu chen and shi 2016 huang and yang 2017 li et al 2009 and dalian huang et al 2015 or a city based administrative region like hongkong jensen and nair 2019 hence this study defined china s municipalities as the research objects and carried out an investigation of their development and hotspots of water security in order to improve current urban water security assessment this study demonstrated an urban water security assessment framework that integrates sustainability dimensions and the features of urban water management transitions and analyzed the status characteristics and challenges of water security of the four municipalities in china during 2011 2017 the study also employed the critic method to assign weights to indicators without considering personal value choices to improve the results robustness this study can be a foundation to develop urban water security assessment frameworks that address sustainable development and urban water management practice allowing for both methodological and

flowing through the territory are the yongding river the chaobai river the north canal and the juma river beijing municipal people s government 2019 apart from being a municipality from 1949 beijing is the capital of china as the political cultural and research center of china the population has reached 21 million and the annual gdp per capita has increased to 128 994 chinese yuan in 2017 national bureau of statistics 2019 2 1 3 tianjin tianjin is situated in north china and is the confluence and estuary of the five major tributaries of the haihe river the total area is 11 916 85 km2

economic and social development in the western region and the upper reaches of the yangtze river it is an important modern manufacturing base of china and the economic structure has transformed and upgraded at a fast pace chongqing municipal people s government 2019 2 2 urban water security assessment framework as shown in fig 2 we proposed an urban water security assessment framework in three steps namely identifying indicator categories selecting indicators and collecting data to better respond to the proposed definition of urban water security we suggested the urban water security assessment framework by considering the six stages of urban water management transitions and the four sustainability dimensions as a backbone of the framework to our knowledge there is no literature specifying urban water management transitions and sustainability topics together in the evaluation of urban water security the concept of urban water management transitions and sustainability dimensions associated with urban water security is illustrated in section 2 2 1 and section 2 2 2 respectively then indicator selection and data collection are presented in section 2 2 3 2 2 1 concept of urban water management transitions the features of urban water management transitions should be considered to establish a comprehensive as well as realistic scope for urban water security assessment brown et al 2009 firstly introduced the six stages of urban water management transitions to reflect the features of urban water management practice the six stages are 1 the water supply city 2 the sewered city 3 the drained city 4 the waterways city 5 the water cycle city and 6 the water sensitive city brown et al 2009 daniell et al 2015 the six stages of urban water management transitions were applied as six indicator categories of the assessment framework the objectives and concerns of each stage are presented as below the water supply city ensures the availability and accessibility of water resources to residents and economic activities the objectives are to secure sufficient water supply and to keep water resources widely accessed the sewered city focuses on the provision of a wide coverage of sewage infrastructure to support public health by eradicating waterborne disease the drained city aims to enhance the coverage of drainage infrastructure to avoid the damage from flood the waterways city lays stress on improving water quality and amenity resulted from clean water bodies pollution treatment and prevention are the measures to support the aim the water cycle city emphasizes an efficient water resources consumption and urges the close loop of water use the water sensitive city enhances the resilience and adaptivity of disasters and climate change and supports sustainability and livability of cities these added objectives and concerns can promote urban water management towards a more integrated adaptive coordinated and participatory mechanism and strengthen institutional capacity and water resilience daniell et al 2015 hoekstra et al 2018 fig 3 shows a general picture of urban water management transitions including the objectives and corresponding focuses and service delivery to reach a more comprehensive and advanced water management the management stages gradually move to other ones with added targets we want to underline that the transitions do not have to develop in a linear way for instance in addition to the fulfillment of secured water supply the governments could enhance infrastructure coverage to guarantee sufficient sewage for the sewered city and drainage for the drained city collection at the meantime 2 2 2 concept of sustainability in urban water security sustainable development has become the conclusive goal for governments and societies to pursue according to the brundtland report united nations 1987 sustainable development was defined as a development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs urban water security plays as an important role in achieving sustainable development in terms of water resources protection sustainable urban development and other sustainability associated aspects such as ensuring good health and wellbeing and sustainable energy li et al 2009 the four dimensions of sustainability i e environment economy society and institution european commission 2012 can be the context and drivers of urban water management transitions and in turn can be influenced by the transitions as drawn in fig 3 economic development economic aspect and population growth social aspect are key drivers of water consumption and they bring about water pollution and thus affect water quality environmental aspect at the meantime water depletion and pollutions will restrict the economic activities objectives and emphasis of urban water management practice have altered and transited over time as economic development patterns social needs behavior values and climate have been changing daniell et al 2015 hoekstra et al 2018 growing concerns on environmental issues from governments institutional aspect have also promoted the transitions we considered the four sustainability dimensions as four categories to identify indicators associated with urban water security topics relevant to the context and drivers of sustainability dimensions are conceptually presented in fig 3 2 2 3 indicators identification and data collection we defined the six stages of urban water management transitions and the four sustainability dimensions as ten indicator categories of the assessment framework see table 1 we then took several urban water security studies e g aboelnga et al 2019 el gafy 2018 and jensen and wu 2018 and reports e g asian development bank 2013 2016 as references to select indicators because the studies provided a summary of urban water security assessment frameworks or specified the indicators and aspects relevant to urban water security evaluation global water partnership 2014 as shown in table 1 we identified the indicators based on the listed references in total 24 indicators were chosen from the open access government statistical databases to build the urban water security assessment framework see table 1 15 indicators were selected in accordance with the six stages of urban water management transitions and described in the following text to support the water supply city keeping water available and accessible to populations is essential three indicators water resources per capita length of water supply pipelines per capita and water supply pervasion rate were used to present the status of water availability resources endowment infrastructure coverage and water supply pervasion accessibility respectively for developing the sewered and drained city intensive infrastructure coverage contributes to a better sewerage and drainage collection we chose length of sewers per capita and length of drainage pipelines per capita to measure the sufficiency of sewerage and drainage infrastructure to urban populations pollution regulation and treatment act as crucial measures to support waterways cities five indicators wastewater discharge per capita chemical oxygen demand cod discharge per capita ammonium nitrogen discharge per capita wastewater treatment capacity and wastewater treatment rate were used to evaluate wastewater discharge pollutant cod and ammonia nitrogen discharge treatment capacity and treatment coverage respectively the water use efficiency determines the degree of success of realizing a water system with a closed loop for constructing a water cycle city water use per capita was selected to estimate a general stress given by water demand the indicator water reuse and recycling rate shows the industrial water utilization pattern towards a closed loop water use in order to develop towards a water sensitive city the frequency of environmental events e g numbers of abrupt environmental events and the degree of disaster damage e g disaster affected area and population were selected to represent disaster vulnerability of cities nine indicators were selected in line with the four sustainability dimensions environment economy society and institution to describe the urban context that could influence or be affected by water security condition the indicators are described below for considering environmental sustainability favorable water quality in rivers and extremely inferior water quality in rivers can show the influence of human activities to water bodies and the potential ecosystem damage green covered area as percentage of urban area serves as a relevant indicator to indicate ecosystem vitality of cities concerning the economic context economic growth is a driver that could increase water demand and therefore rises the pressure to urban water security economic growth rate was thus selected to present the potential pressure in addition water intensity of economic activities was assessed by the indicator water use per ten thousand chinese yuan gdp to show the water dependency for supporting the local industry population growth rate indicates the potential increase of water demand in society and brings about the pressure on water supply moreover population having subsistence allowance was used as an indicator to presume the capacity for residents to consume water resources the larger the population is the weaker is the capacity governments support to environmental protection and water affairs can boost the effectiveness of water security governance and was assessed by two indicators governments investment in water conservancy and environmental protection and governments expenditure on land resources and meteorology affairs respectively to ensure the applicability of the framework we collected data for the indicators to describe the ten categories from the open access statistical databases and reports provided by the governments e g water resources bulletin of the municipal governments beijing water authority 2019 chongqing water resources bureau 2019 shanghai water authority 2019 tianjin water authority 2019 statistical yearbook of urban construction in china ministry of housing and urban rural development of the people s republic of china 2019 and china statistical yearbook series national bureau of statistics 2019 data for the selected indicators for the four municipalities were collected from those databases and reports the timeframe considered for the comparative assessment was limited to 2011 2017 due to the restriction of data availability as an initiative study for building the urban water security assessment framework that tackles sustainability and urban water management objectives we noticed that the consideration of indicators needs to be continuously refined though there can be interdependency between the selected indicators we applied a data driven weighting method namely the critic method to address the conflict between indicators see the following section 2 3 2 in weighting determination and thus ensure the robustness of weighting results 2 3 estimation approach of urban water security condition having the urban water security assessment framework we designed an estimation approach for indicator normalization see section 2 3 1 weighting determination see section 2 3 2 and aggregation see section 2 3 3 to illustrate annual water security condition of the four municipalities during 2011 2017 2 3 1 indicator normalization normalization transfers indicator values into a common scale to facilitate the aggregation of indicators into a summarized score oecd 2008 singh et al 2012 velasquez and hester 2013 in this study linear scaling was used as the normalization method to transform the indicator values into 0 1 scale linear scaling transformation requires two reference points minimum and maximum reference points for each indicator minimum and maximum reference points were determined in accordance to the lowest and the highest indicator values collected for an indicator among the four municipalities from 2011 to 2017 this setting allows a comparative assessment of water security condition across municipalities and years the normalized indicator scores were calculated based on the determined reference points depending on the type i e so called positive indicators and negative indicators of indicators the normalized indicator scores were calculated differently for positive indicators e g wastewater treatment rate a higher indicator value means a higher positive contribution to urban water security for negative indicators e g cod discharge per capita a higher indicator value means a higher negative influence on urban water security the normalized score s i i for a positive indicator i with data of a specific investigated municipality i was measured by equation 1 1 s i i v i i r m i r m i r m i v i i denotes the value for a positive indicator i of a specific municipality i r m i and r m i represent the maximum and minimum reference points for i respectively the normalized score s i i for a negative indicator i with data of a specific municipality i was measured according to eq 2 2 s i i r m i v i i r m i r m i v i i denotes the value for a negative indicator i of a specific municipality i r m i and r m i represent the maximum and minimum reference points for i respectively 2 3 2 the critic method for weights determination in this study a data driven method the critic the criteria importance through intercriteria correlation method was applied to determine indicator weights diakoulaki et al 1995 proposed the critic method that detects indicator weights by incorporating both contrast intensity and conflict based on the extraction of information contained in the indicators jahan et al 2012 the method can be easily converted into an algorithmic form and enables the incorporation of interdependent indicators jahan et al 2012 to identify indicator weights first vector x j of the normalized matrix was generated where x j indicates the normalized scores of an indicator j for the four municipalities with data during 2011 2017 x j was then characterized by the standard deviation σ j quantifying the contrast intensity of indicator j diakoulaki et al 1995 rostamzadeh et al 2018 tuş and aytaç adalı 2019 zardari et al 2015 afterwards linear correlation coefficients r jk between the vectors x j and x k were computed to construct a symmetric matrix with dimensions n n n denotes the number of indicators k 1 2 3 n if the value of r jk decreases this indicates that the indicators j and k are more discordant in this sense r jk represents the conflict embedded by indicator j with respect to the rest of the indicators diakoulaki et al 1995 rostamzadeh et al 2018 tuş and aytaç adalı 2019 zardari et al 2015 then the amount of information cj conveyed by indicator j was estimated by comprising the two measures i e the contrast intensity and conflict in equation 3 the higher the value cj is the larger is the amount of information transmitted by indicator j and the higher is its relative importance the weight wj of indicator j was determined by normalizing the value cj in to unity equation 4 diakoulaki et al 1995 rostamzadeh et al 2018 tuş and aytaç adalı 2019 zardari et al 2015 in this sense the weights of other indicators were derived by applying equations 3 and 4 as well 3 c j σ j k 1 n 1 r jk 4 w j c j j 1 n c k 1 2 3 3 aggregation approach in this study the weighted sum method was used to aggregate the indicators singh et al 2012 ehrgott 2005 based on the normalized scores s ij and the given weights of the indicators see sections 2 3 1 and 2 3 2 indicators were aggregated into a single score q i to represent the annual urban water security condition of the municipalities according to equation 5 5 q i j 1 n s ij w j as the normalized scores of indicators range between 0 and 1 see section 2 3 1 q i also ranges between 0 and 1 it is assumed that the higher q i is the better is the urban water security condition 3 results and discussion the following sections present the findings of the comparative assessment of annual urban water security condition of the municipalities section 3 1 and analyze the features concerns as well as policy implications of water security of each municipality section 3 2 research limitations and prospects are elaborated in section 3 3 3 1 general urban water security condition of china s municipalities indicator weights were detected according to the indictor normalization approach and the critic method see sections 2 3 1 and 2 3 2 table 2 lists the indicator weights and shows the ten highest weights in bold the indicator water reuse and recycling rate has the highest importance among the 24 indicators followed by water use per capita green covered area as percentage of urban area wastewater treatment capacity ammonia nitrogen discharge per capita proportion of crops affected area by flood and drought in total municipal area and others the higher the weight is the larger is the amount of information transmitted by the indicator therefore we recognized that there has been significant variated status of water use efficiency pollutant discharge wastewater treatment capacity green covered area river quality environmental events and crop affected area by flood and drought between the four municipalities in accordance with the aggregation approach section 2 3 3 the single scores that summarize annual water security condition of the four municipalities were then calculated listed in table 3 based on the single scores fig 4 illustrates the development of urban water security condition of the four municipalities it was found that water security condition of all municipalities has gradually enhanced from 2011 to 2017 in general tables a 1 a 4 listed in appendix a provide the raw data used in the assessment for the four municipalities and the normalized indicator scores the results point out that beijing has had the best water security condition in 2017 followed by tianjin shanghai and chongqing in addition table 3 shows that shanghai has had the largest improvement of the overall water security condition during the investigated period and beijing has showed the least among others in the following section we further specify the features and challenges of water security to each municipality 3 2 features and policy implications of water security condition of china s municipalities to give a closer look the features and challenges of water security condition of individual municipalities are described in the following sections 3 2 1 shanghai shanghai has the most intensive coverage of sewer infrastructure and sufficient wastewater treatment capacity among china s municipalities besides this residents and agricultural activities have been less affected by droughts and floods the proportion of rivers in inferior water quality has significantly reduced during the investigated period on the other hand shanghai has several weak points threating water security households and economic activities consume a great amount of water in 2017 water use per capita of shanghai has reached 433 cubic meters 2 38 times that of beijing 2 46 times that of tianjin and 1 71 times that of chongqing such massive water use alerts the criticality of water use efficiency and has brought about significant pressure on water security in addition shanghai has the largest wastewater and ammonia nitrogen discharge among the municipalities especially ammonia nitrogen discharge per capita has gone to 15 3 kg in 2017 1 35 2 68 times that of the other municipalities it points out that the local governments should pay attention to the regulation of wastewater and pollutant discharge in order to prevent the negative effect on human health and ecosystem despite the fact that droughts and floods have made relatively little damage to residents and economic activities abrupt environmental events have frequently occurred in shanghai from 2011 to 2017 the average number of abrupt environmental events in shanghai was six times that in beijing and chongqing and 95 times that in tianjin this underlines the great risks on urban water security caused by environmental events and therefore the local government should reinforce the capacity in disaster prevention and mitigation 3 2 2 beijing unlike the concerns in shanghai water use and pollutant i e cod and ammonia nitrogen discharge have been less critical the amount of water use and pollutant discharge has been the least in beijing among the municipalities during the investigated years nevertheless the degree of water reuse and recycling has been relatively low in beijing as a city with low rainfall and water resources like beijing local government and society should attach importance to the closed loop of water use beijing has the largest coverage of urban landscaping among the municipalities representing a relatively vital ecosystem concerning the economic context low water intensity indicates less water dependency for supporting economic activities reducing the pressure on water security regarding the social aspect a relatively low share of the population having subsistence allowance indicates that beijing residents have had better water consuming capacity compared to the other municipalities droughts and floods have brought about a negative effect on households and agricultural activities in beijing however government expenditure on land resources and meteorology affairs and the investment in fixed assets for water conservancy environment and public facilities have been in severe minority and thus insufficiently contributed to improving urban resilience it s worth noting that the share of favorable water quality of rivers has decreased during the investigated period local government should notice the deterioration of river quality and advance the supporting policy measures e g monitoring and levy 3 2 3 tianjin tianjin and beijing have several commons of water security because of their similar climate and geographic condition first though the comparative assessment points out that water use per capita has not been recognized as a tough water security topic water availability i e the amount of water resources per capita has been a difficult concern of tianjin and beijing and thus laid pressure on water security limited water resources could be caused by the relatively low rainfall this restriction may have resulted in an efficient water use behavior and economic patterns in low water intensity and thus decreased the water use per capita in the both municipalities second residents and agricultural activities in both municipalities have been largely affected by droughts and floods and the damages have greatly fluctuated during 2011 2017 unlike the beijing government the tianjin authorities have arranged a more sufficient fixed asset investment and expenditure for water conservancy environmental protection and resource management the arrangement can contribute to the reduction of disaster risks third river quality has not been enhanced in the both municipalities and tianjin has faced a lower water quality condition it is one of the biggest challenges for tianjin to address the low water quality since its rivers are black and odorous apart from the commons some dissimilarities have existed between tianjin and beijing for example tianjin has the best performance regarding water reuse and recycling among the municipalities and therefore it has the leading position with regard to water efficiency on the other side tianjin has shown the relatively low wastewater treatment capacity and limited coverage of urban landscaping the low water treatment capacity could be a factor that affects river quality 3 2 4 chongqing due to abundant water resource endowment and physiographic condition chongqing has the most plentiful water resources to support households and economic development and also has the best river quality among the considered municipalities nevertheless water use efficiency has been a relevant issue as well as a hidden danger in chongqing water use per capita and water reuse and recycling have been recognized as critical downsides that threat water security moreover chongqing has the highest water intensity among the municipalities in other words the economic activities have significantly depended on the water resources without proper industrial transformation technological upgrading and water saving management water security condition will be continuously damaged in the long run having a large population affected by floods over years the chongqing government has laid attention to supporting the land resources and meteorology affairs and the investment in fixed assets of water conservancy and public facilities to prevent flood damage improve water management capacity and advance infrastructure however chongqing has been the only municipality without complete water supply pervasion furthermore the intensity of sewers and drainage pipeline coverage has been the least sufficient among the four municipalities chongqing government should focus on the enhancement of infrastructure planning and construction wastewater discharge per capita in chongqing has been identified as the lowest of the four municipalities however the amount of pollutant cod and ammonia nitrogen discharge per capita has largely increased over years and could threat the water quality in the local and the lower reaches of the yangtze river last but not least chongqing has had the largest share of population having subsistence allowance among china s municipalities that means the water consumption capacity of residents can have been restricted in chongqing and the residents have been comparatively more vulnerable than in the other municipalities while carrying out water resources management practices the government should also pay attention to the water capacity and rights of vulnerable groups 3 3 research limitations and prospects apart from the findings and policy implications outlined in this study some limitations remain first some indicators e g the frequency of flood control training could be relevant to urban water security but were not considered in the framework at present due to the limited data availability as an initiative study the suggested framework will have to be refined and updated when additional indicators and data regarding urban water security become available cities could have a greatly diverse resource endowment social context and characteristics of water management researchers can moderately expand the framework by including additional indicators with regard to the features of cities the next steps of this study are establishing frameworks for individual groups of cities which have similar natural and social context for a better comparative assessment and suggesting roadmaps for different grouped cities to improve water security conditions this study linearly transformed the indicator values into 0 1 scale over the range of the maximum and minimum indicator values this indicator normalization approach has been widely applied in mcda studies singh et al 2012 nevertheless the linear scaling approach can bring about the loss of data proportionality rowley et al 2012 for example if the values of a given indicator are close in all municipalities the municipalities which perform slightly worse than the others will score 0 in the context of the linear scaling approach if that indicator is weighted highly then the slightly poor performing municipality may be greatly penalized rowley et al 2012 to lower the bias in result interpretation researchers should always provide the data in a transparent way and decision makers should understand the data and the meaning of indicators in water management practice the critic method was used to detect the indicator weights without considering personal judgements and thus increased scientific robustness of analysis however the data driven indicator weights may contradict to policy preferences or can not represent the level of potential impacts on society for example the indicator water supply pervasion rate was not assigned to a high weight compared to the other considered indicators but the differences of water supply pervasion rate between the municipalities imply that the large urban populations have been influenced by insufficient water supply condition decision makers should identify the improvement needs of urban water security not only referring to the indicator weights and aggregated results but also considering the original data and urban context in order to enhance policy practicality researchers can integrate different weighting approaches e g the panel methods and the data driven methods to incorporate local water management strategies i e policy preferences in the assessment 4 conclusions this study applied a water security assessment framework which incorporates the features of urban water management transitions and sustainability aspects to analyze the urban water security condition of china s municipalities namely shanghai beijing tianjin and chongqing during 2011 2017 beijing has had the best water security condition followed by tianjin shanghai and chongqing shanghai has shown the largest improvement of water security condition among the municipalities during the investigated period in addition the condition of water use efficiency river quality pollutant discharge green covered area wastewater treatment capacity abrupt environmental events and crop area affected by droughts and floods has shown a great variation between the municipalities furthermore this study is a leading paper to analyze the characteristics and weaknesses of water security specific to china s municipalities and points out the needs for policy improvement the outcome serves as a foundation to support tailoring policy measurements to cities in various water security
