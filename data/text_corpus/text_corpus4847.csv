24235,the urban socioeconomic metabolism of multiple flows of resources is highly complex our concern is that of moderating the environmental burden and intensity of this metabolism and elevating its circularity through technological interventions in the composition of urban infrastructure the paper addresses present and possible future patterns of the nitrogen n metabolism of suzhou china using a multi sectoral systems analysis msa model of the water energy food forestry and waste management sectors of the city s infrastructure and economy two of the triple bottom lines are employed in the assessment those of the economic feasibility and the environmental benignity of the technological interventions environmental benignity is gauged by three metabolic performance metrics mpms 15 scenarios of these interventions are assessed each being a different combination of introducing four particular promising technologies the mpms allow ranking of the scenarios according to first the ratio of incoming resource flows into the city and outgoing socio economically beneficial products and second the rates at which wastes of no value are released to the atmosphere as air pollutants hydrosphere water pollutants and the lithosphere solid wastes the economic feasibility of the options can similarly be ranked according to the monetary values of resources such as clean water or energy that are saved by lowered urban consumption or that are recovered such as biofuels or fertilizer for beneficial re circulation and re use all four candidate technological innovations are associated with the water and waste management sectors of urban infrastructure we show that the trio of urine separating technology cultivation of algal biomass in wastewater treatment and pyrolysis of animal manure can achieve an expected net annual economic benefit of 1 4b yuan together with the potential to recover some 31 gg n yr 1 notably our computational assessment accounts for uncertainty using monte carlo simulation and sensitivity testing in particular we examine how uncertainty may significantly undermine the conclusions we may draw about the promise of any given technological innovation vis à vis another alternative graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords urban nitrogen metabolism water energy food nexus data uncertainty circular economy resource recovery technological innovation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction cities are where multiple flows of vital resources carbon nitrogen n phosphorus energy water and so on interact in the most intense and complex of ways villarroel walker et al 2017 fang and chen 2017 looked at from another perspective given the current prominence of discussions of nexus issues beck and villarroel walker 2013 leck et al 2015 villarroel walker et al 2014 cities are also the focal destination for supplies of food water and energy they are the locus of some of the strongest of interactions among the three attaching economic sectors and they are the most conspicuous source of what we have conventionally labelled as the waste flows of food water and energy or rather the flows of the residuals of urban metabolism which are duly released to the terrestrial aquatic and atmospheric environments beck et al 2018 put a different way we can say this pre consumption resources flow into the city and post consumption resources flow out of the city post consumption flows in a circular economy gregson et al 2015 quina et al 2018 beck et al 2019 will return courtesy of a number of recovery technologies and suitably sustained ecosystem services villarroel walker et al 2017 beck 2016 as pre consumption resources for the re production and re supply of food energy and water this all sounds very modern and contemporary but while the words and labels may have changed in fact the circular urban metabolism was present and prospering in paris in the 1700s and throughout the 1800s notably in respect of nitrogen barles 2007 barles and lestel 2007 the same obtained in linköping sweden in respect of phosphorus neset et al 2008 across the twentieth century as a result of profound changes in for instance urban water and sanitation infrastructure and urban and global transport infrastructures it became progressively more and more difficult to discern any such circularity in the urban metabolism and quite a challenge to conceive of working one s way back to something akin to it to re engineer the infrastructure of the city that is such that it may become a force for good cfg in the environment a net generator of ecosystem services beck 2011 one possibly attractive approach to the analysis of such issues is that of a system of systems modeling framework otto et al 2016 at the core of that particular approach to the analysis of future national infrastructure requirements in the uk is the matching of demand for a service energy water and so on to the capacity to supply that service the strongest of inter dependencies between one service sector and another are those associated with the demand for energy otto et al 2016 this approach however yields no insight into the nature of the resource flows among the various sectors of infrastructure hence no insights into the urban metabolism or the circularity of the attaching economy it is as if the model accounts for the easily recognizable and familiar superstructure of infrastructures water energy food waste transport whereas what we wish to reveal has to do with the much less familiar and more difficult to recognize sub structure of infrastructures i e the flows of water energy nitrogen phosphorus and carbon among and around the various sectors the purpose of the analyses reported herein indeed requires a different approach in short our present interest is in examining the cross sectoral and cross media implications of a sample of technology policy interventions in the water sector for the resource metabolism of a city suzhou china given that promoting technological progress of the renewable resource and energy industry could drive the transition to low emission urban development zhao et al 2021 zhao and wang 2020 a secondary purpose of our analyses is investigation of the ways in which and the extent to which uncertainty in data and a computational model undermine the capacity for clear conclusions to be drawn about promising and unpromising technological interventions to these ends over the past decade we have been developing and applying an approach to the study of urban metabolism based on substance flow analysis sfa we shall refer to it as a multi sectoral systems analysis msa an outline of this framework is given in section 3 of the paper along with then in section 4 a more precise triangulation of the rather broad goals of our analysis as just expressed the challenges of our analysis are complex irreducibly so in many ways for such complexity to be fully and properly appreciated the scope and make up of the msa framework must first be introduced and summarily set out as in section 3 the prototypical case study in applying msa referred to the metabolism of the city of atlanta within the upper chattahoochee watershed in the south eastern usa villarroel walker and beck 2012 in essence those first results provided general insights into the magnitudes and uncertainties of the principal flows of nitrogen phosphorus carbon water and energy through and around the atlanta chattahoochee system together with a sense of the relative significance of the interactions among the various economic sectors of water energy food forestry and waste management analysis of some of these interactions specifically between water and nutrients especially n is provided in a second paper villarroel walker et al 2012 along with comparable results for water energy interactions in a second case study of the city of london uk the comparative nature of our work for the respective metabolisms of atlanta and london is highlighted elsewhere beck et al 2013 the wider scope of msa i e its capacity to identify particular flows of resources that are key to the attainment of future metabolic performance targets in respect of nitrogen phosphorus carbon water and energy is also demonstrated in beck and villarroel walker 2013 more extensive and more detailed results for the london case study are given in villarroel walker et al 2014 2017 some of these include identification of the potential technological innovations associated with the key resource flows for improving urban metabolic performance together with those businesses currently engaged in developing the technological innovations in other words msa is cast in terms of the sub structure of resource flows in the city but readily permits working back up from this basis to deductions and conclusions about the super structure of customary infrastructure sectors and their attaching segments of the economy our case study of suzhou china builds upon these later developments in the application of msa compared with the previous studies of atlanta and london the present study pays special attention to the use of msa in revealing the cross sectoral and cross media interconnections of urban resource metabolism there is little merit in a candidate innovation that transforms say a current atmospheric pollutant burden into a future aquatic and solid waste burden in addition a study of suzhou provides insight into the metabolic characteristics of typical resource intensive cities in china for contrast and comparison therefore with cities such as london and atlanta such comparisons however are beyond the scope of the present paper likewise we should note this restriction of our present study msa is extensive in its coverage of the urban metabolism it is multi resource carbon nitrogen phosphorus water energy multi sectoral water energy food forestry waste handling and multi media terrestrial aquatic atmospheric in its scope the volume and detail of its computational results are substantial thus while there are policy and on the ground restrictions to our analysis notably the infrastructure of the energy sector in suzhou will be locked into fossil fuel technology for several decades to come there are also pragmatic technical reasons for confining the discussion of the present paper to the urban n metabolism alone the remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows our review of the literature on the global regional and urban scales of n metabolism is presented in section 2 followed by the introduction of msa model in section 3 three criteria for assessment of candidate technology policy interventions will be referred to as metabolic performance metrics mpms and be defined in section 4 to accompany there the more detailed definition and expression of the goals of our computational analyses section 5 presents the first segment of results from our studies with msa an overview of the ranking of the significance under uncertainty of the principal flows of n through the five economic sectors of suzhou in section 6 our second tranche of results addresses the impacts and implications again under uncertainty of fifteen scenarios for implementing four candidate technologies in the water and waste management sectors for improving suzhou s n metabolism according to our three mpms we examine some of the cross sectoral and cross media inter dependencies embedded in the msa results and close by examining the importance of uncertainty in our capacity to draw clear conclusions about those candidate technology policy interventions with the greatest potential to improve the urban n metabolism section 7 concludes with an economic assessment of the possible costs and benefits of the various technological interventions as a result of their cross sectoral effects 2 nitrogen metabolism of cities it is helpful to distinguish between atmospheric dinitrogen gas n2 and reactive nitrogen which comprises all the other compound forms of nitrogen in macroscopic terms and to simplify for present purposes reactive nitrogen enters naturally into the metabolism of the biosphere through its biological fixation from atmospheric n2 and from volcanic eruptions and lightning given man s industrial agricultural and economic activities it enters into the metabolism of the biosphere through industrial ammonia nh3 production the majority of which is converted into artificial fertilizers along with the concomitant biological fixation of n2 in agricultural and silvicultural activities it also enters the biosphere through fossil fuel combustion which we may view as the re release of immobilized but reactive n from a previous era of plant life the n metabolism of cities mirrors the two predominant anthropogenic flows of nitrogen from fuel combustion in the energy and transport sectors to the resulting gaseous pollutant waste forms of reactive n notably no x and from food production food sector and consumption to sewage water sector and compost waste management sector which will include wasted non consumed food in contrast to the latter food related flow the forms of reactive n produced from fuel combustion generate no other forms deemed useful to man s socioeconomic life erisman and larsen 2013 in terms of improving the circularity of the urban n metabolism it is important to retain the desirable forms of reactive n in productive circulation without their being returned unproductively to atmospheric n2 taking a historical perspective erisman et al 2008 wrote of how a century of ammonia synthesis changed the world they were marking the centenary of the invention of the haber bosch process just before the first world war which had massively accelerated and expanded the industrial production of nh3 from atmospheric n2 at the global scale galloway et al 2002 tell us further that in the late 20th century anthropogenic haber bosch n fixation from the atmosphere overtook natural terrestrial n fixation erisman and larsen 2013 for their part observe that the total rate of producing reactive n in the global food and energy sectors has increased by a factor of 1 5 to 2 over the past 50 100 years or so in short this pattern of disruption amplification and intensification of the global movement of n is now well known and widely discussed galloway et al 2014 2017 shibata et al 2017 remaining at the global scale of assessment erisman and larsen 2013 provide the following estimations on the principal flows of reactive n natural biological fixation of n from atmospheric n2 at the turn of the millennium was some 120 tg n yr 1 while biological fixation through the associated agricultural activities was put at 30 tg n yr 1 the two primary flows of anthropogenically generated reactive n i e fossil fuel combustion in the energy and transport sectors and n flows in the food water waste sectors corresponded to about 40 tg n yr 1 and 100 tg n yr 1 of n flux respectively in addition to place a desirable limit on the scale of such flows rockström et al 2009 in their analysis and prescription of safe planetary boundaries propose that anthropogenic production of reactive n should be no more than 35 tg n yr 1 looking to the future erisman and larsen 2013 suggest that by 2050 optimization of fossil fuel combustion systems could lead to a decrease of 8 tg n yr 1 in the production of reactive n along that path along the other path from the roughly 50 tg n yr 1 of reactive n forecast to be present in wastewater by 2050 the comparable estimate for 2000 was about 25 tg n yr 1 the improved elimination of such n by wastewater treatment could be as much as 5 tg n yr 1 the goal of nutrient n and phosphorus removal in wastewater treatment is to curb pollution of the aquatic environment in respect of eutrophication but the improved elimination of reactive n from sewage is not what we are seeking in this paper nor emphatically is it what larsen and her colleagues are seeking to achieve in their paradigm breaking book source separation and decentralization for wastewater management larsen et al 2013 for one thing it does not make a lot of sense to expend significant amounts of energy in taking n2 from the atmosphere to synthesize fertilizers at the beginning of the flow of reactive n into and along the food water waste pathway only then to expend not insignificant amounts of energy in the biological nitrification denitrification of sewage in order to return the reactive n to the atmosphere as n2 to summarize much research has been carried out on the cycling and metabolism of nitrogen at the global scale bodirsky et al 2014 fujimori and matsuoka 2007 galloway et al 2014 2004 and the national scale filoso et al 2006 gu et al 2015 ortiz zayas et al 2006 ti et al 2012 yet these studies at the macroscopic scale based on the analysis of large but general databases make it difficult to characterize the complex specific relationships among the multiple flows of n not surprisingly therefore previous studies at a regional scale baker et al 2001 faerge et al 2001 dong et al 2020 could be more helpful to our present purposes notably for the agricultural food sector s antikainen et al 2005 forkes 2007 zhang et al 2022 likewise refining assessments down to the urban scale has allowed exploration of what might be effective environmental n pollution control measures and resource recovery plans for cities such as advanced manure and waste processing coppens et al 2016 treatment of blackwater and greywater firmansyah et al 2017 and increased n use efficiency zhang et al 2023 in fact we may also note significant progress in parallel studies of phosphorus metabolism at the national tasmeea et al 2021 mnthambala et al 2021 regional chowdhury et al 2016 theobald et al 2016 and urban scales treadwell et al 2018 wu et al 2016 xiong et al 2020 we do so because this together with the greater focus of n metabolism studies at the global national and regional scales serves to emphasize the comparative lack of detailed descriptions of the urban n metabolism we judge this to be a consequence of indeed the sheer complexity of that urban n metabolism since nitrogen through so many complex biogeochemical reactions plays a pivotal role in almost every natural process and human activity in an urban ecosystem which is apparent from our previous work on the city of atlanta villarroel walker and beck 2012 in addition most studies focus on merely enumeration of the urban n metabolism on how large are the various flows accordingly questions of how and which policy technology interventions might change the current status are in general not addressed nor are those of the potential environmental economic and social benefits of adopting cross sectoral and nexus approaches to improving the circularity of the urban n metabolism under uncertainty our suzhou case study contributes therefore by addressing directly the foregoing knowledge gap furthermore it does so in the context of acknowledging the inevitable uncertainty that must surround any such assessments of possible technological interventions 3 case study city of suzhou china turning thus to our case study location we note the following regarding current flows of reactive n in china as a whole in 2020 total energy consumption in china amounted to 4980 tg of standard coal among which coal consumption accounted for 56 8 nbsprc 2021 given that chinese coal has an average n content of 0 52 ཞ1 41 wu et al 2011 in excess of some 27 7 tg of reactive n could have been released with gaseous emissions along this flowpath primarily through the energy sector this is roughly equal to the estimated 25 0 tg of industrially produced reactive n entering the second primary pathway through the biosphere as fertilizer nbsprc 2021 gu et al 2015 in addition nitrogen use efficiencies in croplands livestock and grassland in china were estimated to be merely around 39 16 and 5 respectively with therefore large amounts of reactive n not being put to good use gu et al 2017 in summary the economic industrial structure of suzhou is typical of many of the major cities of china indeed similarly typical of such cities is that the structure of suzhou s energy sector and current policy regarding the city s fuel combustion hence the anthropogenic generation of unproductive reactive n are not expected to change significantly coal will remain suzhou s most important source of energy in the light of this outlook our case study will address the scope for improving the n metabolism of suzhou through technological interventions in the water and waste management sectors in particular in the wastewater sub sector 3 1 reference year for analysis 2015 the city of suzhou is located in jiangsu province china data and parameterization for setting up the msa refer to conditions in 2015 given the good availability of data for that year in 2015 the city s population was about 10 6 m and its areal extent was 8657 km2 37 of which was covered by water suzhou is in fact famous for its aquatic environments which comprise more than 20 000 watercourses and 300 lakes this notwithstanding since the late 1980s lake tai has become one of the most eutrophic lakes in china forested land coverage is about 28 of the city s area together therefore the water and forestry sectors amount to 65 of the city s area hence they are important considerations in our study economically suzhou s gdp in 2015 was 1 450b yuan 230b us ranking it thus as 7th among china s cities the proportions of primary to secondary to tertiary industry were 1 5 48 6 49 9 which gives the city a heavy reliance on energy consumption the supply of which is essentially entirely imported for 2015 the city s total energy consumption amounted to 82 tg of standard coal with total consumption of electricity being 131b kwh 3 2 the msa model in greater detail our experience in using our msa approach has already been summarized in the foregoing suffice it to say the substance flow analysis sfa on which it is based has found wide application elsewhere with the work of bringezu and moriguchi 2002 and the review of allesch and brunner 2015 being indicative computationally the msa entails a two step procedure a monte carlo simulation to account for uncertainty in the analysis and a sensitivity test using the kolmogorov smirnoff statistic designed to detect the significance or otherwise of the differences between in effect model parameterizations technologies in effect that enable the city to exceed a specified level of urban metabolic performance and those that do not villarroel walker 2010 accounting for uncertainty is a key and a distinctive feature of msa hence we discuss data uncertainty in section 3 3 below and the impact of uncertainty on our interpretation of the computational results from msa in sections 5 and 6 following the general pattern of socioeconomic life in the city the msa model recognizes five economic sectors water food forestry energy and waste management as is shown in fig 1 flows of resources are exchanged among these sectors as well as between them and segments of the external environment namely the hydrosphere atmosphere and lithosphere the metabolism of each sector entails processing units that handle treat separate or transform material flows to gage the scope and detail covered by msa we offer this comparison the study of flows of n in coppens et al 2016 which stresses the high resolution thereof covers 21 process compartments and 160 individual nutrient flows in contrast our msa study covers 30 processing units and 350 constituent material flows which collectively entail 635 model parameters summary accounts of the structure of the material flow sub models of each of the five sectors of msa now follow 3 2 1 food sector plant production fertilizer use and the import consumption and export of food and animal fodder are the principal processing activities of the food sector given the restriction of our study primarily to analysis of that flow of n entering the city originating in the food sector as opposed to the energy sector it has primacy as the source sector the flow of n in inputs of food across the system boundary and into the food sector can be estimated from data on food consumption categories and amounts as reported in statistical yearbooks and on the n content in various types of food the food categories in the msa model cover cereals vegetables fruit meat including bovine poultry and pig fish seafood dairy and others in addition to human consumption and then human toilet waste some of the food related n will be embodied in kitchen waste in suzhou in 2015 50 of this kitchen waste was treated by composting with the remainder passed either to incineration 25 or landfill 25 all three processes are parts of the waste management sector of msa below estimation of the flow of n passing through animal husbandry is based on figures for the consumption of animal fodder and the livestock inventory in suzhou composting of animal manure is the major method of treatment given its advantages in respect of removing harmful substances in such organic matter and decreasing losses of nutrients through runoff and infiltration 3 2 2 water sector the water sector is a focal component of the present study it is in this sector that we shall examine the scope for recovering and re circulating reactive n not least to improve the urban n metabolism through the introduction of several technological innovations the water sector is a part of the non energy driven pathway by which anthropogenically generated reactive n is introduced into the biosphere in the suzhou msa the water sector module comprises mainly urban water intakes water treatment and supply for various purposes and sewerage and wastewater treatment along with some atmospheric and hydrological processes precipitation is the driving force of the water sector it may infiltrate into the land surface form surface runoff or evaporate after falling on the ground different kinds of terrain and land permeability determine the infiltration intensity water abstraction from surface and underground sources is destined for the use of residents commerce the public industry agriculture stockbreeding and power generation the amount of water for the first four uses can be acquired from the suzhou water resource bulletin the amount of water for stockbreeding is calculated based on the inventory of poultry and livestock while that required for irrigation is a function of the irrigated land area and an irrigation coefficient which is set at 0 6 for suzhou return flows of water to the atmosphere include transpiration and evaporation of surface water soil water industrial water and water on impervious surfaces all of which is considered to be evaporated in the case of suzhou areas designated as permeable land surface include open water grassland farmland and forest with adjustments for differing degrees of soil moisture infiltration and surface runoff we note are especially relevant to the movement of n materials given the importance of fertilizer use because wet sanitation systems the wc have become utterly predominant over the past 150 years in developed urban regions they are the principal point of entry of food residuals into the water sector the rate of n removal from flows of waste water during wastewater treatment is set at 85 90 based on monitoring data from wastewater treatment plants the resulting separated flow of sludge is transferred to the waste management sector where it receives further treatment 50 of the sludge is subjected to composting hence some of the n in this material stream is recovered the other 50 is incinerated i e with n returned unproductively to the atmosphere 3 2 3 waste management sector the waste management sector is a core feature of msa in the sense that it interacts with all the other four sectors and many material flows pass through it it encompasses the final disposal and recovery of the many waste flows produced in the other four sectors liang and zhang 2012 typical unit processes include sludge digestion incineration composting and landfill sludge from wastewater treatment plants wwtps in the water sector manure from animal husbandry in the food sector and coal cinder from the energy sector are major flows into the waste management sector in suzhou the input streams for processing by composting are mainly those of animal manure and kitchen waste processing itself is subject to a non recovered loss rate of n of 40 due to infiltration to groundwater and volatilization to the atmosphere eghball et al 2005 landfill in msa accounts for the decomposition of organic substances and the infiltration of nutrients whereby flows of n may enter the atmosphere and hydrosphere the amount of n entering the landfill can be estimated from data on the composition of municipal solid waste whereas the amount of n infiltrating to groundwater is calculated according to the procedure reported in raveh and avnimelech 1979 and scott et al 2005 the n content of biogas from landfill is estimated on the basis of the landgem model liu and ren 2012 with a biogas recovery rate of 60 3 2 4 energy sector as already noted in the introduction section 1 imports of fossil fuel to the energy sector and the consequent production of energy constitute the primary pathway for reactive n to be introduced into the urban metabolism in the case of suzhou fossil fuel flows are from external supplies energy is used by residents commerce industry and transportation in 2015 nearly 90 of industrial energy consumption was from coal combustion the remainder from combustion of natural gas fuel oil diesel oil municipal waste and waste biomass at 40 natural gas constitutes a large proportion of domestic fossil fuel consumption however some resources of energy are recovered within the city including from solid waste which is incinerated for power generation and the recovery of landfill biogas amounts of n passing through and circulating around the energy sector can be calculated from the amounts categories and n contents of the various energy sources when estimating the gaseous n emissions from fuel combustion the model assumes that gaseous and liquid fuels are 100 oxidized the fate of n during coal combustion requires more detailed consideration especially given the dominant position at 80 of coal consumption in the energy structure of suzhou in particular bottom ash and coal combustion products ccp are important outputs of the coal combustion process about 33 of the n in the un combusted coal ends up in these products research shows that the no x emission in coal combustion is closely related to the n content in coal the ratio between n mass loss and the overall coal mass loss is around 1 25 1 5 baxter et al 1996 3 2 5 forestry sector forestry encompasses three main features in the case of suzhou forest growth processing of wood and the consumption of products e g wood and paper the flow of n through the sector can be quantified according to the n content of wood its introduction into the constructed durable fabric of the city is an obvious element of the slower decadal dynamics of urban metabolism which are not analyzed herein wastes generated during the manufacture of wood products are transferred to the waste management sector where they are subject to recovery or treatment fertilizers both organic and inorganic are important input sources of n in the forestry sector in the case of organic fertilizers for which there are no data the plant available nitrogen pan content can be calculated based on the amount of manure applied supporting data on the amounts of animal manure being generated the inventory of poultry and livestock and the nutrient content of the various manures sullivan et al 2004 turan 2009 denitrification and nitrogen volatilization are the major pathways for n returns to the atmosphere 70 of such denitrification and conversely nitrogen fixation is assumed to take place in the upper soil layer 5 10 cm n is released into the atmosphere in the forms of nh3 and no x through volatilization this release occurs primarily during fertilizer utilization but also as a result of the storage and treatment of manure some 3 30 of the n in inorganic fertilizer and some 5 50 of n in organic fertilizer is assumed to be available for volatilization during fertilizer use 3 3 data and accounting for uncertainty assembly of the data for setting up the suzhou msa draws upon the following the peer viewed literature reference to the research findings of government departments the circulation and subsequent analysis of a questionnaire survey issued to firms and the conduct of interviews with government officials including those of the suzhou environmental protection agency suzhou housing and urban rural development bureau and suzhou environmental sanitation administration agency data not available from statistical yearbooks or official reports for instance on the quantity of water evaporation and the amounts of various types of food intake are drawn mainly from either current research or are estimated from larger scale data such as data for jiangsu province or for china process operating data such as the removal rates of nitrogen compounds in wastewater treatment plants are those of sample observations from monitoring data some of the more important sources of data are listed in table 1 data uncertainty must be formally accounted for for the following reasons since data and statistics for many aspects of resource transformations at the city scale are lacking or deficient parameterization of such features may need to be inferred from corresponding data and statistics at the country scale hence a typical source of uncertainty to quantify such uncertainties and data qualities in the msa model we follow the method of hedbrant and sörme 2001 see also villarroel walker 2010 where data are specified as values across a bounded interval that interval is set as the range for random sampling of a parameter value more specifically we follow the protocol shown in table 2 in which it is apparent that the uncertainty attaching to a parameter increases the more distant the data source from local suzhou circumstances thus for example given a parameter with an interval factor uj of 1 33 and whose most likely value α has been derived from official statistics at the national and regional level the sampling space for this parameter is set to be α 1 33 1 33 α technically a latin hypercube sampling is employed to generate candidate values for the model s parameters the number of samples needed for effectively covering the parameter space should be larger than 0 75 p where p is the number of model parameters barlund and tattari 2001 given that our msa models contains 635 parameters we judge our choice of 1000 samples is large enough table s1 in the supporting information provides further details of the parameter settings and sampling in msa 4 purpose and scope of analyses and the assessment criteria as we noted in the introduction to this paper the challenges presented by our analytical framework are irreducibly complex so that now after the foregoing summary of msa in more detail there is an essential need to define the scope and purpose of our studies in greater detail we also introduce and define here the three criteria the metabolic performance metrics mpms to be used to discriminate between the more and the less promising technological interventions for improving suzhou s n metabolism 4 1 triangulating and defining the purpose and scope of our analysis to begin msa is multi sectoral nexus plus we might say it covers interactions among the resource flows entering circulating within and exiting the water food energy waste handling and forestry sectors in the given geographical system the city of suzhou here we examine four candidate technology interventions in the water and waste handling sectors individually or combined according to 16 scenarios given the locked in nature of suzhou s energy sector for the coming few decades no interventions in the technology infrastructure of that sector are considered second msa is multi resource i e it tracks the flows of carbon nitrogen phosphorus water and energy circulating around and through all five of the foregoing sectors third it is also multi media it covers the movements of pre consumption resource flows from and the returns of post consumption flows to the terrestrial aquatic and atmospheric environments fourth screening of our results will be carried out using three mpm criteria significantly for this paper therefore msa enables analyses of the impacts on all sectors resource types and all environmental media of policy technology interventions in one sector which interventions may be aimed at altering primarily just one resource flow more specifically msa facilitates assessments of the cross sectoral advantages and disadvantages of the given intervention irrespective of the sector into which it is introduced similarly it alerts the analyst to the positives and negatives of addressing a problem of pollution in one medium say the aquatic environment with a candidate technology that while addressing this one medium generates residual flows as gaseous emissions and solid wastes discharged to the atmospheric and terrestrial environments wen et al 2018a in other words msa enables cross media assessments of candidate interventions both such domains of assessment cross sectoral and cross media are important yet one immediate implication of this is that very rarely are the requisite multi sectoral and or multi media institutional arrangements available through which to ensure both the implementation and the supervision of the desired technological changes to be specific therefore our enquiry is focused on the flow of n into and out of the city of suzhou primarily in association with the influx of n bearing goods associated with the food sector as opposed notably to the energy sector the downstream pollution resulting from the city s subsequent n metabolism primarily in respect of the food water and waste handling sectors is aquatic and manifest as eutrophication technological interventions in the water and waste handling sectors intended to improve suzhou s metabolic performance and curb eutrophication will surely alter the flows of carbon nitrogen phosphorus water and energy through the city our assessment nonetheless is driven primarily by msa s account and tracking of the urban n metabolism alone the focus of our analysis is also restricted to the notion of metabolism understood as changing in the relatively short term with a characteristic time constant of months to a year on this short scale some aspects of the accumulation year on year of resources within the built manufactured fabric and infrastructure of the city such as the resources embodied in construction materials durable goods office and household furniture and so on including their n content in the present study will be apparent in msa s computational results the metabolism of this built content of the city however is something whose dynamic variations are significant over the longer term of decades notably of course our candidate technological interventions just like the current fossil fuel based energy infrastructure of suzhou will influence the longer term decadal dynamics of the city s metabolism albeit to a relatively minor extent the crucial significance of these longer lived technological interventions herein is of course their intended influence over the short term metabolism of suzhou as imagined for example for a single year in the future such as 2035 or 2050 4 2 the metabolic performance metrics mpms flows of materials and resources in msa are straightforwardly estimated as follows eq 1 1 f i m i c i here f i is the amount of nitrogen in material flow i m i is the total mass of the flow i which is typically determined by direct investigation and material conservation and c i is the n content of material flow i usually expressed as a concentration or mass fraction since eq 1 is the fundamental basis of our three mpms it is to be noted that our results in this paper do not refer to improvements in the four other resource flows of carbon phosphorus water and energy to analyze the general structure and metabolic performance of the urban n metabolism msa categorizes material flows passing through the system boundary into five types input flows or resources r output flows or products p gaseous emissions to the atmosphere e aqueous emissions to the hydrosphere a and solid waste flows w input flows r originating outside the urban ecosystem boundary include flows entering the city as both raw materials and as finished products output flows p are those flows exiting the system across its boundary and destined for beneficial use in other systems such flows of r and p include fertilizers food feed wood products

categorized as useful products and summation is exercised over all these so defined exiting flows i p therefore represents the total of all the products from suzhou across all five economic sectors

summation is exercised over all the flows i deemed respectively to be gaseous emissions aqueous emissions or landfill directed solid wastes exiting the system several metabolic performance metrics mpms can be specified in order to assess broadly the efficiency of suzhou s n metabolism and to evaluate the potential impacts on this metabolic efficiency of several technological options for enhancing n recovery and recirculation within the city inspired by the concept of eco efficiency i e broadly speaking the notion of producing more with fewer resources and emissions côté et al 2006 we specify three mpms first we define a resource productivity indicator pri as the following ratio of output and input n mass flows i e eq 6 6 p r i p r the higher the value of pri the greater is the conversion of incoming resource flows into useful outgoing product flows hence a higher urban metabolic efficiency hence a more circular less linear urban economy it should be noted that the industrial structure of the city can also have a vital influence on the pri indicator for example cities with a substantial component of agricultural production tend to have a smaller pri value than cities with high proportions of secondary and tertiary industries since a relatively significantly greater unproductive loss of n is associated with agricultural production this notwithstanding pri can still effectively assess the n metabolic efficiency and whether it can be improved by the various candidate technological policy interventions within one and the same city second in order to gage the environmental load imposed on the atmosphere hydrosphere and lithosphere of the city s surrounding hinterland we introduce two further metrics the products wastes indicator pwi and the emissions eco efficiency indicator eei they are computed as follows 7 p w i p w 8 e e i p e a pwi quantifies the balance between the beneficial productivity of the city s metabolism p and its detrimental quite unproductive disposal of solid wastes mainly to landfill w eei measures the same kind of balance in respect of the polluting unproductive burdens imposed across the atmosphere e and hydrosphere a relative to the more desirable beneficial productivity of the city s metabolism to summarize higher values for all three of the mpms pri pwi and eei can be considered preferable and desirable for the metabolism of suzhou 5 overview principal sector by sector flowpaths the results of the msa are provided in the form of probability distributions for the various flows of n in the system these computational results are based on 1000 candidate parameterizations of the model generated from the latin hypercube sampling procedure although the results are for the metabolism of suzhou in 2015 the city s industrial structure fuel and food demands and waste management infrastructure have not changed significantly since that year such that we may take the results as indicative of the current situation besides our principal focus in this analysis is on the extents to which technological innovations may change and improve upon the current metabolism one two or three decades or so into the future when they are assessed according to the mpms defined in the preceding section for clarity merely the 5th 50th and 95th percentiles of each distribution are reported and discussed accordingly the 50th percentile value of any given n flow can be taken as close to the most probable or average value of the flow while the 5th and 95th percentiles are indicative of the range of possible values about the central tendency fig 2 provides the summary all told the input n to the system in 2015 was estimated to be about 1570 gg with the 5th and 95th percentiles being 1270 gg and 1940 gg respectively 89 of the input n was in the forms of coal and natural gas while 5 was embodied in the incoming flows of food and animal feed 76 of the total input n was released into the atmosphere in the form of diatomic nitrogen n2 and nitrogen oxides no x as a result of fuel combustion and the process of denitrification in wastewater treatment since n2 releases are generally believed to cause little adverse environmental impact it is the release of no x from fuel combustion and incineration of municipal waste and sewage sludge that should be the focus of concern however denitrification of wastewater is not an insignificant contributor to global n2o emissions it is a small but not insignificant 3 4 or so thereof ipcc 2015 chen et al 2020 in addition n2o is a notably strong greenhouse gas otherwise the results show that 19 of the input n to suzhou leaves the city in the form of ccp solid coal combustion products some 12 gg n yr 1 pass with solid material into landfill sites about 20 gg n yr 1 are released into groundwater via soil infiltration and waste disposal sites including landfill and composting over the year about 74 gg n yr 1 accumulate in the city which is roughly 5 of the total n input with this accumulation being distributed mainly between the forestry and food sectors in more detail the magnitudes of the ten principal flows of n within each of the five economic sectors are given in fig 3 5 1 water sector in the water sector fig 3 a about 44 60 gg n yr 1 in industrial effluent together with 107 143 gg n yr 1 in residential commercial and municipal wastewater are sent to wastewater treatment plants in the city most of this n is then released to the atmosphere as a result of denitrification about 108 gg n yr 1 while some 53 gg n yr 1 are discharged from the urban ecosystem in aqueous effluents to surrounding water bodies sewage sludge carries with it some 19 gg n yr 1 ranging between 16 23 from wastewater treatment across and into the waste management sector in essence wastewater treatment is the key component in the n metabolism of the water sector accordingly its constituent unit processes should be the focus of our attention with respect to recovering n from suzhou s metabolism in the future indeed there are many mainstream technologies directed at doing just this with high n recovery potential egle et al 2016 5 2 food sector in the food sector fig 3 b and not surprisingly the production and consumption of food and animal feed are associated with large flows of n natural n deposition on agricultural lands we note is around 5 4 gg n yr 1 a much smaller amount than the n inputs in inorganic fertilizer of about 30 gg n yr 1 animal feed another principal n input bears with it about 28 gg n yr 1 ranging between 26 31 food imported from outside the city adds a further 32 gg n yr 1 to the food sector which contributes to the total 48 60 gg n yr 1 metabolized by residents in their food consumption post consumption 51 gg n yr 1 are transferred across from the food sector to the water sector in the forms of human urine and feces animal manure by comparison contains 10 19 gg n yr 1 of this about 8 gg n yr 1 are released as gaseous emissions to the atmosphere through volatilization during handling and storage processes while the remainder of the manure associated n is sent to the waste management sector it can be concluded that n storage in the food sector is mainly being accumulated in human biomass and more so animal biomass this latter amounting to around 14 gg n yr 1 such n storage will in due course exit the food sector as a function of the export of husbandry animals and the deaths of humans and animals 5 3 forestry sector forested lands within the system boundaries receive 1 2 4 2 gg n yr 1 via natural nutrient deposition from the atmosphere this being split as 0 3 2 6 gg n yr 1 of dry deposition and 0 9 1 6 gg n yr 1 of wet deposition both estimates are notably uncertain wood imported for paper products amounts to some 6 4 gg of incoming n flows on the whole however the forestry sector has a relatively small potential for n recovery fig 3 c 5 4 energy sector in the energy sector fig 3 d power generation and fuel combustion account for the largest flows of n all the energy generated in suzhou is derived from external fuel imports which bring with them 1250 gg n yr 1 ranging between 1040 1520 as coal and 140 gg n yr 1 ranging between 70 210 as natural gas with respect to power generation the total input of n is about 530 gg n yr 1 of this 76 emerges as gaseous emissions to the atmosphere and the remaining 24 is immobilized in coal cinder which is destined for the waste management sector apart from power generation local residents commerce industry and transportation also consume large amounts of fuel amounting to about 860 gg n yr 1 of this 80 ends up in gaseous emissions to the atmosphere in sum suzhou s energy sector participates in massive n flows but with virtually no accumulation occurring within the city itself 5 5 waste management sector the n metabolism of the waste management sector is significantly driven by transfers of n from the other four sectors for example sewage sludge from the water sector brings about 19 gg n yr 1 into the waste management sector half of this is converted into fertilizer compost and the other half is passed to incineration for power generation when mixed with both wood products and kitchen waste 12 gg n yr 1 accumulate in landfills within the city after accounting for some 0 3 gg n yr 1 of losses from these sites in gaseous emissions about 0 4 gg n yr 1 of biogas capture and about 3 7 gg n yr 1 in flows leaching to groundwater fig 3 e to summarize the energy and food sectors receive the largest inputs of n from outside the system the dominant pathways of n in the city s urban nitrogen metabolism are fuel utilization food consumption and wastewater treatment fuel demand household consumption patterns and the growth in livestock production are major factors that may drive future growth in the magnitude of suzhou s urban n metabolism at present however the metabolic residues of the food and water sectors such as those conveyed in the effluent from wastewater treatment in human urine sewage sludge and in livestock manure are crucial for examining the future potential for n recovery accordingly the technology scenarios for n recovery which are to be discussed in section 6 below will be focused on these four flows first however it is appropriate to assess the possible impacts of uncertainty on directing technological choices towards these four flows 5 6 considerations of uncertainty looking more closely at the distributions of the results of fig 3 the greatest relative uncertainties are apparent for the estimates of n flows in the forestry sector fig 3 c for instance the estimate of incoming n through the dry component of atmospheric deposition is especially uncertain according to our computations it is even possible that a larger mass of n might be entering suzhou in flows related to paper production than through dry atmospheric deposition although this is unlikely the emission of n to the atmosphere from the forestry sector presented as a negative value in the plot is also notably uncertain that said however flows of n associated with the forestry sector are relatively small and none of them is to be the focus of policies for improving the metabolic performance of suzhou in the food sector fig 1 b estimates of the flows of urine and feces associated n are relatively uncertain but while both of these are potential sources of beneficial n recovery and reuse our study assesses the performance of related technological interventions implemented in the water and waste management sectors wherein estimates of the respective n flows are subject to relatively less uncertainty i e the prospects for success of the technological interventions are relatively more clear cut hence more robust the relatively high uncertainty of the n flows in urine and feces is a consequence of the lack of suzhou specific statistical data for the production of human urine and feces comparable flow estimates for the amounts of n in the other waste nutrient flows such as industrial wastewater are relatively more suzhou specific as a result the companion aggregate flows of total wwtp influent effluent and sludge are relatively less uncertain otherwise beyond the forestry and food sectors the large emissions of n from the water and energy sectors are salient 6 technological innovations assessment according to the metabolic performance metrics current applications of the technologies and policies for n pollutant control and resource recovery have two main limitations first pollution control is often considered to be much more important than resource recovery whose role in promoting the circular economy tends therefore to be overlooked beck et al 2018 second most technologies focus on just a specific form of nitrogenous pollutant or a specific pollutant generation process without consideration of the overall picture or the possibilities for coordination across the various environmental media and the various urban economic infrastructure sectors for example the release of nitrogenous pollutants from the energy sector can be controlled and reduced using technologies such as flue gas denitrification this has knock on consequences however while the nitrogenous pollutants transferred into the water sector can be treated through the activated sludge process to meet applicable standards for n pollutants in aqueous emissions this is achieved at the expense of generating significant amounts of n bearing sewage sludge and this sludge in turn then needs its own proper treatment in order to prevent further secondary pollution in other words there is simply a cross media shifting of the pollution our msa approach was developed precisely for the purpose of examining the cross sectoral cross media ramifications of technology innovations for multiple resource recovery forms water energy nitrogen phosphorus carbon here however although the flows of n through suzhou are greatest in the energy sector the prospects for change in the near future in the structure of china s energy sector are very limited coal is and will continue to be the most important energy source in addition since 95 of the solid coal combustion residues are recycled for the production of building materials and cement the scope for n recovery in the energy sector will remain small we therefore confine our technology scenarios for n recovery from the urban metabolism of suzhou to the alternative scope for such recovery in the water and waste management sectors in particular let us focus on four flows that have been recognized as having substantial potentials for n recovery 6 1 four candidate technological interventions four technologies are considered each is a hot spot of current research in china li et al 2022 zhou et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 li et al 2020 they are urine separation technology ust pyrolysis of separated sludge pss livestock manure pyrolysis lmp and algae production in wastewater treatment facilities aww 6 1 1 urine separating technology ust ust as a technological intervention in the water sector addresses directly the unsustainability of end of pipe wastewater treatment which dilutes out in effect the otherwise richest source of n in the water sector through ust urine is collected and transported separately from its point of generation with the goal then of achieving the production of struvite nh4mgpo4 6h2o and ammonium sulfate nh4 2so4 thus ust recycles nitrogen from urine and turns part of this once regarded waste flow into beneficial product flows shu et al 2006 this technology has great potential in generating considerable economic benefit through recovered nutrient stream leading to its extensive promotion by businesses and institutions villarroel walker and beck 2014 villarroel walker et al 2017 6 1 2 pyrolysis of separated sludge pss and land manure pyrolysis lmp within the past decades pyrolysis has become one of the most significant technologies for recovering the renewable and economic value of waste biomass zhou et al 2018 pyrolysis in both urban as via pss and rural as via lmp settings given supplies respectively of separated sludges from urban wastewater treatment and poultry manure can realize the recovery of both material and energy resources pss in msa is treated as a technological intervention in the water sector while that of lmp is treated within the waste management sector for both technologies organic substances can be decomposed into liquid gaseous and solid products with most of the original n components being incorporated into solid end products for fertilizer manufacture pss and lmp are therefore clearly capable of decreasing the amount of nitrogen in waste streams of respectively sludge and animal manure of increasing resource recovery and also of indirectly reducing nitrogen pollution of the hydrosphere as a result of leaching and infiltration wan et al 2011 6 1 3 algae production from wastewater treatment aww aww deals with the treated wastewater as its raw input feedstock and recycles nitrogen by first incorporating it into algal biomass which may then be processed further to yield fuels and fertilizers sturm and lamer 2011 it is a promising environment enhancing pathway for sustainable wastewater management and biomass amplification li et al 2020 thus a candidate innovation available to the water sector in msa 6 2 the scenarios it is important to highlight the fact that there are interactions between technologies when implemented in combination hence the importance of a multi sectoral decision making framework such as that informed and supported by msa these interactions may be positive synergy or negative antagonism in total 16 scenarios are assessed as set out in table 3 they include each option implemented on its own pairwise combinations combinations of three technologies at a time all four together and a business as usual bau scenario in which none of the new technologies are in place 15 of the scenarios therefore cover technological interventions with the scope for improving suzhou s n metabolism with bau serving as a comparative reference base case for simplicity we assume that when any option is implemented the associated technology achieves what we might describe as 100 market penetration i e it is applied wherever this is possible we use the three mpms introduced and defined above the resource productivity indicator pri the products wastes indicator pwi and the emissions eco efficiency indicator eei to shed light on the relative performances of the 16 scenarios however all results refer to relative changes to the urban n metabolism in respect of the flows of n associated with the four sectors of water food forestry and waste management the substantial flows of n through the energy sector which remain unchanged under all 16 scenarios are therefore excluded from judgements about the improvements these technological innovations may bring to suzhou s overall n metabolism 6 3 screening the promise of technologies fig 4 summarizes the performances of all 16 scenarios according to the three mpms pri pwi and eei and fig 5 shows the percentages of improvement or otherwise in the performance of each of the 15 varieties of technological interventions relative to the bau scenario as in presenting the n flow estimates above in section 5 the uncertainties of the resulting mpm estimates for each scenario are reflected in the respective dots and bars in the columns of each plot of fig 4 with the median estimates annotated above each column 6 3 1 uncertainty and discriminating power of mpms broadly speaking subject to the uncertainties of the results in fig 4 no scenario promises strongly significant improvement in the product waste performance metric with any great confidence pwi fig 4 b as a matter of statistical detail application of the standard kolmogorov smirnoff test of the maximum difference between any pair of distributions results in most of the outcomes of no significant difference obtaining among the performances of the scenarios in respect of the pwi such outcomes are indicated in fig 4 as dotted lines connecting the relevant scenarios there are seven such occurrences of no significant difference in fig 4 b for the pwi and one in each of fig 4 a and 4 c for the other two indices see also below in addition the median estimates dots within the spans bars of the 5th and 95th percentiles of the pwi are biased towards the lower bounds of the distributions i e the chances are that the pwi for each scenario will be on the low side rather than desirably on the high side such skewing of the pwi distributions in fig 4 b as well as their limited improvements over the business as usual bau scenario are absent from the results for the other two indices the resource productivity index pri fig 4 a and the emissions eco efficiency index eei fig 4 c in sum we may conclude that the pri and eei are generally the more sensitive more discriminating indicators in the present analysis of suzhou the overall patterns of the results of fig 4 a for the pri and fig 4 c for the eei are also broadly similar 6 3 2 the more promising scenarios based on just the pri and eei we observe that if one technology alone were to be implemented it should probably be the urine separation technology ust the pri and eei distributions for the other three technologies when implemented singly are not greatly different from those of the present day reference bau if a combination of two technologies is to be introduced the pri and eei performance metrics suggest that the two pairings of the livestock manure pyrolysis lmp with either the pyrolysis of sewage sludge pss or the algal production from wastewater aww i e scenarios lp and la in fig 4 a and 4 c are not to be favored the gains they offer in respect of the metabolic performance of suzhou are more marginal than the other pairwise combinations of technologies however when the ust is added to both these pairwise scenarios i e a trio of technologies is implemented the performance of the trio relative to both these pairwise combinations of lp and la is markedly improved relative to the comparable alternatives again fig 4 a and 4 c refer nevertheless when all three constituent technologies of the lp and la pairs are implemented together as scenario lpa comprising the lmp pss and aww technologies the relatively inferior performance of this particular trio is marked urine separating technology is absent from these trios such that the importance of the ust is thereby again confirmed albeit indirectly last it is unsurprising that implementing all four technologies at once is likely on balance to give the best metabolic performance for n across all three indicators pri eei and pwi inspection of fig 5 reveals different insights although it is important to keep in mind that the percentages of improvement for each scenario relative to the bau are based on merely the 50th percentile statistics of the computed distributions thus scanning across each triplet of results for the 15 scenarios salient is the consistent and superior improvement in the products waste indicator pwi whenever the pyrolysis of sewage sludge pss or p in short in fig 5 is implemented alone or in combination indeed whenever pss appears in conjunction with urine separation technology ust all three metabolic performance indicators improve comparably well whereas scenarios lacking this conjunction yield more mixed less clear results for the percentage improvements in performance also notable is the way in which the implementation of all four technologies together improves performance by at least 100 a doubling on average according to all three indicators in short we might tentatively conclude that two of the four technologies urine separation technology ust and pyrolysis of sewage sludge pss emerge as especially promising 6 3 3 technology by technology assessment underlying these conclusions from figs 4 and 5 are the following remarks on the way we expect the various technologies to function within our multi sectoral analysis each technology is considered first on its own merits before consideration is given to the synergies and antagonisms between and among the deployment of two or more technologies in concert thus the success of the urine separation technology ust rests on the way in which the n in human urine is accessed and recovered upstream of the city s wastewater treatment plants while this urine bears only about a quarter of the total flux of n into wastewater treatment fig 3 a and b its n content is concentrated in addition its recovery at source as opposed to its elimination during wastewater treatment through biological nitrification denitrification reduces the subsequent wasteful emission of n to the atmospheric and aquatic environments in which respects which we might call integrated multi media pollution control it performs better than any of the other technologies the respective values of the eei metabolic performance index refer we may note in passing that such n recovery through ust as opposed to its elimination in conventional wastewater treatment also saves energy villarroel walker et al 2017 however these distinctive advantages notwithstanding the introduction of ust into suzhou would present substantial challenges in the required re engineering of the city s infrastructure which challenges in general are well recognized and addressed elsewhere beck 2011 larsen et al 2013 the technology of pyrolysis of sewage sludge pss as already observed with reference to the product waste index pwi is notable for its unique success in respect of reducing solid waste outputs from suzhou indeed combining the implementation of pss technology with any of the three others including ust yields no significant improvement upon what the pss option alone is capable of achieving in terms of the pwi fig 4 b in which pss is denoted as p for short shows that the probability distribution of pwi for scenario p alone is not statistically significantly different from the distribution for scenario up which in turn is itself not significantly different from scenarios lp and pa the consequence of introducing pss into the suzhou system is that less n would be unproductively disposed of to landfill sites of the other two technologies livestock manure pyrolysis lmp can only have but a minor role to play within the metabolism of suzhou since it is predominantly an industrial city aww algae production in wastewater treatment also has a relatively minor role in respect of altering the urban n metabolism not least because its primary purpose is the generation of c based fuels 6 3 4 interactions among technologies synergies and antagonisms not surprisingly aspects of these attributes of the individual technological options considered one by one are manifest when they are paired in the various combinations for instance the combination of the lmp and aww technologies yields the most inferior performance across all three indices this is scenario la in fig 5 when either technology is combined with the promising ust option in the ul and ua scenarios both the resulting pairwise scenarios of ul and ua in fig 5 show significant improvements for all three indicators potential synergies and antagonisms are also apparent when two or more of the technologies are implemented together the ust which on its own scores well in respect of the productivity index pri and eco efficiency index eei when combined with the pss technology with its attaching success in improving the solid waste burden index pwi leads to the best performing pairwise combination up in fig 5 as gauged across all three metabolic performance indices this superior potential of the two technologies ust and pss carries through into the various trios of options wherever they both appear together in the trios of ulp and upa in fig 5 improvements in suzhou s metabolic performance look most promising thus making the two technologies priorities for further more detailed consideration but in part this emerging preference for ust and pss is coupled with an inherent potential antagonism the n that the ust may access and recover upstream close to the sources of urine generation inevitably becomes unavailable for exploitation downstream in the aww option 7 sustainability and the circular economy how then does the foregoing assessment of the environmental and metabolic performance of the suite of four candidate technological interventions in suzhou fare according to the other components of the triple bottom line of sustainability i e the economic and social policy dimensions beck 2011 we now offer some closing discussion on these matters as well as on the implications of the present case study in respect of realizing a more circular economy for suzhou in turning to address the costs and financial benefits of implementing the various technological scenarios the complexities and cross sectoral nexus cross media ramifications of re engineering the urban metabolism are again apparent the means to gage and assess these multi sectoral features are discussed in more detail elsewhere in table s2 of the supplementary materials as well as in our previous case studies of london and atlanta villarroel walker 2010 villarroel walker et al 2014 in addition lest this be overlooked recall that our environmental metabolic assessment of suzhou has been confined solely to the flows of nitrogen not that of the accompanying deeply interwoven flows of phosphorus carbon energy or water in addition let us emphasize the following about all of the above our assessment of suzhou s metabolism has been cast in terms of what we have called the sub structure of the city s infrastructure as noted at the very beginning of this paper section 1 in moving now towards the paper s closure it is time for some of the results from msa to be brought back and up to the more familiar conventional super structure of urban infrastructure as follows 7 1 economic financial perspective given the natures of the four technologies monetary values may be assigned to four aspects of their performance the costs saved in association with reductions in urban water consumption the costs saved or not through reduced energy consumption the potential profit from biofuel recovery and the profits to be derived from fertilizer production intuitively these flows of resources and money are attached to the water energy and food sectors of the city s economy and infrastructure to the more readily recognized nexus in other words on these accounts in terms of conventional resource product flows as opposed to elemental n flows we can also point again to potential synergies and more importantly as it happens potential antagonisms in particular introduction of the urine separation technology ust while beneficial in terms of fertilizer production savings in water consumption and savings in energy consumption in wastewater treatment plants would reduce the yield of beneficial biogas from digestion of the separated sludges of wastewater treatment likewise the potential benefits of implementing the technologies of algal biomass production from wastewater aww and livestock manure pyrolysis must be gained at the expense and metabolic disadvantages of elevated rates of energy consumption fig 6 presents the results of our economic analysis estimates are based on current market prices for water industrial energy consumption natural gas gasoline and industrial n based fertilizer for each scenario the constituent benefits costs of the four value streams water saved energy saved biofuel recovery fertilizer production are shown in fig 6 a and the total revenue benefit of each scenario is given in fig 6 b further details of our procedure are provided in table s3 of the supplementary material scanning across fig 6 a it becomes apparent that only the urine separation technology ust affords a benefit in terms of water savings potentially profitable income streams from fertilizer production are also dominated by ust but are not exclusive to it on the downside ust incurs a marginal reduction in biofuel recovery relative to the present bau scenario which reduction is more emphasized when ust is combined with implementation of the pyrolysis of sewage sludge pss technology scenario up in fig 6 a in contrast promising returns from biofuel recovery are obtained whenever the livestock manure pyrolysis lmp and algal biomass from wastewater aww technologies are introduced although these the most significant financial benefits of all are coupled with the costs of a negative energy saving when alternatively the revenue and expenditure streams are aggregated across all four categories of savings and products fig 6 b reveals that the pairwise combinations of the ul and la scenarios along with the trio of the ula scenario offer the prospect of the greatest financial and economic benefits we observe then that examination of the various possible technological interventions from the perspective of their economic performance suggests priorities different from those identified above according to the assessment of their environmental performance i e their impacts on the nitrogen metabolism of suzhou for instance whereas the livestock manure pyrolysis lmp gave quite inferior n metabolic performance relative to notably the ust option when either was introduced on its own it fares significantly better on the economic front scenario l for lmp alone is even marginally superior in this respect to the u scenario for ust alone in fig 6 b a consequence of its capacity for valuable biofuel recovery our outlook on the option of pyrolysis of sewage sludge pss might also be substantially modified when economic considerations are taken into account we have talked of its promising potential for n recovery above at least in respect primarily of the somewhat equivocal product solid waste index pwi but when implemented alone or in concert with the aww technology as scenario la its economic performance is quite obviously not convincing again see fig 6 b indeed going further when pss is implemented in the all scenario its attaching need for additional energy consumption renders the economic performance of the all scenario inferior to that of the ula trio from which the pss technology is notably absent fig 6 b on the two accounts of environmental metabolic performance and economic performance it is tempting to conclude that the trio of the urine separation technology ust the livestock manure pyrolysis lmp and the algal biomass from wastewater aww looks the most promising of all its economic performance is superior and amounts to 1 4b yuan per annum fig 6 b its environmental metabolic performance is ranked within the top four of the 15 scenarios fig 5 the total amount of nitrogen it might recover and recycle is of the order of 31 gg n yr 1 of this the fertilizer thereby generated may be returned to cultivation processes in urban agriculture while the recovered biofuel and electricity can be put to good use in the urban transport system and other industrial enterprises however this is what can be achieved by way of annual operating revenue after the necessary investments in installing related facilities to that extent this scenario would contribute towards suzhou s economy becoming less linear and more circular hence appropriately in line with china s 2008 circular economy promotion law and this would be especially pertinent at the city scale which is of increasing importance as china s urban population heads towards the forecast 60 of the country s total population world bank 2018 indeed suzhou has already taken steps to reduce the linearity and increase the circularity of its economy as evident in our companion research on a sensor based internet of things iot network for resource recovery and recycling in the sector of restaurant food waste rfw management wen et al 2018b 7 1 1 in the wider global picture markets for nutrient recovery notwithstanding the extent and complexity of the results generated with msa it is important to recall now that our analysis has been confined first to a single case study city second to n bearing flows of resources and third to just four candidate technological interventions to give therefore a wider context to our economic analysis of n recovery in suzhou let us touch upon an earlier nexus impact analysis of technological innovations for nutrient carbon phosphorus and nitrogen recovery into a wider global framework villarroel walker and beck 2014 we offer these two insights first the global market for nutrient recovery at that time 2014 was estimated to range up to as much as 145b us per annum second while each of the four candidate technologies considered in our case study of suzhou were covered in one form or another under the some 18 nutrient recovery innovations considered they were either under commercial development or already installed the technology of anaerobic digestion looked exceptionally promising in respect of both its actual potential market share and the index of beneficial nexus impact employed for the purpose of ranking and comparing the alternatives villarroel walker and beck 2014 7 2 looking beyond n metabolism alone msa as should be readily apparent is intended to enable and illuminate cross sectoral cross media and cross resource interactions among flows of carbon nitrogen phosphorus energy and water resources it is intended as an antidote to what can often appear as an exclusive contemporary focus albeit understandably so on solely the energy sector and flows of carbon reducing carbon emissions is one of the core objectives in china s ecological civilization construction at present as too it is elsewhere so what interconnections and synergies might there be between the energy sector and carbon emissions and the above assessment of suzhou s n metabolism which we freely acknowledge is exclusive in its own way first our preceding economic financial assessment of ways to improve the urban n metabolism is dominated by energy sector and carbon flow implications these include both savings in electricity consumption hence carbon emission reductions and the benefit of a carbon resource flow of renewable biofuel second we may point to the following cross resource linkage changing the type and intensity of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers applied to farmland can significantly affect the characteristics of nutrients organic matter and microbial species in soil which in turn affect the intensities of methane carbon emissions from paddy field agriculture sun 2020 third and conversely deliberate interventions to adjust the carbon nitrogen ratio of sewage will affect the microbial community structure of unit treatment processes and its metabolic state in sedimentation tanks thereby influencing transformations of n through denitrification shu 2021 last but surely not least substantial amounts of energy are consumed hence equally substantial amounts of carbon are emitted to the atmosphere in the global industrial production of reactive n in fertilizer supply menegat et al 2022 estimate these emissions to have been of the order of 440 mt co2 in 2018 to give perspective this synthetic industrial n fertilizer supply chain was responsible for some 10 6 of global agricultural carbon emissions and 2 1 of global ghg emissions in that year 7 3 towards appropriate institutional arrangements the core thrust of this paper has been to treat the urban metabolism in a multiple resource flow multi sectoral multi media setting in theory introducing new technologies and policies for the food sector should not be addressed independently of those for the water sector nor should the emission of unproductive polluting materials to the aquatic environment be assessed independently of those emitted to the atmospheric environment and so on even in the present restricted analysis of just the nitrogen metabolism of suzhou a single resource flow as a function of technology interventions in the water and waste handling sectors just two of the five sectors cross sectoral and cross media interactions are significant and substantial in practice however it is very difficult to find evidence of any accompanying institutional arrangements capable of delivering the potential gains from and minimizing the potential disadvantages of our multi sectoral analysis our msa for example even within the confines of one sector water half a century of attempts to promote fully coordinated integrated operation of sewer network systems wastewater treatment systems and receiving water quality have struggled to achieve their successful implementation in practice beck 1976 2013 yuan et al 2019 this notwithstanding however china has undoubtedly responded determinedly to the severe environmental pressures it was experiencing and duly implemented a succession of action plans for the prevention and control of air pollution water pollution and soil pollution along with new ambient air quality standards through these measures it has gradually been transferring the target of its policies away from a focus solely on pollution control and towards the improvement of environmental quality nevertheless in china as in most other countries monitoring and management of the air water and soil environments are tasks discharged independently technological innovations continue to be evaluated with respect to just a particular pollutant discharge with the benefits being assessed with respect to a specific sensitive segment of the environment such as a surface water body and not across all media in addition considerations of the multiple resource flows associated with and manipulated by a given technology are always absent for example china s action plan for prevention and control of air pollution places emphasis on project construction and renovation of desulfurization denitrification and dust removal while overlooking entirely the manner in which the by products of these processes might be reused or otherwise disposed of it remains the case therefore that some measures to control pollution may succeed in decreasing the amounts of pollutants discharged into the single specifically targeted environmental medium and demonstrably fail elsewhere by causing more severe even irreversible damage in another medium in redressing this narrowness and singularity of perspective our analysis has been very much in accord with the spirit of the ambitions of china s framework design for a circular economy ndrc 2017 it is also in accordance with the target of achieving a smarter urban metabolism from the perspectives of resource utilization efficiency lowering environmental impacts and generating economic benefits see also villarroel walker and beck 2014 beck et al 2018 beck et al 2013 at the critical stage of low emission transition in china supportive policies and measures are highly recommended in promoting the innovative diffusion of waste to energy and waste to resource technologies wang et al 2022 8 conclusions of the two primary means by which n bearing materials are engaged in suzhou s urban metabolism the first from fuel combustion in the energy and transport sectors and the second in the food water waste chain the former dominates at around 1390 gg n yr 1 over the latter at around 80 gg n yr 1 however given that the structure of energy provision in suzhou is not set to change substantially in the near to medium term future we have investigated a total of 15 scenarios for future arrangements for the city s water and waste management infrastructures together with a sixteenth scenario of suzhou s infrastructure configuration the scenarios cater for all the various ways in which four technologies can be introduced into suzhou s water and waste management sectors singly or in the various multiple combinations in the presence of uncertainty as duly accounted for in our msa model computations we find that the trio of urine separating technology ust the cultivation of algal biomass in wastewater treatment as the precursor of fuels and the pyrolysis of animal manure is especially promising it achieves an expected net annual economic benefit of 1 4b yuan around 0 2b us and is ranked again with sufficient statistical confidence among the top four of the 16 scenarios in respect of environmental i e metabolic performance it might beneficially recover some 31 gg n yr 1 for the city

24235,the urban socioeconomic metabolism of multiple flows of resources is highly complex our concern is that of moderating the environmental burden and intensity of this metabolism and elevating its circularity through technological interventions in the composition of urban infrastructure the paper addresses present and possible future patterns of the nitrogen n metabolism of suzhou china using a multi sectoral systems analysis msa model of the water energy food forestry and waste management sectors of the city s infrastructure and economy two of the triple bottom lines are employed in the assessment those of the economic feasibility and the environmental benignity of the technological interventions environmental benignity is gauged by three metabolic performance metrics mpms 15 scenarios of these interventions are assessed each being a different combination of introducing four particular promising technologies the mpms allow ranking of the scenarios according to first the ratio of incoming resource flows into the city and outgoing socio economically beneficial products and second the rates at which wastes of no value are released to the atmosphere as air pollutants hydrosphere water pollutants and the lithosphere solid wastes the economic feasibility of the options can similarly be ranked according to the monetary values of resources such as clean water or energy that are saved by lowered urban consumption or that are recovered such as biofuels or fertilizer for beneficial re circulation and re use all four candidate technological innovations are associated with the water and waste management sectors of urban infrastructure we show that the trio of urine separating technology cultivation of algal biomass in wastewater treatment and pyrolysis of animal manure can achieve an expected net annual economic benefit of 1 4b yuan together with the potential to recover some 31 gg n yr 1 notably our computational assessment accounts for uncertainty using monte carlo simulation and sensitivity testing in particular we examine how uncertainty may significantly undermine the conclusions we may draw about the promise of any given technological innovation vis à vis another alternative graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords urban nitrogen metabolism water energy food nexus data uncertainty circular economy resource recovery technological innovation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction cities are where multiple flows of vital resources carbon nitrogen n phosphorus energy water and so on interact in the most intense and complex of ways villarroel walker et al 2017 fang and chen 2017 looked at from another perspective given the current prominence of discussions of nexus issues beck and villarroel walker 2013 leck et al 2015 villarroel walker et al 2014 cities are also the focal destination for supplies of food water and energy they are the locus of some of the strongest of interactions among the three attaching economic sectors and they are the most conspicuous source of what we have conventionally labelled as the waste flows of food water and energy or rather the flows of the residuals of urban metabolism which are duly released to the terrestrial aquatic and atmospheric environments beck et al 2018 put a different way we can say this pre consumption resources flow into the city and post consumption resources flow out of the city post consumption flows in a circular economy gregson et al 2015 quina et al 2018 beck et al 2019 will return courtesy of a number of recovery technologies and suitably sustained ecosystem services villarroel walker et al 2017 beck 2016 as pre consumption resources for the re production and re supply of food energy and water this all sounds very modern and contemporary but while the words and labels may have changed in fact the circular urban metabolism was present and prospering in paris in the 1700s and throughout the 1800s notably in respect of nitrogen barles 2007 barles and lestel 2007 the same obtained in linköping sweden in respect of phosphorus neset et al 2008 across the twentieth century as a result of profound changes in for instance urban water and sanitation infrastructure and urban and global transport infrastructures it became progressively more and more difficult to discern any such circularity in the urban metabolism and quite a challenge to conceive of working one s way back to something akin to it to re engineer the infrastructure of the city that is such that it may become a force for good cfg in the environment a net generator of ecosystem services beck 2011 one possibly attractive approach to the analysis of such issues is that of a system of systems modeling framework otto et al 2016 at the core of that particular approach to the analysis of future national infrastructure requirements in the uk is the matching of demand for a service energy water and so on to the capacity to supply that service the strongest of inter dependencies between one service sector and another are those associated with the demand for energy otto et al 2016 this approach however yields no insight into the nature of the resource flows among the various sectors of infrastructure hence no insights into the urban metabolism or the circularity of the attaching economy it is as if the model accounts for the easily recognizable and familiar superstructure of infrastructures water energy food waste transport whereas what we wish to reveal has to do with the much less familiar and more difficult to recognize sub structure of infrastructures i e the flows of water energy nitrogen phosphorus and carbon among and around the various sectors the purpose of the analyses reported herein indeed requires a different approach in short our present interest is in examining the cross sectoral and cross media implications of a sample of technology policy interventions in the water sector for the resource metabolism of a city suzhou china given that promoting technological progress of the renewable resource and energy industry could drive the transition to low emission urban development zhao et al 2021 zhao and wang 2020 a secondary purpose of our analyses is investigation of the ways in which and the extent to which uncertainty in data and a computational model undermine the capacity for clear conclusions to be drawn about promising and unpromising technological interventions to these ends over the past decade we have been developing and applying an approach to the study of urban metabolism based on substance flow analysis sfa we shall refer to it as a multi sectoral systems analysis msa an outline of this framework is given in section 3 of the paper along with then in section 4 a more precise triangulation of the rather broad goals of our analysis as just expressed the challenges of our analysis are complex irreducibly so in many ways for such complexity to be fully and properly appreciated the scope and make up of the msa framework must first be introduced and summarily set out as in section 3 the prototypical case study in applying msa referred to the metabolism of the city of atlanta within the upper chattahoochee watershed in the south eastern usa villarroel walker and beck 2012 in essence those first results provided general insights into the magnitudes and uncertainties of the principal flows of nitrogen phosphorus carbon water and energy through and around the atlanta chattahoochee system together with a sense of the relative significance of the interactions among the various economic sectors of water energy food forestry and waste management analysis of some of these interactions specifically between water and nutrients especially n is provided in a second paper villarroel walker et al 2012 along with comparable results for water energy interactions in a second case study of the city of london uk the comparative nature of our work for the respective metabolisms of atlanta and london is highlighted elsewhere beck et al 2013 the wider scope of msa i e its capacity to identify particular flows of resources that are key to the attainment of future metabolic performance targets in respect of nitrogen phosphorus carbon water and energy is also demonstrated in beck and villarroel walker 2013 more extensive and more detailed results for the london case study are given in villarroel walker et al 2014 2017 some of these include identification of the potential technological innovations associated with the key resource flows for improving urban metabolic performance together with those businesses currently engaged in developing the technological innovations in other words msa is cast in terms of the sub structure of resource flows in the city but readily permits working back up from this basis to deductions and conclusions about the super structure of customary infrastructure sectors and their attaching segments of the economy our case study of suzhou china builds upon these later developments in the application of msa compared with the previous studies of atlanta and london the present study pays special attention to the use of msa in revealing the cross sectoral and cross media interconnections of urban resource metabolism there is little merit in a candidate innovation that transforms say a current atmospheric pollutant burden into a future aquatic and solid waste burden in addition a study of suzhou provides insight into the metabolic characteristics of typical resource intensive cities in china for contrast and comparison therefore with cities such as london and atlanta such comparisons however are beyond the scope of the present paper likewise we should note this restriction of our present study msa is extensive in its coverage of the urban metabolism it is multi resource carbon nitrogen phosphorus water energy multi sectoral water energy food forestry waste handling and multi media terrestrial aquatic atmospheric in its scope the volume and detail of its computational results are substantial thus while there are policy and on the ground restrictions to our analysis notably the infrastructure of the energy sector in suzhou will be locked into fossil fuel technology for several decades to come there are also pragmatic technical reasons for confining the discussion of the present paper to the urban n metabolism alone the remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows our review of the literature on the global regional and urban scales of n metabolism is presented in section 2 followed by the introduction of msa model in section 3 three criteria for assessment of candidate technology policy interventions will be referred to as metabolic performance metrics mpms and be defined in section 4 to accompany there the more detailed definition and expression of the goals of our computational analyses section 5 presents the first segment of results from our studies with msa an overview of the ranking of the significance under uncertainty of the principal flows of n through the five economic sectors of suzhou in section 6 our second tranche of results addresses the impacts and implications again under uncertainty of fifteen scenarios for implementing four candidate technologies in the water and waste management sectors for improving suzhou s n metabolism according to our three mpms we examine some of the cross sectoral and cross media inter dependencies embedded in the msa results and close by examining the importance of uncertainty in our capacity to draw clear conclusions about those candidate technology policy interventions with the greatest potential to improve the urban n metabolism section 7 concludes with an economic assessment of the possible costs and benefits of the various technological interventions as a result of their cross sectoral effects 2 nitrogen metabolism of cities it is helpful to distinguish between atmospheric dinitrogen gas n2 and reactive nitrogen which comprises all the other compound forms of nitrogen in macroscopic terms and to simplify for present purposes reactive nitrogen enters naturally into the metabolism of the biosphere through its biological fixation from atmospheric n2 and from volcanic eruptions and lightning given man s industrial agricultural and economic activities it enters into the metabolism of the biosphere through industrial ammonia nh3 production the majority of which is converted into artificial fertilizers along with the concomitant biological fixation of n2 in agricultural and silvicultural activities it also enters the biosphere through fossil fuel combustion which we may view as the re release of immobilized but reactive n from a previous era of plant life the n metabolism of cities mirrors the two predominant anthropogenic flows of nitrogen from fuel combustion in the energy and transport sectors to the resulting gaseous pollutant waste forms of reactive n notably no x and from food production food sector and consumption to sewage water sector and compost waste management sector which will include wasted non consumed food in contrast to the latter food related flow the forms of reactive n produced from fuel combustion generate no other forms deemed useful to man s socioeconomic life erisman and larsen 2013 in terms of improving the circularity of the urban n metabolism it is important to retain the desirable forms of reactive n in productive circulation without their being returned unproductively to atmospheric n2 taking a historical perspective erisman et al 2008 wrote of how a century of ammonia synthesis changed the world they were marking the centenary of the invention of the haber bosch process just before the first world war which had massively accelerated and expanded the industrial production of nh3 from atmospheric n2 at the global scale galloway et al 2002 tell us further that in the late 20th century anthropogenic haber bosch n fixation from the atmosphere overtook natural terrestrial n fixation erisman and larsen 2013 for their part observe that the total rate of producing reactive n in the global food and energy sectors has increased by a factor of 1 5 to 2 over the past 50 100 years or so in short this pattern of disruption amplification and intensification of the global movement of n is now well known and widely discussed galloway et al 2014 2017 shibata et al 2017 remaining at the global scale of assessment erisman and larsen 2013 provide the following estimations on the principal flows of reactive n natural biological fixation of n from atmospheric n2 at the turn of the millennium was some 120 tg n yr 1 while biological fixation through the associated agricultural activities was put at 30 tg n yr 1 the two primary flows of anthropogenically generated reactive n i e fossil fuel combustion in the energy and transport sectors and n flows in the food water waste sectors corresponded to about 40 tg n yr 1 and 100 tg n yr 1 of n flux respectively in addition to place a desirable limit on the scale of such flows rockström et al 2009 in their analysis and prescription of safe planetary boundaries propose that anthropogenic production of reactive n should be no more than 35 tg n yr 1 looking to the future erisman and larsen 2013 suggest that by 2050 optimization of fossil fuel combustion systems could lead to a decrease of 8 tg n yr 1 in the production of reactive n along that path along the other path from the roughly 50 tg n yr 1 of reactive n forecast to be present in wastewater by 2050 the comparable estimate for 2000 was about 25 tg n yr 1 the improved elimination of such n by wastewater treatment could be as much as 5 tg n yr 1 the goal of nutrient n and phosphorus removal in wastewater treatment is to curb pollution of the aquatic environment in respect of eutrophication but the improved elimination of reactive n from sewage is not what we are seeking in this paper nor emphatically is it what larsen and her colleagues are seeking to achieve in their paradigm breaking book source separation and decentralization for wastewater management larsen et al 2013 for one thing it does not make a lot of sense to expend significant amounts of energy in taking n2 from the atmosphere to synthesize fertilizers at the beginning of the flow of reactive n into and along the food water waste pathway only then to expend not insignificant amounts of energy in the biological nitrification denitrification of sewage in order to return the reactive n to the atmosphere as n2 to summarize much research has been carried out on the cycling and metabolism of nitrogen at the global scale bodirsky et al 2014 fujimori and matsuoka 2007 galloway et al 2014 2004 and the national scale filoso et al 2006 gu et al 2015 ortiz zayas et al 2006 ti et al 2012 yet these studies at the macroscopic scale based on the analysis of large but general databases make it difficult to characterize the complex specific relationships among the multiple flows of n not surprisingly therefore previous studies at a regional scale baker et al 2001 faerge et al 2001 dong et al 2020 could be more helpful to our present purposes notably for the agricultural food sector s antikainen et al 2005 forkes 2007 zhang et al 2022 likewise refining assessments down to the urban scale has allowed exploration of what might be effective environmental n pollution control measures and resource recovery plans for cities such as advanced manure and waste processing coppens et al 2016 treatment of blackwater and greywater firmansyah et al 2017 and increased n use efficiency zhang et al 2023 in fact we may also note significant progress in parallel studies of phosphorus metabolism at the national tasmeea et al 2021 mnthambala et al 2021 regional chowdhury et al 2016 theobald et al 2016 and urban scales treadwell et al 2018 wu et al 2016 xiong et al 2020 we do so because this together with the greater focus of n metabolism studies at the global national and regional scales serves to emphasize the comparative lack of detailed descriptions of the urban n metabolism we judge this to be a consequence of indeed the sheer complexity of that urban n metabolism since nitrogen through so many complex biogeochemical reactions plays a pivotal role in almost every natural process and human activity in an urban ecosystem which is apparent from our previous work on the city of atlanta villarroel walker and beck 2012 in addition most studies focus on merely enumeration of the urban n metabolism on how large are the various flows accordingly questions of how and which policy technology interventions might change the current status are in general not addressed nor are those of the potential environmental economic and social benefits of adopting cross sectoral and nexus approaches to improving the circularity of the urban n metabolism under uncertainty our suzhou case study contributes therefore by addressing directly the foregoing knowledge gap furthermore it does so in the context of acknowledging the inevitable uncertainty that must surround any such assessments of possible technological interventions 3 case study city of suzhou china turning thus to our case study location we note the following regarding current flows of reactive n in china as a whole in 2020 total energy consumption in china amounted to 4980 tg of standard coal among which coal consumption accounted for 56 8 nbsprc 2021 given that chinese coal has an average n content of 0 52 ཞ1 41 wu et al 2011 in excess of some 27 7 tg of reactive n could have been released with gaseous emissions along this flowpath primarily through the energy sector this is roughly equal to the estimated 25 0 tg of industrially produced reactive n entering the second primary pathway through the biosphere as fertilizer nbsprc 2021 gu et al 2015 in addition nitrogen use efficiencies in croplands livestock and grassland in china were estimated to be merely around 39 16 and 5 respectively with therefore large amounts of reactive n not being put to good use gu et al 2017 in summary the economic industrial structure of suzhou is typical of many of the major cities of china indeed similarly typical of such cities is that the structure of suzhou s energy sector and current policy regarding the city s fuel combustion hence the anthropogenic generation of unproductive reactive n are not expected to change significantly coal will remain suzhou s most important source of energy in the light of this outlook our case study will address the scope for improving the n metabolism of suzhou through technological interventions in the water and waste management sectors in particular in the wastewater sub sector 3 1 reference year for analysis 2015 the city of suzhou is located in jiangsu province china data and parameterization for setting up the msa refer to conditions in 2015 given the good availability of data for that year in 2015 the city s population was about 10 6 m and its areal extent was 8657 km2 37 of which was covered by water suzhou is in fact famous for its aquatic environments which comprise more than 20 000 watercourses and 300 lakes this notwithstanding since the late 1980s lake tai has become one of the most eutrophic lakes in china forested land coverage is about 28 of the city s area together therefore the water and forestry sectors amount to 65 of the city s area hence they are important considerations in our study economically suzhou s gdp in 2015 was 1 450b yuan 230b us ranking it thus as 7th among china s cities the proportions of primary to secondary to tertiary industry were 1 5 48 6 49 9 which gives the city a heavy reliance on energy consumption the supply of which is essentially entirely imported for 2015 the city s total energy consumption amounted to 82 tg of standard coal with total consumption of electricity being 131b kwh 3 2 the msa model in greater detail our experience in using our msa approach has already been summarized in the foregoing suffice it to say the substance flow analysis sfa on which it is based has found wide application elsewhere with the work of bringezu and moriguchi 2002 and the review of allesch and brunner 2015 being indicative computationally the msa entails a two step procedure a monte carlo simulation to account for uncertainty in the analysis and a sensitivity test using the kolmogorov smirnoff statistic designed to detect the significance or otherwise of the differences between in effect model parameterizations technologies in effect that enable the city to exceed a specified level of urban metabolic performance and those that do not villarroel walker 2010 accounting for uncertainty is a key and a distinctive feature of msa hence we discuss data uncertainty in section 3 3 below and the impact of uncertainty on our interpretation of the computational results from msa in sections 5 and 6 following the general pattern of socioeconomic life in the city the msa model recognizes five economic sectors water food forestry energy and waste management as is shown in fig 1 flows of resources are exchanged among these sectors as well as between them and segments of the external environment namely the hydrosphere atmosphere and lithosphere the metabolism of each sector entails processing units that handle treat separate or transform material flows to gage the scope and detail covered by msa we offer this comparison the study of flows of n in coppens et al 2016 which stresses the high resolution thereof covers 21 process compartments and 160 individual nutrient flows in contrast our msa study covers 30 processing units and 350 constituent material flows which collectively entail 635 model parameters summary accounts of the structure of the material flow sub models of each of the five sectors of msa now follow 3 2 1 food sector plant production fertilizer use and the import consumption and export of food and animal fodder are the principal processing activities of the food sector given the restriction of our study primarily to analysis of that flow of n entering the city originating in the food sector as opposed to the energy sector it has primacy as the source sector the flow of n in inputs of food across the system boundary and into the food sector can be estimated from data on food consumption categories and amounts as reported in statistical yearbooks and on the n content in various types of food the food categories in the msa model cover cereals vegetables fruit meat including bovine poultry and pig fish seafood dairy and others in addition to human consumption and then human toilet waste some of the food related n will be embodied in kitchen waste in suzhou in 2015 50 of this kitchen waste was treated by composting with the remainder passed either to incineration 25 or landfill 25 all three processes are parts of the waste management sector of msa below estimation of the flow of n passing through animal husbandry is based on figures for the consumption of animal fodder and the livestock inventory in suzhou composting of animal manure is the major method of treatment given its advantages in respect of removing harmful substances in such organic matter and decreasing losses of nutrients through runoff and infiltration 3 2 2 water sector the water sector is a focal component of the present study it is in this sector that we shall examine the scope for recovering and re circulating reactive n not least to improve the urban n metabolism through the introduction of several technological innovations the water sector is a part of the non energy driven pathway by which anthropogenically generated reactive n is introduced into the biosphere in the suzhou msa the water sector module comprises mainly urban water intakes water treatment and supply for various purposes and sewerage and wastewater treatment along with some atmospheric and hydrological processes precipitation is the driving force of the water sector it may infiltrate into the land surface form surface runoff or evaporate after falling on the ground different kinds of terrain and land permeability determine the infiltration intensity water abstraction from surface and underground sources is destined for the use of residents commerce the public industry agriculture stockbreeding and power generation the amount of water for the first four uses can be acquired from the suzhou water resource bulletin the amount of water for stockbreeding is calculated based on the inventory of poultry and livestock while that required for irrigation is a function of the irrigated land area and an irrigation coefficient which is set at 0 6 for suzhou return flows of water to the atmosphere include transpiration and evaporation of surface water soil water industrial water and water on impervious surfaces all of which is considered to be evaporated in the case of suzhou areas designated as permeable land surface include open water grassland farmland and forest with adjustments for differing degrees of soil moisture infiltration and surface runoff we note are especially relevant to the movement of n materials given the importance of fertilizer use because wet sanitation systems the wc have become utterly predominant over the past 150 years in developed urban regions they are the principal point of entry of food residuals into the water sector the rate of n removal from flows of waste water during wastewater treatment is set at 85 90 based on monitoring data from wastewater treatment plants the resulting separated flow of sludge is transferred to the waste management sector where it receives further treatment 50 of the sludge is subjected to composting hence some of the n in this material stream is recovered the other 50 is incinerated i e with n returned unproductively to the atmosphere 3 2 3 waste management sector the waste management sector is a core feature of msa in the sense that it interacts with all the other four sectors and many material flows pass through it it encompasses the final disposal and recovery of the many waste flows produced in the other four sectors liang and zhang 2012 typical unit processes include sludge digestion incineration composting and landfill sludge from wastewater treatment plants wwtps in the water sector manure from animal husbandry in the food sector and coal cinder from the energy sector are major flows into the waste management sector in suzhou the input streams for processing by composting are mainly those of animal manure and kitchen waste processing itself is subject to a non recovered loss rate of n of 40 due to infiltration to groundwater and volatilization to the atmosphere eghball et al 2005 landfill in msa accounts for the decomposition of organic substances and the infiltration of nutrients whereby flows of n may enter the atmosphere and hydrosphere the amount of n entering the landfill can be estimated from data on the composition of municipal solid waste whereas the amount of n infiltrating to groundwater is calculated according to the procedure reported in raveh and avnimelech 1979 and scott et al 2005 the n content of biogas from landfill is estimated on the basis of the landgem model liu and ren 2012 with a biogas recovery rate of 60 3 2 4 energy sector as already noted in the introduction section 1 imports of fossil fuel to the energy sector and the consequent production of energy constitute the primary pathway for reactive n to be introduced into the urban metabolism in the case of suzhou fossil fuel flows are from external supplies energy is used by residents commerce industry and transportation in 2015 nearly 90 of industrial energy consumption was from coal combustion the remainder from combustion of natural gas fuel oil diesel oil municipal waste and waste biomass at 40 natural gas constitutes a large proportion of domestic fossil fuel consumption however some resources of energy are recovered within the city including from solid waste which is incinerated for power generation and the recovery of landfill biogas amounts of n passing through and circulating around the energy sector can be calculated from the amounts categories and n contents of the various energy sources when estimating the gaseous n emissions from fuel combustion the model assumes that gaseous and liquid fuels are 100 oxidized the fate of n during coal combustion requires more detailed consideration especially given the dominant position at 80 of coal consumption in the energy structure of suzhou in particular bottom ash and coal combustion products ccp are important outputs of the coal combustion process about 33 of the n in the un combusted coal ends up in these products research shows that the no x emission in coal combustion is closely related to the n content in coal the ratio between n mass loss and the overall coal mass loss is around 1 25 1 5 baxter et al 1996 3 2 5 forestry sector forestry encompasses three main features in the case of suzhou forest growth processing of wood and the consumption of products e g wood and paper the flow of n through the sector can be quantified according to the n content of wood its introduction into the constructed durable fabric of the city is an obvious element of the slower decadal dynamics of urban metabolism which are not analyzed herein wastes generated during the manufacture of wood products are transferred to the waste management sector where they are subject to recovery or treatment fertilizers both organic and inorganic are important input sources of n in the forestry sector in the case of organic fertilizers for which there are no data the plant available nitrogen pan content can be calculated based on the amount of manure applied supporting data on the amounts of animal manure being generated the inventory of poultry and livestock and the nutrient content of the various manures sullivan et al 2004 turan 2009 denitrification and nitrogen volatilization are the major pathways for n returns to the atmosphere 70 of such denitrification and conversely nitrogen fixation is assumed to take place in the upper soil layer 5 10 cm n is released into the atmosphere in the forms of nh3 and no x through volatilization this release occurs primarily during fertilizer utilization but also as a result of the storage and treatment of manure some 3 30 of the n in inorganic fertilizer and some 5 50 of n in organic fertilizer is assumed to be available for volatilization during fertilizer use 3 3 data and accounting for uncertainty assembly of the data for setting up the suzhou msa draws upon the following the peer viewed literature reference to the research findings of government departments the circulation and subsequent analysis of a questionnaire survey issued to firms and the conduct of interviews with government officials including those of the suzhou environmental protection agency suzhou housing and urban rural development bureau and suzhou environmental sanitation administration agency data not available from statistical yearbooks or official reports for instance on the quantity of water evaporation and the amounts of various types of food intake are drawn mainly from either current research or are estimated from larger scale data such as data for jiangsu province or for china process operating data such as the removal rates of nitrogen compounds in wastewater treatment plants are those of sample observations from monitoring data some of the more important sources of data are listed in table 1 data uncertainty must be formally accounted for for the following reasons since data and statistics for many aspects of resource transformations at the city scale are lacking or deficient parameterization of such features may need to be inferred from corresponding data and statistics at the country scale hence a typical source of uncertainty to quantify such uncertainties and data qualities in the msa model we follow the method of hedbrant and sörme 2001 see also villarroel walker 2010 where data are specified as values across a bounded interval that interval is set as the range for random sampling of a parameter value more specifically we follow the protocol shown in table 2 in which it is apparent that the uncertainty attaching to a parameter increases the more distant the data source from local suzhou circumstances thus for example given a parameter with an interval factor uj of 1 33 and whose most likely value α has been derived from official statistics at the national and regional level the sampling space for this parameter is set to be α 1 33 1 33 α technically a latin hypercube sampling is employed to generate candidate values for the model s parameters the number of samples needed for effectively covering the parameter space should be larger than 0 75 p where p is the number of model parameters barlund and tattari 2001 given that our msa models contains 635 parameters we judge our choice of 1000 samples is large enough table s1 in the supporting information provides further details of the parameter settings and sampling in msa 4 purpose and scope of analyses and the assessment criteria as we noted in the introduction to this paper the challenges presented by our analytical framework are irreducibly complex so that now after the foregoing summary of msa in more detail there is an essential need to define the scope and purpose of our studies in greater detail we also introduce and define here the three criteria the metabolic performance metrics mpms to be used to discriminate between the more and the less promising technological interventions for improving suzhou s n metabolism 4 1 triangulating and defining the purpose and scope of our analysis to begin msa is multi sectoral nexus plus we might say it covers interactions among the resource flows entering circulating within and exiting the water food energy waste handling and forestry sectors in the given geographical system the city of suzhou here we examine four candidate technology interventions in the water and waste handling sectors individually or combined according to 16 scenarios given the locked in nature of suzhou s energy sector for the coming few decades no interventions in the technology infrastructure of that sector are considered second msa is multi resource i e it tracks the flows of carbon nitrogen phosphorus water and energy circulating around and through all five of the foregoing sectors third it is also multi media it covers the movements of pre consumption resource flows from and the returns of post consumption flows to the terrestrial aquatic and atmospheric environments fourth screening of our results will be carried out using three mpm criteria significantly for this paper therefore msa enables analyses of the impacts on all sectors resource types and all environmental media of policy technology interventions in one sector which interventions may be aimed at altering primarily just one resource flow more specifically msa facilitates assessments of the cross sectoral advantages and disadvantages of the given intervention irrespective of the sector into which it is introduced similarly it alerts the analyst to the positives and negatives of addressing a problem of pollution in one medium say the aquatic environment with a candidate technology that while addressing this one medium generates residual flows as gaseous emissions and solid wastes discharged to the atmospheric and terrestrial environments wen et al 2018a in other words msa enables cross media assessments of candidate interventions both such domains of assessment cross sectoral and cross media are important yet one immediate implication of this is that very rarely are the requisite multi sectoral and or multi media institutional arrangements available through which to ensure both the implementation and the supervision of the desired technological changes to be specific therefore our enquiry is focused on the flow of n into and out of the city of suzhou primarily in association with the influx of n bearing goods associated with the food sector as opposed notably to the energy sector the downstream pollution resulting from the city s subsequent n metabolism primarily in respect of the food water and waste handling sectors is aquatic and manifest as eutrophication technological interventions in the water and waste handling sectors intended to improve suzhou s metabolic performance and curb eutrophication will surely alter the flows of carbon nitrogen phosphorus water and energy through the city our assessment nonetheless is driven primarily by msa s account and tracking of the urban n metabolism alone the focus of our analysis is also restricted to the notion of metabolism understood as changing in the relatively short term with a characteristic time constant of months to a year on this short scale some aspects of the accumulation year on year of resources within the built manufactured fabric and infrastructure of the city such as the resources embodied in construction materials durable goods office and household furniture and so on including their n content in the present study will be apparent in msa s computational results the metabolism of this built content of the city however is something whose dynamic variations are significant over the longer term of decades notably of course our candidate technological interventions just like the current fossil fuel based energy infrastructure of suzhou will influence the longer term decadal dynamics of the city s metabolism albeit to a relatively minor extent the crucial significance of these longer lived technological interventions herein is of course their intended influence over the short term metabolism of suzhou as imagined for example for a single year in the future such as 2035 or 2050 4 2 the metabolic performance metrics mpms flows of materials and resources in msa are straightforwardly estimated as follows eq 1 1 f i m i c i here f i is the amount of nitrogen in material flow i m i is the total mass of the flow i which is typically determined by direct investigation and material conservation and c i is the n content of material flow i usually expressed as a concentration or mass fraction since eq 1 is the fundamental basis of our three mpms it is to be noted that our results in this paper do not refer to improvements in the four other resource flows of carbon phosphorus water and energy to analyze the general structure and metabolic performance of the urban n metabolism msa categorizes material flows passing through the system boundary into five types input flows or resources r output flows or products p gaseous emissions to the atmosphere e aqueous emissions to the hydrosphere a and solid waste flows w input flows r originating outside the urban ecosystem boundary include flows entering the city as both raw materials and as finished products output flows p are those flows exiting the system across its boundary and destined for beneficial use in other systems such flows of r and p include fertilizers food feed wood products livestock biomass coal natural gas diesel fuel gasoline electricity and wastewater gaseous emissions e to the atmosphere include both aerosols and typical gasses from volatilization metabolic respiration photosynthesis denitrification and emissions from fuel combustion wastewater treatment plants landfill sites composting processes and the incineration of municipal waste aqueous emission flows a are those flows discharged into surface or ground water bodies e g surface runoff that reaches the river leakage from the public water supply and leaching from landfill or composting sites solid wastes w are flows of solid material that end up in the lithosphere notably flows directed towards landfill sites which remain there as solid deposits in the present study r p e a and w represent the amounts of n in the five categories of material flows p is therefore estimated according to eq 2 2 p f i p where f i p represents all the various flows of n exiting the urban ecosystem categorized as useful products and summation is exercised over all these so defined exiting flows i p therefore represents the total of all the products from suzhou across all five economic sectors eqs 3 4 and 5 below can be derived in just the same manner to give the following for the n in gaseous emissions e aqueous emissions a and solid wastes w respectively 3 e f i e 4 a f i a 5 w f i w here summation is exercised over all the flows i deemed respectively to be gaseous emissions aqueous emissions or landfill directed solid wastes exiting the system several metabolic performance metrics mpms can be specified in order to assess broadly the efficiency of suzhou s n metabolism and to evaluate the potential impacts on this metabolic efficiency of several technological options for enhancing n recovery and recirculation within the city inspired by the concept of eco efficiency i e broadly speaking the notion of producing more with fewer resources and emissions côté et al 2006 we specify three mpms first we define a resource productivity indicator pri as the following ratio of output and input n mass flows i e eq 6 6 p r i p r the higher the value of pri the greater is the conversion of incoming resource flows into useful outgoing product flows hence a higher urban metabolic efficiency hence a more circular less linear urban economy it should be noted that the industrial structure of the city can also have a vital influence on the pri indicator for example cities with a substantial component of agricultural production tend to have a smaller pri value than cities with high proportions of secondary and tertiary industries since a relatively significantly greater unproductive loss of n is associated with agricultural production this notwithstanding pri can still effectively assess the n metabolic efficiency and whether it can be improved by the various candidate technological policy interventions within one and the same city second in order to gage the environmental load imposed on the atmosphere hydrosphere and lithosphere of the city s surrounding hinterland we introduce two further metrics the products wastes indicator pwi and the emissions eco efficiency indicator eei they are computed as follows 7 p w i p w 8 e e i p e a pwi quantifies the balance between the beneficial productivity of the city s metabolism p and its detrimental quite unproductive disposal of solid wastes mainly to landfill w eei measures the same kind of balance in respect of the polluting unproductive burdens imposed across the atmosphere e and hydrosphere a relative to the more desirable beneficial productivity of the city s metabolism to summarize higher values for all three of the mpms pri pwi and eei can be considered preferable and desirable for the metabolism of suzhou 5 overview principal sector by sector flowpaths the results of the msa are provided in the form of probability distributions for the various flows of n in the system these computational results are based on 1000 candidate parameterizations of the model generated from the latin hypercube sampling procedure although the results are for the metabolism of suzhou in 2015 the city s industrial structure fuel and food demands and waste management infrastructure have not changed significantly since that year such that we may take the results as indicative of the current situation besides our principal focus in this analysis is on the extents to which technological innovations may change and improve upon the current metabolism one two or three decades or so into the future when they are assessed according to the mpms defined in the preceding section for clarity merely the 5th 50th and 95th percentiles of each distribution are reported and discussed accordingly the 50th percentile value of any given n flow can be taken as close to the most probable or average value of the flow while the 5th and 95th percentiles are indicative of the range of possible values about the central tendency fig 2 provides the summary all told the input n to the system in 2015 was estimated to be about 1570 gg with the 5th and 95th percentiles being 1270 gg and 1940 gg respectively 89 of the input n was in the forms of coal and natural gas while 5 was embodied in the incoming flows of food and animal feed 76 of the total input n was released into the atmosphere in the form of diatomic nitrogen n2 and nitrogen oxides no x as a result of fuel combustion and the process of denitrification in wastewater treatment since n2 releases are generally believed to cause little adverse environmental impact it is the release of no x from fuel combustion and incineration of municipal waste and sewage sludge that should be the focus of concern however denitrification of wastewater is not an insignificant contributor to global n2o emissions it is a small but not insignificant 3 4 or so thereof ipcc 2015 chen et al 2020 in addition n2o is a notably strong greenhouse gas otherwise the results show that 19 of the input n to suzhou leaves the city in the form of ccp solid coal combustion products some 12 gg n yr 1 pass with solid material into landfill sites about 20 gg n yr 1 are released into groundwater via soil infiltration and waste disposal sites including landfill and composting over the year about 74 gg n yr 1 accumulate in the city which is roughly 5 of the total n input with this accumulation being distributed mainly between the forestry and food sectors in more detail the magnitudes of the ten principal flows of n within each of the five economic sectors are given in fig 3 5 1 water sector in the water sector fig 3 a about 44 60 gg n yr 1 in industrial effluent together with 107 143 gg n yr 1 in residential commercial and municipal wastewater are sent to wastewater treatment plants in the city most of this n is then released to the atmosphere as a result of denitrification about 108 gg n yr 1 while some 53 gg n yr 1 are discharged from the urban ecosystem in aqueous effluents to surrounding water bodies sewage sludge carries with it some 19 gg n yr 1 ranging between 16 23 from wastewater treatment across and into the waste management sector in essence wastewater treatment is the key component in the n metabolism of the water sector accordingly its constituent unit processes should be the focus of our attention with respect to recovering n from suzhou s metabolism in the future indeed there are many mainstream technologies directed at doing just this with high n recovery potential egle et al 2016 5 2 food sector in the food sector fig 3 b and not surprisingly the production and consumption of food and animal feed are associated with large flows of n natural n deposition on agricultural lands we note is around 5 4 gg n yr 1 a much smaller amount than the n inputs in inorganic fertilizer of about 30 gg n yr 1 animal feed another principal n input bears with it about 28 gg n yr 1 ranging between 26 31 food imported from outside the city adds a further 32 gg n yr 1 to the food sector which contributes to the total 48 60 gg n yr 1 metabolized by residents in their food consumption post consumption 51 gg n yr 1 are transferred across from the food sector to the water sector in the forms of human urine and feces animal manure by comparison contains 10 19 gg n yr 1 of this about 8 gg n yr 1 are released as gaseous emissions to the atmosphere through volatilization during handling and storage processes while the remainder of the manure associated n is sent to the waste management sector it can be concluded that n storage in the food sector is mainly being accumulated in human biomass and more so animal biomass this latter amounting to around 14 gg n yr 1 such n storage will in due course exit the food sector as a function of the export of husbandry animals and the deaths of humans and animals 5 3 forestry sector forested lands within the system boundaries receive 1 2 4 2 gg n yr 1 via natural nutrient deposition from the atmosphere this being split as 0 3 2 6 gg n yr 1 of dry deposition and 0 9 1 6 gg n yr 1 of wet deposition both estimates are notably uncertain wood imported for paper products amounts to some 6 4 gg of incoming n flows on the whole however the forestry sector has a relatively small potential for n recovery fig 3 c 5 4 energy sector in the energy sector fig 3 d power generation and fuel combustion account for the largest flows of n all the energy generated in suzhou is derived from external fuel imports which bring with them 1250 gg n yr 1 ranging between 1040 1520 as coal and 140 gg n yr 1 ranging between 70 210 as natural gas with respect to power generation the total input of n is about 530 gg n yr 1 of this 76 emerges as gaseous emissions to the atmosphere and the remaining 24 is immobilized in coal cinder which is destined for the waste management sector apart from power generation local residents commerce industry and transportation also consume large amounts of fuel amounting to about 860 gg n yr 1 of this 80 ends up in gaseous emissions to the atmosphere in sum suzhou s energy sector participates in massive n flows but with virtually no accumulation occurring within the city itself 5 5 waste management sector the n metabolism of the waste management sector is significantly driven by transfers of n from the other four sectors for example sewage sludge from the water sector brings about 19 gg n yr 1 into the waste management sector half of this is converted into fertilizer compost and the other half is passed to incineration for power generation when mixed with both wood products and kitchen waste 12 gg n yr 1 accumulate in landfills within the city after accounting for some 0 3 gg n yr 1 of losses from these sites in gaseous emissions about 0 4 gg n yr 1 of biogas capture and about 3 7 gg n yr 1 in flows leaching to groundwater fig 3 e to summarize the energy and food sectors receive the largest inputs of n from outside the system the dominant pathways of n in the city s urban nitrogen metabolism are fuel utilization food consumption and wastewater treatment fuel demand household consumption patterns and the growth in livestock production are major factors that may drive future growth in the magnitude of suzhou s urban n metabolism at present however the metabolic residues of the food and water sectors such as those conveyed in the effluent from wastewater treatment in human urine sewage sludge and in livestock manure are crucial for examining the future potential for n recovery accordingly the technology scenarios for n recovery which are to be discussed in section 6 below will be focused on these four flows first however it is appropriate to assess the possible impacts of uncertainty on directing technological choices towards these four flows 5 6 considerations of uncertainty looking more closely at the distributions of the results of fig 3 the greatest relative uncertainties are apparent for the estimates of n flows in the forestry sector fig 3 c for instance the estimate of incoming n through the dry component of atmospheric deposition is especially uncertain according to our computations it is even possible that a larger mass of n might be entering suzhou in flows related to paper production than through dry atmospheric deposition although this is unlikely the emission of n to the atmosphere from the forestry sector presented as a negative value in the plot is also notably uncertain that said however flows of n associated with the forestry sector are relatively small and none of them is to be the focus of policies for improving the metabolic performance of suzhou in the food sector fig 1 b estimates of the flows of urine and feces associated n are relatively uncertain but while both of these are potential sources of beneficial n recovery and reuse our study assesses the performance of related technological interventions implemented in the water and waste management sectors wherein estimates of the respective n flows are subject to relatively less uncertainty i e the prospects for success of the technological interventions are relatively more clear cut hence more robust the relatively high uncertainty of the n flows in urine and feces is a consequence of the lack of suzhou specific statistical data for the production of human urine and feces comparable flow estimates for the amounts of n in the other waste nutrient flows such as industrial wastewater are relatively more suzhou specific as a result the companion aggregate flows of total wwtp influent effluent and sludge are relatively less uncertain otherwise beyond the forestry and food sectors the large emissions of n from the water and energy sectors are salient 6 technological innovations assessment according to the metabolic performance metrics current applications of the technologies and policies for n pollutant control and resource recovery have two main limitations first pollution control is often considered to be much more important than resource recovery whose role in promoting the circular economy tends therefore to be overlooked beck et al 2018 second most technologies focus on just a specific form of nitrogenous pollutant or a specific pollutant generation process without consideration of the overall picture or the possibilities for coordination across the various environmental media and the various urban economic infrastructure sectors for example the release of nitrogenous pollutants from the energy sector can be controlled and reduced using technologies such as flue gas denitrification this has knock on consequences however while the nitrogenous pollutants transferred into the water sector can be treated through the activated sludge process to meet applicable standards for n pollutants in aqueous emissions this is achieved at the expense of generating significant amounts of n bearing sewage sludge and this sludge in turn then needs its own proper treatment in order to prevent further secondary pollution in other words there is simply a cross media shifting of the pollution our msa approach was developed precisely for the purpose of examining the cross sectoral cross media ramifications of technology innovations for multiple resource recovery forms water energy nitrogen phosphorus carbon here however although the flows of n through suzhou are greatest in the energy sector the prospects for change in the near future in the structure of china s energy sector are very limited coal is and will continue to be the most important energy source in addition since 95 of the solid coal combustion residues are recycled for the production of building materials and cement the scope for n recovery in the energy sector will remain small we therefore confine our technology scenarios for n recovery from the urban metabolism of suzhou to the alternative scope for such recovery in the water and waste management sectors in particular let us focus on four flows that have been recognized as having substantial potentials for n recovery 6 1 four candidate technological interventions four technologies are considered each is a hot spot of current research in china li et al 2022 zhou et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 li et al 2020 they are urine separation technology ust pyrolysis of separated sludge pss livestock manure pyrolysis lmp and algae production in wastewater treatment facilities aww 6 1 1 urine separating technology ust ust as a technological intervention in the water sector addresses directly the unsustainability of end of pipe wastewater treatment which dilutes out in effect the otherwise richest source of n in the water sector through ust urine is collected and transported separately from its point of generation with the goal then of achieving the production of struvite nh4mgpo4 6h2o and ammonium sulfate nh4 2so4 thus ust recycles nitrogen from urine and turns part of this once regarded waste flow into beneficial product flows shu et al 2006 this technology has great potential in generating considerable economic benefit through recovered nutrient stream leading to its extensive promotion by businesses and institutions villarroel walker and beck 2014 villarroel walker et al 2017 6 1 2 pyrolysis of separated sludge pss and land manure pyrolysis lmp within the past decades pyrolysis has become one of the most significant technologies for recovering the renewable and economic value of waste biomass zhou et al 2018 pyrolysis in both urban as via pss and rural as via lmp settings given supplies respectively of separated sludges from urban wastewater treatment and poultry manure can realize the recovery of both material and energy resources pss in msa is treated as a technological intervention in the water sector while that of lmp is treated within the waste management sector for both technologies organic substances can be decomposed into liquid gaseous and solid products with most of the original n components being incorporated into solid end products for fertilizer manufacture pss and lmp are therefore clearly capable of decreasing the amount of nitrogen in waste streams of respectively sludge and animal manure of increasing resource recovery and also of indirectly reducing nitrogen pollution of the hydrosphere as a result of leaching and infiltration wan et al 2011 6 1 3 algae production from wastewater treatment aww aww deals with the treated wastewater as its raw input feedstock and recycles nitrogen by first incorporating it into algal biomass which may then be processed further to yield fuels and fertilizers sturm and lamer 2011 it is a promising environment enhancing pathway for sustainable wastewater management and biomass amplification li et al 2020 thus a candidate innovation available to the water sector in msa 6 2 the scenarios it is important to highlight the fact that there are interactions between technologies when implemented in combination hence the importance of a multi sectoral decision making framework such as that informed and supported by msa these interactions may be positive synergy or negative antagonism in total 16 scenarios are assessed as set out in table 3 they include each option implemented on its own pairwise combinations combinations of three technologies at a time all four together and a business as usual bau scenario in which none of the new technologies are in place 15 of the scenarios therefore cover technological interventions with the scope for improving suzhou s n metabolism with bau serving as a comparative reference base case for simplicity we assume that when any option is implemented the associated technology achieves what we might describe as 100 market penetration i e it is applied wherever this is possible we use the three mpms introduced and defined above the resource productivity indicator pri the products wastes indicator pwi and the emissions eco efficiency indicator eei to shed light on the relative performances of the 16 scenarios however all results refer to relative changes to the urban n metabolism in respect of the flows of n associated with the four sectors of water food forestry and waste management the substantial flows of n through the energy sector which remain unchanged under all 16 scenarios are therefore excluded from judgements about the improvements these technological innovations may bring to suzhou s overall n metabolism 6 3 screening the promise of technologies fig 4 summarizes the performances of all 16 scenarios according to the three mpms pri pwi and eei and fig 5 shows the percentages of improvement or otherwise in the performance of each of the 15 varieties of technological interventions relative to the bau scenario as in presenting the n flow estimates above in section 5 the uncertainties of the resulting mpm estimates for each scenario are reflected in the respective dots and bars in the columns of each plot of fig 4 with the median estimates annotated above each column 6 3 1 uncertainty and discriminating power of mpms broadly speaking subject to the uncertainties of the results in fig 4 no scenario promises strongly significant improvement in the product waste performance metric with any great confidence pwi fig 4 b as a matter of statistical detail application of the standard kolmogorov smirnoff test of the maximum difference between any pair of distributions results in most of the outcomes of no significant difference obtaining among the performances of the scenarios in respect of the pwi such outcomes are indicated in fig 4 as dotted lines connecting the relevant scenarios there are seven such occurrences of no significant difference in fig 4 b for the pwi and one in each of fig 4 a and 4 c for the other two indices see also below in addition the median estimates dots within the spans bars of the 5th and 95th percentiles of the pwi are biased towards the lower bounds of the distributions i e the chances are that the pwi for each scenario will be on the low side rather than desirably on the high side such skewing of the pwi distributions in fig 4 b as well as their limited improvements over the business as usual bau scenario are absent from the results for the other two indices the resource productivity index pri fig 4 a and the emissions eco efficiency index eei fig 4 c in sum we may conclude that the pri and eei are generally the more sensitive more discriminating indicators in the present analysis of suzhou the overall patterns of the results of fig 4 a for the pri and fig 4 c for the eei are also broadly similar 6 3 2 the more promising scenarios based on just the pri and eei we observe that if one technology alone were to be implemented it should probably be the urine separation technology ust the pri and eei distributions for the other three technologies when implemented singly are not greatly different from those of the present day reference bau if a combination of two technologies is to be introduced the pri and eei performance metrics suggest that the two pairings of the livestock manure pyrolysis lmp with either the pyrolysis of sewage sludge pss or the algal production from wastewater aww i e scenarios lp and la in fig 4 a and 4 c are not to be favored the gains they offer in respect of the metabolic performance of suzhou are more marginal than the other pairwise combinations of technologies however when the ust is added to both these pairwise scenarios i e a trio of technologies is implemented the performance of the trio relative to both these pairwise combinations of lp and la is markedly improved relative to the comparable alternatives again fig 4 a and 4 c refer nevertheless when all three constituent technologies of the lp and la pairs are implemented together as scenario lpa comprising the lmp pss and aww technologies the relatively inferior performance of this particular trio is marked urine separating technology is absent from these trios such that the importance of the ust is thereby again confirmed albeit indirectly last it is unsurprising that implementing all four technologies at once is likely on balance to give the best metabolic performance for n across all three indicators pri eei and pwi inspection of fig 5 reveals different insights although it is important to keep in mind that the percentages of improvement for each scenario relative to the bau are based on merely the 50th percentile statistics of the computed distributions thus scanning across each triplet of results for the 15 scenarios salient is the consistent and superior improvement in the products waste indicator pwi whenever the pyrolysis of sewage sludge pss or p in short in fig 5 is implemented alone or in combination indeed whenever pss appears in conjunction with urine separation technology ust all three metabolic performance indicators improve comparably well whereas scenarios lacking this conjunction yield more mixed less clear results for the percentage improvements in performance also notable is the way in which the implementation of all four technologies together improves performance by at least 100 a doubling on average according to all three indicators in short we might tentatively conclude that two of the four technologies urine separation technology ust and pyrolysis of sewage sludge pss emerge as especially promising 6 3 3 technology by technology assessment underlying these conclusions from figs 4 and 5 are the following remarks on the way we expect the various technologies to function within our multi sectoral analysis each technology is considered first on its own merits before consideration is given to the synergies and antagonisms between and among the deployment of two or more technologies in concert thus the success of the urine separation technology ust rests on the way in which the n in human urine is accessed and recovered upstream of the city s wastewater treatment plants while this urine bears only about a quarter of the total flux of n into wastewater treatment fig 3 a and b its n content is concentrated in addition its recovery at source as opposed to its elimination during wastewater treatment through biological nitrification denitrification reduces the subsequent wasteful emission of n to the atmospheric and aquatic environments in which respects which we might call integrated multi media pollution control it performs better than any of the other technologies the respective values of the eei metabolic performance index refer we may note in passing that such n recovery through ust as opposed to its elimination in conventional wastewater treatment also saves energy villarroel walker et al 2017 however these distinctive advantages notwithstanding the introduction of ust into suzhou would present substantial challenges in the required re engineering of the city s infrastructure which challenges in general are well recognized and addressed elsewhere beck 2011 larsen et al 2013 the technology of pyrolysis of sewage sludge pss as already observed with reference to the product waste index pwi is notable for its unique success in respect of reducing solid waste outputs from suzhou indeed combining the implementation of pss technology with any of the three others including ust yields no significant improvement upon what the pss option alone is capable of achieving in terms of the pwi fig 4 b in which pss is denoted as p for short shows that the probability distribution of pwi for scenario p alone is not statistically significantly different from the distribution for scenario up which in turn is itself not significantly different from scenarios lp and pa the consequence of introducing pss into the suzhou system is that less n would be unproductively disposed of to landfill sites of the other two technologies livestock manure pyrolysis lmp can only have but a minor role to play within the metabolism of suzhou since it is predominantly an industrial city aww algae production in wastewater treatment also has a relatively minor role in respect of altering the urban n metabolism not least because its primary purpose is the generation of c based fuels 6 3 4 interactions among technologies synergies and antagonisms not surprisingly aspects of these attributes of the individual technological options considered one by one are manifest when they are paired in the various combinations for instance the combination of the lmp and aww technologies yields the most inferior performance across all three indices this is scenario la in fig 5 when either technology is combined with the promising ust option in the ul and ua scenarios both the resulting pairwise scenarios of ul and ua in fig 5 show significant improvements for all three indicators potential synergies and antagonisms are also apparent when two or more of the technologies are implemented together the ust which on its own scores well in respect of the productivity index pri and eco efficiency index eei when combined with the pss technology with its attaching success in improving the solid waste burden index pwi leads to the best performing pairwise combination up in fig 5 as gauged across all three metabolic performance indices this superior potential of the two technologies ust and pss carries through into the various trios of options wherever they both appear together in the trios of ulp and upa in fig 5 improvements in suzhou s metabolic performance look most promising thus making the two technologies priorities for further more detailed consideration but in part this emerging preference for ust and pss is coupled with an inherent potential antagonism the n that the ust may access and recover upstream close to the sources of urine generation inevitably becomes unavailable for exploitation downstream in the aww option 7 sustainability and the circular economy how then does the foregoing assessment of the environmental and metabolic performance of the suite of four candidate technological interventions in suzhou fare according to the other components of the triple bottom line of sustainability i e the economic and social policy dimensions beck 2011 we now offer some closing discussion on these matters as well as on the implications of the present case study in respect of realizing a more circular economy for suzhou in turning to address the costs and financial benefits of implementing the various technological scenarios the complexities and cross sectoral nexus cross media ramifications of re engineering the urban metabolism are again apparent the means to gage and assess these multi sectoral features are discussed in more detail elsewhere in table s2 of the supplementary materials as well as in our previous case studies of london and atlanta villarroel walker 2010 villarroel walker et al 2014 in addition lest this be overlooked recall that our environmental metabolic assessment of suzhou has been confined solely to the flows of nitrogen not that of the accompanying deeply interwoven flows of phosphorus carbon energy or water in addition let us emphasize the following about all of the above our assessment of suzhou s metabolism has been cast in terms of what we have called the sub structure of the city s infrastructure as noted at the very beginning of this paper section 1 in moving now towards the paper s closure it is time for some of the results from msa to be brought back and up to the more familiar conventional super structure of urban infrastructure as follows 7 1 economic financial perspective given the natures of the four technologies monetary values may be assigned to four aspects of their performance the costs saved in association with reductions in urban water consumption the costs saved or not through reduced energy consumption the potential profit from biofuel recovery and the profits to be derived from fertilizer production intuitively these flows of resources and money are attached to the water energy and food sectors of the city s economy and infrastructure to the more readily recognized nexus in other words on these accounts in terms of conventional resource product flows as opposed to elemental n flows we can also point again to potential synergies and more importantly as it happens potential antagonisms in particular introduction of the urine separation technology ust while beneficial in terms of fertilizer production savings in water consumption and savings in energy consumption in wastewater treatment plants would reduce the yield of beneficial biogas from digestion of the separated sludges of wastewater treatment likewise the potential benefits of implementing the technologies of algal biomass production from wastewater aww and livestock manure pyrolysis must be gained at the expense and metabolic disadvantages of elevated rates of energy consumption fig 6 presents the results of our economic analysis estimates are based on current market prices for water industrial energy consumption natural gas gasoline and industrial n based fertilizer for each scenario the constituent benefits costs of the four value streams water saved energy saved biofuel recovery fertilizer production are shown in fig 6 a and the total revenue benefit of each scenario is given in fig 6 b further details of our procedure are provided in table s3 of the supplementary material scanning across fig 6 a it becomes apparent that only the urine separation technology ust affords a benefit in terms of water savings potentially profitable income streams from fertilizer production are also dominated by ust but are not exclusive to it on the downside ust incurs a marginal reduction in biofuel recovery relative to the present bau scenario which reduction is more emphasized when ust is combined with implementation of the pyrolysis of sewage sludge pss technology scenario up in fig 6 a in contrast promising returns from biofuel recovery are obtained whenever the livestock manure pyrolysis lmp and algal biomass from wastewater aww technologies are introduced although these the most significant financial benefits of all are coupled with the costs of a negative energy saving when alternatively the revenue and expenditure streams are aggregated across all four categories of savings and products fig 6 b reveals that the pairwise combinations of the ul and la scenarios along with the trio of the ula scenario offer the prospect of the greatest financial and economic benefits we observe then that examination of the various possible technological interventions from the perspective of their economic performance suggests priorities different from those identified above according to the assessment of their environmental performance i e their impacts on the nitrogen metabolism of suzhou for instance whereas the livestock manure pyrolysis lmp gave quite inferior n metabolic performance relative to notably the ust option when either was introduced on its own it fares significantly better on the economic front scenario l for lmp alone is even marginally superior in this respect to the u scenario for ust alone in fig 6 b a consequence of its capacity for valuable biofuel recovery our outlook on the option of pyrolysis of sewage sludge pss might also be substantially modified when economic considerations are taken into account we have talked of its promising potential for n recovery above at least in respect primarily of the somewhat equivocal product solid waste index pwi but when implemented alone or in concert with the aww technology as scenario la its economic performance is quite obviously not convincing again see fig 6 b indeed going further when pss is implemented in the all scenario its attaching need for additional energy consumption renders the economic performance of the all scenario inferior to that of the ula trio from which the pss technology is notably absent fig 6 b on the two accounts of environmental metabolic performance and economic performance it is tempting to conclude that the trio of the urine separation technology ust the livestock manure pyrolysis lmp and the algal biomass from wastewater aww looks the most promising of all its economic performance is superior and amounts to 1 4b yuan per annum fig 6 b its environmental metabolic performance is ranked within the top four of the 15 scenarios fig 5 the total amount of nitrogen it might recover and recycle is of the order of 31 gg n yr 1 of this the fertilizer thereby generated may be returned to cultivation processes in urban agriculture while the recovered biofuel and electricity can be put to good use in the urban transport system and other industrial enterprises however this is what can be achieved by way of annual operating revenue after the necessary investments in installing related facilities to that extent this scenario would contribute towards suzhou s economy becoming less linear and more circular hence appropriately in line with china s 2008 circular economy promotion law and this would be especially pertinent at the city scale which is of increasing importance as china s urban population heads towards the forecast 60 of the country s total population world bank 2018 indeed suzhou has already taken steps to reduce the linearity and increase the circularity of its economy as evident in our companion research on a sensor based internet of things iot network for resource recovery and recycling in the sector of restaurant food waste rfw management wen et al 2018b 7 1 1 in the wider global picture markets for nutrient recovery notwithstanding the extent and complexity of the results generated with msa it is important to recall now that our analysis has been confined first to a single case study city second to n bearing flows of resources and third to just four candidate technological interventions to give therefore a wider context to our economic analysis of n recovery in suzhou let us touch upon an earlier nexus impact analysis of technological innovations for nutrient carbon phosphorus and nitrogen recovery into a wider global framework villarroel walker and beck 2014 we offer these two insights first the global market for nutrient recovery at that time 2014 was estimated to range up to as much as 145b us per annum second while each of the four candidate technologies considered in our case study of suzhou were covered in one form or another under the some 18 nutrient recovery innovations considered they were either under commercial development or already installed the technology of anaerobic digestion looked exceptionally promising in respect of both its actual potential market share and the index of beneficial nexus impact employed for the purpose of ranking and comparing the alternatives villarroel walker and beck 2014 7 2 looking beyond n metabolism alone msa as should be readily apparent is intended to enable and illuminate cross sectoral cross media and cross resource interactions among flows of carbon nitrogen phosphorus energy and water resources it is intended as an antidote to what can often appear as an exclusive contemporary focus albeit understandably so on solely the energy sector and flows of carbon reducing carbon emissions is one of the core objectives in china s ecological civilization construction at present as too it is elsewhere so what interconnections and synergies might there be between the energy sector and carbon emissions and the above assessment of suzhou s n metabolism which we freely acknowledge is exclusive in its own way first our preceding economic financial assessment of ways to improve the urban n metabolism is dominated by energy sector and carbon flow implications these include both savings in electricity consumption hence carbon emission reductions and the benefit of a carbon resource flow of renewable biofuel second we may point to the following cross resource linkage changing the type and intensity of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers applied to farmland can significantly affect the characteristics of nutrients organic matter and microbial species in soil which in turn affect the intensities of methane carbon emissions from paddy field agriculture sun 2020 third and conversely deliberate interventions to adjust the carbon nitrogen ratio of sewage will affect the microbial community structure of unit treatment processes and its metabolic state in sedimentation tanks thereby influencing transformations of n through denitrification shu 2021 last but surely not least substantial amounts of energy are consumed hence equally substantial amounts of carbon are emitted to the atmosphere in the global industrial production of reactive n in fertilizer supply menegat et al 2022 estimate these emissions to have been of the order of 440 mt co2 in 2018 to give perspective this synthetic industrial n fertilizer supply chain was responsible for some 10 6 of global agricultural carbon emissions and 2 1 of global ghg emissions in that year 7 3 towards appropriate institutional arrangements the core thrust of this paper has been to treat the urban metabolism in a multiple resource flow multi sectoral multi media setting in theory introducing new technologies and policies for the food sector should not be addressed independently of those for the water sector nor should the emission of unproductive polluting materials to the aquatic environment be assessed independently of those emitted to the atmospheric environment and so on even in the present restricted analysis of just the nitrogen metabolism of suzhou a single resource flow as a function of technology interventions in the water and waste handling sectors just two of the five sectors cross sectoral and cross media interactions are significant and substantial in practice however it is very difficult to find evidence of any accompanying institutional arrangements capable of delivering the potential gains from and minimizing the potential disadvantages of our multi sectoral analysis our msa for example even within the confines of one sector water half a century of attempts to promote fully coordinated integrated operation of sewer network systems wastewater treatment systems and receiving water quality have struggled to achieve their successful implementation in practice beck 1976 2013 yuan et al 2019 this notwithstanding however china has undoubtedly responded determinedly to the severe environmental pressures it was experiencing and duly implemented a succession of action plans for the prevention and control of air pollution water pollution and soil pollution along with new ambient air quality standards through these measures it has gradually been transferring the target of its policies away from a focus solely on pollution control and towards the improvement of environmental quality nevertheless in china as in most other countries monitoring and management of the air water and soil environments are tasks discharged independently technological innovations continue to be evaluated with respect to just a particular pollutant discharge with the benefits being assessed with respect to a specific sensitive segment of the environment such as a surface water body and not across all media in addition considerations of the multiple resource flows associated with and manipulated by a given technology are always absent for example china s action plan for prevention and control of air pollution places emphasis on project construction and renovation of desulfurization denitrification and dust removal while overlooking entirely the manner in which the by products of these processes might be reused or otherwise disposed of it remains the case therefore that some measures to control pollution may succeed in decreasing the amounts of pollutants discharged into the single specifically targeted environmental medium and demonstrably fail elsewhere by causing more severe even irreversible damage in another medium in redressing this narrowness and singularity of perspective our analysis has been very much in accord with the spirit of the ambitions of china s framework design for a circular economy ndrc 2017 it is also in accordance with the target of achieving a smarter urban metabolism from the perspectives of resource utilization efficiency lowering environmental impacts and generating economic benefits see also villarroel walker and beck 2014 beck et al 2018 beck et al 2013 at the critical stage of low emission transition in china supportive policies and measures are highly recommended in promoting the innovative diffusion of waste to energy and waste to resource technologies wang et al 2022 8 conclusions of the two primary means by which n bearing materials are engaged in suzhou s urban metabolism the first from fuel combustion in the energy and transport sectors and the second in the food water waste chain the former dominates at around 1390 gg n yr 1 over the latter at around 80 gg n yr 1 however given that the structure of energy provision in suzhou is not set to change substantially in the near to medium term future we have investigated a total of 15 scenarios for future arrangements for the city s water and waste management infrastructures together with a sixteenth scenario of suzhou s infrastructure configuration the scenarios cater for all the various ways in which four technologies can be introduced into suzhou s water and waste management sectors singly or in the various multiple combinations in the presence of uncertainty as duly accounted for in our msa model computations we find that the trio of urine separating technology ust the cultivation of algal biomass in wastewater treatment as the precursor of fuels and the pyrolysis of animal manure is especially promising it achieves an expected net annual economic benefit of 1 4b yuan around 0 2b us and is ranked again with sufficient statistical confidence among the top four of the 16 scenarios in respect of environmental i e metabolic performance it might beneficially recover some 31 gg n yr 1 for the city

24236,the dynamic energy budget model describes energy and mass balance in living organisms it has found many applications in biological and ecological sciences the model parameters can be connected to a single underlying biological process and this mechanistic approach is helpful in understanding how complex biological systems work however the large number of model parameters makes it difficult to estimate their value especially from data limited only to adult growth and reproduction at abundant food and constant temperature therefore in this study the sensitivity of the model solution to primary parameter values and the sensitivity of parameters to the perturbation in the data were analyzed it was shown that the first order sensitivity coefficients are different for each of the analyzed primary parameters and depend on their values and configuration in the equation the sensitivity of parameters to data changes across analyzed time intervals reaching minima and maxima moreover the influence of each data point is smaller with an increasing number of data points the recognition of the impact of parameters on the model solution as well as the identification of data points with the strongest influence on estimates can be helpful in experimental design and evaluation of the model keywords growth model reproduction model dynamic system estimation numerical methods data availability data available in supporting materials 1 introduction the dynamic energy budget deb theory and model were formulated by kooijman in the 1980s kearney 2021 kooijman 1986a 1986b since then they have been applied widely in biological and ecological sciences i e modeling population dynamics aging assessing the toxicity of chemicals or finding the organizing principles for metabolism and understanding taxon specific patterns jager 2020 jager and zimmer 2012 kearney 2021 kooijman 2010 lika et al 2014 2011 livanou et al 2019 marques et al 2019 2018 the wide range of model applications results from that the deb model describes energy and mass fluxes which are common for all living creatures according to the deb theory organisms consist of structures and reserves structures require energy to be maintained whereas reserves do not energy obtained by an organism through its surface from the environment is stored in reserves the reserves are mobilized and the fixed fraction κ of it is used with priority for somatic maintenance and the rest to increase the volume of structures growth the remaining fraction of mobilized energy 1 κ can be used for maturity maintenance maturation or reproduction reserves play a crucial role in the deb theory they are necessary to include metabolic memory smooth out fluctuation in resource availability and capture changes in the chemical composition of individuals kooijman 2010 on this basis it is possible to build different deb models which can include multiple reserves and structures and be applied to organisms in different life stages distinguished by the ability to obtain energy from the environment or by the ability to reproduce for the isomorph organism with one reserve and one structure both with constant chemical composition the standard deb model is formed the assumption for this model can be found elsewhere kooijman 2010 and the scheme and equations are provided in the following section the deb model describes most of the features of the metabolic organization of living organisms including development and reproduction this comprehensive framework affects the number of parameters that have to be included in the model therefore the number of deb model parameters is higher compared to that of the model parameters used to describe a single process such as the von bertalanffy growth model the monod equation or survival curves in some cases several five or even more deb model parameters must be estimated for control from limited data eg growth and or reproduction only margerit et al 2016 matyja et al 2020 a high number of model parameters and the difficulties obtaining sufficient data for other variables of the deb model i e directly measuring the reserve density and maturity changes make the estimation of parameters complex but not impossible there are several ways to deal with this issue billoir et al 2008 meer 2006 probably the most developed deb model estimation procedures arrived with the add my pet project amp which aims to compare different species in terms of their energy budget to find metabolism organization principles and taxon specific patterns upon which all life is based amp up to today deb model parameters have been determined for more than 3800 species https www bio vu nl thb deb deblab add my pet obviously the more data about the chosen species are available the more constrained the parameters and their estimates seem to be more reliable the data may include information about certain physiological features of organisms such as maximum body weight incubation time weight at birth or puberty zero variate data in amp along with full sets of kinetic data e g growth and reproduction curves feeding respiration as a function of length uni variate data lika et al 2011 moreover the elemental composition and energy balances in different food levels body sizes or ages can also be included lika et al 2011 however in most cases the full data set lika et al 2011 is not available and therefore some additional constraints on parameter values are needed to obtain reliable estimates for example the rules of co variations of parameters among species and their evolutionary and ecological adaptation can be used to generate fixed parameters of generalized animals which can be used as an additional data set in the estimation procedure pseudo data in amp moreover the co variation regularization term can be added to the loss function lika et al 2020 the bijection from zero variate data to model parameters can be used to catch boundaries of parameter space which can be applied as filters in the estimation procedure lika et al 2014 besides the amp project the deb model can be used in different types of studies that aim for instance to test the influences of food availability temperature or toxic substances on the life histories of chosen organisms in such cases most often only the growth and reproduction curves are obtained and the simultaneous estimation of a few parameters under different environmental conditions food toxic substances is often required margerit et al 2016 matyja et al 2020 this paper focuses only on growth and reproduction data and equations and further considerations are related to these issues the deb model parameters can be classified into different groups kooijman 2010 the core deb parameters relate to theory assumptions and control the dynamics of state variables state variables such as scaled length and reserve density cannot be measured directly and therefore the auxiliary theory is necessary to transform the data auxiliary parameters such as shape coefficient and specific densities are used to link state variables with physical measurements and obtain access to core parameters lika et al 2011 in many cases the auxiliary parameters can be determined in separate and dedicated measurements which decreases the number of parameters that have to be estimated from the full system dynamics meer 2006 primary deb model parameters are connected to a single underlying process these parameters can be connected into compound parameters one compound parameter is built from a few primary parameters which are added subtracted multiplied or divided by each other this frequently used method allows to reduce the number of model parameters and obtain reliable estimates of compound parameters thereby facilitating reliable simulations and predictions jager and zimmer 2012 lika et al 2011 however the values of primary parameters can still be unknown some compound parameters can be measured directly in certain experimental conditions which greatly impacts the reliability of estimates by decreasing the number of parameters that have to be estimated simultaneously for instance maximum length which is the cubic root of structural volume at ad libitum food availability not to be confused with ultimate length can be determined from physical measurements and used as a constant value while estimating the remaining model parameters the estimation of model parameters from kinetic data i e growth curve and reproduction in time data can be conducted using among others the nonlinear least square method in this method an error function is minimized to decrease the difference between data points and estimated model values a large number of parameters makes it difficult to find the global minimum of this function whereas multiple local minima can appear marques et al 2019 moreover finding a global minimum still does not guarantee the reliability of estimates whereas parameters can take on non physical values recently some alternative loss functions which are modifications of the sum of squares error have been applied to solve dimension problems for multiple data sets and to deal with asymmetry between under and over estimation lika et al 2020 marques et al 2019 while estimating a large number of parameters good knowledge of the sensitivity of the dynamic system can be helpful baker and rihan 1999 de meester et al 2001 kalaba and spingarn 1980 this includes the sensitivity of the model values to the parameters and the sensitivity of the parameters to the perturbation in the data the first shows how some changes in parameter values will influence the outcome basically the shape and limits of the model curve baker and rihan 1999 de meester et al 2001 kalaba and spingarn 1980 it is recommended to investigate it each time before estimating the parameters of the new model small changes in some parameters can have a huge impact on the model solution whereas in other cases the influence can be negligible moreover this kind of investigation can provide information about the range of parameter values which produces reliable outcomes on the other hand the influence of the quality and quantity of data points on model parameters can help design an experiment choosing the number of measurements performed their frequency and their accuracy analysis of the sensitivity of the parameters to the data can be used to identify data points that have a strong or insignificant impact on the estimates which allows consciously exploring experimental data baker and rihan 1999 de meester et al 2001 kalaba and spingarn 1980 in this study the standard dynamic energy budget model was analyzed the main aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the sensitivity of the deb model solution to the primary parameters and to analyze the sensitivity of parameter estimates to the perturbation in the growth and reproduction data the matlab code was prepared and made available to facilitate the analysis of other models in the future 2 material and methods 2 1 mathematical model the standard deb model can be used to describe the changes in structural length scaled reserves destiny and reproduction of an isomorphic organism the scheme of the model is presented in fig 1 when an organism starts to feed itself after birth b the energy obtained from food is assimilated into the reserve and reserves are mobilized and used in different physiological processes the kappa κ fraction is primarily used to maintain structure and then for growth the rest firstly for maturation of juveniles and after puberty p for reproduction kooijman 2010 the standard deb model for an adult can be given by a set of equations that describe the changes of scaled structural length l scaled reserve density e and reproduction rate r kooijman 2010 1 d d t l k m g 3 e l l t e g 2 d d t e k m g f e l 3 r κ r k m υ e 0 e l 2 e g g l t l k υ h p the scaled length is defined as a structural length divided by the maximum structural length l l l m and the scaled reserve density is a reserve density divided by the maximum reserve density e e e m the parameters used in eqs 1 3 are compound parameters the core model parameters are listed in table 1 and the compound model parameters and how they relate to core parameters are shown in table 2 eqs 1 3 can be rewritten using only primary parameters 4 d d t l p m υ κ p a m 3 e l p t κ p a m e e g υ κ p a m 5 d d t e p m υ κ p a m f e l 6 r κ r e 0 1 κ e l 2 e e g υ κ p a m e g υ p t κ p a m l p a m κ p a m p m 2 k j e h p for the purposes of this study some additional assumptions and simplifications were made to exclude the influence of food availability on the system dynamics the deb organism is considered to be fed ad libitum f 1 and there is no fluctuation in food availability therefore d d t e 0 thus specific searching rate and assimilation efficiency are not considered the temperature is 20 c and constant during the considered time interval the surface specific somatic maintenance cost p t is assumed to be equal to zero and not taken into account in further considerations marques et al 2018 only the adult form of deb organisms is analyzed because only this form can provide reproduction data therefore maturity at birth is not analyzed the parameters controlling life span weibull aging acceleration and gompertz stress coefficient are also not analyzed in addition to survival data the zoom factor was assumed to be 1 z 1 at the end the model takes the form of two equations 7 d d

and 8 parameters p m υ κ p a m e g κ r e 0 k j e h p was analyzed where the last four parameters control only reproduction 2 2 sensitivity analysis 2 2 1 sensitivity of the model values to the parameter p the first order sensitivity coefficient s k measures the local sensitivity of the model solution y t p with respect to the changes in parameter p k it is given as a partial derivative kalaba and spingarn 1980 9 s k t p y t p p k the function y t p symbolizes the solution of model differential equations for the system of two deb model equations the y t p can be substituted by a vector 10 y t p y l t p y n t p where y l t p l t p and y n t p n t p 0 t r d t provide the opportunity to determine the first order sensitivity coefficients simultaneously for the set of model equations with respect to the scalar parameter p k 11 s k t p y t p p k y l t p p k y r t p p k s l k t p s n k t p where s l k t p and s n k t p are first order sensitivity coefficients for growth and cumulative reproduction respectively symbol p denotes a vector of parameters that will be evaluated at optimal values of p 12 p p p 1 p 2 p l p t the index k 1 l p is used to simplify the further description by pointing to a specific parameter given that p p m υ κ p a m e g κ r e 0 k j e h p t the typical values of parameters in the std deb model for deb organisms at 20 c are given in table 1 and they were used in further analyses the value of s k t p can also be approximated de meester et al 2001 13 s k t p y t j p y t j p δ p k where y t j p is the model solution at time point t j at the optimal parameter values and y t j p is the model solution when the optimal value of the parameter p k was perturbated by δ p k according to the formula p k p k δ p k the δ p k value can be defined as a small fraction of p k here δ p k 10 8 p k for each of the analyzed parameters de meester et al 2001 to determine the first order sensitivity coefficient s k changes in time the derivatives with respect to each parameter p k of both model eqs 7 and 8 were calculated and solved numerically with respect to t along with the model equations baker and rihan 1999 de meester et al 2001 eighteen derivatives 2 y l t p t p k and 2 y n t p t p k can be found in the supporting information si the solutions of these equations with respect to t were used to determine the sensitivity of parameters to the perturbation in the data 2 2 2 sensitivity of parameters to the perturbation in the data the sensitivity of parameters p to the perturbation in data y can be measured as a partial derivative p y j baker and rihan 1999 de meester et al 2001 kalaba and spingarn 1980 according to the least squares method the objective error loss function which has to be minimized takes the following form 14 s p y

length and reproduction data w l i i and w n i i are elements of the diagonal matrixes w l and w n of weights of each residual for growth and reproduction respectively and index i denotes each data point the weights can be defined as w i i 1 σ i 2 given that σ i 2 is the variance of certain measurements the use of such weights eliminates the problem of summing residuals expressed in different units weighted sums of squared residuals are dimensionless numbers moreover to simplify further considerations we can assume that variances σ l i 2 of length measurements are equal as well as variances of cumulated reproduction σ n i 2 therefore the diagonal matrixes can be substituted by scalars w l and w n 16 s p y l y n i 1 n w l y l t i p y l i 2 i 1 n w n y n t i p y n i 2 the minimum of the objective function is found when parameters have their optimal values p p and the first derivative with respect to each parameter p k equals zero 17 s p y l y n p k 2 w l i 1 n y l t i p y l i y l t i p p k 2 w n i 1 n y n t i p y n i y n t i p p k 0 for optimal parameter values p and knowing that parameter values depend on data p y l y n the eq 17 can be simplified and rewritten as follows i 1 n y l t i p y l y n y l i s l k t i p y l y n 18 i 1 n y n t i p y l y n y n i s n k t i p y l y n 0 for simplicity we assume that the weight factors w l and w n are equal and therefore vanish from eq 17 eq 18 is a function of y l y n and p y l y n and can be differentiated with respect to growth data y l or reproduction data y n both solutions are obtained analogically and therefore only the derivative with respect to y l is presented below 19 i 1 n m 1 l p s l k t i p s l m t i p y l t i p y l i 2 y l t i p p m p k p m y l j i 1 n m 1 l p s n k t i p s n m t i p y n t i p y n i 2 y r

indexed by i 1 n assuming that estimated model values are close to observed data the terms y l t i p y l i and y n t i p y n i can be neglected baker and rihan 1999 the terms 2 y l t i p p m p k and 2 y r t i p p m p k are called second order sensitivity coefficients baker and rihan 1999 and are not analyzed because they vanished with the last simplification 20 i 1 n m 1 l p s l k t i p s l m t i p

and 23 it is possible to determine the influence of data perturbation on certain parameters taking into account the perturbation of all other parameters eqs 22 and 23 can be simplified for the assumption that only one parameter p k is estimated and influenced by the data in this case the equations take the following form kalaba and spingarn 1980 24 p k y l j s l k t j p k i 1 n s l k 2 t i p k s n k 2 t i p k and 25 p k y n j s n k t j p k i 1 n s l k 2 t i p k s n k 2 t i p k for simplicity the notation of the coefficient of sensitivity with respect to data was replaced in a further part of the study 26 s d l k p k y l j and 27 s d n k p k y n j the sensitivity of isolated and not isolated parameters to the perturbation in the data was determined for all nine considered parameters p m υ κ p a m e g κ r e 0 k j e h p the sensitivity of model parameters to the perturbation in the data can also be determined by a simplified procedure the example of it was prepared to illustrate how sensitivity analysis can be used a priori to gain knowledge about model properties and contribute to the experimental design the artificial data were created by solving eqs 7 and 8 numerically in the time interval t 0 3000 with the following steps δ t 100 days using the 4 5 runge kutta method the obtained artificial data set consisted of 31 growth and reproduction data points two model parameters p m and e g were fit using the weighted least squares method eq 16 with weights equal to 1 to the artificial data each of the data points was increased by the value of 0 01 separately and the fitting procedure was repeated in the result 31 sets of estimated parameters were obtained the results were compared to the sensitivity coefficients p y l j and p y n j calculated for p m and e g parameters 2 3 numerical methods the differential model equations and first order sensitivity coefficients y l t p p k and y r t p p k were solved numerically in the time interval t 0 3000 using the runge kutta 4 5 method in matlab 2021b the starting values were l 0 0 29 which was slightly above length at puberty n 0 0 and for each partial derivative with respect to parameters y 0 p p k 0 0 determining the sensitivity of parameters to the perturbation in the data p y l j and p y n j requires solving a set of linear equations which involves numerical methods for dealing with an inverse matrix baker and rihan 1999 for a given set of parameters table 1 and artificial data the matrix i 1 n s l t i p s l t t i p s n t i p s n t t i p can be badly conditioned and the system can be sensitive to perturbations the small change in s l t i p or s n t i p can produce a very large change in the solution p y l j and p y n j to deal with this issue the moore penrose pseudoinverse method function pinv in matlab was used to determine p y l j and p y n j the matrix condition was assessed by the reciprocal condition number function rcond in matlab the estimation of p m and e g was conducted by fitting the numerical solution of the set of the model eqs 7 and 8 obtained by the runge kutta 4 5 method to the artificial data using the weighted nonlinear least squares method matyja et al 2021 the error loss function eq 16 was minimized using the nelder mead simplex method lagarias et al 1998 assuming w l w n 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity of the model values to the parameter p the first order sensitivity coefficients s k in the considered time interval for each parameter are shown in fig 2 they are presented along with plots of scaled length and cumulated reproduction to ensure readability of the influence of parameter changes on the different regions of the model curves there was no significant difference between s k values obtained as a derivative eq 11 and using the approximated method eq 13 the influence of parameters on the model solution depends on their own values variables t l n and interactions with each other inside the model equations for instance an increase in the parameter p k s k 0 which is only found in the numerator of the equation will surely increase the rate d y t p d t and therefore the model solutions in the specific region d y t p d t symbolize d y l t p d t or d y n t p d t for d y t p d t 0 the influence of parameters changes on the model solution converges to zero and the cases when d y t p d t 0 are not considered in this study as they are biologically impossible or require specific extension and modification of discussed model e g shrinking kooijman 2010 a good example of a parameter that is located only in the numerator in the growth eq 7 is p m analogically in the case when the parameter is found only in the denominator the modeled rate and solution will decrease see e g e 0 in the reproduction rate eq 8 the interaction between parameters and especially the presence of one parameter in different parts of the equations significantly influences the model analysis the influence of parameter changes on the model solution can be reflected by first order sensitivity coefficients s k without analyzing the form and arrangement of the model equation therefore the presented analysis fig 2 can be used to understand how and in which time interval some changes in primary std deb model parameters can influence the shape of growth and reproduction curves it is known that the higher the absolute value of s k the higher the change in y t p the positive value s k means that an increase in the parameter p k will cause an increase in the model solution y t p whereas a negative s k is responsible for the decrease in the model solution whilst s k depends on time the influence of parameters on the model curve will be different at different time points at t 0 the first order sensitivity coefficients are equal to zero this is because none of the analyzed parameters can influence the initial starting point for the model solution which was fixed in this study in some cases some forcing functions can be applied to increase the freedom of the fitted model the s k in some cases reaches local minima and maxima for example the first order sensitivity coefficient of the parameter p m determined for the growth curve has the highest positive value at t 630 based on the time vector in the runge kutta method this means that an increase in p m will increase scaled length l by the highest value at that time in the case of reproduction data the increase of p m will lower the model solution by the highest value at t 3000 it should be noted that the maxima and minima of s k for the growth curve were noted at similar time points in the range t 560 640 and are provided in table s1 it is worth pointing out that none of the parameters have any influence on the maximum scaled length as its value in the applied model is fixed to 1 the s k values converge to zero whereas the rate d y l t p d t converges to zero and the scaled length l reaches its maximum left side of fig 2 moreover the changes in parameters κ r e 0 k j e h p have no influence on the growth curve as they do not appear in eq 7 in these cases the first order sensitivity coefficients are equal to zero fig 2 the lower the parameter value the higher the maximum s k the comparison of std deb model typical parameters values with maximum s k can be found in table s1 for example the model is more sensitive to changes in κ r rather than to e 0 see fig 2 some exceptions from this rule can be explained by the more sophisticated interaction between parameters especially in the case where one parameter appears in the model equation in a few different configurations moreover some model parameters are raised to the second power which can greatly increase their influence on the solution in summary the value of scaled length l is most sensitive to changes in υ at t 610 and the cumulative reproduction n is most sensitive to changes in k j at t 3000 both l and n are least sensitive to changes in e g 3 2 sensitivity of isolated parameters to perturbation in the data the sensitivity of isolated parameters to perturbation in the data s d k is shown in fig 3 the higher the absolute value of s k the lower the absolute value of s d k this relationship can be seen in eqs 24 and 25 within the sum of squared s k in the denominator kalaba and spingarn 1980 this means when small changes in parameters result in large changes in dependent variables l n the small perturbation of the data points hardly influences the parameters values importantly the sensitivity of isolated parameters to the perturbation in the data depends on the number of data points see eqs 24 and 25 the higher the number of data points the lower the s d when the number of data points increases each point has less influence on the outcome therefore when the measurements are taken often the possible deviation of one of them has little influence on the general outcome the relationship between the number of data points n and the s d k for arbitrarily chosen time points t 1000 2000 is shown in fig s1 this relationship seems to be exponential which leads to the conclusion that increasing the number of measurements to infinity is useless for instance the number of data points higher than 61 does not substantially decrease s d k the sensitivity of parameters to data perturbation is similar in the case of n 61 and n 301 therefore preparing 301 measurements seems to be economically unjustified the same relationship can be seen in fig 3 where the plotted curves for the higher number of data points n are closer to zero it should be noted that in the case of the analyzed std deb model with fixed maximum scaled length the data collected when the changes of growth rate were highest growth curve is most strongly bent have the greatest influence on estimates therefore these data points should be measured with the highest accuracy the reproduction data have the greatest influence on parameter values at the end of the simulation time the explanation of this observation is related to the accumulation of reproductive data the cumulative reproduction n is the sum of offspring produced in a given period therefore each following point is based on all earlier ones the sensitivity of parameters to data points seems to accumulate as well 3 3 sensitivity of parameters to perturbation in the data the more sophisticated analysis comes with the assumption that each of the analyzed parameters can be influenced by each data point the results of the sensitivity analysis of all parameters to the perturbation in the data are presented in fig 4 notably the sensitivity of parameters still depends on the number of data points moreover the patterns of s d k for the growth curve are similar to those determined for isolated parameters however their values and signs in the case of p a m and υ are different figs 3 and 4 moreover parameters κ r e 0 k j e h p are not present in the growth equation and are sensitive to perturbation in growth data see eq 24 in the case of the reproduction curve the sensitivity of all parameters to perturbation in data differs from that determined for the individual isolated parameters fig 3 the s d k changes sign four times inside the considered time interval eqs 22 and 23 show how the s k values are added and multiplied with each other creating a matrix i 1 n s l t i p s l t t i p s n t i p s n t t i p that has to be inverted to determine s d k therefore the influence of data points on cumulative reproduction n does not seem to be intuitive the reciprocal condition number of this matrix was lower than 10 25 for all cases of datasets with a different number of data points n therefore this matrix is badly conditioned and the small changes in s k can generate large changes in s d k it is highlighted that the patterns of s d k for chosen parameters are similar within the growth and reproduction data conducted analysis indicated the existence of cumulative reproduction data points whose perturbations do not influence the model parameters s d k 0 moreover it appears that none of the parameters not only some of them can be influenced by the changes in these data points which can be found on the plots around t 600 1500 and 2700 on the other hand local maxima and minima of s d k appear at similar times for each analyzed parameter this means that there are some n data points that have a larger influence on parameter estimates than others it seems to be reasonable to identify both types of data points in the data set it should also be mentioned that this analysis was performed for a given loss function eq 15 using different loss functions such as those presented elsewhere lika et al 2020 marques et al 2019 can generate different outcomes however this issue is beyond the scope of this study the matlab code used to determine the first order sensitivity coefficients s k and the sensitivity of parameters isolated and not isolated to the perturbation in the data s d k can be found in si in many cases not all deb model parameters are estimated from kinetic data in that cases the simplified procedure which does not involve the determination of s k and s d k can be applied an example of the sensitivity analysis and estimation of two parameters p m and e g was performed and the results of the simulations are shown in fig 5 the artificial data points scale length and cumulative reproduction are plotted at the top of fig 5 below them the sensitivity of two parameters to perturbation in the data s d k is shown at the bottom of fig 5 the results of the simultaneous estimation of two parameters to modified artificial data are presented the estimation was repeated for small modifications of each data point the patterns of s d k match the changes in the estimated parameter values in other words a small perturbation in the data point with the highest absolute value of s d k will result in the highest deviation of estimates interestingly even in the case of only two unknown parameters the pattern of s d k for reproduction data is not trivial it is possible to identify points in which small perturbations will have a large or small influence on estimates for instance perturbation in the cumulative reproduction n measured at t 1400 had the highest influence on p m and n at t 2300 had a negligible one this example directly shows which data points should be measured carefully with high accuracy and which are less important for the estimation procedure here it should be noted that parameters that appear only once in the set of model equations and are multiplied or divided by each other should not be estimated simultaneously even when both parameter values are constrained by certain physical biological or other boundaries in some continuous interval the same result of their multiplication or division can be obtained by infinite combinations of their values for example the same value of the quotient κ r e 0 can be obtained by an infinite number of κ r and e 0 value combinations therefore these two parameters should not be estimated simultaneously from one data set which includes growth and reproduction assuming e 0 is a parameter this also applies to the product k j e h p 4 discussion the main purpose of sensitivity analysis is to assess how the uncertainty of model parameters as varying inputs impacts model performance and therefore to support model calibration verification and simplification pianosi et al 2016 it can be performed by a wide range of distinct methods and is used in many fields such as astronomy social science economics medicine environmental sciences and biology pianosi et al 2016 saltelli et al 2019 for example parameter sensitivity analysis similar to that described in this study was conducted to analyze the bass diffusion model which describes the process of sales growth of new products grasman and kornelis 2019 parameter sensitivity analysis of activated sludge models which describes microbial growth as well as the removal of organic compounds nitrogen and phosphorous was also performed demir and atçı 2021 liwarska bizukojc and biernacki 2010 studies on the sensitivity of the deb model to the parameter values are scarce one example of the influence of changes in parameter values on the debtox reproduction curve was described by billoir et al 2008 however the authors prepared a sensitivity analysis by letting each parameter vary one at a time in realistic ranges and assuming that the remaining ones were fixed at the reference values therefore the analysis took a discrete and not a continuous form the second example can be found in accolla et al 2020 who analyzed the influence of missing datasets on deb model parameter estimates the authors used the estimation method and loss function used in the amp project marques et al 2018 to study the influence of missing datasets on deb model parameter estimates and maximum length and daily egg spawn of danio rerio in conditions with and without hypothetical stressors the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of the deb model used to assess the effects of uranium on caenorhabditis elegans was also conducted goussen et al 2015 in the mentioned study the variances of the model output were estimated by monte carlo integrations and parameter sensitivity was performed using a variance based sobol method nevertheless such analyses are not common enough and seem to be inaccurate in many cases saltelli et al 2019 in this study the sensitivity of the standard deb model to parameter values and the sensitivity of parameters to the perturbation in the data were analyzed the influence of changes of different parameters on model solutions varied between them as well as a perturbation in the dataset on parameters the derivation and analytical solutions closed form solutions of sensitivity coefficients were presented along with numerical and simplified approximation methods of sensitivity analysis sensitivity was specified and quantified this provides a general outline and framework which can be applied for sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation of the whole family of deb models and others this kind of sensitivity analysis can be used a priori in future studies on deb models for instance when one of the deb models is going to be applied in the study on some features of the chosen organism sensitivity analysis can be used to identify parameters that have the highest and lowest impact on state variables therefore further information about parameters that contribute the most to model uncertainty can be collected to reduce this uncertainty and parameters which have a low influence on model uncertainty can be potentially fixed saltelli et al 2019 similarly the time intervals where the data points have a significant or nonsignificant influence on estimates can be identified therefore by analyzing model sensitivity the researcher can consciously design an experiment knowing which of the model parameters have to be estimated and which can be fixed and how many and which data points should be collected with high accuracy it should be noted that analyses a posteriori after data point collection have to be conducted in a different way which is beyond the scope of this study shortly the whole eq 19 has to be used and the term y l t i p y l i 2 y l t i p p m p k cannot be neglected because the difference between estimated values and data can be significant in this study a weighted sum of squares with weights inversely proportional to the variance of each measurement was used aitken 1936 this method allows for estimating parameters from multidimensional datasets the variance inverse multiplied by the sum of squared errors in the loss function provides a dimensionless outcome and therefore the scaled squared errors obtained for each variable can be summed and minimized altogether furthermore the squared errors from different data here growth and reproduction are scaled to their variances and therefore their values are comparable and have a similar influence on the total sum of squared errors compared to the loss functions proposed elsewhere marques et al 2019 where the weight are set to the default value of 1 and can be modified on the basis of insights on accuracy or reliability here the weights have more precise statistical meaning the higher variance of measurements the lower its weight moreover the weights are kept in diagonal matrixes which can simplify the matrix notation in more complex problems eq 15 it should be noted that the variance of data points cannot be determined as the sum of squared error between data points and estimated model values in such a case the same value will appear in the numerator and denominator of the loss function eqs 15 and 16 the variance of data points should be interpreted as a deviation from their mean values and can be obtained by e g repeated measurements of the same variable in constant conditions it should be underlined that the procedure described in this study is focused on the estimation of a few deb model parameters from limited kinetic data mainly growth and reproduction it is worth pointing out that in such cases often only five parameters of the deb model are estimated meer 2006 and their choice depends on the applied parameterization of the model in some cases p m κ p a m e g e m are chosen in others k m g υ l m and r b which is the von bertalanffy growth coefficient r b 1 3 p m κ f e m e g are selected many of the mentioned parameters cannot be measured directly because they do not represent simple measurable processes meer 2006 for example the respiration rate cannot be used to measure maintenance costs because respiration also includes overheads of growth and reproduction despite that compound parameters can be readily estimated meer 2006 this study was focused on the estimation of the deb primary parameters these are because of a few reasons first the correlation between parameters which can be noted for some compound parameters has to be carefully analyzed along with their standard errors and confidence intervals billoir et al 2008 second many different deb models are used for different purposes and it is impossible to present parameter sensitivity analysis for all of them in one paper this study attempts to analyze the sensitivity of the most important primary parameters examine the most important properties of the model and prepare a framework for the further analysis of different kinds of deb models 5 conclusions sensitivity analysis was performed for the weighted sum of squared errors and can be applied to multidimensional estimation problems the sensitivity of the std deb model solution is different for each of the analyzed primary parameters the first order sensitivity coefficients can bring more understanding of the behavior of the model solution which is a good starting point to begin the estimation procedure the sensitivity of parameter estimates to the perturbation in the data depends on the number of data points and is different for each data point this kind of analysis can be conducted a priori in future studies to do deb models to reduce model uncertainty and identify the significance of data points in given time intervals it is recommended to perform a parametric sensitivity

24236,the dynamic energy budget model describes energy and mass balance in living organisms it has found many applications in biological and ecological sciences the model parameters can be connected to a single underlying biological process and this mechanistic approach is helpful in understanding how complex biological systems work however the large number of model parameters makes it difficult to estimate their value especially from data limited only to adult growth and reproduction at abundant food and constant temperature therefore in this study the sensitivity of the model solution to primary parameter values and the sensitivity of parameters to the perturbation in the data were analyzed it was shown that the first order sensitivity coefficients are different for each of the analyzed primary parameters and depend on their values and configuration in the equation the sensitivity of parameters to data changes across analyzed time intervals reaching minima and maxima moreover the influence of each data point is smaller with an increasing number of data points the recognition of the impact of parameters on the model solution as well as the identification of data points with the strongest influence on estimates can be helpful in experimental design and evaluation of the model keywords growth model reproduction model dynamic system estimation numerical methods data availability data available in supporting materials 1 introduction the dynamic energy budget deb theory and model were formulated by kooijman in the 1980s kearney 2021 kooijman 1986a 1986b since then they have been applied widely in biological and ecological sciences i e modeling population dynamics aging assessing the toxicity of chemicals or finding the organizing principles for metabolism and understanding taxon specific patterns jager 2020 jager and zimmer 2012 kearney 2021 kooijman 2010 lika et al 2014 2011 livanou et al 2019 marques et al 2019 2018 the wide range of model applications results from that the deb model describes energy and mass fluxes which are common for all living creatures according to the deb theory organisms consist of structures and reserves structures require energy to be maintained whereas reserves do not energy obtained by an organism through its surface from the environment is stored in reserves the reserves are mobilized and the fixed fraction κ of it is used with priority for somatic maintenance and the rest to increase the volume of structures growth the remaining fraction of mobilized energy 1 κ can be used for maturity maintenance maturation or reproduction reserves play a crucial role in the deb theory they are necessary to include metabolic memory smooth out fluctuation in resource availability and capture changes in the chemical composition of individuals kooijman 2010 on this basis it is possible to build different deb models which can include multiple reserves and structures and be applied to organisms in different life stages distinguished by the ability to obtain energy from the environment or by the ability to reproduce for the isomorph organism with one reserve and one structure both with constant chemical composition the standard deb model is formed the assumption for this model can be found elsewhere kooijman 2010 and the scheme and equations are provided in the following section the deb model describes most of the features of the metabolic organization of living organisms including development and reproduction this comprehensive framework affects the number of parameters that have to be included in the model therefore the number of deb model parameters is higher compared to that of the model parameters used to describe a single process such as the von bertalanffy growth model the monod equation or survival curves in some cases several five or even more deb model parameters must be estimated for control from limited data eg growth and or reproduction only margerit et al 2016 matyja et al 2020 a high number of model parameters and the difficulties obtaining sufficient data for other variables of the deb model i e directly measuring the reserve density and maturity changes make the estimation of parameters complex but not impossible there are several ways to deal with this issue billoir et al 2008 meer 2006 probably the most developed deb model estimation procedures arrived with the add my pet project amp which aims to compare different species in terms of their energy budget to find metabolism organization principles and taxon specific patterns upon which all life is based amp up to today deb model parameters have been determined for more than 3800 species https www bio vu nl thb deb deblab add my pet obviously the more data about the chosen species are available the more constrained the parameters and their estimates seem to be more reliable the data may include information about certain physiological features of organisms such as maximum body weight incubation time weight at birth or puberty zero variate data in amp along with full sets of kinetic data e g growth and reproduction curves feeding respiration as a function of length uni variate data lika et al 2011 moreover the elemental composition and energy balances in different food levels body sizes or ages can also be included lika et al 2011 however in most cases the full data set lika et al 2011 is not available and therefore some additional constraints on parameter values are needed to obtain reliable estimates for example the rules of co variations of parameters among species and their evolutionary and ecological adaptation can be used to generate fixed parameters of generalized animals which can be used as an additional data set in the estimation procedure pseudo data in amp moreover the co variation regularization term can be added to the loss function lika et al 2020 the bijection from zero variate data to model parameters can be used to catch boundaries of parameter space which can be applied as filters in the estimation procedure lika et al 2014 besides the amp project the deb model can be used in different types of studies that aim for instance to test the influences of food availability temperature or toxic substances on the life histories of chosen organisms in such cases most often only the growth and reproduction curves are obtained and the simultaneous estimation of a few parameters under different environmental conditions food toxic substances is often required margerit et al 2016 matyja et al 2020 this paper focuses only on growth and reproduction data and equations and further considerations are related to these issues the deb model parameters can be classified into different groups kooijman 2010 the core deb parameters relate to theory assumptions and control the dynamics of state variables state variables such as scaled length and reserve density cannot be measured directly and therefore the auxiliary theory is necessary to transform the data auxiliary parameters such as shape coefficient and specific densities are used to link state variables with physical measurements and obtain access to core parameters lika et al 2011 in many cases the auxiliary parameters can be determined in separate and dedicated measurements which decreases the number of parameters that have to be estimated from the full system dynamics meer 2006 primary deb model parameters are connected to a single underlying process these parameters can be connected into compound parameters one compound parameter is built from a few primary parameters which are added subtracted multiplied or divided by each other this frequently used method allows to reduce the number of model parameters and obtain reliable estimates of compound parameters thereby facilitating reliable simulations and predictions jager and zimmer 2012 lika et al 2011 however the values of primary parameters can still be unknown some compound parameters can be measured directly in certain experimental conditions which greatly impacts the reliability of estimates by decreasing the number of parameters that have to be estimated simultaneously for instance maximum length which is the cubic root of structural volume at ad libitum food availability not to be confused with ultimate length can be determined from physical measurements and used as a constant value while estimating the remaining model parameters the estimation of model parameters from kinetic data i e growth curve and reproduction in time data can be conducted using among others the nonlinear least square method in this method an error function is minimized to decrease the difference between data points and estimated model values a large number of parameters makes it difficult to find the global minimum of this function whereas multiple local minima can appear marques et al 2019 moreover finding a global minimum still does not guarantee the reliability of estimates whereas parameters can take on non physical values recently some alternative loss functions which are modifications of the sum of squares error have been applied to solve dimension problems for multiple data sets and to deal with asymmetry between under and over estimation lika et al 2020 marques et al 2019 while estimating a large number of parameters good knowledge of the sensitivity of the dynamic system can be helpful baker and rihan 1999 de meester et al 2001 kalaba and spingarn 1980 this includes the sensitivity of the model values to the parameters and the sensitivity of the parameters to the perturbation in the data the first shows how some changes in parameter values will influence the outcome basically the shape and limits of the model curve baker and rihan 1999 de meester et al 2001 kalaba and spingarn 1980 it is recommended to investigate it each time before estimating the parameters of the new model small changes in some parameters can have a huge impact on the model solution whereas in other cases the influence can be negligible moreover this kind of investigation can provide information about the range of parameter values which produces reliable outcomes on the other hand the influence of the quality and quantity of data points on model parameters can help design an experiment choosing the number of measurements performed their frequency and their accuracy analysis of the sensitivity of the parameters to the data can be used to identify data points that have a strong or insignificant impact on the estimates which allows consciously exploring experimental data baker and rihan 1999 de meester et al 2001 kalaba and spingarn 1980 in this study the standard dynamic energy budget model was analyzed the main aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the sensitivity of the deb model solution to the primary parameters and to analyze the sensitivity of parameter estimates to the perturbation in the growth and reproduction data the matlab code was prepared and made available to facilitate the analysis of other models in the future 2 material and methods 2 1 mathematical model the standard deb model can be used to describe the changes in structural length scaled reserves destiny and reproduction of an isomorphic organism the scheme of the model is presented in fig 1 when an organism starts to feed itself after birth b the energy obtained from food is assimilated into the reserve and reserves are mobilized and used in different physiological processes the kappa κ fraction is primarily used to maintain structure and then for growth the rest firstly for maturation of juveniles and after puberty p for reproduction kooijman 2010 the standard deb model for an adult can be given by a set of equations that describe the changes of scaled structural length l scaled reserve density e and reproduction rate r kooijman 2010 1 d d t l k m g 3 e l l t e g 2 d d t e k m g f e l 3 r κ r k m υ e 0 e l 2 e g g l t l k υ h p the scaled length is defined as a structural length divided by the maximum structural length l l l m and the scaled reserve density is a reserve density divided by the maximum reserve density e e e m the parameters used in eqs 1 3 are compound parameters the core model parameters are listed in table 1 and the compound model parameters and how they relate to core parameters are shown in table 2 eqs 1 3 can be rewritten using only primary parameters 4 d d t l p m υ κ p a m 3 e l p t κ p a m e e g υ κ p a m 5 d d t e p m υ κ p a m f e l 6 r κ r e 0 1 κ e l 2 e e g υ κ p a m e g υ p t κ p a m l p a m κ p a m p m 2 k j e h p for the purposes of this study some additional assumptions and simplifications were made to exclude the influence of food availability on the system dynamics the deb organism is considered to be fed ad libitum f 1 and there is no fluctuation in food availability therefore d d t e 0 thus specific searching rate and assimilation efficiency are not considered the temperature is 20 c and constant during the considered time interval the surface specific somatic maintenance cost p t is assumed to be equal to zero and not taken into account in further considerations marques et al 2018 only the adult form of deb organisms is analyzed because only this form can provide reproduction data therefore maturity at birth is not analyzed the parameters controlling life span weibull aging acceleration and gompertz stress coefficient are also not analyzed in addition to survival data the zoom factor was assumed to be 1 z 1 at the end the model takes the form of two equations 7 d d

kalaba and spingarn 1980 9 s k t p y t p p k the function y t p symbolizes the solution of model differential equations for the system of two deb model equations the y t p can be substituted by a

description by pointing to a specific parameter given that p p m υ κ p a m e g κ r e 0 k j e h p t the typical values of parameters in the std deb model for deb organisms at 20 c are given in table 1

a small fraction of p k here δ p k 10 8 p k for each of the analyzed parameters de meester et al 2001 to determine the first order sensitivity coefficient s k changes in time the derivatives with respect to each parameter p k of both model eqs 7 and 8 were calculated and solved numerically with respect to t along with the model equations baker and rihan 1999 de meester et al 2001 eighteen derivatives 2 y l t p t p k and 2 y n t p t p k can be found in the supporting information si the solutions of these equations with respect to t were used to determine the sensitivity of parameters to

baker and rihan 1999 de meester et al 2001 kalaba and spingarn 1980 according to the least squares method the objective error loss function which has to be minimized takes the following form 14 s p y

length and reproduction data w l i i and w n i i are elements of the diagonal matrixes w l and w n of weights of each residual for growth and reproduction respectively and index i denotes each data point the weights can be defined as w i i 1 σ i 2 given that σ i 2 is the variance of certain measurements the use of such weights eliminates the problem of summing residuals expressed in different units weighted sums of squared residuals are dimensionless numbers moreover to simplify further considerations we can assume that variances σ l i 2 of length measurements are equal as well as variances of cumulated reproduction σ n i 2 therefore the diagonal matrixes can be substituted by scalars w l and w n 16 s p y l y n i 1 n w l y l t i p y l i 2 i 1 n w n y n t i p y n i 2 the minimum

from eq 17 eq 18 is a function of y l y n and p y l y n and can be differentiated with respect to growth data y l or reproduction data y n both solutions are obtained analogically and therefore only

and 23 it is possible to determine the influence of data perturbation on certain parameters taking into account the perturbation of all other parameters eqs 22 and 23 can be simplified for the

part of the study 26 s d l k p k y l j and 27 s d n k p k y n j the sensitivity of isolated and not isolated parameters to the perturbation in the data was determined for all nine considered parameters p m υ κ p a m e g κ r e 0 k j e h p the sensitivity of model parameters to the perturbation in the data can also be determined by a simplified procedure the example of it was prepared to illustrate how sensitivity analysis can be used a priori to gain knowledge about model properties and contribute to the experimental design the artificial data were created by solving eqs 7 and 8 numerically in the time interval t 0 3000 with the following steps δ t 100 days using the 4 5 runge kutta method the obtained artificial data set consisted of 31 growth and reproduction data points two model parameters p m and e g were fit using the weighted least squares method eq 16 with weights equal to 1 to the artificial data each of the data points was increased by the value of 0 01 separately and the fitting procedure was repeated in the result 31 sets of estimated parameters were obtained the results were compared to the sensitivity coefficients p y l j and p y n j calculated for p m and e g parameters 2 3 numerical methods the differential model equations and first order sensitivity coefficients y l t p p k and y r t p p k were solved numerically in the time interval t 0

p p k 0 0 determining the sensitivity of parameters to the perturbation in the data p y l j and p y n j requires solving a set of linear equations which involves numerical methods for dealing with an inverse matrix baker and rihan 1999 for a given set of parameters table 1 and artificial data the matrix i 1 n s l t i p s l t t i p s n t i p s n t t i p can be badly conditioned and the system can be sensitive to perturbations the small change in s l t i p or s n t i p can produce a very large change in the solution p y l j and p y n j to deal with this issue the moore penrose pseudoinverse method function pinv in matlab was used to determine p y l j and p y n j the matrix condition was assessed by the reciprocal condition number function rcond in matlab the estimation of p m and e g was conducted by fitting the numerical solution of the set of the model eqs 7 and 8 obtained by the runge kutta 4 5 method to the artificial data using the weighted nonlinear least squares method matyja et al 2021 the error loss function eq 16 was minimized using the nelder mead simplex method lagarias et al 1998 assuming w l w n 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity of the model values to the parameter p the first order sensitivity coefficients s k in the considered time interval for each parameter are shown in fig 2 they are presented along with plots of scaled length and cumulated reproduction to ensure readability of the influence of parameter changes on the different regions of the model curves there was no significant difference between s k values obtained as a derivative eq 11 and using the approximated method eq 13 the influence of parameters on the model solution depends on their own values variables t l n and interactions with each other inside the model equations for instance an increase in the parameter p k s k 0 which is only found in the numerator of the equation will surely increase the rate d y t p d t and therefore the model solutions in the specific region d y t p d t symbolize d y l t p d t or d y n t p d t for d y t p d t 0 the influence of parameters changes on the model solution converges to zero and the cases when d y t p d t 0 are not considered in this study as they are biologically impossible or require specific extension and modification of discussed model e g shrinking kooijman 2010 a good example of a parameter that is located only in the numerator in the growth eq 7 is p m analogically in the case when the parameter is found only in the denominator the modeled rate and solution will decrease see e g e 0 in the reproduction rate eq 8 the interaction between parameters and especially the presence of one parameter in different parts of the equations significantly influences the model analysis the influence of parameter changes on the model solution can be reflected by first order sensitivity coefficients s k without analyzing the form and arrangement of the model equation therefore the presented analysis fig 2 can be used to understand how and in which time interval some changes in primary std deb model parameters can influence the shape of growth and reproduction curves it is known that the higher the absolute value of s k the higher the change in y t p the positive value s k means that an increase in the parameter p k will cause an increase in the model solution y t p whereas a negative s k is responsible for the decrease in the model solution whilst s k depends on time the influence of parameters on the model curve will be different at different time points at t 0 the first order sensitivity coefficients are equal to zero this is because none of the analyzed parameters can influence the initial starting point for the model solution which was fixed in this study in some cases some forcing functions can be applied to increase the freedom of the fitted model the s k in some cases reaches local minima and maxima for example the first order sensitivity coefficient of the parameter p m determined for the growth curve has the highest positive value at t 630 based on the time vector in the runge kutta method this means that an increase in p m will increase scaled length l by the highest value at that time in the case of reproduction data the increase of p m will lower the model solution by the highest value at t 3000 it should be noted that the maxima and minima of s k for the growth curve were noted at similar time points in the range t 560 640 and are provided in table s1 it is worth pointing out that none of the parameters have any influence on the maximum scaled length as its value in the applied model is fixed to 1 the s k values converge to zero whereas the rate d y l t p d t converges to zero and the scaled length l reaches its maximum left side of fig 2 moreover the changes in parameters κ r e 0 k j e h p have no influence on the growth curve as they do not appear in eq 7 in these cases the first order sensitivity coefficients are equal to zero fig 2 the lower the parameter value the higher the maximum s k the comparison of std deb model typical parameters values with maximum s k can be found in table s1 for example the model is more sensitive to changes in κ r rather than to e 0 see fig 2 some exceptions from this rule can be explained by the more sophisticated interaction between parameters especially in the case where one parameter appears in the model equation in a few different configurations moreover some model parameters are raised to the second power which can greatly increase their influence on the solution in summary the value of scaled length l is most sensitive to changes in υ at t 610 and the cumulative reproduction n is most sensitive to changes in k j at t 3000 both l and n are least sensitive to changes in e g 3 2 sensitivity of isolated parameters to perturbation in the data the sensitivity of isolated parameters to perturbation in the data s d k is shown in fig 3 the higher the absolute value of s k the lower the absolute value of s d k this relationship can be seen in eqs 24 and 25 within the sum of squared s k in the denominator kalaba and spingarn 1980 this means when small changes in parameters result in large changes in dependent variables l n the small perturbation of the data points hardly influences the parameters values importantly the sensitivity of isolated parameters to the perturbation in the data depends on the number of data points see eqs 24 and 25 the higher the number of data points the lower the s d when the number of data points increases each point has less influence on the outcome therefore when the measurements are taken often the possible deviation of one of them has little influence on the general outcome the relationship between the number of data points n and the s d k for arbitrarily chosen time points t 1000 2000 is shown in fig s1 this relationship seems to be exponential which leads to the conclusion that increasing the number of measurements to infinity is useless for instance the number of data points higher than 61 does not substantially decrease s d k the sensitivity of parameters to data perturbation is similar in the case of n 61 and n 301 therefore preparing 301 measurements seems to be economically unjustified the same relationship can be seen in fig 3 where the plotted curves for the higher number of data points n are closer to zero it should be noted that in the case of the analyzed std deb model with fixed maximum scaled length the data collected when the changes of growth rate were highest growth curve is most strongly bent have the greatest influence on estimates therefore these data points should be measured with the highest accuracy the reproduction data have the greatest influence on parameter values at the end of the simulation time the explanation of this observation is related to the accumulation of reproductive data the cumulative reproduction n is the sum of offspring produced in a given period therefore each following point is based on all earlier ones the sensitivity of parameters to data points seems to accumulate as well 3 3 sensitivity of parameters to perturbation in the data the more sophisticated analysis comes with the assumption that each of the analyzed parameters can be influenced by each data point the results of the sensitivity analysis of all parameters to the perturbation in the data are presented in fig 4 notably the sensitivity of parameters still depends on the number of data points moreover the patterns of s d k for the growth curve are similar to those determined for isolated parameters however their values and signs in the case of p a m and υ are different figs 3 and 4 moreover parameters κ r e 0 k j e h p are not present in the growth equation and are sensitive to perturbation in growth data see eq 24 in the case of the reproduction curve the sensitivity of all parameters to perturbation in data differs from that determined for the individual isolated parameters fig 3 the s d k changes sign four times inside the considered time interval eqs 22 and 23 show how the s k values are added and multiplied with each other creating a matrix i 1 n s l t i p s l t t i p s n t i p s n t t i p that has to be inverted to determine s d k therefore the influence of data points on cumulative reproduction n does not seem to be intuitive the reciprocal condition number of this matrix was lower than 10 25 for all cases of datasets with a different number of data points n therefore this matrix is badly conditioned and the small changes in s k can generate large changes in s d k it is highlighted that the patterns of s d k for chosen parameters are similar within the growth and reproduction data conducted analysis indicated the existence of cumulative reproduction data points whose perturbations do not influence the model parameters s d k 0 moreover it appears that none of the parameters not only some of them can be influenced by the changes in these data points which can be found on the plots around t 600 1500 and 2700 on the other hand local maxima and minima of s d k appear at similar times for each analyzed parameter this means that there are some n data points that have a larger influence on parameter estimates than others it seems to be reasonable to identify both types of data points in the data set it should also be mentioned that this analysis was performed for a given loss function eq 15 using different loss functions such as those presented elsewhere lika et al 2020 marques et al 2019 can generate different outcomes however this issue is beyond the scope of this study the matlab code used to determine the first order sensitivity coefficients s k and the sensitivity of parameters isolated and not isolated to the perturbation in the data s d k can be found in si in many cases not all deb model parameters are estimated from kinetic data in that cases the simplified procedure which does not involve the determination of s k and s d k can be applied an example of the sensitivity analysis and estimation of two parameters p m and e g was performed and the results of the simulations are shown in fig 5 the artificial data points scale length and cumulative reproduction are plotted at the top of fig 5 below them the sensitivity of two parameters to perturbation in the data s d k is shown at the bottom of fig 5 the results of the simultaneous estimation of two parameters to modified artificial data are presented the estimation was repeated for small modifications of each data point the patterns of s d k match the changes in the estimated parameter values in other words a small perturbation in the data point with the highest absolute value of s d k will result in the highest deviation of estimates interestingly even in the case of only two unknown parameters the pattern of s d k for reproduction data is not trivial it is possible to identify points in which small perturbations will have a large or small influence on estimates for instance perturbation in the cumulative reproduction n measured at t 1400 had the highest influence on p m and n at t 2300 had a negligible one this example directly shows which data points should be measured carefully with high accuracy and which are less important for the estimation procedure here it should be noted that parameters that appear only once in the set of model equations and are multiplied or divided by each other should not be estimated simultaneously even when both parameter values are constrained by certain physical biological or other boundaries in some continuous interval the same result of their multiplication or division can be obtained by infinite combinations of their values for example the same value of the quotient κ r e 0 can be obtained by an infinite number of κ r and e 0 value combinations therefore these two parameters should not be estimated simultaneously from one data set which includes growth and reproduction assuming e 0 is a parameter this also applies to the product k j e h p 4 discussion the main purpose of sensitivity analysis is to assess how the uncertainty of model parameters as varying inputs impacts model performance and therefore to support model calibration verification and simplification pianosi et al 2016 it can be performed by a wide range of distinct methods and is used in many fields such as astronomy social science economics medicine environmental sciences and biology pianosi et al 2016 saltelli et al 2019 for example parameter sensitivity analysis similar to that described in this study was conducted to analyze the bass diffusion model which describes the process of sales growth of new products grasman and kornelis 2019 parameter sensitivity analysis of activated sludge models which describes microbial growth as well as the removal of organic compounds nitrogen and phosphorous was also performed demir and atçı 2021 liwarska bizukojc and biernacki 2010 studies on the sensitivity of the deb model to the parameter values are scarce one example of the influence of changes in parameter values on the debtox reproduction curve was described by billoir et al 2008 however the authors prepared a sensitivity analysis by letting each parameter vary one at a time in realistic ranges and assuming that the remaining ones were fixed at the reference values therefore the analysis took a discrete and not a continuous form the second example can be found in accolla et al 2020 who analyzed the influence of missing datasets on deb model parameter estimates the authors used the estimation method and loss function used in the amp project marques et al 2018 to study the influence of missing datasets on deb model parameter estimates and maximum length and daily egg spawn of danio rerio in conditions with and without hypothetical stressors the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of the deb model used to assess the effects of uranium on caenorhabditis elegans was also conducted goussen et al 2015 in the mentioned study the variances of the model output were estimated by monte carlo integrations and parameter sensitivity was performed using a variance based sobol method nevertheless such analyses are not common enough and seem to be inaccurate in many cases saltelli et al 2019 in this study the sensitivity of the standard deb model to parameter values and the sensitivity of parameters to the perturbation in the data were analyzed the influence of changes of different parameters on model solutions varied between them as well as a perturbation in the dataset on parameters the derivation and analytical solutions closed form solutions of sensitivity coefficients were presented along with numerical and simplified approximation methods of sensitivity analysis sensitivity was specified and quantified this provides a general outline and framework which can be applied for sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation of the whole family of deb models and others this kind of sensitivity analysis can be used a priori in future studies on deb models for instance when one of the deb models is going to be applied in the study on some features of the chosen organism sensitivity analysis can be used to identify parameters that have the highest and lowest impact on state variables therefore further information about parameters that contribute the most to model uncertainty can be collected to reduce this uncertainty and parameters which have a low influence on model uncertainty can be potentially fixed saltelli et al 2019 similarly the time intervals where the data points have a significant or nonsignificant influence on estimates can be identified therefore by analyzing model sensitivity the researcher can consciously design an experiment knowing which of the model parameters have to be estimated and which can be fixed and how many and which data points should be collected with high accuracy it should be noted that analyses a posteriori after data point collection have to be conducted in a different way which is beyond the scope of this study shortly the whole eq 19 has to be used and the term y l t i p y l i 2 y l t i p p m p k cannot be neglected because the difference between estimated values and data can be significant in this study a weighted sum of squares with weights inversely proportional to the variance of each measurement was used aitken 1936 this method allows for estimating parameters from multidimensional datasets the variance inverse multiplied by the sum of squared errors in the loss function provides a dimensionless outcome and therefore the scaled squared errors obtained for each variable can be summed and minimized altogether furthermore the squared errors from different data here growth and reproduction are scaled to their variances and therefore their values are comparable and have a similar influence on the total sum of squared errors compared to the loss functions proposed elsewhere marques et al 2019 where the weight are set to the default value of 1 and can be modified on the basis of insights on accuracy or reliability here the weights have more precise statistical meaning the higher variance of measurements the lower its weight moreover the weights are kept in diagonal matrixes which can simplify the matrix notation in more complex problems eq 15 it should be noted that the variance of data points cannot be determined as the sum of squared error between data points and estimated model values in such a case the same value will appear in the numerator and denominator of the loss function eqs 15 and 16 the variance of data points should be interpreted as a deviation from their mean values and can be obtained by e g repeated measurements of the same variable in constant conditions it should be underlined that the procedure described in this study is focused on the estimation of a few deb model parameters from limited kinetic data mainly growth and reproduction it is worth pointing out that in such cases often only five parameters of the deb model are estimated meer 2006 and their choice depends on the applied parameterization of the model in some cases p m κ p a m e g e m are chosen in others k m g υ l m and r b which is the von bertalanffy growth coefficient r b 1 3 p m κ f e m e g are selected many of the mentioned parameters cannot be measured directly because they do not represent simple measurable processes meer 2006 for example the respiration rate cannot be used to measure maintenance costs because respiration also includes overheads of growth and reproduction despite that compound parameters can be readily estimated meer 2006 this study was focused on the estimation of the deb primary parameters these are because of a few reasons first the correlation between parameters which can be noted for some compound parameters has to be carefully analyzed along with their standard errors and confidence intervals billoir et al 2008 second many different deb models are used for different purposes and it is impossible to present parameter sensitivity analysis for all of them in one paper this study attempts to analyze the sensitivity of the most important primary parameters examine the most important properties of the model and prepare a framework for the further analysis of different kinds of deb models 5 conclusions sensitivity analysis was performed for the weighted sum of squared errors and can be applied to multidimensional estimation problems the sensitivity of the std deb model solution is different for each of the analyzed primary parameters the first order sensitivity coefficients can bring more understanding of the behavior of the model solution which is a good starting point to begin the estimation procedure the sensitivity of parameter estimates to the perturbation in the data depends on the number of data points and is different for each data point this kind of analysis can be conducted a priori in future studies to do deb models to reduce model uncertainty and identify the significance of data points in given time intervals it is recommended to perform a parametric sensitivity

24237,conservation tillage to agricultural fields has been widely used in the loess plateau of china however uncertainties remain regarding the long term effects of this approach on soil carbon dioxide co2 emissions under future climate scenarios we used the pre validated denitrification decomposition dndc model to investigate the effects of no tillage and straw mulch implementation on soil co2 emissions from dry farmland in the loess plateau of china under different future climate scenarios and their dynamic changes based on the baseline period 1971 2019 and climate data 2022 2070 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios for two climate models soil co2 emissions from dry farmland were simulated under four tillage practices ct conventional tillage cts conventional tillage with straw mulch nt no tillage nts no tillage with straw mulch the results showed that future climate change would affect soil co2 emissions of each treatment compared with the baseline period the annual mean co2 emissions of four treatments increased under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 4 scenarios for the two climate models with increases ranging from 5 81 to 56 73 under the rcp4 5 scenario and 24 48 to 68 75 under the rcp8 5 scenario in addition compared with ct and nt treatments the cts and nts treatments with straw mulch had higher annual mean co2 emissions under both climate scenarios while the nt treatment had the lowest further analysis showed that the changes in soil co2 emissions of each treatment under different future climate scenarios were related to the constant changes in annual mean temperature annual precipitation and atmospheric co2 concentration simulation of the long term effects on soil co2 emissions under different tillage practices based on future climate scenarios led to the conclusion that conservation tillage practices together with future changes in temperature precipitation and atmospheric co2 concentrations affect soil co2 emissions while no tillage has potential to mitigate soil co2 emissions from dry farmland in the loess plateau of china under future climate change keywords climate change tillage practices dry farmland co2 emissions dndc model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change mainly characterized by global warming is increasing in its impact on biodiversity ecosystems and related services with an increased incidence of severe weather events such as droughts floods and heat waves mechler et al 2019 naumann et al 2018 melillo e1 al 2014 the two main factors affecting climate change are human activities including fossil fuel use agricultural urban and industrial activities and others and natural factors including earth s orbital change sunlight intensity water cycle in the oceans and atmosphere and others these factors interact to increase the concentration of greenhouse gasses ghg in the atmosphere lorius et al 1990 sathiendrakumar 2003 disrupting the earth s climate and accelerating environmental degradation fahad et al 2021a agriculture is a fundamental production activity that provides food and livelihoods for humans and agricultural soils are an essential source of ghg emissions mainly carbon dioxide co2 nitrous oxide n2o and methane ch4 chen et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 soil co2 emissions are one of the biggest fluxes in the global carbon cycle accounting for approximately 26 of global anthropogenic co2 emissions wei et al 2021 minor changes in soil co2 emissions have a considerable impact on atmospheric co2 concentrations and may constitute considerable positive feedback to the climate system lu et al 2013 however agriculture is a nature based and climate dependent economic sector whose ecosystem processes are strongly regulated by temperature and precipitation wu et al 2020 it can be directly influenced by climate change induced changes in temperature and precipitation contributing to increased carbon c loss from soils and affecting soil c storage as well as atmospheric co2 concentrations jia et al 2021 li et al 2022 poll et al 2013 therefore it is necessary to understand the impact of future climate change on co2 emissions from agricultural soils agricultural soils produce co2 mainly through inter root respiration and microbial decomposition galic et al 2019 tillage an important agricultural management practice affects the distribution and transformation of soil organic carbon soc content aggregate stability water holding capacity and soil temperature by opening or closing air and water exchange pathways between the soil surface and the atmosphere bregaglio et al 2022 lu et al 2016 which in turn changes the dynamics of soil microbial community decomposition of organic matter causing changes in soil co2 emissions kandel et al 2019 neogi et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 no tillage is a conservation oriented management practice with less soil disturbance and can effectively mitigate soil co2 loss in dryland abdalla et al 2016 similarly straw mulch associated with conservation soil tillage systems affects water storage and fertilizer enhancement that can cause significant changes in soil physicochemical properties dai et al 2020 wang et al 2020 which also can affect soil co2 emission processes it was found in a study that no tillage with straw mulch led to higher soil co2 emissions in a dryland agricultural system dong et al 2017 moreover no tillage with straw mulch could decrease soil co2 emissions and enhance economic performance according to another study li et al 2022 it can be seen that there are still uncertainties about the changes in soil co2 emissions caused by these conservation management practices moreover the majority of prior research was based on relatively brief field observations which would not have adequately captured the long term effects and dynamics of tillage and straw mulch on soil co2 emissions because the climate in the future is constantly changing including variations in temperature and precipitation as well as growth in atmospheric co2 concentrations which may induce changes in the impact on soil co2 emissions chen et al 2019 currently predicting and evaluating the long term dynamics of ghg emissions with the help of biogeochemical models is a very effective research avenue azad et al 2020 chen et al 2018 denitrification decomposition dndc model a biogeochemical model has been validated in more than 20 countries since its publication in 1992 li et al 1992 and has been utilized for research soil carbon dynamics optimal management practices ghg emissions and crop yields for all kinds of ecosystems abdalla et al 2010 dietiker et al 2010 chen et al 2018 in contrast to other ecosystems dryland ecosystems are especially susceptible to climate change and human activities due to their fragility and low stability dai 2013 li et al 2020 in the relatively arid northwest of china the loess plateau is one of the more significant geographical regions it plays a vital role in the biogeochemical c cycle and climate change on a global scale wang et al 2015 more than 70 of crops depend on rainfed in this region which is vulnerable to climate change lu et al 2016 for this reason the length of dry spells and the frequency of erratic precipitation events have varied more markedly in the region li et al 2010 while drought causes crops to minimize water consumption resulting in stomatal closure and lower co2 uptake affecting crop productivity calleja cabrera et al 2020 fahad et al 2021b in recent years the dndc model has frequently been employed to anticipate and assess the change in ghg emissions soc and yields under future climate change in arid agricultural regions of china chen et al 2015 2019 jia et al 2021 yu et al 2017 however less research explored the long term dynamics of soil co2 emissions from dry farmland in the loess plateau of china under different tillage practices based on future climate scenarios in addition there are distinct variances in the future climatic predictions by various climate models liu et al 2017 piao et al 2010 which lead to differences in the simulation of future soil co2 emissions by the dndc model abdalla et al 2014 yu et al 2018 therefore diverse climate models should be considered when performing studies on future projections based on the future climate prediction data of two climate models we used the validated dndc model to simulate soil co2 emissions under four tillage practices ct conventional tillage cts conventional tillage with straw mulch nt no tillage and nts no tillage with straw mulch from dry farmland in the loess plateau of china the objectives of this study were to 1 predict the dynamics of soil co2 emissions from dry farmland under four tillage practices based on different climate scenarios 2 assess the effects of future climate change on soil co2 emissions from dry farmland under four tillage practices and 3 explore whether conservation tillage practices can mitigate the effects of climate change on soil co2 emissions from dry farmland 2 material and methods 2 1 description of the field experiment site the experiment was implemented for two years 2018 2019 in anjiapo village fengxiang town anding district dingxi city gansu province 104 23 24 e 35 34 48 n a typical dry farmland area on loess plateau of china the area is sunny with a large temperature difference between day and night and the annual mean sunshine time exceeds 2400 h during the experimental period the annual mean temperature and precipitation were 7 38 c and 482 40 mm respectively the soil is made of loess and has a sandy loam texture the soil bulk density was 1 27 g cm 3 the soil organic carbon content was 6 21 g kg 1 the total nitrogen content was 0 61 g kg 1 and the total phosphorus content was 0 45 g kg 1 2 2 field experimental design the experiment was conducted in a randomized complete group design with four tillage practices conventional tillage ct conventional tillage with straw mulch cts no tillage nt and no tillage with straw mulch nts each treatment was repeated three times and there were 12 sample plots in total with the area of each plot being 4 m 6 m the descriptions of the sample plots are shown in table 1 we selected the local standing spring wheat dingxi 42 as the experimental variety approved number gansu approved wheat 2 014 004 which was sown at the end of march and harvested at the beginning of august each year the base fertilizer was 105 kg ha 1 urea and 105 kg ha 1 p2o5 each plot was sown at 187 50 kg ha 1 with a row spacing of 25 cm weeds were removed from the plots during planting using glyphosate 30 herbicide with no irrigation measures and rainfed only in order to prevent marginal effects between plots the sample plots were separated from each other by a 0 50 m wide barrier strip all other field management and conservation measures were in accordance with local farming practices and the selection of farmland for the experiment site and all studies were in accordance with relevant institutional national and international norms and legislation 2 3 gas sampling and flux measurements the static dark chamber method was used for gas sampling the static chamber consisted of two parts the chamber body 50 cm 50 cm 50 cm and the base which was covered with insulation material and equipped with a small fan and a temperature sensor inside forty eight hours before sampling the base of the sampling chamber was inserted into the experimental field to a depth of about 10 cm during sampling the base was kept stationary in the experimental field to reduce the disturbance to the crop and the soil interior in addition during sample collection the sampling chamber and the base were sealed by the fp2300 type sealing tape and the right angle clamp with spring figs 1 and 2 the field monitoring began in january 2018 with a sampling of gas emissions from wheat fields every 15 days sampling was conducted between 9 00 am and 11 00 am after the static chamber was closed for 0 9 18 27 and 36 min the gas in the chamber was extracted with a 100 ml well sealed plastic syringe and injected into a 0 1 l gas sampling bag with aluminum foil composite film for storage after the sampling the samples were returned to the laboratory and the gas emission concentrations were measured using the yimeng a90 gas chromatograph within one week the gas emission fluxes were calculated according to the formula 1 1 f d c d t m v p p 0 t 0 t h where f is the gas emission flux mg m 2 h 1 and dc dt refers to the slope of the regression curve of the target gas concentration in the static chamber with time change at the sampling time m denotes the molar mass of the measured gas g mol 1 and v

gcms are widely considered to be the most acceptable model for studying climate change but the magnitude of meteorological factor changes under different gcm scenarios is uncertain nie et al 2019 the multi scenario multi model china future climate projection dataset pan et al 2020 provided by the national tibetan plateau science data center http data tpdc ac cn based on the regcm4 6 model for regional dynamical downscaling of different carbon emission concentration scenarios from multiple gcms to obtain multiple sets of china future climate data therefore in this study the future climate projection data under two representative concentration path scenarios rcps table 2 from two gcms table 3 in the above dataset for soil co2 emission simulation 2 5 the dndc model the dndc model is a process mechanism model that integrates biogeochemical factors and processes associated with c and nitrogen n cycles and aims to anticipate the interactions and effects of terrestrial ecosystems human activity and climate change li et al 1997 there are two major components to the model 1 a sub model of soil climate crop growth and organic matter decomposition which simulates soil temperature moisture ph redox potential eh and matrix concentration distribution driven by ecological factors 2 a sub model of nitrification denitrification and fermentation which simulate plant soil emissions of n2o ch4 co2 and other gasses these six sub models transmit information to each other in daily steps closely integrating crop growth with soil biogeochemistry and climate components and simulating c and n cycles in terrestrial ecosystems in a relatively complete range deng et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 researchers borrowed ideas equations and parameters from various models to create the dndc model for example the ncsoil model created by molina et al molina et al 1983 was used to explore the structure of the soil organic matter som pool while the denitrification sequence was extracted from the closed system model developed by leffelaar et al leffelar and wessel 1988 in addition the hydraulic conductivity equation from a model developed by clapp et al clapp and hornberger 1978 these equations are relatively simple but hundreds of equations are linked and interact to achieve various nonlinear processes in ecosystems giltrap et al 2010 2 6 constructing site simulations the dndc model requires input of meteorological data soil data and crop management data at the site to simulate soil co2 emissions under different tillage practices in this paper soil co2 emissions were simulated for the baseline period 1971 2019 and the future period 2022 2070 in the experiment site for the simulation of the period 1971 2019 we used daily meteorological data from the meteorological monitoring station in the experiment site including daily maximum air temperature daily maximum air temperature and daily precipitation for the simulation of the period 2022 2070 daily meteorological data from the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios of the canems2 and hadgem2 es models were selected including daily maximum air temperature daily maximum air temperature and daily precipitation considering the variation of atmospheric co2 concentration the atmospheric co2 concentration in 1971 was set to 334 38 ppm with a constant increase rate of 1 58 ppm year 1 for the simulation of future climate scenarios the atmospheric co2 concentration was 417 26 ppm and 428 82 ppm under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios in 2022 respectively and 514 70 ppm and 707 70 ppm in 2070 respectively ipcc 2013 nie et al 2019 furthermore the model soil and crop management parameters were set based on experimental data from 2018 to 2019 2 7 data processing in this study we used arcgis 10 2 to extract daily meteorological data from 2022 to 2070 and used this software to map the experiment site microsoft excel 2021 was used to summarize and organize the data spss 24 0 software to analyze the data and origin 2021 software to make graphs 3 results and analysis 3 1 dndc model verification based on the field experimental data our team has previously used the calibrated dndc model to simulate the soil co2 emissions from dry crop spring wheat fields under four tillage practices ct cts nt and nts from 2018 to 2019 we conducted a correlation analysis between the simulated and measured values and further verified the model s adaptability using evaluation indicators rmse me the results showed that the dndc model could better simulate the soil co2 emissions under four tillage practices yao et al 2021 3 2 changes in temperature and precipitation under different climate scenarios compared with the baseline period 1971 2019 the annual mean temperature and precipitation from 2022 to 2070 under both climate scenarios for two climate models are shown in fig 3 as can be seen in fig 3 the annual mean temperature of the canems2 model is significantly higher than that of the hadgem2 es model under both scenarios and the annual mean temperature under the rcp8 5 scenario of both models is significantly higher than that of the baseline period however there is no significant difference between the annual mean precipitation of the two models under both scenarios but both are significantly higher than the baseline period 3 3 model results of soil co2 emissions under different climate scenarios the simulation results of the dndc model showed that future climate change would affect soil co2 emissions under four tillage practices fig 4 it can be observed from fig 4 that under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios of the two climate models the annual mean co2 emissions of the four treatments were significantly different from the baseline period and all of them increased under the rcp4 5 scenario of the canems2 model fig 5 the annual mean co2 emissions of the four treatments ct cts nt and nts increased by 47 64 27 91 22 48 and 5 81 respectively under the rcp8 5 scenario they increased by 61 74 57 93 64 96 and 27 58 respectively under the rcp4 5 scenario of the hadgem2 es model fig 5 the annual mean co2 emissions of the four treatments ct cts nt and nts increased by 53 63 50 56 56 73 and 18 21 respectively under the rcp8 5 scenario they increased by 65 62 60 35 68 75 and 24 48 respectively we also found that no matter in the baseline period or under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios of the two climate models the cts and nts treatments with straw mulch had higher annual mean co2 emissions compared to the ct and nt treatments in addition the nt treatment had the lowest annual mean co2 emissions of the four treatments based on the two climate models the interannual variation of soil co2 emissions under four tillage practices predicted by the dndc model from 2022 to 2070 showed different results fig 6 nevertheless the relatively consistent was that co2 emissions from the four treatments were significantly higher under the rcp8 5 scenario than under the rcp4 5 scenario in the canems2 model the co2 emissions of the nts treatment showed an increasing trend year by year in both scenarios the other three treatments showed an increasing trend overall but there were significant fluctuations in contrast in the hadgem2 es model the co2 emissions of all four treatments showed an increasing year to year trend under both scenarios with less fluctuation similarly based on the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios of the two climate models the correlation analysis of soil co2 emissions with annual mean temperature annual precipitation and atmospheric co2 concentration under four tillage practices predicted by the dndc model from 2022 to 2070 had different results table 4 under the rcp4 5 scenario of the canems2 model the co2 emissions of ct and nt have a notable positive association with annual precipitation and atmospheric co2 concentration p 0 01 in contrast nts has a notable correlation with annual mean temperature and atmospheric co2 concentration and there was a notable positive association between cts and the three p 0 05 p 0 01 under the rcp8 5 scenario the co2 emissions of ct cts and nt were significantly positively correlated with annual mean temperature annual precipitation and atmospheric co2 concentration p 0 01 in contrast nts has significantly correlated with annual mean temperature and atmospheric co2 concentration p 0 01 under the two scenarios of the hadgem2 es model the co2 emissions of the four tillage practices were all notably positively correlated with the annual mean temperature and atmospheric co2 concentration p 0 01 but not notably correlated with the annual precipitation these suggest that the changes in soil co2 emissions for each treatment under future climate scenarios are the result of the combination of constantly changing temperature precipitation and atmospheric co2 concentrations 4 discussion temperature and precipitation are vital regulators of terrestrial ecosystem processes both of which can alter soil microclimate and thus affect ghg emissions liu et al 2016 yang et al 2022 since abiotic variables like temperature and moisture can regulate humus and crop residue mineralization processes climate change may directly affect soil carbon export alvarez and alvarez 2001 moreover climate change related increases in temperature can affect microbial activity and soil carbon stocks in various ways through direct or indirect mechanisms which can also impact soil co2 emissions flanagan et al 2013 in this study based on the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios of the two climate models soil co2 emissions of the four tillage practices predicted by the dndc model from 2022 to 2070 showed different results in the interannual variability fig 6 nevertheless the relatively consistent was that the co2 emissions of the four tillage practices under the rcp8 5 scenario were significantly higher than those under the rcp4 5 scenario which may be related to the increased temperatures in the climate scenario we found that in both climate models the annual mean temperature from 2022 to 2070 under the rcp8 5 scenario is higher than that under the rcp4 5 scenario fig 3 and the annual increase trend is more significant than the rcp4 5 scenario figs 7 and 8 furthermore the correlation analysis revealed a highly significant positive correlation between the annual mean soil co2 emissions of the four tillage practices and the annual mean temperature of the rcp8 5 scenario indicating that soil co2 emissions increase with temperature which is consistent with previous findings lu et al 2013 schlesinger and andrews 2000 at the same time numerous field trials have shown that warming can contribute to co2 emissions from maize wheat and soybean fields wang et al 2019 wu et al 2020 because relatively small temperature increases when carbon availability and enzymatic activity are not constrained directly stimulate soil microbial activity leading to substantial ecosystem co2 loss to the atmosphere conant et al 2011 in dry and semi arid areas precipitation regulates ecological activities it can influence microbial activity and organic matter mineralization by regulating soil water content thereby affecting soil co2 emissions chu et al 2022 wang et al 2015 relevant research has demonstrated that changes in soil respiration are positively linked with changes in soil moisture in most water limited ecosystems as a result an increase in precipitation typically enhances soil respiration and conversely can decrease it liu et al 2016 wu et al 2011 in this study based on the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios of the canems2 model the dndc model simulated soil co2 emissions for the ct cts and nt treatments fluctuated wildly in interannual variation with significant low peaks fig 6 as shown in fig 7 the precipitation in 2035 308 57 mm is significantly lower than the other years under the rcp4 5 scenario while the co2 emissions of the three treatments in that year are significantly lower fig 6 according to the correlation analysis table 4 a notable positive association p 0 01 between co2 emissions and annual precipitation for these three treatments it can be seen that the fluctuations in co2 emissions were related to precipitation wang et al 2011 also found that annual soil co2 emissions from summer maize croplands increased with increasing precipitation based on dndc model simulations furthermore in our study co2 emissions from the four tillage practices simulated using the dndc model were not significantly correlated with annual precipitation based on the hadgem2 es model climate scenario table 4 but were significantly correlated with annual mean temperature and the interannual variation in emissions was more stable with less fluctuation fig 6 this may be because current precipitation is not a limiting factor so co2 emissions are more sensitive to changes in mean annual temperature wang et al 2011 in addition to temperature and precipitation atmospheric co2 concentrations are constantly increasing under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios which also affects soil c and n cycles gorissen 1995 polley et al 2011 including the generation of n2o ch4 co2 and their emissions lam et al 2011 van groenigen et al 2011 drake et al 2016 have found that root and rhizome respiration is enhanced with increasing co2 concentrations leading to enhanced soil respiration in addition root production increases under elevated atmospheric co2 may result in accelerated root turnover and increased input of root secretions into the soil which would boost microbial respiration kou et al 2007 smith et al 2013 also discovered that higher co2 concentrations boost plant biomass and may encourage soil respiration by improving the respiration of roots which the dndc model predicted yu et al 2018 observed that plant biomass and soil respiration increased with rising co2 concentrations in both plastic and non plastic mulch treatments in line with previous findings our study also found a significant positive correlation p 0 01 between co2 emissions and atmospheric co2 concentration for all four tillage practices under different climate scenarios which indicated that changes in atmospheric co2 concentration would impact soil co2 emissions we also found that the dndc model simulations under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios of both climate models indicated that the nt treatment had the lowest annual mean co2 emissions from 2022 to 2070 compared to the other treatments because nt can reduce the mineralization rate caused by soil disturbance and increase the stability of soil aggregates leading to some reduction in soil co2 emissions farhate et al 2019 shahidi et al 2014 dendooven et al 2012 also concluded that tillage stimulates co2 emissions while the absence of tillage in conservation agriculture ca hinders the decomposition of organic matter to some extent in addition previous studies have also investigated the effect of cover crop residues on soil co2 emissions oorts et al al 2007 found that under no tillage covering the soil surface with crop residues led to an increase in soil co2 emissions and tang et al al 2013 showed that winter cover crops have a beneficial effect on soil organic carbon sequestration and can strongly influence soil co2 emissions abdalla et al al 2014 concluded that the predicted accumulation of co2 c was statistically higher p 0 05 in the reduced tillage with mustard mulch treatment rt cc treatment compared to conventional tillage ct while the increase in soil respiration was likely driven by the higher carbon input from cover crops zhang et al 2019 found that straw mulch increased soil respiration in maize farmland consistent with the results of previous studies our results showed that annual mean soil co2 emissions of the cts and nts treatments with straw mulch were higher than ct and nt treatments indicating that straw mulch can increase soil co2 emissions because straw mulch can improve soil physical properties and nutrients and increase soil organic and reactive carbon fractions while changes in these parameters will affect the structure of the soil microbial community dai et al 2020 wang et al 2020 prompting rapid microbial decomposition of carbon in straw and accelerating som mineralization leading to enhanced soil respiration and significant co2 emissions li et al 2022 furthermore straw exposed directly to the soil surface can also release co2 through aerobic mineralization zhao et al 2016 in addition we found that the dndc model showed different results for the simulation of soil co2 emissions from the four tillage practices figs 5 and 6 which may be related to future climate differences under different climate models abdalla et al 2014 used the dndc model to simulate soil respiration in conventional and reduced tillage systems under future scenarios andfound that in the clm4 gcm3 1 model soil respiration would decrease by 4 8 and increase by 3 6 while in the clm4 hadgem2 es model soil respiration would decrease by 3 14 and increase by 10 12 respectively yu et al 2018 assessed the effects of ground cover on soil respiration and plant biomass based on three future climate scenarios from five climate models and found that soil respiration predicted by the dndc model in the no cover treatment showed different results as a result future studies of soil ghg emissions should consider climate data from different sources in this study there is a certain degree of uncertainty in the predictions and results of changes in soil co2 emission dynamics from dry farmland in the loess plateau of china from 2022 to 2070 mainly because 1 the dndc model has some bias in the simulation of co2 emissions at a single time point yao et al 2021 2 in the simulation process soil parameters were based on the conditions of the experiment site without considering its specific changes in the future climate change process 3 climate change is not a simple linear process and there are uncertainties in the simulation of any climate scenario 4 this study only considered the influence of future climate and management measures on soil co2 emissions not a benefit analysis in conjunction with crop yields therefore confirming the interaction and impact of future climate change and management measures on agricultural soil ghg emissions and crop yields at regional scales is a crucial consideration for future assessment and scientific formulation of high yield and low carbon management measures for dry farmland 5 conclusion based on different climate scenarios this study completed the assessment of the long term dynamic changes of soil co2 emissions from dry farmland spring wheat in the loess plateau of china under different tillage practices using the dndc model the results of the research showed that 1 under different climate scenarios soil co2 emissions of the four tillage practices increased and the emissions under the rcp8 5 scenario were significantly higher than that under the rcp4 5 scenario 2 under different climate scenarios the application of straw mulch on top of conventional tillage and no tillage significantly increased soil co2 emissions by contrast no tillage had the lowest annual mean co2 emissions 3 under the influence of tillage measures changes in soil co2 emissions from dry farmland in the future are also the result of the combined effects of changing temperature precipitation and atmospheric co2 concentration therefore we conclude that no tillage may be an effective measure to mitigate the impact of future climate change on soil co2 emissions from dry farmland in the loess plateau of china however although our simulation predictions suggest that no tillage can reduce soil co2 emissions under different climate scenarios the predictions should be verified by field experiment data in addition this study is currently based on simulations at the point locations only and the impact of future climate change on regional scale agricultural soil co2 emission needs to be further studied credit authorship contribution statement yao yao investigation formal analysis writing original draft guang

24237,conservation tillage to agricultural fields has been widely used in the loess plateau of china however uncertainties remain regarding the long term effects of this approach on soil carbon dioxide co2 emissions under future climate scenarios we used the pre validated denitrification decomposition dndc model to investigate the effects of no tillage and straw mulch implementation on soil co2 emissions from dry farmland in the loess plateau of china under different future climate scenarios and their dynamic changes based on the baseline period 1971 2019 and climate data 2022 2070 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios for two climate models soil co2 emissions from dry farmland were simulated under four tillage practices ct conventional tillage cts conventional tillage with straw mulch nt no tillage nts no tillage with straw mulch the results showed that future climate change would affect soil co2 emissions of each treatment compared with the baseline period the annual mean co2 emissions of four treatments increased under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 4 scenarios for the two climate models with increases ranging from 5 81 to 56 73 under the rcp4 5 scenario and 24 48 to 68 75 under the rcp8 5 scenario in addition compared with ct and nt treatments the cts and nts treatments with straw mulch had higher annual mean co2 emissions under both climate scenarios while the nt treatment had the lowest further analysis showed that the changes in soil co2 emissions of each treatment under different future climate scenarios were related to the constant changes in annual mean temperature annual precipitation and atmospheric co2 concentration simulation of the long term effects on soil co2 emissions under different tillage practices based on future climate scenarios led to the conclusion that conservation tillage practices together with future changes in temperature precipitation and atmospheric co2 concentrations affect soil co2 emissions while no tillage has potential to mitigate soil co2 emissions from dry farmland in the loess plateau of china under future climate change keywords climate change tillage practices dry farmland co2 emissions dndc model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change mainly characterized by global warming is increasing in its impact on biodiversity ecosystems and related services with an increased incidence of severe weather events such as droughts floods and heat waves mechler et al 2019 naumann et al 2018 melillo e1 al 2014 the two main factors affecting climate change are human activities including fossil fuel use agricultural urban and industrial activities and others and natural factors including earth s orbital change sunlight intensity water cycle in the oceans and atmosphere and others these factors interact to increase the concentration of greenhouse gasses ghg in the atmosphere lorius et al 1990 sathiendrakumar 2003 disrupting the earth s climate and accelerating environmental degradation fahad et al 2021a agriculture is a fundamental production activity that provides food and livelihoods for humans and agricultural soils are an essential source of ghg emissions mainly carbon dioxide co2 nitrous oxide n2o and methane ch4 chen et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 soil co2 emissions are one of the biggest fluxes in the global carbon cycle accounting for approximately 26 of global anthropogenic co2 emissions wei et al 2021 minor changes in soil co2 emissions have a considerable impact on atmospheric co2 concentrations and may constitute considerable positive feedback to the climate system lu et al 2013 however agriculture is a nature based and climate dependent economic sector whose ecosystem processes are strongly regulated by temperature and precipitation wu et al 2020 it can be directly influenced by climate change induced changes in temperature and precipitation contributing to increased carbon c loss from soils and affecting soil c storage as well as atmospheric co2 concentrations jia et al 2021 li et al 2022 poll et al 2013 therefore it is necessary to understand the impact of future climate change on co2 emissions from agricultural soils agricultural soils produce co2 mainly through inter root respiration and microbial decomposition galic et al 2019 tillage an important agricultural management practice affects the distribution and transformation of soil organic carbon soc content aggregate stability water holding capacity and soil temperature by opening or closing air and water exchange pathways between the soil surface and the atmosphere bregaglio et al 2022 lu et al 2016 which in turn changes the dynamics of soil microbial community decomposition of organic matter causing changes in soil co2 emissions kandel et al 2019 neogi et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 no tillage is a conservation oriented management practice with less soil disturbance and can effectively mitigate soil co2 loss in dryland abdalla et al 2016 similarly straw mulch associated with conservation soil tillage systems affects water storage and fertilizer enhancement that can cause significant changes in soil physicochemical properties dai et al 2020 wang et al 2020 which also can affect soil co2 emission processes it was found in a study that no tillage with straw mulch led to higher soil co2 emissions in a dryland agricultural system dong et al 2017 moreover no tillage with straw mulch could decrease soil co2 emissions and enhance economic performance according to another study li et al 2022 it can be seen that there are still uncertainties about the changes in soil co2 emissions caused by these conservation management practices moreover the majority of prior research was based on relatively brief field observations which would not have adequately captured the long term effects and dynamics of tillage and straw mulch on soil co2 emissions because the climate in the future is constantly changing including variations in temperature and precipitation as well as growth in atmospheric co2 concentrations which may induce changes in the impact on soil co2 emissions chen et al 2019 currently predicting and evaluating the long term dynamics of ghg emissions with the help of biogeochemical models is a very effective research avenue azad et al 2020 chen et al 2018 denitrification decomposition dndc model a biogeochemical model has been validated in more than 20 countries since its publication in 1992 li et al 1992 and has been utilized for research soil carbon dynamics optimal management practices ghg emissions and crop yields for all kinds of ecosystems abdalla et al 2010 dietiker et al 2010 chen et al 2018 in contrast to other ecosystems dryland ecosystems are especially susceptible to climate change and human activities due to their fragility and low stability dai 2013 li et al 2020 in the relatively arid northwest of china the loess plateau is one of the more significant geographical regions it plays a vital role in the biogeochemical c cycle and climate change on a global scale wang et al 2015 more than 70 of crops depend on rainfed in this region which is vulnerable to climate change lu et al 2016 for this reason the length of dry spells and the frequency of erratic precipitation events have varied more markedly in the region li et al 2010 while drought causes crops to minimize water consumption resulting in stomatal closure and lower co2 uptake affecting crop productivity calleja cabrera et al 2020 fahad et al 2021b in recent years the dndc model has frequently been employed to anticipate and assess the change in ghg emissions soc and yields under future climate change in arid agricultural regions of china chen et al 2015 2019 jia et al 2021 yu et al 2017 however less research explored the long term dynamics of soil co2 emissions from dry farmland in the loess plateau of china under different tillage practices based on future climate scenarios in addition there are distinct variances in the future climatic predictions by various climate models liu et al 2017 piao et al 2010 which lead to differences in the simulation of future soil co2 emissions by the dndc model abdalla et al 2014 yu et al 2018 therefore diverse climate models should be considered when performing studies on future projections based on the future climate prediction data of two climate models we used the validated dndc model to simulate soil co2 emissions under four tillage practices ct conventional tillage cts conventional tillage with straw mulch nt no tillage and nts no tillage with straw mulch from dry farmland in the loess plateau of china the objectives of this study were to 1 predict the dynamics of soil co2 emissions from dry farmland under four tillage practices based on different climate scenarios 2 assess the effects of future climate change on soil co2 emissions from dry farmland under four tillage practices and 3 explore whether conservation tillage practices can mitigate the effects of climate change on soil co2 emissions from dry farmland 2 material and methods 2 1 description of the field experiment site the experiment was implemented for two years 2018 2019 in anjiapo village fengxiang town anding district dingxi city gansu province 104 23 24 e 35 34 48 n a typical dry farmland area on loess plateau of china the area is sunny with a large temperature difference between day and night and the annual mean sunshine time exceeds 2400 h during the experimental period the annual mean temperature and precipitation were 7 38 c and 482 40 mm respectively the soil is made of loess and has a sandy loam texture the soil bulk density was 1 27 g cm 3 the soil organic carbon content was 6 21 g kg 1 the total nitrogen content was 0 61 g kg 1 and the total phosphorus content was 0 45 g kg 1 2 2 field experimental design the experiment was conducted in a randomized complete group design with four tillage practices conventional tillage ct conventional tillage with straw mulch cts no tillage nt and no tillage with straw mulch nts each treatment was repeated three times and there were 12 sample plots in total with the area of each plot being 4 m 6 m the descriptions of the sample plots are shown in table 1 we selected the local standing spring wheat dingxi 42 as the experimental variety approved number gansu approved wheat 2 014 004 which was sown at the end of march and harvested at the beginning of august each year the base fertilizer was 105 kg ha 1 urea and 105 kg ha 1 p2o5 each plot was sown at 187 50 kg ha 1 with a row spacing of 25 cm weeds were removed from the plots during planting using glyphosate 30 herbicide with no irrigation measures and rainfed only in order to prevent marginal effects between plots the sample plots were separated from each other by a 0 50 m wide barrier strip all other field management and conservation measures were in accordance with local farming practices and the selection of farmland for the experiment site and all studies were in accordance with relevant institutional national and international norms and legislation 2 3 gas sampling and flux measurements the static dark chamber method was used for gas sampling the static chamber consisted of two parts the chamber body 50 cm 50 cm 50 cm and the base which was covered with insulation material and equipped with a small fan and a temperature sensor inside forty eight hours before sampling the base of the sampling chamber was inserted into the experimental field to a depth of about 10 cm during sampling the base was kept stationary in the experimental field to reduce the disturbance to the crop and the soil interior in addition during sample collection the sampling chamber and the base were sealed by the fp2300 type sealing tape and the right angle clamp with spring figs 1 and 2 the field monitoring began in january 2018 with a sampling of gas emissions from wheat fields every 15 days sampling was conducted between 9 00 am and 11 00 am after the static chamber was closed for 0 9 18 27 and 36 min the gas in the chamber was extracted with a 100 ml well sealed plastic syringe and injected into a 0 1 l gas sampling bag with aluminum foil composite film for storage after the sampling the samples were returned to the laboratory and the gas emission concentrations were measured using the yimeng a90 gas chromatograph within one week the gas emission fluxes were calculated according to the formula 1 1 f d c d t m v p p 0 t 0 t h where f is the gas emission flux mg m 2 h 1 and dc dt refers to the slope of the regression curve of the target gas concentration in the static chamber with time change at the sampling time m denotes the molar mass of the measured gas g mol 1 and v refers to the molar volume of the gas at the standard state ml mol 1 p0 and t0 represent the ideal gas standard pressure and temperature p and t represent the actual static chamber pressure and temperature at the time of sampling and h indicates the height of the gas chamber within the static chamber wei et al 2014 2 4 climate scenarios the climate data derived from global circulation models gcms are widely considered to be the most acceptable model for studying climate change but the magnitude of meteorological factor changes under different gcm scenarios is uncertain nie et al 2019 the multi scenario multi model china future climate projection dataset pan et al 2020 provided by the national tibetan plateau science data center http data tpdc ac cn based on the regcm4 6 model for regional dynamical downscaling of different carbon emission concentration scenarios from multiple gcms to obtain multiple sets of china future climate data therefore in this study the future climate projection data under two representative concentration path scenarios rcps table 2 from two gcms table 3 in the above dataset for soil co2 emission simulation 2 5 the dndc model the dndc model is a process mechanism model that integrates biogeochemical factors and processes associated with c and nitrogen n cycles and aims to anticipate the interactions and effects of terrestrial ecosystems human activity and climate change li et al 1997 there are two major components to the model 1 a sub model of soil climate crop growth and organic matter decomposition which simulates soil temperature moisture ph redox potential eh and matrix concentration distribution driven by ecological factors 2 a sub model of nitrification denitrification and fermentation which simulate plant soil emissions of n2o ch4 co2 and other gasses these six sub models transmit information to each other in daily steps closely integrating crop growth with soil biogeochemistry and climate components and simulating c and n cycles in terrestrial ecosystems in a relatively complete range deng et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 researchers borrowed ideas equations and parameters from various models to create the dndc model for example the ncsoil model created by molina et al molina et al 1983 was used to explore the structure of the soil organic matter som pool while the denitrification sequence was extracted from the closed system model developed by leffelaar et al leffelar and wessel 1988 in addition the hydraulic conductivity equation from a model developed by clapp et al clapp and hornberger 1978 these equations are relatively simple but hundreds of equations are linked and interact to achieve various nonlinear processes in ecosystems giltrap et al 2010 2 6 constructing site simulations the dndc model requires input of meteorological data soil data and crop management data at the site to simulate soil co2 emissions under different tillage practices in this paper soil co2 emissions were simulated for the baseline period 1971 2019 and the future period 2022 2070 in the experiment site for the simulation of the period 1971 2019 we used daily meteorological data from the meteorological monitoring station in the experiment site including daily maximum air temperature daily maximum air temperature and daily precipitation for the simulation of the period 2022 2070 daily meteorological data from the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios of the canems2 and hadgem2 es models were selected including daily maximum air temperature daily maximum air temperature and daily precipitation considering the variation of atmospheric co2 concentration the atmospheric co2 concentration in 1971 was set to 334 38 ppm with a constant increase rate of 1 58 ppm year 1 for the simulation of future climate scenarios the atmospheric co2 concentration was 417 26 ppm and 428 82 ppm under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios in 2022 respectively and 514 70 ppm and 707 70 ppm in 2070 respectively ipcc 2013 nie et al 2019 furthermore the model soil and crop management parameters were set based on experimental data from 2018 to 2019 2 7 data processing in this study we used arcgis 10 2 to extract daily meteorological data from 2022 to 2070 and used this software to map the experiment site microsoft excel 2021 was used to summarize and organize the data spss 24 0 software to analyze the data and origin 2021 software to make graphs 3 results and analysis 3 1 dndc model verification based on the field experimental data our team has previously used the calibrated dndc model to simulate the soil co2 emissions from dry crop spring wheat fields under four tillage practices ct cts nt and nts from 2018 to 2019 we conducted a correlation analysis between the simulated and measured values and further verified the model s adaptability using evaluation indicators rmse me the results showed that the dndc model could better simulate the soil co2 emissions under four tillage practices yao et al 2021 3 2 changes in temperature and precipitation under different climate scenarios compared with the baseline period 1971 2019 the annual mean temperature and precipitation from 2022 to 2070 under both climate scenarios for two climate models are shown in fig 3 as can be seen in fig 3 the annual mean temperature of the canems2 model is significantly higher than that of the hadgem2 es model under both scenarios and the annual mean temperature under the rcp8 5 scenario of both models is significantly higher than that of the baseline period however there is no significant difference between the annual mean precipitation of the two models under both scenarios but both are significantly higher than the baseline period 3 3 model results of soil co2 emissions under different climate scenarios the simulation results of the dndc model showed that future climate change would affect soil co2 emissions under four tillage practices fig 4 it can be observed from fig 4 that under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios of the two climate models the annual mean co2 emissions of the four treatments were significantly different from the baseline period and all of them increased under the rcp4 5 scenario of the canems2 model fig 5 the annual mean co2 emissions of the four treatments ct cts nt and nts increased by 47 64 27 91 22 48 and 5 81 respectively under the rcp8 5 scenario they increased by 61 74 57 93 64 96 and 27 58 respectively under the rcp4 5 scenario of the hadgem2 es model fig 5 the annual mean co2 emissions of the four treatments ct cts nt and nts increased by 53 63 50 56 56 73 and 18 21 respectively under the rcp8 5 scenario they increased by 65 62 60 35 68 75 and 24 48 respectively we also found that no matter in the baseline period or under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios of the two climate models the cts and nts treatments with straw mulch had higher annual mean co2 emissions compared to the ct and nt treatments in addition the nt treatment had the lowest annual mean co2 emissions of the four treatments based on the two climate models the interannual variation of soil co2 emissions under four tillage practices predicted by the dndc model from 2022 to 2070 showed different results fig 6 nevertheless the relatively consistent was that co2 emissions from the four treatments were significantly higher under the rcp8 5 scenario than under the rcp4 5 scenario in the canems2 model the co2 emissions of the nts treatment showed an increasing trend year by year in both scenarios the other three treatments showed an increasing trend overall but there were significant fluctuations in contrast in the hadgem2 es model the co2 emissions of all four treatments showed an increasing year to year trend under both scenarios with less fluctuation similarly based on the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios of the two climate models the correlation analysis of soil co2 emissions with annual mean temperature annual precipitation and atmospheric co2 concentration under four tillage practices predicted by the dndc model from 2022 to 2070 had different results table 4 under the rcp4 5 scenario of the canems2 model the co2 emissions of ct and nt have a notable positive association with annual precipitation and atmospheric co2 concentration p 0 01 in contrast nts has a notable correlation with annual mean temperature and atmospheric co2 concentration and there was a notable positive association between cts and the three p 0 05 p 0 01 under the rcp8 5 scenario the co2 emissions of ct cts and nt were significantly positively correlated with annual mean temperature annual precipitation and atmospheric co2 concentration p 0 01 in contrast nts has significantly correlated with annual mean temperature and atmospheric co2 concentration p 0 01 under the two scenarios of the hadgem2 es model the co2 emissions of the four tillage practices were all notably positively correlated with the annual mean temperature and atmospheric co2 concentration p 0 01 but not notably correlated with the annual precipitation these suggest that the changes in soil co2 emissions for each treatment under future climate scenarios are the result of the combination of constantly changing temperature precipitation and atmospheric co2 concentrations 4 discussion temperature and precipitation are vital regulators of terrestrial ecosystem processes both of which can alter soil microclimate and thus affect ghg emissions liu et al 2016 yang et al 2022 since abiotic variables like temperature and moisture can regulate humus and crop residue mineralization processes climate change may directly affect soil carbon export alvarez and alvarez 2001 moreover climate change related increases in temperature can affect microbial activity and soil carbon stocks in various ways through direct or indirect mechanisms which can also impact soil co2 emissions flanagan et al 2013 in this study based on the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios of the two climate models soil co2 emissions of the four tillage practices predicted by the dndc model from 2022 to 2070 showed different results in the interannual variability fig 6 nevertheless the relatively consistent was that the co2 emissions of the four tillage practices under the rcp8 5 scenario were significantly higher than those under the rcp4 5 scenario which may be related to the increased temperatures in the climate scenario we found that in both climate models the annual mean temperature from 2022 to 2070 under the rcp8 5 scenario is higher than that under the rcp4 5 scenario fig 3 and the annual increase trend is more significant than the rcp4 5 scenario figs 7 and 8 furthermore the correlation analysis revealed a highly significant positive correlation between the annual mean soil co2 emissions of the four tillage practices and the annual mean temperature of the rcp8 5 scenario indicating that soil co2 emissions increase with temperature which is consistent with previous findings lu et al 2013 schlesinger and andrews 2000 at the same time numerous field trials have shown that warming can contribute to co2 emissions from maize wheat and soybean fields wang et al 2019 wu et al 2020 because relatively small temperature increases when carbon availability and enzymatic activity are not constrained directly stimulate soil microbial activity leading to substantial ecosystem co2 loss to the atmosphere conant et al 2011 in dry and semi arid areas precipitation regulates ecological activities it can influence microbial activity and organic matter mineralization by regulating soil water content thereby affecting soil co2 emissions chu et al 2022 wang et al 2015 relevant research has demonstrated that changes in soil respiration are positively linked with changes in soil moisture in most water limited ecosystems as a result an increase in precipitation typically enhances soil respiration and conversely can decrease it liu et al 2016 wu et al 2011 in this study based on the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios of the canems2 model the dndc model simulated soil co2 emissions for the ct cts and nt treatments fluctuated wildly in interannual variation with significant low peaks fig 6 as shown in fig 7 the precipitation in 2035 308 57 mm is significantly lower than the other years under the rcp4 5 scenario while the co2 emissions of the three treatments in that year are significantly lower fig 6 according to the correlation analysis table 4 a notable positive association p 0 01 between co2 emissions and annual precipitation for these three treatments it can be seen that the fluctuations in co2 emissions were related to precipitation wang et al 2011 also found that annual soil co2 emissions from summer maize croplands increased with increasing precipitation based on dndc model simulations furthermore in our study co2 emissions from the four tillage practices simulated using the dndc model were not significantly correlated with annual precipitation based on the hadgem2 es model climate scenario table 4 but were significantly correlated with annual mean temperature and the interannual variation in emissions was more stable with less fluctuation fig 6 this may be because current precipitation is not a limiting factor so co2 emissions are more sensitive to changes in mean annual temperature wang et al 2011 in addition to temperature and precipitation atmospheric co2 concentrations are constantly increasing under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios which also affects soil c and n cycles gorissen 1995 polley et al 2011 including the generation of n2o ch4 co2 and their emissions lam et al 2011 van groenigen et al 2011 drake et al 2016 have found that root and rhizome respiration is enhanced with increasing co2 concentrations leading to enhanced soil respiration in addition root production increases under elevated atmospheric co2 may result in accelerated root turnover and increased input of root secretions into the soil which would boost microbial respiration kou et al 2007 smith et al 2013 also discovered that higher co2 concentrations boost plant biomass and may encourage soil respiration by improving the respiration of roots which the dndc model predicted yu et al 2018 observed that plant biomass and soil respiration increased with rising co2 concentrations in both plastic and non plastic mulch treatments in line with previous findings our study also found a significant positive correlation p 0 01 between co2 emissions and atmospheric co2 concentration for all four tillage practices under different climate scenarios which indicated that changes in atmospheric co2 concentration would impact soil co2 emissions we also found that the dndc model simulations under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios of both climate models indicated that the nt treatment had the lowest annual mean co2 emissions from 2022 to 2070 compared to the other treatments because nt can reduce the mineralization rate caused by soil disturbance and increase the stability of soil aggregates leading to some reduction in soil co2 emissions farhate et al 2019 shahidi et al 2014 dendooven et al 2012 also concluded that tillage stimulates co2 emissions while the absence of tillage in conservation agriculture ca hinders the decomposition of organic matter to some extent in addition previous studies have also investigated the effect of cover crop residues on soil co2 emissions oorts et al al 2007 found that under no tillage covering the soil surface with crop residues led to an increase in soil co2 emissions and tang et al al 2013 showed that winter cover crops have a beneficial effect on soil organic carbon sequestration and can strongly influence soil co2 emissions abdalla et al al 2014 concluded that the predicted accumulation of co2 c was statistically higher p 0 05 in the reduced tillage with mustard mulch treatment rt cc treatment compared to conventional tillage ct while the increase in soil respiration was likely driven by the higher carbon input from cover crops zhang et al 2019 found that straw mulch increased soil respiration in maize farmland consistent with the results of previous studies our results showed that annual mean soil co2 emissions of the cts and nts treatments with straw mulch were higher than ct and nt treatments indicating that straw mulch can increase soil co2 emissions because straw mulch can improve soil physical properties and nutrients and increase soil organic and reactive carbon fractions while changes in these parameters will affect the structure of the soil microbial community dai et al 2020 wang et al 2020 prompting rapid microbial decomposition of carbon in straw and accelerating som mineralization leading to enhanced soil respiration and significant co2 emissions li et al 2022 furthermore straw exposed directly to the soil surface can also release co2 through aerobic mineralization zhao et al 2016 in addition we found that the dndc model showed different results for the simulation of soil co2 emissions from the four tillage practices figs 5 and 6 which may be related to future climate differences under different climate models abdalla et al 2014 used the dndc model to simulate soil respiration in conventional and reduced tillage systems under future scenarios andfound that in the clm4 gcm3 1 model soil respiration would decrease by 4 8 and increase by 3 6 while in the clm4 hadgem2 es model soil respiration would decrease by 3 14 and increase by 10 12 respectively yu et al 2018 assessed the effects of ground cover on soil respiration and plant biomass based on three future climate scenarios from five climate models and found that soil respiration predicted by the dndc model in the no cover treatment showed different results as a result future studies of soil ghg emissions should consider climate data from different sources in this study there is a certain degree of uncertainty in the predictions and results of changes in soil co2 emission dynamics from dry farmland in the loess plateau of china from 2022 to 2070 mainly because 1 the dndc model has some bias in the simulation of co2 emissions at a single time point yao et al 2021 2 in the simulation process soil parameters were based on the conditions of the experiment site without considering its specific changes in the future climate change process 3 climate change is not a simple linear process and there are uncertainties in the simulation of any climate scenario 4 this study only considered the influence of future climate and management measures on soil co2 emissions not a benefit analysis in conjunction with crop yields therefore confirming the interaction and impact of future climate change and management measures on agricultural soil ghg emissions and crop yields at regional scales is a crucial consideration for future assessment and scientific formulation of high yield and low carbon management measures for dry farmland 5 conclusion based on different climate scenarios this study completed the assessment of the long term dynamic changes of soil co2 emissions from dry farmland spring wheat in the loess plateau of china under different tillage practices using the dndc model the results of the research showed that 1 under different climate scenarios soil co2 emissions of the four tillage practices increased and the emissions under the rcp8 5 scenario were significantly higher than that under the rcp4 5 scenario 2 under different climate scenarios the application of straw mulch on top of conventional tillage and no tillage significantly increased soil co2 emissions by contrast no tillage had the lowest annual mean co2 emissions 3 under the influence of tillage measures changes in soil co2 emissions from dry farmland in the future are also the result of the combined effects of changing temperature precipitation and atmospheric co2 concentration therefore we conclude that no tillage may be an effective measure to mitigate the impact of future climate change on soil co2 emissions from dry farmland in the loess plateau of china however although our simulation predictions suggest that no tillage can reduce soil co2 emissions under different climate scenarios the predictions should be verified by field experiment data in addition this study is currently based on simulations at the point locations only and the impact of future climate change on regional scale agricultural soil co2 emission needs to be further studied credit authorship contribution statement yao yao investigation formal analysis writing original draft guang

24238,detecting spatiotemporal changes in the abundances of organisms is key to effectively conserving species while indices of abundance have long been used there has been a shift toward model based estimators that account for the detection process popular approaches including traditional occupancy models and n mixture models entail tradeoffs the traditional occupancy approach requires the researcher coarsen the characterization of abundance to the probability that a site is occupied or unoccupied conversely n mixture models make use of variation in counts but perform poorly when individuals have low detectability or move into or out of sites between visits multistate occupancy models that differentiate relatively abundant from non abundant states have the potential to fill this gap but have been underexplored we conducted a simulation study to test whether multistate occupancy models could capture spatial abundance patterns and detect population declines in the face of low individual detection probability p 0 3 and unmodeled heterogeneity e g that arising from individual movement we considered 10 773 scenarios to examine the effects of differing amounts of heterogeneity as well as alternative study designs population parameters and modeling choices we tracked bias in the proportion of sites estimated to be in the abundant state for single season models and power to detect a declining trend across multiple years we also evaluated data diagnostic metrics to provide guidance to users multistate occupancy models were able to differentiate sites with higher abundances from sites with lower abundances when there were at least medium levels of spatial heterogeneity in true abundances if different sites were randomly selected each year power to detect even large population declines 65 was poor power 0 8 however if the same sites were surveyed each year and a dynamic multistate occupancy was used multistate occupancy models could detect power 0 8 relatively small declines 5 40 in 20 of scenarios and frequently detect large declines of 45 60 mean power 0 92 conservation decisions rely on detecting change reliably rarely needing absolute abundance information multistate occupancy models can improve our ability to detect changing abundance while accommodating low individual detection probability and heterogeneity in count monitoring data keywords abundance estimation count data detection probability multistate occupancy population trend power analysis data availability all data used in this article were simulated simulation code is provided in the supplementary materials 1 introduction estimating abundances of animals through space and time is the goal of many monitoring programs armed with this information conservation practitioners can understand population trends and prioritize locations for protection and restoration while raw count data are often used as indices of abundance variation in such estimates can be confounded with patterns in the detection process and yield misleading results bayley and peterson 2001 williams et al 2002 royle et al 2007 kéry et al 2009 furthermore given that conservation of species often has diverse stakeholders involved the tenability of reported trends or spatial patterns is often as important as the trends themselves duarte and peterson 2021 therefore analytical methods that explicitly address the detection process are ever more widely used mackenzie et al 2017 kéry and royle 2020 numerous analytical approaches have been developed to explicitly model detectability of individuals within a population and obtain direct estimates of abundance among the oldest of these mark recapture methods use unique identifiers to estimate abundance based on the number of marked individuals relative to unmarked individuals otis et al 1978 pollock et al 1990 nichols 1992 williams et al 2002 amstrup et al 2005 caci et al 2013 alonso et al 2015 aside from the few animals with unique and visible markings this requires the intensive work of capturing and marking animals developed more recently n mixture models estimate individual detection probabilities and abundance from repeat visits to sites using counts of unmarked individuals and thus do not require capturing animals royle 2004 given this convenience these models have exploded in popularity however n mixture models have recently been shown to produce biased abundance estimates in the face of low individual detection probability p 0 3 and unmodeled heterogeneity in the count data barker et al 2018 duarte et al 2018 knape et al 2018 link et al 2018 rendering them a poor choice for many study systems another related approach to explicitly modeling detectability is to use occupancy models where counts of animals are reclassed as detected 1 or not detected 0 to estimate occupied and unoccupied site level status mackenzie et al 2002 tyre et al 2003 in occupancy models detection probability refers to the detectability of the species rather than the individuals within a sample unit whereas unmodeled heterogeneity in count or capture based models arises from a lack of site closure to for example individual movement in occupancy models this lack of individual level closure is less problematic unless it produces a change in occupancy state in the common case where counts number higher than one occupancy modeling entails an information reduction however this reduction can produce gains in the precision and accuracy of model estimates due to the more lenient population closure assumption mackenzie 2006 then variation in abundance might be inferred through variation in occupancy or detectability estimates royle and nichols 2003 monitored as change in occupied area over time e g briscoe et al 2021 or inferred by taking advantage of the presumed occupancy abundance relationship in ecological systems gaston et al 2000 however simulation based studies have found changes in abundance need to be large ellis et al 2014 or species detectability needs to be high fuller et al 2016 before occupancy models can detect a change severe positive bias in abundance estimates can occur when model assumptions are violated stauffer et al 2021 and the occupancy abundance relationship does not always hold ellis et al 2014 stauffer et al 2021 thus occupancy models may be biased or have low sensitivity to detect population change in many common circumstances multistate occupancy models estimate the detectability and status of three or more occupancy states simultaneously mackenzie et al 2009 by adding one or more additional states they increase the sensitivity of the basic occupancy model to detect important differences in occupied sites they have commonly been used to differentiate breeding categories of occupied sites e g nichols et al 2007 peterson and shea 2015 mcgrady et al 2017 duarte et al 2020 clawson et al 2022 and to identify disease status of individuals or populations e g elmore et al 2014 mosher et al 2018 rodrigues et al 2020 reddell et al 2021 when the abundance across sites is of interest relative abundance categories can be included such as relatively abundant and not abundant this can increase the ability of occupancy models to detect changing abundance while the utility of this approach has been shown in a variety of systems royle and link 2005 martin et al 2010 jensen and vokoun 2013 peterson and barajas 2018 whitlock et al 2020 it has not been widely applied this is likely because multistate occupancy models have not been systematically evaluated for their ability to estimate spatiotemporal variation in abundance furthermore in study systems where no a priori definition of abundance categories exist guidance is needed on how to optimally define the number of animals that would constitute abundant versus not abundant states we used simulations to evaluate the ability of multistate occupancy models to estimate variation in abundance among sites spatial variation and changes in abundance when populations are declining across years or primary sampling occasions temporal variation we restricted simulation scenarios to situations where the count based n mixture model performs poorly i e low detection and unmodeled heterogeneity of individuals specifically we explored 1 how to determine the threshold count value that separates abundant and non abundant states 2 bias in estimates of the proportion of sites spatial variation in the abundant state given varying study designs elements number of sites and visits and 3 the power to detect a declining trend temporal variation in abundance given two common survey designs a random site design with different sites surveyed from year to year and a fixed site design using dynamic occupancy models with the same sites surveyed from year to year 2 materials and methods 2 1 simulations 2 1 1 overview we generated observed animal count data for each visit at each site and then classed the observations into one of three states not detected detected in the non abundant state and detected in the abundant state to do this we simulated true latent i e unobserved site occupancy for occupied sites we simulated true latent abundances we then generated the number of individuals observed counts from the latent abundances assuming a low individual detection probability to generate sample data under different scenarios we varied study design and population parameters by what we consider to be low medium or high levels for many studies and systems that do not meet the criteria needed to reliably fit n mixture models for distributions and parameter levels used see table 1 each unique combination of mean true abundance µ number of sites i and number of visits j along with specified levels of among site spatial and within site heterogeneity described below in true abundance defined the basic study design and population parameter components of a scenario for population trend simulations we also evaluated random site and fixed site designs alternative levels of population decrease the number of years sampled and whether the abundant state was determined based on counts from just the first year or all years described below collectively this resulted in the evaluation of 10 773 different scenarios 2 1 2 single season heterogeneity exploration spatial we explored the effects of spatial heterogeneity in true abundance on bias in abundant state probabilities and the ability to detect a trend fig 1 2 a we evaluated four levels of spatial heterogeneity including a very high level because we wanted to verify our expectation that increasing levels of spatial heterogeneity would benefit multistate abundant occupancy models as count distributions become longer right tailed a larger spread of values presumably facilitates differentiating abundance states table 1 fig 1 2 our evaluation contained 108 scenarios across three levels of abundance visits and sites and the four levels of spatial heterogeneity within site we also explored the effects of within site heterogeneity in true abundance on bias in abundant state probabilities and the power to detect trends fig 1 2b these scenarios represent conditions where individuals enter leave sample units between replicate surveys in addition to including scenarios with no within site heterogeneity we explored four additional levels of heterogeneity table 1 within site heterogeneity was simulated for visits j 1 where true abundances were drawn from a gamma distribution based on the true abundance from the first visit j and a level of variation table 1 this evaluation included 405 scenarios across the three highest levels of spatial heterogeneity three levels of abundance visits and sites and the five levels of within site heterogeneity 2 1 3 trends we evaluated the power to detect changes in occupancy states across primary sampling occasions using two common survey designs random site and fixed site for the former sites were randomly selected during each simulated year whereas the latter included the random selection of sites during the first year and the same sites on subsequent years for both designs we set annual decreases in abundance of 5 and 10 for two and ten year simulations although given the stochastic nature of the simulations actual population declines varied fig 1 3 we also simulated declines between two primary periods of 5 10 20 and 40 as commonly in natural resource studies surveys conducted at two points in time whether separated by e g 5 10 or 20 years or more are all that is available to simulate declines in annual abundance for the random site design we imposed declines on the overall mean true abundance from year to year we then randomly sampled from the yearly overall mean to obtain values for each new randomly selected site for the fixed site design we randomly generated true abundances for the first year at each site and imposed a proportional change in abundance for each subsequent year for each specific site because these decreases would result in fractions of animals e g a 5 decline for an initial abundance of 10 is 9 5 animals we randomly generated the true abundance in subsequent years using a normal distribution with a mean equal to the abundance at a site after decrease e g 9 5 above example and a cv of 0 1 rounded to the nearest whole number this resulted in spatial variation in abundance that equaled that specified we simulated 9 720 scenarios given varying spatial and within site heterogeneity mean true abundance visits sites years population decline sample design and whether we defined abundant based on the first year or all years data 2 2 defining the abundant state 2 2 1 true states we used quantiles of the true abundances where n 0 to identify simulated sites that were in the abundant state and defined the true abundant state as abundance greater than the 60th quantile fig 1 1 for simulations with within site heterogeneity in true abundance we used the maximum true abundances across visits e g five is the maximum count for a site with simulated counts for three visits of zero one and five to calculate the threshold abundance value and classify sites into their true states 2 2 2 observed states multistate occupancy models assume that lower level states occupied not abundant are not misclassified as upper level states detected in the abundant state therefore we explored various thresholds to separate simulated count data into abundant and non abundant states that minimized bias in the estimated proportion of abundant sites fig 1 1 we evaluated several candidate thresholds using quantiles of the maximum non zero counts at each site across multiple visits and tested thresholds of 0 70 0 75 0 8 0 85 and 0 9 we defined abundant counts as those values greater than or equal to the threshold note this was different than how the threshold was applied in defining true states we evaluated bias for 540 scenarios representing all combinations of abundance spatial heterogeneity sites and visits simulated for 200 iterations table 1 we summarized bias for each scenario based on the mean values across the 200 replicates for each scenario we found that a threshold quantile of 0 8 had the lowest median bias see the supporting information given that the sensitivity of bias to the optimal threshold quantile between scenarios was low we use this threshold for all subsequent steps in this paper fig s1 in the supporting information for users wanting to optimize their threshold for a given dataset see data diagnostics sections in the supporting information 2 3 multistate occupancy model fitting we fit single season multistate occupancy models with program mark white and burnham 1999 in r r core team 2022 using rmark version 2 2 7 laake 2013 to estimate the probability of sites being in the abundant state and the power to detect a trend with the random sites design below we used the conditional binomial formulation which estimates parameters ψ1 the probability of occupancy regardless of abundance state ψ2 the probability of abundant given that the site is occupied p 1 the probability of detecting occupancy given it is not in the abundant state p 2 the probability of detecting occupancy given it is in the abundant state and δ the probability of detecting the abundant state given that the species was detected and the true state was abundant we used intercept only models for all parameters and allowed p 1 and p 2 to be estimated separately we calculated the probability of a site being in the abundant state as ψ1 ψ2 and the probability of being unoccupied as 1 ψ1 we restricted our trends evaluations to simulations that resulted in a true decline in simulated abundances to test for a true decline we used a generalized linear model with a poisson distribution and modeled the maximum abundance across visits for the occupied sites first year only as a function of year a true decline was any iteration that found a statistically significant decline in simulated true abundances α 0 05 0 1 to evaluate our ability to estimate trends in abundance across primary occasions using a random site design with single season multistate occupancy models we included a year covariate on ψ2 to evaluate our ability to estimate trends in abundance across primary occasions with a fixed site design we used dynamic multistate occupancy models in rmark to model transition probabilities from state 2 to state 1 ψ b a and from state 1 to state 0 ψ a 0 we fixed all other transition probabilities to zero because we did not expect for example transitions to occur from absent to present given our simulations were focused on declining trends for fixed site and random site simulations we tracked power the proportion of simulation replicates where the parameter estimate was negative i e declining trend and statistically significant α 0 05 0 1 2 3 1 convergence for all iterations we excluded results if parameter estimates did not converge we ascribed this if parameter standard errors were zero or larger than 10 on the logit scale because p 2 is often large near or at 1 on the real scale due to the strong relationship among n p and the number of individuals in the count data bayley and peterson 2001 royle and nichols 2003 we did not apply this rule to the standard error for p 2 standard errors are inestimable by their nature if the parameter is at a boundary we tracked the proportion of simulations that converged for each scenario we ran each scenario until we had 500 replicates that converged or for a minimum of 100 replicates where the time exceeded 30 minutes we report scenarios where fewer than 100 replicates converged 2 4 inference on important relationships for each set of simulations defining the abundant state heterogeneity trend with random site design and fixed site design we assessed which simulation parameters most affected bias or power also convergence see the supporting information for details we evaluated the relative importance of parameters using ensemble regression trees with the randomforest package in r using the default settings liaw and wiener 2002 we tracked permutation importance a metric that describes the relative explanatory ability of variables to estimate variable importance we report the average relativized importance across ten random forest models cutler et al 2012 we discuss important variables as those with a minimum relative importance of 0 10 2 5 data diagnostics see the supporting information 3 results 3 1 single season heterogeneity low levels of spatial heterogeneity resulted in unacceptable levels of bias but otherwise the estimator performed well fig 2 a medium levels resulted in a small positive bias on average while high or very high levels resulted in a small negative bias this mix of positive and negative bias was due to defining a single threshold cutoff optimized across our varying levels of heterogeneity whereas as a threshold could be optimized for specific levels of heterogeneity see data diagnostics in the supporting information increasing the number of visits or sites did not lower bias in a consistent fashion fig 2b within site heterogeneity had little impact on the ability of multistate occupancy models to estimate the proportion of sites in the abundant state mean bias with no within site heterogeneity was 0 007 and with very high levels was 0 001 across levels of spatial heterogeneity increasing within site heterogeneity from none to very high levels shifted bias to be more positive fig 2c increasing the number of sites or visits did not lower bias in a consistent fashion fig 2d 3 2 power to detect a trend 3 2 1 random site design power to detect a trend for the years comparison with the random site design was low on average x 0 33 at α 0 10 fig 3 a to detect a declining trend large population decreases were needed mean power across 2 year scenarios with 5 and 10 decreases was 0 10 while for 10 year simulations mean power was 0 41 for 5 annual decreases 40 total decline from year 1 to year 10 and 0 69 for 10 annual decreases 65 total decline besides the large impact of overall declines number of years and population decrease increasing the number of sites improved power the most followed by lower levels of spatial heterogeneity fig 3b 3c table s1 and fig s4 in the supporting information power was low using the random site design to detect a population decline as much as 40 between two time periods mean power for a decrease of 5 was 0 10 for 10 it was 0 10 for 20 it was 0 13 and for 40 it was 0 22 at α 0 10 fig 3a c the number of sites influenced power the most followed by the population decline spatial heterogeneity and the number of visits fig 3b table s1 all effects were small and positive except spatial heterogeneity which had a small negative effect fig 3c 3 2 2 fixed site design across scenarios for 2 and 10 year periods with 5 and 10 declines when using a fixed site design mean power to detect a declining trend was on average higher for the non abundant to unoccupied state transition 0 71 at α 0 10 0 65 at α 0 05 than for the abundant to non abundant state transition 0 64 at α 0 10 0 62 at α 0 05 thus we focus on power to detect a trend in the non abundant to unoccupied state transition at α 0 10 mean power was high for 10 year 0 92 and moderate for 2 year simulations 0 50 fig 3a besides the number of years varying sites mean true abundance visits and within site heterogeneity impacted power the most fig 3b table s1 and fig s5 in the supporting information power was highest when within site heterogeneity was zero fig 3c for two periods again mean power was greater for the non abundant to unoccupied state transition 0 48 at α 0 10 0 39 at α 0 05 than the abundant to non abundant state transition 0 29 at α 0 10 0 26 at α 0 05 focusing on the non abundant to unoccupied transition the amount of decline for a two year period had little impact on power fig 3b the number of sites followed by varying mean true abundance visits and within site heterogeneity impacted power the most fig 3b table s1 in the supporting information increasing sites increased power while increasing visits lowered it fig 3c the minimum of 100

information 3 4 convergence see the supporting information 3 5 data diagnostics see the supporting information 4 discussion conservation decisions are often based on differentiating areas of higher animal populations from lower and with detecting trends they rarely require information on total abundance nichols and williams 2006 therefore we evaluated the ability of multistate occupancy models that differentiate relatively low and high abundance states to detect spatial variation in abundance or a declining trend in the face of low individual detection probability and unexplained heterogeneity in true abundance between visits we found not surprisingly that this approach would not be appropriate if sites differ little in their true abundance levels we otherwise found that this approach could be used to differentiate sites with relatively high abundance from sites with relatively low abundance even in the face of high levels of individual movement deaths or recruitment among visits multistate occupancy models also had a good ability to detect a declining trend if the same sites were surveyed each year i e the fixed site design especially when more sites were surveyed the good performance of the estimator for differentiating relative abundance patterns among sites under high within site heterogeneity is likely at least partly due to our definition of true abundance we defined true abundance based on the maximum abundance across visits describing the so called super population schwarz and arnason 1996 williams et al 2011 which included the surrounding area from which animals moved into and out of the site when we lack closure during abundance estimation we are in fact always estimating super population abundance kendall 1999 classing a site in a relatively abundant or non abundant state based on the maximum count therefore did not generate any additional bias between the true superpopulation abundant state and the estimate however if we had based true abundance on that from the first visit instead of the maximum across visits we would have likely found that bias increased with increasing within site heterogeneity while we tried to mitigate false positive classifications of the abundant state by choosing a reasonable optimal threshold for classing counts as abundant this did not eliminate this set of misclassed observations fig 1 1 this violates a key assumption of standard occupancy models the effect of these false positives is to produce positively biased estimates sampling more simply worsens this problem the more you sample the worse you do kéry and royle 2020 this was apparent as we increased the number of visits to sites and although the pattern is less clear may also be why increasing the number of sites did not decrease bias in single season models fig 2b d this problem was less or not at all apparent in our evaluation of the power to detect a trend where increasing sites positively impacted power and increasing visits often did fig 3 when sites are randomly selected each year spatial heterogeneity is not seen by a statistical model as explicitly spatial given variation is likely occurring within and among sites thus any temporal signal needs to overcome the reduction in precision caused by the spatial heterogeneity to register as statistically significant larsen et al 2001 in other words a random site study design can only detect declines that are large we found this to be the case in our multistate occupancy model simulations where we only had good power to detect a decline in our 10 year simulations which was improved by lower spatial heterogeneity and higher annual population declines in additional simulations we found that a very large number of sites n 300 allowed declines of 40 to be detected power 0 8 across two periods with a medium level of spatial heterogeneity if spatial heterogeneity was very high many more sites were needed n 1 000 fig s7 in the supporting information many studies report that large declines are needed in order to detect a statistically significant trend for example in one study a 50 decline in occupancy could be detected for only 22 of a large taxonomically diverse suite of species 136 species of birds reptiles and mammals southwell et al 2019 studies using density estimates or abundance indices reported needing large declines 64 for tropical bats meyer et al 2010 note power cutoff was 0 9 greater than 40 for the sonoran desert tortoise zylstra et al 2010 power was 0 43 to detect a 40 decline and greater than 50 for 70 of 127 marine mammal species taylor et al 2007 with the relatively precise abundance estimates from mark recapture or spatial mark recapture methods but see green et al 2020 the minimum decrease detectable was 45 for a population of dolphins cantor et al 2012 and ranged from 20 80 for asian bears morin et al 2022 using a fixed site design analyzed with dynamic multistate occupancy models we could detect declines of 5 40 between two periods in 20 of the scenarios we looked at power 0 8 with 10 years of 5 10 annual declines we had relatively high power 0 75 across all scenarios supporting information fig s5a power appeared unaffected by the actual amount of the population decline using a fixed site design fig 3 indicating that the increase in power from two to ten years was due to an increased ability to estimate transition probabilities with the repeated samples i e a greater sample size and not because declines themselves were large i e 10 annual declines produce 65 declines after 10 years when animals are solitary and hard to find occupancy based trends analysis can be appropriate our results indicate that when counts of animals vary between sites multistate occupancy models can be sensitive to relatively small declines in abundance while we only looked at two relative abundance states more relative abundance states might increase the sensitivity of this model we used a three state multistate occupancy model as this parameterization allowed us to account for potential misclassifications in the observation data via the δ parameter nichols et al 2007 although more complicated parameterizations can be considered more data would be needed to achieve model convergence fig s2 s3 and results in the supporting information this is especially true when trying to estimate trends in abundance across years in our trend simulations convergence rates ranged from low to high fig s3 in the supporting information decreasing with increasing model complexity lower for the more complex dynamic multistate occupancy model and increasing with number of years and sites this supports the notion that even in the simplest of cases a multistate dynamic occupancy model requires substantial data to be fitted while we opted to fit our model using a frequentist statistical approach better convergence could possibly be achieved using a bayesian approach where information can be borrowed across parameters kéry and schaub 2011 5 conclusion based on our simulations multistate occupancy models are able to model varying spatial abundance patterns and detect declining trends where n mixture models fail in particular dynamic multistate occupancy models utilizing surveys conducted at the same sites from year to year fixed site design were effective at detecting declining trends especially with more years and sites fig s7 in the supporting information by utilizing data diagnostic summaries icc qcv spatial mmc0 along with study design elements i e number of visits sites and years users can evaluate for a given dataset whether bias in the estimated proportion of abundant sites will be low and or the likelihood they will be able to detect a

24238,detecting spatiotemporal changes in the abundances of organisms is key to effectively conserving species while indices of abundance have long been used there has been a shift toward model based estimators that account for the detection process popular approaches including traditional occupancy models and n mixture models entail tradeoffs the traditional occupancy approach requires the researcher coarsen the characterization of abundance to the probability that a site is occupied or unoccupied conversely n mixture models make use of variation in counts but perform poorly when individuals have low detectability or move into or out of sites between visits multistate occupancy models that differentiate relatively abundant from non abundant states have the potential to fill this gap but have been underexplored we conducted a simulation study to test whether multistate occupancy models could capture spatial abundance patterns and detect population declines in the face of low individual detection probability p 0 3 and unmodeled heterogeneity e g that arising from individual movement we considered 10 773 scenarios to examine the effects of differing amounts of heterogeneity as well as alternative study designs population parameters and modeling choices we tracked bias in the proportion of sites estimated to be in the abundant state for single season models and power to detect a declining trend across multiple years we also evaluated data diagnostic metrics to provide guidance to users multistate occupancy models were able to differentiate sites with higher abundances from sites with lower abundances when there were at least medium levels of spatial heterogeneity in true abundances if different sites were randomly selected each year power to detect even large population declines 65 was poor power 0 8 however if the same sites were surveyed each year and a dynamic multistate occupancy was used multistate occupancy models could detect power 0 8 relatively small declines 5 40 in 20 of scenarios and frequently detect large declines of 45 60 mean power 0 92 conservation decisions rely on detecting change reliably rarely needing absolute abundance information multistate occupancy models can improve our ability to detect changing abundance while accommodating low individual detection probability and heterogeneity in count monitoring data keywords abundance estimation count data detection probability multistate occupancy population trend power analysis data availability all data used in this article were simulated simulation code is provided in the supplementary materials 1 introduction estimating abundances of animals through space and time is the goal of many monitoring programs armed with this information conservation practitioners can understand population trends and prioritize locations for protection and restoration while raw count data are often used as indices of abundance variation in such estimates can be confounded with patterns in the detection process and yield misleading results bayley and peterson 2001 williams et al 2002 royle et al 2007 kéry et al 2009 furthermore given that conservation of species often has diverse stakeholders involved the tenability of reported trends or spatial patterns is often as important as the trends themselves duarte and peterson 2021 therefore analytical methods that explicitly address the detection process are ever more widely used mackenzie et al 2017 kéry and royle 2020 numerous analytical approaches have been developed to explicitly model detectability of individuals within a population and obtain direct estimates of abundance among the oldest of these mark recapture methods use unique identifiers to estimate abundance based on the number of marked individuals relative to unmarked individuals otis et al 1978 pollock et al 1990 nichols 1992 williams et al 2002 amstrup et al 2005 caci et al 2013 alonso et al 2015 aside from the few animals with unique and visible markings this requires the intensive work of capturing and marking animals developed more recently n mixture models estimate individual detection probabilities and abundance from repeat visits to sites using counts of unmarked individuals and thus do not require capturing animals royle 2004 given this convenience these models have exploded in popularity however n mixture models have recently been shown to produce biased abundance estimates in the face of low individual detection probability p 0 3 and unmodeled heterogeneity in the count data barker et al 2018 duarte et al 2018 knape et al 2018 link et al 2018 rendering them a poor choice for many study systems another related approach to explicitly modeling detectability is to use occupancy models where counts of animals are reclassed as detected 1 or not detected 0 to estimate occupied and unoccupied site level status mackenzie et al 2002 tyre et al 2003 in occupancy models detection probability refers to the detectability of the species rather than the individuals within a sample unit whereas unmodeled heterogeneity in count or capture based models arises from a lack of site closure to for example individual movement in occupancy models this lack of individual level closure is less problematic unless it produces a change in occupancy state in the common case where counts number higher than one occupancy modeling entails an information reduction however this reduction can produce gains in the precision and accuracy of model estimates due to the more lenient population closure assumption mackenzie 2006 then variation in abundance might be inferred through variation in occupancy or detectability estimates royle and nichols 2003 monitored as change in occupied area over time e g briscoe et al 2021 or inferred by taking advantage of the presumed occupancy abundance relationship in ecological systems gaston et al 2000 however simulation based studies have found changes in abundance need to be large ellis et al 2014 or species detectability needs to be high fuller et al 2016 before occupancy models can detect a change severe positive bias in abundance estimates can occur when model assumptions are violated stauffer et al 2021 and the occupancy abundance relationship does not always hold ellis et al 2014 stauffer et al 2021 thus occupancy models may be biased or have low sensitivity to detect population change in many common circumstances multistate occupancy models estimate the detectability and status of three or more occupancy states simultaneously mackenzie et al 2009 by adding one or more additional states they increase the sensitivity of the basic occupancy model to detect important differences in occupied sites they have commonly been used to differentiate breeding categories of occupied sites e g nichols et al 2007 peterson and shea 2015 mcgrady et al 2017 duarte et al 2020 clawson et al 2022 and to identify disease status of individuals or populations e g elmore et al 2014 mosher et al 2018 rodrigues et al 2020 reddell et al 2021 when the abundance across sites is of interest relative abundance categories can be included such as relatively abundant and not abundant this can increase the ability of occupancy models to detect changing abundance while the utility of this approach has been shown in a variety of systems royle and link 2005 martin et al 2010 jensen and vokoun 2013 peterson and barajas 2018 whitlock et al 2020 it has not been widely applied this is likely because multistate occupancy models have not been systematically evaluated for their ability to estimate spatiotemporal variation in abundance furthermore in study systems where no a priori definition of abundance categories exist guidance is needed on how to optimally define the number of animals that would constitute abundant versus not abundant states we used simulations to evaluate the ability of multistate occupancy models to estimate variation in abundance among sites spatial variation and changes in abundance when populations are declining across years or primary sampling occasions temporal variation we restricted simulation scenarios to situations where the count based n mixture model performs poorly i e low detection and unmodeled heterogeneity of individuals specifically we explored 1 how to determine the threshold count value that separates abundant and non abundant states 2 bias in estimates of the proportion of sites spatial variation in the abundant state given varying study designs elements number of sites and visits and 3 the power to detect a declining trend temporal variation in abundance given two common survey designs a random site design with different sites surveyed from year to year and a fixed site design using dynamic occupancy models with the same sites surveyed from year to year 2 materials and methods 2 1 simulations 2 1 1 overview we generated observed animal count data for each visit at each site and then classed the observations into one of three states not detected detected in the non abundant state and detected in the abundant state to do this we simulated true latent i e unobserved site occupancy for occupied sites we simulated true latent abundances we then generated the number of individuals observed counts from the latent abundances assuming a low individual detection probability to generate sample data under different scenarios we varied study design and population parameters by what we consider to be low medium or high levels for many studies and systems that do not meet the criteria needed to reliably fit n mixture models for distributions and parameter levels used see table 1 each unique combination of mean true abundance µ number of sites i and number of visits j along with specified levels of among site spatial and within site heterogeneity described below in true abundance defined the basic study design and population parameter components of a scenario for population trend simulations we also evaluated random site and fixed site designs alternative levels of population decrease the number of years sampled and whether the abundant state was determined based on counts from just the first year or all years described below collectively this resulted in the evaluation of 10 773 different scenarios 2 1 2 single season heterogeneity exploration spatial we explored the effects of spatial heterogeneity in true abundance on bias in abundant state probabilities and the ability to detect a trend fig 1 2 a we evaluated four levels of spatial heterogeneity including a very high level because we wanted to verify our expectation that increasing levels of spatial heterogeneity would benefit multistate abundant occupancy models as count distributions become longer right tailed a larger spread of values presumably facilitates differentiating abundance states table 1 fig 1 2 our evaluation contained 108 scenarios across three levels of abundance visits and sites and the four levels of spatial heterogeneity within site we also explored the effects of within site heterogeneity in true abundance on bias in abundant state probabilities and the power to detect trends fig 1 2b these scenarios represent conditions where individuals enter leave sample units between replicate surveys in addition to including scenarios with no within site heterogeneity we explored four additional levels of heterogeneity table 1 within site heterogeneity was simulated for visits j 1 where true abundances were drawn from a gamma distribution based on the true abundance from the first visit j and a level of variation table 1 this evaluation included 405 scenarios across the three highest levels of spatial heterogeneity three levels of abundance visits and sites and the five levels of within site heterogeneity 2 1 3 trends we evaluated the power to detect changes in occupancy states across primary sampling occasions using two common survey designs random site and fixed site for the former sites were randomly selected during each simulated year whereas the latter included the random selection of sites during the first year and the same sites on subsequent years for both designs we set annual decreases in abundance of 5 and 10 for two and ten year simulations although given the stochastic nature of the simulations actual population declines varied fig 1 3 we also simulated declines between two primary periods of 5 10 20 and 40 as commonly in natural resource studies surveys conducted at two points in time whether separated by e g 5 10 or 20 years or more are all that is available to simulate declines in annual abundance for the random site design we imposed declines on the overall mean true abundance from year to year we then randomly sampled from the yearly overall mean to obtain values for each new randomly selected site for the fixed site design we randomly generated true abundances for the first year at each site and imposed a proportional change in abundance for each subsequent year for each specific site because these decreases would result in fractions of animals e g a 5 decline for an initial abundance of 10 is 9 5 animals we randomly generated the true abundance in subsequent years using a normal distribution with a mean equal to the abundance at a site after decrease e g 9 5 above example and a cv of 0 1 rounded to the nearest whole number this resulted in spatial variation in abundance that equaled that specified we simulated 9 720 scenarios given varying spatial and within site heterogeneity mean true abundance visits sites years population decline sample design and whether we defined abundant based on the first year or all years data 2 2 defining the abundant state 2 2 1 true states we used quantiles of the true abundances where n 0 to identify simulated sites that were in the abundant state and defined the true abundant state as abundance greater than the 60th quantile fig 1 1 for simulations with within site heterogeneity in true abundance we used the maximum true abundances across visits e g five is the maximum count for a site with simulated counts for three visits of zero one and five to calculate the threshold abundance value and classify sites into their true states 2 2 2 observed states multistate occupancy models assume that lower level states occupied not abundant are not misclassified as upper level states detected in the abundant state therefore we explored various thresholds to separate simulated count data into abundant and non abundant states that minimized bias in the estimated proportion of abundant sites fig 1 1 we evaluated several candidate thresholds using quantiles of the maximum non zero counts at each site across multiple visits and tested thresholds of 0 70 0 75 0 8 0 85 and 0 9 we defined abundant counts as those values greater than or equal to the threshold note this was different than how the threshold was applied in defining true states we evaluated bias for 540 scenarios representing all combinations of abundance spatial heterogeneity sites and visits simulated for 200 iterations table 1 we summarized bias for each scenario based on the mean values across the 200 replicates for each scenario we found that a threshold quantile of 0 8 had the lowest median bias see the supporting information given that the sensitivity of bias to the optimal threshold quantile between scenarios was low we use this threshold for all subsequent steps in this paper fig s1 in the supporting information for users wanting to optimize their threshold for a given dataset see data diagnostics sections in the supporting information 2 3 multistate occupancy model fitting we fit single season multistate occupancy models with program mark white and burnham 1999 in r r core team 2022 using rmark version 2 2 7 laake 2013 to estimate the probability of sites being in the abundant state and the power to detect a trend with the random sites design below we used the conditional binomial formulation which estimates parameters ψ1 the probability of occupancy regardless of abundance state ψ2 the probability of abundant given that the site is occupied p 1 the probability of detecting occupancy given it is not in the abundant state p 2 the probability of detecting occupancy given it is in the abundant state and δ the probability of detecting the abundant state given that the species was detected and the true state was abundant we used intercept only models for all parameters and allowed p 1 and p 2 to be estimated separately we calculated the probability of a site being in the abundant state as ψ1 ψ2 and the probability of being unoccupied as 1 ψ1 we restricted our trends evaluations to simulations that resulted in a true decline in simulated abundances to test for a true decline we used a generalized linear model with a poisson distribution and modeled the maximum abundance across visits for the occupied sites first year only as a function of year a true decline was any iteration that found a statistically significant decline in simulated true abundances α 0 05 0 1 to evaluate our ability to estimate trends in abundance across primary occasions using a random site design with single season multistate occupancy models we included a year covariate on ψ2 to evaluate our ability to estimate trends in abundance across primary occasions with a fixed site design we used dynamic multistate occupancy models in rmark to model transition probabilities from state 2 to state 1 ψ b a and from state 1 to state 0 ψ a 0 we fixed all other transition probabilities to zero because we did not expect for example transitions to occur from absent to present given our simulations were focused on declining trends for fixed site and random site simulations we tracked power the proportion of simulation replicates where the parameter estimate was negative i e declining trend and statistically significant α 0 05 0 1 2 3 1 convergence for all iterations we excluded results if parameter estimates did not converge we ascribed this if parameter standard errors were zero or larger than 10 on the logit scale because p 2 is often large near or at 1 on the real scale due to the strong relationship among n p and the number of individuals in the count data bayley and peterson 2001 royle and nichols 2003 we did not apply this rule to the standard error for p 2 standard errors are inestimable by their nature if the parameter is at a boundary we tracked the proportion of simulations that converged for each scenario we ran each scenario until we had 500 replicates that converged or for a minimum of 100 replicates where the time exceeded 30 minutes we report scenarios where fewer than 100 replicates converged 2 4 inference on important relationships for each set of simulations defining the abundant state heterogeneity trend with random site design and fixed site design we assessed which simulation parameters most affected bias or power also convergence see the supporting information for details we evaluated the relative importance of parameters using ensemble regression trees with the randomforest package in r using the default settings liaw and wiener 2002 we tracked permutation importance a metric that describes the relative explanatory ability of variables to estimate variable importance we report the average relativized importance across ten random forest models cutler et al 2012 we discuss important variables as those with a minimum relative importance of 0 10 2 5 data diagnostics see the supporting information 3 results 3 1 single season heterogeneity low levels of spatial heterogeneity resulted in unacceptable levels of bias but otherwise the estimator performed well fig 2 a medium levels resulted in a small positive bias on average while high or very high levels resulted in a small negative bias this mix of positive and negative bias was due to defining a single threshold cutoff optimized across our varying levels of heterogeneity whereas as a threshold could be optimized for specific levels of heterogeneity see data diagnostics in the supporting information increasing the number of visits or sites did not lower bias in a consistent fashion fig 2b within site heterogeneity had little impact on the ability of multistate occupancy models to estimate the proportion of sites in the abundant state mean bias with no within site heterogeneity was 0 007 and with very high levels was 0 001 across levels of spatial heterogeneity increasing within site heterogeneity from none to very high levels shifted bias to be more positive fig 2c increasing the number of sites or visits did not lower bias in a consistent fashion fig 2d 3 2 power to detect a trend 3 2 1 random site design power to detect a trend for the years comparison with the random site design was low on average x 0 33 at α 0 10 fig 3 a to detect a declining trend large population decreases were needed mean power across 2 year scenarios with 5 and 10 decreases was 0 10 while for 10 year simulations mean power was 0 41 for 5 annual decreases 40 total decline from year 1 to year 10 and 0 69 for 10 annual decreases 65 total decline besides the large impact of overall declines number of years and population decrease increasing the number of sites improved power the most followed by lower levels of spatial heterogeneity fig 3b 3c table s1 and fig s4 in the supporting information power was low using the random site design to detect a population decline as much as 40 between two time periods mean power for a decrease of 5 was 0 10 for 10 it was 0 10 for 20 it was 0 13 and for 40 it was 0 22 at α 0 10 fig 3a c the number of sites influenced power the most followed by the population decline spatial heterogeneity and the number of visits fig 3b table s1 all effects were small and positive except spatial heterogeneity which had a small negative effect fig 3c 3 2 2 fixed site design across scenarios for 2 and 10 year periods with 5 and 10 declines when using a fixed site design mean power to detect a declining trend was on average higher for the non abundant to unoccupied state transition 0 71 at α 0 10 0 65 at α 0 05 than for the abundant to non abundant state transition 0 64 at α 0 10 0 62 at α 0 05 thus we focus on power to detect a trend in the non abundant to unoccupied state transition at α 0 10 mean power was high for 10 year 0 92 and moderate for 2 year simulations 0 50 fig 3a besides the number of years varying sites mean true abundance visits and within site heterogeneity impacted power the most fig 3b table s1 and fig s5 in the supporting information power was highest when within site heterogeneity was zero fig 3c for two periods again mean power was greater for the non abundant to unoccupied state transition 0 48 at α 0 10 0 39 at α 0 05 than the abundant to non abundant state transition 0 29 at α 0 10 0 26 at α 0 05 focusing on the non abundant to unoccupied transition the amount of decline for a two year period had little impact on power fig 3b the number of sites followed by varying mean true abundance visits and within site heterogeneity impacted power the most fig 3b table s1 in the supporting information increasing sites increased power while increasing visits lowered it fig 3c the minimum of 100

information 3 4 convergence see the supporting information 3 5 data diagnostics see the supporting information 4 discussion conservation decisions are often based on differentiating areas of higher animal populations from lower and with detecting trends they rarely require information on total abundance nichols and williams 2006 therefore we evaluated the ability of multistate occupancy models that differentiate relatively low and high abundance states to detect spatial variation in abundance or a declining trend in the face of low individual detection probability and unexplained heterogeneity in true abundance between visits we found not surprisingly that this approach would not be appropriate if sites differ little in their true abundance levels we otherwise found that this approach could be used to differentiate sites with relatively high abundance from sites with relatively low abundance even in the face of high levels of individual movement deaths or recruitment among visits multistate occupancy models also had a good ability to detect a declining trend if the same sites were surveyed each year i e the fixed site design especially when more sites were surveyed the good performance of the estimator for differentiating relative abundance patterns among sites under high within site heterogeneity is likely at least partly due to our definition of true abundance we defined true abundance based on the maximum abundance across visits describing the so called super population schwarz and arnason 1996 williams et al 2011 which included the surrounding area from which animals moved into and out of the site when we lack closure during abundance estimation we are in fact always estimating super population abundance kendall 1999 classing a site in a relatively abundant or non abundant state based on the maximum count therefore did not generate any additional bias between the true superpopulation abundant state and the estimate however if we had based true abundance on that from the first visit instead of the maximum across visits we would have likely found that bias increased with increasing within site heterogeneity while we tried to mitigate false positive classifications of the abundant state by choosing a reasonable optimal threshold for classing counts as abundant this did not eliminate this set of misclassed observations fig 1 1 this violates a key assumption of standard occupancy models the effect of these false positives is to produce positively biased estimates sampling more simply worsens this problem the more you sample the worse you do kéry and royle 2020 this was apparent as we increased the number of visits to sites and although the pattern is less clear may also be why increasing the number of sites did not decrease bias in single season models fig 2b d this problem was less or not at all apparent in our evaluation of the power to detect a trend where increasing sites positively impacted power and increasing visits often did fig 3 when sites are randomly selected each year spatial heterogeneity is not seen by a statistical model as explicitly spatial given variation is likely occurring within and among sites thus any temporal signal needs to overcome the reduction in precision caused by the spatial heterogeneity to register as statistically significant larsen et al 2001 in other words a random site study design can only detect declines that are large we found this to be the case in our multistate occupancy model simulations where we only had good power to detect a decline in our 10 year simulations which was improved by lower spatial heterogeneity and higher annual population declines in additional simulations we found that a very large number of sites n 300 allowed declines of 40 to be detected power 0 8 across two periods with a medium level of spatial heterogeneity if spatial heterogeneity was very high many more sites were needed n 1 000 fig s7 in the supporting information many studies report that large declines are needed in order to detect a statistically significant trend for example in one study a 50 decline in occupancy could be detected for only 22 of a large taxonomically diverse suite of species 136 species of birds reptiles and mammals southwell et al 2019 studies using density estimates or abundance indices reported needing large declines 64 for tropical bats meyer et al 2010 note power cutoff was 0 9 greater than 40 for the sonoran desert tortoise zylstra et al 2010 power was 0 43 to detect a 40 decline and greater than 50 for 70 of 127 marine mammal species taylor et al 2007 with the relatively precise abundance estimates from mark recapture or spatial mark recapture methods but see green et al 2020 the minimum decrease detectable was 45 for a population of dolphins cantor et al 2012 and ranged from 20 80 for asian bears morin et al 2022 using a fixed site design analyzed with dynamic multistate occupancy models we could detect declines of 5 40 between two periods in 20 of the scenarios we looked at power 0 8 with 10 years of 5 10 annual declines we had relatively high power 0 75 across all scenarios supporting information fig s5a power appeared unaffected by the actual amount of the population decline using a fixed site design fig 3 indicating that the increase in power from two to ten years was due to an increased ability to estimate transition probabilities with the repeated samples i e a greater sample size and not because declines themselves were large i e 10 annual declines produce 65 declines after 10 years when animals are solitary and hard to find occupancy based trends analysis can be appropriate our results indicate that when counts of animals vary between sites multistate occupancy models can be sensitive to relatively small declines in abundance while we only looked at two relative abundance states more relative abundance states might increase the sensitivity of this model we used a three state multistate occupancy model as this parameterization allowed us to account for potential misclassifications in the observation data via the δ parameter nichols et al 2007 although more complicated parameterizations can be considered more data would be needed to achieve model convergence fig s2 s3 and results in the supporting information this is especially true when trying to estimate trends in abundance across years in our trend simulations convergence rates ranged from low to high fig s3 in the supporting information decreasing with increasing model complexity lower for the more complex dynamic multistate occupancy model and increasing with number of years and sites this supports the notion that even in the simplest of cases a multistate dynamic occupancy model requires substantial data to be fitted while we opted to fit our model using a frequentist statistical approach better convergence could possibly be achieved using a bayesian approach where information can be borrowed across parameters kéry and schaub 2011 5 conclusion based on our simulations multistate occupancy models are able to model varying spatial abundance patterns and detect declining trends where n mixture models fail in particular dynamic multistate occupancy models utilizing surveys conducted at the same sites from year to year fixed site design were effective at detecting declining trends especially with more years and sites fig s7 in the supporting information by utilizing data diagnostic summaries icc qcv spatial mmc0 along with study design elements i e number of visits sites and years users can evaluate for a given dataset whether bias in the estimated proportion of abundant sites will be low and or the likelihood they will be able to detect a declining trend should one exist fig s6 in the supporting information credit authorship contribution statement valerie a steen conceptualization formal analysis methodology validation visualization

24239,digibog is a numerical model that simulates peat accumulation in temperate peatlands here we modify digibog for boreal peatlands digibog boreal by accounting for snow cover short growing seasons and groundwater exchanges between the peat and the aquifer digibog boreal is then used to replicate 6500 years of peat accumulation at two high boreal latitude peatlands in quebec canada digibog boreal was driven with a weather generator and climate models while peat cores from the sites were used to develop initial conditions and calibrate digibog boreal our results demonstrate that digibog boreal can replicate well peat thickness and age depth profiles but cannot produce long term fluctuations in water table depths here a possible explanation for digibog boreal s underperformance is the stability in the climatic drivers and less likely the new model developments the results also indicate that peat decomposition and accumulation in digibog boreal are sensitive to water stored on the peat surface keywords peatland digibog model high boreal latitudes ecohydrology holocene carbon dynamics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction peatlands form where net primary production exceeds organic matter decomposition resulting in the accumulation of peat and carbon c wieder and vitt 2006 northern peatlands in temperate boreal and arctic regions cover 3 7 0 5 million km2 and store 415 150 pg of c hugelius et al 2020 globally the majority of peatlands are found in the boreal biome joosten and clarke 2002 where 15 of the land cover is peatland xu et al 2018 numerical models are useful in helping to identify the processes and conditions that underpin peatland development regional to global scale models chaudhary et al 2017 müller and joos 2020 have been applied to boreal peatlands and provide a mesoscale 100 s km view of carbon stock changes but they lack the fine spatial resolution tens of m needed to represent variations in peat properties and landscape setting both of which can strongly influence peatland hydrological processes and peatland development e g qiu et al 2019 models that can be applied at the finer scale of individual peatlands include digibog holocene peat model hpm and mpeat baird et al 2012 frolking et al 2010 mahdiyasa et al 2021 morris et al 2012 with the exception of digibog these models reduce an entire peatland into a single column of peat i e they are one dimensional however although digibog can simulate peatlands in two and three dimensions it was built for temperate climates and cannot account for snow cover and the short growing seasons found in boreal regions unlike hpm treat et al 2021 therefore we updated digibog to create a new version of the model digibog boreal which we describe here we also report on the application of the two dimensional version of digibog boreal to two high boreal peatlands in northeastern canada finally we comment on the difficulties of reconstructing past boundary conditions required to drive the model and the effect of boundary condition uncertainty on model accuracy 2 study area the two peatlands used to test digibog boreal are located in separate watersheds north of the otish mountains in north central quebec they were originally selected to document their current hydrological dynamics lambert et al 2022 and holocene ecohydrological trajectories in response to climate variations robitaille et al 2021 these peatlands are called misask 52 43 27 n 72 12 50 w and cheinu 52 38 48 n 72 11 31 w and have areas of 0 102 and 0 148 km2 respectively fig 1 a b both sites are in the dfc cold no dry season cold summer class of the köppen geiger climate map produced by beck et al 2018 misask is partially patterned with a microtopography of alternating low hummocks lawns wet hollows and pools covering approximately 10 of its total area robitaille et al 2021 cheinu is characterized by a patterned surface with elongated and parallel pools covering up to 60 of the total area both peatlands have developed in local depressions within the post glacial landscape and are underlain by boulders and sand filled interstices inherited from till leaching fig 1c d both sites are dominated by sphagnum spp and show evidence of recent lateral peatland expansion robitaille et al 2021 carex spp and trichophorum cespitosum are the herbaceous species mostly found in depressions while ericaceous taxa like chamaedaphne calyculata and kalmia angustifolia are located on strings robitaille et al 2021 along the edges of the sites there are black spruce picea mariana and larch larix laricina trees 3 methods and data 3 1 developing digibog boreal digibog is a process based model of peatland development baird et al 2012 morris et al 2012 and has been applied to northern temperate peatlands young et al 2017 digibog has submodels that simulate plant litter production peat decomposition peat hydraulic properties and water table behavior fig 2 the new version digibog boreal considers the effects of a boreal climate on peatland development by 1 limiting plant production and so the formation of new litter to the growing season based on growing season temperatures and water table behavior 2 limiting peat decomposition to the growing season in a similar manner and 3 including a representation of snow accumulation and melt which are important parts of the hydrological cycle in the boreal biome fig 2 in common with the earlier versions of digibog described by baird et al 2012 morris et al 2012 and young et al 2017 digibog boreal represents a peatland as multiple adjacent columns of peat between which water can flow in response to local water table gradients peat properties can vary vertically within individual columns each column has layers or horizontally between them the initial condition of the model is a mineral soil topography upon which peat subsequently accumulates if conditions allow litter production depends on air temperature and water table depth below the surface with cohorts of new litter being added annually to the top of each column the peat surface at the rate p kg m 2 yr 1 morris et al 2015 annual average air temperatures for boreal peatlands are usually less than 0 c garneau et al 2014 moore 1989 and would result in no litter production if digibog s existing plant productivity function was used this is because the function is based on data from a peatland in an oceanic temperate climate with long growing seasons therefore digibog s annual litter production equation morris et al 2015 was modified to reflect the temperature of the growing season under boreal conditions and the proportion of the year occupied by the growing season the modified litter production equation thus becomes 1 p 0 001 9 3 133 z g s 0 022 100 z g s 2 2 0 1575 t a v e g s 0 0091 t g s for 0 m z gs 0 668 m and p 0 where z gs 0 668 m where the average growing season temperature tavegs c replaces average annual air temperature average growing season oxic zone thickness given by water table depth zgs m replaces average annual oxic zone thickness and litter production is reduced by the proportion of the year occupied by the growing season tgs constants in the litter production equation presented in morris et al 2015 remain unchanged and were derived from empirical data sets belyea and clymo 2001 breeuwer et al 2008 peat decomposition in digibog boreal is also dependent on air temperature water table depth and the recalcitrance of peat the latter increases as peat becomes more decomposed young et al 2017 decomposition is calculated on a weekly time scale as a change in each peat layer s mass mt kg m 2 as opposed to year round decomposition in digibog digibog boreal assumes that decomposition only occurs during the growing season calculated on a weekly basis hence digibog s peat decomposition equation was modified to the following 2 m t m t 1 o x e δ t m o x α o x t b c q 10 t a v e g s t b c 10 a n e δ t m a n α a n t b c q 10 t a v e g s t b c 10 where the average growing season temperature tavegs c replaces average annual air temperature the remaining parameters are unchanged and include ox and an as the proportions of the layer occurring above and below the water table respectively αox and αan are user set decay parameters for oxic and anoxic conditions q 10 is a temperature sensitivity parameter tbc 6 29 c is a baseline temperature and mox and man are user set degrees of recalcitrance for peat under oxic and anoxic conditions morris et al 2015 water movement in digibog boreal occurs between peat columns at sub hourly time steps to maintain numerical stability water movement is affected by changes in peat saturated hydraulic conductivity which changes according to the degree of peat decomposition young et al 2017 water is also allowed to pond on the surface of a modelled peatland to a depth defined by the user see baird et al 2012 and once the stored water exceeds the threshold depth it is lost from the model domain which is akin to rapid overland flow to the peatland margin groundwater recharge is based on net precipitation which is rainfall snowmelt evapotranspiration in high latitude boreal peatlands in northern quebec surficial peat seasonally freezes kingsbury and moore 1987 and large amounts of snowmelt occur at the onset of the growing season quinton and roulet 1998 our modelled peatland subsurface received no precipitation during the winter because the surface of the peatland was assumed frozen snowfall simply accumulates during the period where temperatures are 0 c and snowmelt is added to precipitation in the spring when temperatures rise above freezing digibog boreal does not explicitly model snow processes and a separate snowmelt model is used as explained in section 3 2 2 3 2 digibog boreal setup for the study sites for this study digibog boreal was driven with modelled climate data we used field observations to establish initial conditions and to calibrate the model fig s1 3 2 1 atmospheric boundary conditions in 2016 three peat cores were obtained at each site fig 1a d for paleoenvironmental reconstructions see robitaille et al 2021 for more details radiocarbon dates from the base of these cores indicate that the misask and cheinu peatlands initiated at least 6500 calibrated years before present cal yr bp therefore time series inputs for digibog boreal ran from 6500 cal yr bp to 2016 common era ce climate inputs to digibog boreal are time series of net precipitation at a weekly resolution and average growing season temperature per annum actual evapotranspiration aet was not used in the net precipitation calculation but potential evapotranspiration pet was used instead at our sites the difference between pet and aet should be minimal because observed water table depths are shallow 7 cm and at these depths pet is approximately the same as aet e g kim and verma 1996 wu et al 2010 to obtain climate inputs for digibog boreal we used the awe gen weather generator model fatichi et al 2013 2011 that enables the simulation of precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration while preserving the cross correlations between the simulated variables the model was first calibrated for the present period and then its parameters were modified using information from climate models with the factors of change fc approach e g moraga et al 2021 to simulate the climate conditions of the past fatichi et al 2021 the model was calibrated with era5 climate re analysis data hersbach et al 2020 for the period 1981 to ce 2019 and validated with adjusted daily precipitation and temperature from 1943 to ce 1983 wang et al 2017 acquired from the nearest weather station nitchequon which lies 100 km northeast from misask and cheinu fig s2 a b the use of different data for calibration and validation ensures the independence of the validation procedure modelled monthly pet was calibrated with pet derived from daily anusplin temperature 1950 2017 ce mckenney et al 2011 using the hamon method hamon 1961 as proposed by oudin et al 2005 fig s2 c the general circulation model hadcm3 gordon et al 2000 valdes et al 2017 provided the underlying climate from 6500 cal yr bp to ce 1950 for the awe gen paleoclimate reconstruction two fc were used a difference in air temperature between the reference period 1950 ce 15 yr and the simulated period and the ratio of average precipitation intensity between the two periods for further discussion on the fc method see peleg et al 2019 and moraga et al 2021 seasonal fc were computed at intervals of 500 years and applied on 50 year intervals using linear interpolation between each of the 500 year points fig s2 d e no fc for pet were computed because the awe gen modeled paleoclimate pet is directly conditioned on temperature the final output from our method was 6566 years of daily average temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration where 6500 cal yr bp to ce 1950 simulates the past climate and the calibrated period of 1950 to ce 2016 represents the present climate temperature thresholds were used to define the growing season at the sites as proposed by christidis et al 2007 thresholds for spring ts and autumn ta were applied to smoothed daily average temperatures determined with a low pass filter itsmr package version 1 9 in r version 3 6 1 to define the growing season while unsmoothed daily average temperatures were used to calculate the average growing season temperature fig s3 a the growing season begins on the first day when the smoothed daily average temperature is greater than ts and ends on the first day the smoothed daily average temperature is less than ta for our sites the onset of spring and the end of autumn used temperature thresholds of ts 10 c lottes and ziegler 1994 and ta 6 c fig s3 a the capacity of these thresholds to determine the growing season was tested using 7000 years of awe gen present day climate 1981 2019 ce smoothed with a low pass filter the resulting growing seasons 1 mostly start in early june and end in late september 2 have lengths between 95 and 123 days and 3 average temperatures near 12 c fig s3 b d for our sites the temperature threshold method employed produced present day growing season lengths that are comparable to those derived using machine learning methods 81 100 days pedlar et al 2015 these thresholds were applied to the 6566 years of daily average temperatures to determine the average growing season temperature and the weeks of the year for growing season commencement and conclusion 3 2 2 hydrological boundary conditions snowmelt contributes to the growing season hydrology of misask and cheinu and was modelled using a degree day method ddm developed in the machbv hydrological model samuel et al 2011 a ddm was chosen because it has low data requirements and parameter values for the lagrande river catchment located 50 km north of our study site were available as a starting point for model calibration agnihotri and coulibaly 2020 table s1 the ddm requires average daily precipitation and temperature observations as input and produces modelled rainfall snowfall and snowmelt as output for model calibration table s1 the ddm was driven with 7000 years of awe gen present day climate 1981 2019 ce the ddm modelled rainfall and snow water equivalent swe were compared to weather observations measured at the nitchequon weather station from 1943 to ce 1983 wang et al 2017 the calibrated ddm adequately replicated the weekly fig s4 a b and annual fig s4 d e rainfall and swe moreover the modelled snowmelt began in april peaked in may and concluded in june fig s4 c and this timing was mirrored in hydrographs obtained from a gaging station 200 km downstream from the study site fig s4 c to determine past and present day daily rainfall and snowmelt the calibrated ddm model was driven with the 6566 years of simulated daily average temperature and precipitation modelled snowmelt and rainfall were combined with evapotranspiration to produce net precipitation and resampled to a weekly resolution for input into digibog boreal fig s1 for the misask and cheinu peatlands exchanges of water between the peat and the underlying aquifer were included because lambert et al 2022 showed that both sites are flow through peatlands receiving groundwater at their upstream portions and discharging water to the aquifer at their downstream limit groundwater fluxes in digibog boreal were replicated by removing or adding a constant rate of water flow from each column of peat throughout the simulation groundwater fluxes along the transect were determined by linearly interpolating values between the endpoints with minimum and maximum amounts of groundwater flux fig s5 a b for example a simulation with 100 mm yr 1 groundwater flux would gain 100 mm yr 1 of groundwater at the most upslope location on the transect and lose 100 mm yr 1 of groundwater at the most downslope location in total five scenarios were tested for each site fig s5 a b with 0 25 50 75 and 100 mm yr 1 of groundwater flux these values are based on field measurements and simulated fluxes estimated by lambert et al 2022 for all simulations and at both sites the digibog boreal calibration section 3 2 4 used the 100 mm yr 1 groundwater flux the remaining scenarios were applied to the calibrated model to determine the sensitivity of digibog boreal to groundwater fluxes 3 2 3 initial conditions in ce 2016 peat thicknesses were surveyed at misask n 116 locations and cheinu n 167 via manual probing robitaille et al 2021 additionally a 1 m spatial resolution digital elevation model dem was produced for each site by applying photogrammetric methods to approximately 2500 overlapping images acquired from a drone lambert et al 2022 peat thickness data were spatially interpolated using the topo to raster function in arcgis 10 5 to produce peat depth maps and the top of the mineral soil at each site was inferred by subtracting peat depths from the dem lambert et al 2022 downward sloping transects that nearly intersect each core and terminated near the peatland boundary were digitized for each site fig 1a b transects were also chosen such that lateral flows perpendicular to them were minimal this reduces the possibility that transects are accumulating or shedding flow the transect length for misask was 432 m and 282 m for cheinu along these transects mineral surface elevation was extracted with a horizontal resolution of 6 m and resulted in 75 and 50 interacting peat columns for misask and cheinu respectively fig 1c d these mineral surfaces were representative of the landscape at 6500 cal yr bp and were the initial conditions for the digibog boreal simulations the upslope end of each transect was set to have no flow neumann condition and the downslope end a constant water level with respect to the peat surface a dirichlet condition 3 2 4 calibration for both sites measurements obtained from the ce 2016 field campaign and follow up laboratory work were used to calibrate digibog boreal the data that were used were 1 present day 2016 ce peat heights across the transect extracted from the dem fig 1c d 2 peat chronologies age depth curves 3 reconstructed water table depths wtd and 4 a measure of peat mass remaining in the model the degree to which peat has decayed or decomposed is given for each layer as the current mass of the layer divided by its original mass this is what we term as peat mass remaining items 2 and 3 above were obtained for three cores per site and item 4 from cores m c2 and cc1 fig 1a b the cores were 114 199 cm long and spanned the period from 6476 cal yr bp to ce 2016 radiocarbon dating was performed on 43 peat samples from the cores to develop peat age depth models and analyzed at 4 cm intervals to reconstruct wtd carbon to nitrogen ratios c n a proxy for peat mass remaining was measured for cores m c2 and cc1 see robitaille et al 2021 for methods the parameters that were calibrated in digibog boreal were 1 rate of oxic αox and anoxic αan peat decomposition 2 degree of peat recalcitrance under oxic mox and anoxic man conditions and 3 ponding thickness see section 3 1 table s2 contains the parameters that were not calibrated for both sites trial and error calibration was performed across the period 6500 cal yr bp to ce 2016 and was guided by reducing the weighted mean normalized root mean squared error wmnrmse between observed and modelled values using the following equation 3 w m n r m s e 0 5 n r m s e p h 0 056 n r m s e p a 1 0 056 n r m s e p a 2 0 056 n r m s e p a 3 0 056 n r m s e w t d 1 0 056 n r m s e w t d 2 0 056 n r m s e w t d 3 0 167 n r m s e m r where the normalized root mean squared error nrmse is expressed as a percentage with a value of zero being optimal and is calculated using the present day peat heights across the transect nrmseph peat age depth profiles nrmsepa wtd nrmsewtd and peat mass remaining nrmsemr weights for the wmnrmse were 0 5 for peat heights which places greater importance on matching the present day peat surface and the remaining weights were evenly distributed across the remaining variables 4 results 4 1 climate weather and snowmelt model table 1 provides summary statistics for the hydrological and meteorological variables aggregated to an annual resolution from the data that drove all digibog boreal simulations at both sites fig 3 a g overall across the entire period the simulated climate becomes noticeably wetter and warmer with minimal changes in snowmelt evapotranspiration average growing season temperature and growing season length table 1 from 6500 cal yr bp to ce 1850 the climate is cooler than present with shorter growing seasons table 1 recent changes from ce 1850 to ce 2016 include a noticeable increase in average annual temperature average growing season temperature and growing season length table 1 throughout this recent period changes in net precipitation are negligible because increases in rainfall are largely offset by increases in evapotranspiration and decreases in snowmelt table 1 4 2 digibog boreal 4 2 1 calibration table 2 summarizes the optimal model parameterizations and corresponding model error at both sites for simulations with small run 1 and large run 2 ponding thicknesses overall the cheinu simulations were marginally better than the misask simulations and the run 1 parameterisations performed better than the run 2 s table 2 for both sites and all runs peat heights and peat ages were better replicated than wtd and peat mass remaining table 2 at misask for both run 1 and 2 midslope peat heights were adequately replicated while upslope peat heights were slightly underestimated and downslope peat heights were substantially overestimated fig 4 a c table 3 overall digibog boreal does quite well for peat height replication at cheinu peat heights for both runs at cheinu were replicated well in the upslope and midslope with a slight overestimation in the downslope fig 5 a c table 3 peat age depth values from simulated profiles at misask fig 6 contained curvature while simulated profiles from cheinu were mostly linear in shape fig 7 at both sites the run 1 parameterisations were on average somewhat better at replicating observed peat age depth profiles than run 2 s table 2 digibog boreal reproduced well peat age depth profiles for misask s midslope core mc 2 and lateral core ml 2 fig 6 and cheinu s downslope core cl 1 fig 7 at all core locations the simulated wtds were mostly within one standard deviation of the observed mean wtds but major changes in observed wtds were not captured by digibog boreal figs 6 7 misask run 1 and 2 and cheinu run 1 produced wtds that largely remained stable in contrast the lateral cores cl 1 and cl 2 from cheinu run 2 had wtds that started above the peat surface and then deepened while wtds at the central core were above the peat surface and stable fig 7 at misask 1 below 120 cm the simulated peat decomposition was overestimated rmse 22 percentage points pp while decomposition in shallower layers was underestimated rmse 25 pp fig 6 misask run 2 did not replicate observed peat decomposition well rmse 36 pp

i e less decomposed peat have wtds that are frequently shallow or above the peat surface figs 4 5 in the misask runs peat mass remaining generally decreases with peat depth fig 4a c while the cheinu runs have many layers of less decomposed peat overlain by highly decomposed peat e g fig 5c downslope overall the run 1 s at both sites have less preserved more uniform peat with deeper less variable water tables than the run 2 s table 3 figs 4 5 s6 s7 all runs at both sites have the highest peat mass on the midslope less mass on the downslope and the lowest mass on the upslope table 3 figs 4a c and 5a c additionally wtd are shallowest on the midslopes and deeper on the downslopes and upslopes table 3 figs 4b d 5b d and figs s6 s7 4 2 3 sensitivity to the groundwater flux boundary condition at both sites run 1 peat heights responded to changes in groundwater flux when compared to simulations with no groundwater flux figs 8 9 top row upslope peat height gains occurred where additions of groundwater resulted in shallower average wtds during the growing season conversely downslope peat height was thinner where groundwater flux reductions produced deeper average wtds during the growing season in these run 1 s the magnitude of peat height change was commensurate with the amount of groundwater flux added or subtracted from the profile figs 8 9 top row the greatest change in peat heights occurred under groundwater flux scenarios of 100 mm yr 1 for example under this scenario the misask run 1 transect had a cumulative gain in peat height of 249 cm on the upslope and a cumulative loss in peat height of 211 cm in the downslope similarly the cheinu run 1 transect had a cumulative peat height gain of 181 cm in the upslope and a cumulative peat height loss of 90 cm loss on the downslope the response of misask run 2 to groundwater flux was minimal fig 8 bottom row with only the extreme ends of the profile exhibiting changes in peat height and average growing season wtds peat heights on the upslope section of cheinu run 2 responded positively to the addition of groundwater except for a column of peat 54 m from the upslope end of the profile fig 9 bottom row at this location when compared to the simulation with no groundwater flux the addition of groundwater raises the water table nearer or above the peat surface which reduces litter production and produces thinner peat fig 9 bottom row moreover in cheinu run 2 groundwater losses on the downslope had a diminished effect on peat heights 5 discussion overall the performance of the new model is mixed in some of the simulations the peat thickness is simulated quite well both cheinu simulations as are individual age depth curves e g misask mc 2 and ml 2 both runs and mass remaining curves good pattern matches for cheinu both runs in contrast water table depths are not well simulated all runs the performance of the model could have been improved if we had expanded the calibration to include i more parameters and ii the model s climatic driving data and the groundwater exchange boundary condition however extending the calibration carries the risk of it becoming a curve fitting exercise which is of limited value in assessing the model s fidelity nevertheless it is possible to identify ways in which the model and or its climatic driving data could be enhanced in the case of the latter it is likely that the variations in measured water table depths are caused by climatic excursions that are not included in our climatic driving data which change little through time fig 3 previous work with digibog has shown that modelled water tables are sensitive to variations in climate e g morris et al 2015 and we would expect the same in digibog boreal paleoclimatic episodes can be difficult to represent in driving data that are based solely on contemporary meteorological data and climate model hindcasts as is the case here therefore it seems likely that a lack of detail in the driving data rather than deficiencies in the model itself explains the poor fit between modelled and observed water tables below we discuss ways in which the model itself might be improved in the model simulated degree of decomposition and peat thickness are sensitive to surface water storage figs 4 and 5 oxic zone thickness affects both the addition of plant litter to a peat column and the decay of peat within it and is partly controlled by the size of the surface water store as set by the model user for example if the surface ponding level is set to a high value more water is stored on the peatland during and after snowmelt and this storage offsets water losses during periods of low net rainfall ensuring water tables remain near the surface however litter production and peat decay in the model interact in a complicated way with water table depth for example similar peat thicknesses may be attained for i moderate water table depths where rates of both litter production and decay are relatively high and ii shallow water table depths where production and decay are both quite low similar peat thicknesses can be seen between the different surface ponding runs for both sites but the peat profile is very different in terms of degree of decay the mass remaining for example for misask similar peat thicknesses are predicted for the transect between 130 m and 200 m but the peat in the shallow ponding run is much more decayed less mass remaining fig 4 nevertheless changes in surface storage do translate into differences in peat thickness and c storage as can be seen for the beginning 0 50 m and end beyond 400 m of the misask transect fig 4 therefore the depth to which surface water is allowed to pond can alter the simulated carbon balance a better understanding of surface water storage and flow in these peatlands could help improve our results model performance may be enhanced by allowing different depths of water to be stored across different parts of the peatland representing local surface gradients and topographic features such as hollows and ridges additionally there may be merit in explicitly modeling surface water flow within the peatland using an overland flow equation digibog boreal does not explicitly represent different plant functional types pfts i e in the model litter production and decay work at the level of the plant assemblage which is assumed to be that typical of a bog in future versions of the model it may be desirable to represent several pfts that differ from each other in rates of litter production and in litter susceptibility to decay such changes may lead to better predictions of the downcore mass remaining and age depth curves an important control on pft is the water source fen pfts such as some sedge species may be found in shallow peats and where some of the water supplied to the peatland is minerotrophic such as groundwater however simulating shifts in pft abundance can be challenging at sites such as misask and cheinu because of large uncertainties in groundwater exchanges with the peatlands over the centuries and millennia during which the peatlands develop see fig 8 and associated discussion therefore we chose to use a simple approach to represent peatland vegetation in the first version of digibog boreal and focused instead on other controls on peatland development growing season and snow melt notwithstanding these possible upgrades and the limitations of the driving data in this test application the new version of digibog already extends the model s capabilities these capabilities suggest the approach we used here to model past peat accumulation could be used in concert with contemporary field measurements such as c fluxes and water table depths and climate projections to explore the effects of land use and climate change on boreal peatland c stocks 6 conclusions we present a new version of the digibog model of peatland development digibog boreal the new model includes routines to simulate processes specific to boreal ecosystems particularly changes to reflect the accumulation and melt of a seasonal snowpack and changes to the routines that govern peat accumulation to account for shorter growing seasons than in temperate ecosystems like previous versions of digibog the new model provides a detailed spatially distributed representation of peat accumulation along a transect we parameterised the model for two peatlands in high boreal latitudes of eastern canada simulating peat development over the last 6500 years the model setups are informed by detailed field surveys that describe the topography of the mineral substrate upon which peat has accumulated and radiocarbon dates from the base of the peat to the surface climatic driving data are provided by a general circulation model combined with modern climate data using a weather generator the model can be parameterised so that simulated peat thickness agrees well with observed peat profiles in both sites simulated peat accumulation is sensitive to the parameters used to represent the storage of water on the surface of the peat which should therefore be well informed by field measurements simulated water table depths and age depth profiles can be compared to palaeohydrological conditions and radiocarbon age depth profiles respectively reconstructed from proxy data at the two sites in these respects the model performs less well than for peat thickness although we suspect this represents a lack of detail in the climatic driving data rather than deficiencies in the model s routines overall the model provides a suitable means to simulate the development of boreal peatlands and may find utility in simulating the response of such ecosystems to future climate and land use

24239,digibog is a numerical model that simulates peat accumulation in temperate peatlands here we modify digibog for boreal peatlands digibog boreal by accounting for snow cover short growing seasons and groundwater exchanges between the peat and the aquifer digibog boreal is then used to replicate 6500 years of peat accumulation at two high boreal latitude peatlands in quebec canada digibog boreal was driven with a weather generator and climate models while peat cores from the sites were used to develop initial conditions and calibrate digibog boreal our results demonstrate that digibog boreal can replicate well peat thickness and age depth profiles but cannot produce long term fluctuations in water table depths here a possible explanation for digibog boreal s underperformance is the stability in the climatic drivers and less likely the new model developments the results also indicate that peat decomposition and accumulation in digibog boreal are sensitive to water stored on the peat surface keywords peatland digibog model high boreal latitudes ecohydrology holocene carbon dynamics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction peatlands form where net primary production exceeds organic matter decomposition resulting in the accumulation of peat and carbon c wieder and vitt 2006 northern peatlands in temperate boreal and arctic regions cover 3 7 0 5 million km2 and store 415 150 pg of c hugelius et al 2020 globally the majority of peatlands are found in the boreal biome joosten and clarke 2002 where 15 of the land cover is peatland xu et al 2018 numerical models are useful in helping to identify the processes and conditions that underpin peatland development regional to global scale models chaudhary et al 2017 müller and joos 2020 have been applied to boreal peatlands and provide a mesoscale 100 s km view of carbon stock changes but they lack the fine spatial resolution tens of m needed to represent variations in peat properties and landscape setting both of which can strongly influence peatland hydrological processes and peatland development e g qiu et al 2019 models that can be applied at the finer scale of individual peatlands include digibog holocene peat model hpm and mpeat baird et al 2012 frolking et al 2010 mahdiyasa et al 2021 morris et al 2012 with the exception of digibog these models reduce an entire peatland into a single column of peat i e they are one dimensional however although digibog can simulate peatlands in two and three dimensions it was built for temperate climates and cannot account for snow cover and the short growing seasons found in boreal regions unlike hpm treat et al 2021 therefore we updated digibog to create a new version of the model digibog boreal which we describe here we also report on the application of the two dimensional version of digibog boreal to two high boreal peatlands in northeastern canada finally we comment on the difficulties of reconstructing past boundary conditions required to drive the model and the effect of boundary condition uncertainty on model accuracy 2 study area the two peatlands used to test digibog boreal are located in separate watersheds north of the otish mountains in north central quebec they were originally selected to document their current hydrological dynamics lambert et al 2022 and holocene ecohydrological trajectories in response to climate variations robitaille et al 2021 these peatlands are called misask 52 43 27 n 72 12 50 w and cheinu 52 38 48 n 72 11 31 w and have areas of 0 102 and 0 148 km2 respectively fig 1 a b both sites are in the dfc cold no dry season cold summer class of the köppen geiger climate map produced by beck et al 2018 misask is partially patterned with a microtopography of alternating low hummocks lawns wet hollows and pools covering approximately 10 of its total area robitaille et al 2021 cheinu is characterized by a patterned surface with elongated and parallel pools covering up to 60 of the total area both peatlands have developed in local depressions within the post glacial landscape and are underlain by boulders and sand filled interstices inherited from till leaching fig 1c d both sites are dominated by sphagnum spp and show evidence of recent lateral peatland expansion robitaille et al 2021 carex spp and trichophorum cespitosum are the herbaceous species mostly found in depressions while ericaceous taxa like chamaedaphne calyculata and kalmia angustifolia are located on strings robitaille et al 2021 along the edges of the sites there are black spruce picea mariana and larch larix laricina trees 3 methods and data 3 1 developing digibog boreal digibog is a process based model of peatland development baird et al 2012 morris et al 2012 and has been applied to northern temperate peatlands young et al 2017 digibog has submodels that simulate plant litter production peat decomposition peat hydraulic properties and water table behavior fig 2 the new version digibog boreal considers the effects of a boreal climate on peatland development by 1 limiting plant production and so the formation of new litter to the growing season based on growing season temperatures and water table behavior 2 limiting peat decomposition to the growing season in a similar manner and 3 including a representation of snow accumulation and melt which are important parts of the hydrological cycle in the boreal biome fig 2 in common with the earlier versions of digibog described by baird et al 2012 morris et al 2012 and young et al 2017 digibog boreal represents a peatland as multiple adjacent columns of peat between which water can flow in response to local water table gradients peat properties can vary vertically within individual columns each column has layers or horizontally between them the initial condition of the model is a mineral soil topography upon which peat subsequently accumulates if conditions allow litter production depends on air temperature and water table depth below the surface with cohorts of new litter being added annually to the top of each column the peat surface at the rate p kg m 2 yr 1 morris et al 2015 annual average air temperatures for boreal peatlands are usually less than 0 c garneau et al 2014 moore 1989 and would result in no litter production if digibog s existing plant productivity function was used this is because the function is based on data from a peatland in an oceanic temperate climate with long growing seasons therefore digibog s annual litter production equation morris et al 2015 was modified to reflect the temperature of the growing season under boreal conditions and the proportion of the year occupied by the growing season the modified litter production equation thus becomes 1 p 0 001 9 3 133 z g s 0 022 100 z g s 2 2 0 1575 t a v e g s 0 0091 t g s for 0 m z gs 0 668 m and p 0 where z gs 0 668 m where the average growing season temperature tavegs c replaces average annual air temperature average growing season oxic zone thickness given by water table depth zgs m replaces average annual oxic zone thickness and litter production is reduced by the proportion of the year occupied by the growing season tgs constants in the litter production equation presented in morris et al 2015 remain unchanged and were derived from empirical data sets belyea and clymo 2001 breeuwer et al 2008 peat decomposition in digibog boreal is also dependent on air temperature water table depth and the recalcitrance of peat the latter increases as peat becomes more decomposed young et al 2017 decomposition is calculated on a weekly time scale as a change in each peat layer s mass mt kg m 2 as opposed to year round decomposition in digibog digibog boreal assumes that decomposition only occurs during the growing season calculated on a weekly basis hence digibog s peat decomposition equation was modified to the following 2 m t m t 1 o x e δ t m o x α o x t b c q 10 t a v e g s t b c 10 a n e δ t m a n α a n t b c q 10 t a v e g s t b c 10 where the average growing season temperature tavegs c replaces average annual air temperature the remaining parameters are unchanged and include ox and an as the proportions of the layer occurring above and below the water table respectively αox and αan are user set decay parameters for oxic and anoxic conditions q 10 is a temperature sensitivity parameter tbc 6 29 c is a baseline temperature and mox and man are user set degrees of recalcitrance for peat under oxic and anoxic conditions morris et al 2015 water movement in digibog boreal occurs between peat columns at sub hourly time steps to maintain numerical stability water movement is affected by changes in peat saturated hydraulic conductivity which changes according to the degree of peat decomposition young et al 2017 water is also allowed to pond on the surface of a modelled peatland to a depth defined by the user see baird et al 2012 and once the stored water exceeds the threshold depth it is lost from the model domain which is akin to rapid overland flow to the peatland margin groundwater recharge is based on net precipitation which is rainfall snowmelt evapotranspiration in high latitude boreal peatlands in northern quebec surficial peat seasonally freezes kingsbury and moore 1987 and large amounts of snowmelt occur at the onset of the growing season quinton and roulet 1998 our modelled peatland subsurface received no precipitation during the winter because the surface of the peatland was assumed frozen snowfall simply accumulates during the period where temperatures are 0 c and snowmelt is added to precipitation in the spring when temperatures rise above freezing digibog boreal does not explicitly model snow processes and a separate snowmelt model is used as explained in section 3 2 2 3 2 digibog boreal setup for the study sites for this study digibog boreal was driven with modelled climate data we used field observations to establish initial conditions and to calibrate the model fig s1 3 2 1 atmospheric boundary conditions in 2016 three peat cores were obtained at each site fig 1a d for paleoenvironmental reconstructions see robitaille et al 2021 for more details radiocarbon dates from the base of these cores indicate that the misask and cheinu peatlands initiated at least 6500 calibrated years before present cal yr bp therefore time series inputs for digibog boreal ran from 6500 cal yr bp to 2016 common era ce climate inputs to digibog boreal are time series of net precipitation at a weekly resolution and average growing season temperature per annum actual evapotranspiration aet was not used in the net precipitation calculation but potential evapotranspiration pet was used instead at our sites the difference between pet and aet should be minimal because observed water table depths are shallow 7 cm and at these depths pet is approximately the same as aet e g kim and verma 1996 wu et al 2010 to obtain climate inputs for digibog boreal we used the awe gen weather generator model fatichi et al 2013 2011 that enables the simulation of precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration while preserving the cross correlations between the simulated variables the model was first calibrated for the present period and then its parameters were modified using information from climate models with the factors of change fc approach e g moraga et al 2021 to simulate the climate conditions of the past fatichi et al 2021 the model was calibrated with era5 climate re analysis data hersbach et al 2020 for the period 1981 to ce 2019 and validated with adjusted daily precipitation and temperature from 1943 to ce 1983 wang et al 2017 acquired from the nearest weather station nitchequon which lies 100 km northeast from misask and cheinu fig s2 a b the use of different data for calibration and validation ensures the independence of the validation procedure modelled monthly pet was calibrated with pet derived from daily anusplin temperature 1950 2017 ce mckenney et al 2011 using the hamon method hamon 1961 as proposed by oudin et al 2005 fig s2 c the general circulation model hadcm3 gordon et al 2000 valdes et al 2017 provided the underlying climate from 6500 cal yr bp to ce 1950 for the awe gen paleoclimate reconstruction two fc were used a difference in air temperature between the reference period 1950 ce 15 yr and the simulated period and the ratio of average precipitation intensity between the two periods for further discussion on the fc method see peleg et al 2019 and moraga et al 2021 seasonal fc were computed at intervals of 500 years and applied on 50 year intervals using linear interpolation between each of the 500 year points fig s2 d e no fc for pet were computed because the awe gen modeled paleoclimate pet is directly conditioned on temperature the final output from our method was 6566 years of daily average temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration where 6500 cal yr bp to ce 1950 simulates the past climate and the calibrated period of 1950 to ce 2016 represents the present climate temperature thresholds were used to define the growing season at the sites as proposed by christidis et al 2007 thresholds for spring ts and autumn ta were applied to smoothed daily average temperatures determined with a low pass filter itsmr package version 1 9 in r version 3 6 1 to define the growing season while unsmoothed daily average temperatures were used to calculate the average growing season temperature fig s3 a the growing season begins on the first day when the smoothed daily average temperature is greater than ts and ends on the first day the smoothed daily average temperature is less than ta for our sites the onset of spring and the end of autumn used temperature thresholds of ts 10 c lottes and ziegler 1994 and ta 6 c fig s3 a the capacity of these thresholds to determine the growing season was tested using 7000 years of awe gen present day climate 1981 2019 ce smoothed with a low pass filter the resulting growing seasons 1 mostly start in early june and end in late september 2 have lengths between 95 and 123 days and 3 average temperatures near 12 c fig s3 b d for our sites the temperature threshold method employed produced present day growing season lengths that are comparable to those derived using machine learning methods 81 100 days pedlar et al 2015 these thresholds were applied to the 6566 years of daily average temperatures to determine the average growing season temperature and the weeks of the year for growing season commencement and conclusion 3 2 2 hydrological boundary conditions snowmelt contributes to the growing season hydrology of misask and cheinu and was modelled using a degree day method ddm developed in the machbv hydrological model samuel et al 2011 a ddm was chosen because it has low data requirements and parameter values for the lagrande river catchment located 50 km north of our study site were available as a starting point for model calibration agnihotri and coulibaly 2020 table s1 the ddm requires average daily precipitation and temperature observations as input and produces modelled rainfall snowfall and snowmelt as output for model calibration table s1 the ddm was driven with 7000 years of awe gen present day climate 1981 2019 ce the ddm modelled rainfall and snow water equivalent swe were compared to weather observations measured at the nitchequon weather station from 1943 to ce 1983 wang et al 2017 the calibrated ddm adequately replicated the weekly fig s4 a b and annual fig s4 d e rainfall and swe moreover the modelled snowmelt began in april peaked in may and concluded in june fig s4 c and this timing was mirrored in hydrographs obtained from a gaging station 200 km downstream from the study site fig s4 c to determine past and present day daily rainfall and snowmelt the calibrated ddm model was driven with the 6566 years of simulated daily average temperature and precipitation modelled snowmelt and rainfall were combined with evapotranspiration to produce net precipitation and resampled to a weekly resolution for input into digibog boreal fig s1 for the misask and cheinu peatlands exchanges of water between the peat and the underlying aquifer were included because lambert et al 2022 showed that both sites are flow through peatlands receiving groundwater at their upstream portions and discharging water to the aquifer at their downstream limit groundwater fluxes in digibog boreal were replicated by removing or adding a constant rate of water flow from each column of peat throughout the simulation groundwater fluxes along the transect were determined by linearly interpolating values between the endpoints with minimum and maximum amounts of groundwater flux fig s5 a b for example a simulation with 100 mm yr 1 groundwater flux would gain 100 mm yr 1 of groundwater at the most upslope location on the transect and lose 100 mm yr 1 of groundwater at the most downslope location in total five scenarios were tested for each site fig s5 a b with 0 25 50 75 and 100 mm yr 1 of groundwater flux these values are based on field measurements and simulated fluxes estimated by lambert et al 2022 for all simulations and at both sites the digibog boreal calibration section 3 2 4 used the 100 mm yr 1 groundwater flux the remaining scenarios were applied to the calibrated model to determine the sensitivity of digibog boreal to groundwater fluxes 3 2 3 initial conditions in ce 2016 peat thicknesses were surveyed at misask n 116 locations and cheinu n 167 via manual probing robitaille et al 2021 additionally a 1 m spatial resolution digital elevation model dem was produced for each site by applying photogrammetric methods to approximately 2500 overlapping images acquired from a drone lambert et al 2022 peat thickness data were spatially interpolated using the topo to raster function in arcgis 10 5 to produce peat depth maps and the top of the mineral soil at each site was inferred by subtracting peat depths from the dem lambert et al 2022 downward sloping transects that nearly intersect each core and terminated near the peatland boundary were digitized for each site fig 1a b transects were also chosen such that lateral flows perpendicular to them were minimal this reduces the possibility that transects are accumulating or shedding flow the transect length for misask was 432 m and 282 m for cheinu along these transects mineral surface elevation was extracted with a horizontal resolution of 6 m and resulted in 75 and 50 interacting peat columns for misask and cheinu respectively fig 1c d these mineral surfaces were representative of the landscape at 6500 cal yr bp and were the initial conditions for the digibog boreal simulations the upslope end of each transect was set to have no flow neumann condition and the downslope end a constant water level with respect to the peat surface a dirichlet condition 3 2 4 calibration for both sites measurements obtained from the ce 2016 field campaign and follow up laboratory work were used to calibrate digibog boreal the data that were used were 1 present day 2016 ce peat heights across the transect extracted from the dem fig 1c d 2 peat chronologies age depth curves 3 reconstructed water table depths wtd and 4 a measure of peat mass remaining in the model the degree to which peat has decayed or decomposed is given for each layer as the current mass of the layer divided by its original mass this is what we term as peat mass remaining items 2 and 3 above were obtained for three cores per site and item 4 from cores m c2 and cc1 fig 1a b the cores were 114 199 cm long and spanned the period from 6476 cal yr bp to ce 2016 radiocarbon dating was performed on 43 peat samples from the cores to develop peat age depth models and analyzed at 4 cm intervals to reconstruct wtd carbon to nitrogen ratios c n a proxy for peat mass remaining was measured for cores m c2 and cc1 see robitaille et al 2021 for methods the parameters that were calibrated in digibog boreal were 1 rate of oxic αox and anoxic αan peat decomposition 2 degree of peat recalcitrance under oxic mox and anoxic man conditions and 3 ponding thickness see section 3 1 table s2 contains the parameters that were not calibrated for both sites trial and error calibration was performed across the period 6500 cal yr bp to ce 2016 and was guided by reducing the weighted mean normalized root mean squared error wmnrmse between observed and modelled values using the following equation 3 w m n r m s e 0 5 n r m s e p h 0 056 n r m s e p a 1 0 056 n r m s e p a 2 0 056 n r m s e p a 3 0 056 n r m s e w t d 1 0 056 n r m s e w t d 2 0 056 n r m s e w t d 3 0 167 n r m s e m r where the normalized root mean squared error nrmse is expressed as a percentage with a value of zero being optimal and is calculated using the present day peat heights across the transect nrmseph peat age depth profiles nrmsepa wtd nrmsewtd and peat mass remaining nrmsemr weights for the wmnrmse were 0 5 for peat heights which places greater importance on matching the present day peat surface and the remaining weights were evenly distributed across the remaining variables 4 results 4 1 climate weather and snowmelt model table 1 provides summary statistics for the hydrological and meteorological variables aggregated to an annual resolution from the data that drove all digibog boreal simulations at both sites fig 3 a g overall across the entire period the simulated climate becomes noticeably wetter and warmer with minimal changes in snowmelt evapotranspiration average growing season temperature and growing season length table 1 from 6500 cal yr bp to ce 1850 the climate is cooler than present with shorter growing seasons table 1 recent changes from ce 1850 to ce 2016 include a noticeable increase in average annual temperature average growing season temperature and growing season length table 1 throughout this recent period changes in net precipitation are negligible because increases in rainfall are largely offset by increases in evapotranspiration and decreases in snowmelt table 1 4 2 digibog boreal 4 2 1 calibration table 2 summarizes the optimal model parameterizations and corresponding model error at both sites for simulations with small run 1 and large run 2 ponding thicknesses overall the cheinu simulations were marginally better than the misask simulations and the run 1 parameterisations performed better than the run 2 s table 2 for both sites and all runs peat heights and peat ages were better replicated than wtd and peat mass remaining table 2 at misask for both run 1 and 2 midslope peat heights were adequately replicated while upslope peat heights were slightly underestimated and downslope peat heights were substantially overestimated fig 4 a c table 3 overall digibog boreal does quite well for peat height replication at cheinu peat heights for both runs at cheinu were replicated well in the upslope and midslope with a slight overestimation in the downslope fig 5 a c table 3 peat age depth values from simulated profiles at misask fig 6 contained curvature while simulated profiles from cheinu were mostly linear in shape fig 7 at both sites the run 1 parameterisations were on average somewhat better at replicating observed peat age depth profiles than run 2 s table 2 digibog boreal reproduced well peat age depth profiles for misask s midslope core mc 2 and lateral core ml 2 fig 6 and cheinu s downslope core cl 1 fig 7 at all core locations the simulated wtds were mostly within one standard deviation of the observed mean wtds but major changes in observed wtds were not captured by digibog boreal figs 6 7 misask run 1 and 2 and cheinu run 1 produced wtds that largely remained stable in contrast the lateral cores cl 1 and cl 2 from cheinu run 2 had wtds that started above the peat surface and then deepened while wtds at the central core were above the peat surface and stable fig 7 at misask 1 below 120 cm the simulated peat decomposition was overestimated rmse 22 percentage points pp while decomposition in shallower layers was underestimated rmse 25 pp fig 6 misask run 2 did not replicate observed peat decomposition well rmse 36 pp

i e less decomposed peat have wtds that are frequently shallow or above the peat surface figs 4 5 in the misask runs peat mass remaining generally decreases with peat depth fig 4a c while the cheinu runs have many layers of less decomposed peat overlain by highly decomposed peat e g fig 5c downslope overall the run 1 s at both sites have less preserved more uniform peat with deeper less variable water tables than the run 2 s table 3 figs 4 5 s6 s7 all runs at both sites have the highest peat mass on the midslope less mass on the downslope and the lowest mass on the upslope table 3 figs 4a c and 5a c additionally wtd are shallowest on the midslopes and deeper on the downslopes and upslopes table 3 figs 4b d 5b d and figs s6 s7 4 2 3 sensitivity to the groundwater flux boundary condition at both sites run 1 peat heights responded to changes in groundwater flux when compared to simulations with no groundwater flux figs 8 9 top row upslope peat height gains occurred where additions of groundwater resulted in shallower average wtds during the growing season conversely downslope peat height was thinner where groundwater flux reductions produced deeper average wtds during the growing season in these run 1 s the magnitude of peat height change was commensurate with the amount of groundwater flux added or subtracted from the profile figs 8 9 top row the greatest change in peat heights occurred under groundwater flux scenarios of 100 mm yr 1 for example under this scenario the misask run 1 transect had a cumulative gain in peat height of 249 cm on the upslope and a cumulative loss in peat height of 211 cm in the downslope similarly the cheinu run 1 transect had a cumulative peat height gain of 181 cm in the upslope and a cumulative peat height loss of 90 cm loss on the downslope the response of misask run 2 to groundwater flux was minimal fig 8 bottom row with only the extreme ends of the profile exhibiting changes in peat height and average growing season wtds peat heights on the upslope section of cheinu run 2 responded positively to the addition of groundwater except for a column of peat 54 m from the upslope end of the profile fig 9 bottom row at this location when compared to the simulation with no groundwater flux the addition of groundwater raises the water table nearer or above the peat surface which reduces litter production and produces thinner peat fig 9 bottom row moreover in cheinu run 2 groundwater losses on the downslope had a diminished effect on peat heights 5 discussion overall the performance of the new model is mixed in some of the simulations the peat thickness is simulated quite well both cheinu simulations as are individual age depth curves e g misask mc 2 and ml 2 both runs and mass remaining curves good pattern matches for cheinu both runs in contrast water table depths are not well simulated all runs the performance of the model could have been improved if we had expanded the calibration to include i more parameters and ii the model s climatic driving data and the groundwater exchange boundary condition however extending the calibration carries the risk of it becoming a curve fitting exercise which is of limited value in assessing the model s fidelity nevertheless it is possible to identify ways in which the model and or its climatic driving data could be enhanced in the case of the latter it is likely that the variations in measured water table depths are caused by climatic excursions that are not included in our climatic driving data which change little through time fig 3 previous work with digibog has shown that modelled water tables are sensitive to variations in climate e g morris et al 2015 and we would expect the same in digibog boreal paleoclimatic episodes can be difficult to represent in driving data that are based solely on contemporary meteorological data and climate model hindcasts as is the case here therefore it seems likely that a lack of detail in the driving data rather than deficiencies in the model itself explains the poor fit between modelled and observed water tables below we discuss ways in which the model itself might be improved in the model simulated degree of decomposition and peat thickness are sensitive to surface water storage figs 4 and 5 oxic zone thickness affects both the addition of plant litter to a peat column and the decay of peat within it and is partly controlled by the size of the surface water store as set by the model user for example if the surface ponding level is set to a high value more water is stored on the peatland during and after snowmelt and this storage offsets water losses during periods of low net rainfall ensuring water tables remain near the surface however litter production and peat decay in the model interact in a complicated way with water table depth for example similar peat thicknesses may be attained for i moderate water table depths where rates of both litter production and decay are relatively high and ii shallow water table depths where production and decay are both quite low similar peat thicknesses can be seen between the different surface ponding runs for both sites but the peat profile is very different in terms of degree of decay the mass remaining for example for misask similar peat thicknesses are predicted for the transect between 130 m and 200 m but the peat in the shallow ponding run is much more decayed less mass remaining fig 4 nevertheless changes in surface storage do translate into differences in peat thickness and c storage as can be seen for the beginning 0 50 m and end beyond 400 m of the misask transect fig 4 therefore the depth to which surface water is allowed to pond can alter the simulated carbon balance a better understanding of surface water storage and flow in these peatlands could help improve our results model performance may be enhanced by allowing different depths of water to be stored across different parts of the peatland representing local surface gradients and topographic features such as hollows and ridges additionally there may be merit in explicitly modeling surface water flow within the peatland using an overland flow equation digibog boreal does not explicitly represent different plant functional types pfts i e in the model litter production and decay work at the level of the plant assemblage which is assumed to be that typical of a bog in future versions of the model it may be desirable to represent several pfts that differ from each other in rates of litter production and in litter susceptibility to decay such changes may lead to better predictions of the downcore mass remaining and age depth curves an important control on pft is the water source fen pfts such as some sedge species may be found in shallow peats and where some of the water supplied to the peatland is minerotrophic such as groundwater however simulating shifts in pft abundance can be challenging at sites such as misask and cheinu because of large uncertainties in groundwater exchanges with the peatlands over the centuries and millennia during which the peatlands develop see fig 8 and associated discussion therefore we chose to use a simple approach to represent peatland vegetation in the first version of digibog boreal and focused instead on other controls on peatland development growing season and snow melt notwithstanding these possible upgrades and the limitations of the driving data in this test application the new version of digibog already extends the model s capabilities these capabilities suggest the approach we used here to model past peat accumulation could be used in concert with contemporary field measurements such as c fluxes and water table depths and climate projections to explore the effects of land use and climate change on boreal peatland c stocks 6 conclusions we present a new version of the digibog model of peatland development digibog boreal the new model includes routines to simulate processes specific to boreal ecosystems particularly changes to reflect the accumulation and melt of a seasonal snowpack and changes to the routines that govern peat accumulation to account for shorter growing seasons than in temperate ecosystems like previous versions of digibog the new model provides a detailed spatially distributed representation of peat accumulation along a transect we parameterised the model for two peatlands in high boreal latitudes of eastern canada simulating peat development over the last 6500 years the model setups are informed by detailed field surveys that describe the topography of the mineral substrate upon which peat has accumulated and radiocarbon dates from the base of the peat to the surface climatic driving data are provided by a general circulation model combined with modern climate data using a weather generator the model can be parameterised so that simulated peat thickness agrees well with observed peat profiles in both sites simulated peat accumulation is sensitive to the parameters used to represent the storage of water on the surface of the peat which should therefore be well informed by field measurements simulated water table depths and age depth profiles can be compared to palaeohydrological conditions and radiocarbon age depth profiles respectively reconstructed from proxy data at the two sites in these respects the model performs less well than for peat thickness although we suspect this represents a lack of detail in the climatic driving data rather than deficiencies in the model s routines overall the model provides a suitable means to simulate the development of boreal peatlands and may find utility in simulating the response of such ecosystems to future climate and land use
