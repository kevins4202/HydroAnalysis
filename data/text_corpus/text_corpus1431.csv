aquatic organisms or humans at low levels and the dose response relationships which represent the toxic effects of chemical pollutants using simple laboratory studies have restricted the availability to nutrient criteria development huo et al 2013 lamon and qian 2008 statistical analysis based on large amounts of observation data can provide theoretical information to support the development of nutrient criteria sun et al 2017 three types of statistical analyses have been recommended for developing nutrient criteria namely the reference condition approach mechanistic modeling and stressor response analysis hausmann et al 2016 us epa 2010 water quality conditions are widely influenced by the entire watershed and no lake watersheds are negligibly affected by land use and climate change resulting from intensive human activities land use patterns and climate change can have extensive impacts on the development of nutrient criteria which makes determining numeric nutrient criteria difficult changes in land use can influence the ability of soil to mitigate external interferences which directly impacts the quality of receiving water zhang et al 2012 the spatial distribution of land use affects the connectivity between pollution sources and sinks because there are different contamination transport and transformation capacities in the different land use types van rompaey et al 2007 the human modification of natural landscapes associated with soil degradation changes in water flow and quality and other impacts may alter ecosystem functions and decrease biodiversity kissinger and rees 2010 recently climate change has altered the relationship between nutrients and primary productivity climate change is expected to modify ecological responses in the ocean and may potentially have important effects on ecosystem services henson et al 2017 climate change would enhance cyanobacterial blooms as a result of increasing nutrient inputs via heavy rainfall longer and more stable periods of thermal stratification and increasing water temperatures all of which are conducive to the growth of cyanobacteria relative to other algae hayes et al 2015 paerl and huisman 2009 paerl and paul 2012 water temperature is highly correlated with primary productivity and affects cyanobacterial development which regulates the production of carbohydrates the synthesis of gas vesicles and the rate of photosynthesis in algal cells wang et al 2016a b furthermore rising temperatures are expected to increase the rate of mineralization of soil nutrients and deoxygenation at the lake sediment surface and the rate of nutrient release into overlying water kosten et al 2012 due to greater nutrient inputs into waterbodies and flushing after rainfall rainfall at various intensities and frequencies can affect cyanobacterial biomass dynamics reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 intense precipitation events supply aquatic ecosystems with 80 of annual p loads in watersheds dominated by agriculture david et al 2006 hayes et al 2015 high surface concentrations of cyanobacterial cells and vast bloom areas usually occur under weak wind conditions because gas vesicles are negatively correlated with increasing wind and waves cao et al 2006 wu et al 2015 extreme weather events ewes such as heavy rainfall events and large storms may increase primary productivity and or the resuspension of benthic cyanobacteria and promote the formation of cyanobacterial blooms chen and tang 2012 robson and hamilton 2003 zhu et al 2014 hence land use patterns and climate change indicators should be considered when developing nutrient criteria however little research has been conducted regarding the effect of future climate change on nutrient criteria development in this paper the criterion values for total nitrogen tn total phosphorous tp and chlorophyll a chl a were developed based on the combined consideration of stressor response models land use nutrient regression models and terrestrial ecosystem health the purpose is to examine how climate change indicators and land use patterns can influence the development of nutrient criteria to achieve this objective 1 stressor response models including a linear regression model lrm a classification and regression tree cart model and changepoint analysis cpa were applied to determine nutrient criteria 2 a regression model involving land use and nutrients was used to develop nutrient criteria 3 the terrestrial ecosystem health status of the studied lake watershed was assessed to verify the reliability of the criterion values and 4 climate change indicators were applied to infer the impact of climate change on the development of nutrient criteria in heilongjiang province 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area heilongjiang province 121 11 135 05 e 43 26 53 33 n is a temperate continental monsoon climate zone located in northeastern china the lakes area 1 km2 cover a total area of approximately 3241 3 km2 liu 2011 and are mainly distributed in the watersheds of the heilongjiang river songhuajiang river and wusulijiang river some lakes and reservoirs in this area have suffered from serious eutrophication in recent decades and environmental quality continues to decline with the rapid economic development in heilongjiang province in this study 21 water bodies were investigated to establish nutrient criteria in this region fig 1 the information regarding the 21 studied lakes and reservoirs is listed in table s1 supporting information si meteorological data show that the annual mean temperature of the land surface tm in heilongjiang province increased significantly from 1961 to 2016 and the heating rate was 0 35 c per decade fig 5 a the warming rate of the land surface tm in china was 0 23 c per decade national climate center 2016 indicating that heilongjiang province is sensitive to climate change 2 2 data sources and data quality the tn tp and chl a concentrations land use patterns and climate change indicators were collected for each studied lake watershed data on the nutrient and chl a concentrations in the lakes of heilongjiang province were obtained from the ambient lake monitoring network administered by the department of environmental protection of heilongjiang province in total 21 water bodies were selected for this analysis which spanned the period from 1988 to 2015 the tn tp and chl a indices were analyzed in a laboratory using the standard testing procedures recommended by the ministry of environmental protection of china prc mep 2002 the annual mean concentrations of the aforementioned variables for all samples from each lake were used as the dependent variables geographic information system gis software was used to extract lake watersheds interpret land use data and assess soil erosion land use data from heilongjiang province at a resolution of 30 30 m were obtained from the institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research igsnrr chinese academy of sciences for five periods 1988 1995 2000 2007 and 2015 the original land use was further grouped into six main categories 1 cropland including paddy fields and dry land 2 forestland 3 grassland 4 water bodies including rivers and sandy beaches 5 urban and rural land including urban land rural residential areas and other construction lands and 6 unused land arcgis 10 2 desktop gis software was used to calculate the area corresponding to each land use type within the region the percentages of cropland forestland grassland water bodies urban and rural land and unused land in the watershed were abbreviated as pc pf pg pw pur and pun respectively climate change indicators such as annual tm c annual precipitation pre mm year annual mean wind speed win m s and annual relative humidity rhu in heilongjiang province were obtained from the cn05 1 dataset which was constructed by the anomaly approach during interpolation based on many station observations 2400 in china wu and gao 2013 xu et al 2009 2 3 methods for establishing nutrient criteria 2 3 1 stressor response models stressor response models incorporating lrm cart and cpa were used to estimate and interpret numeric nutrient criteria to handle both nitrogen and phosphorus pollution us epa 2010 the lrm method evaluates the linear relationship between one response variable and more than one stressor variables a lrm can be further split into simple linear regression slr and multiple linear regression mlr models the results of slr are two coefficients specifying the intercept and slope of a straight line representing the modeled relationship between the two variables us epa 2010 mlr is useful for modeling the combined effects of different nutrients and other environmental factors that influence the response variable huo et al 2014 the complementary equations for lrm can be seen in s1 section in the si cart is beneficial for environmental and ecological research because it can predict interactive effects handle both continuous and discrete variables and establish a hierarchical structure qian and anderson 1999 qian 2009 cart analysis does not need to assume the possible distribution of the predictor variables and it can use numerical data that are highly skewed or multimodal as well as categorical predictors this approach shortens the time required to determine whether variables are normally distributed and to convert non normally distributed data qian and anderson 1999 the complementary algorithm methods and equations for cart model can be seen in s2 section in the si cpa is applied to calculate the locations of thresholds or changepoints in bivariate nonlinear stressor response relationships us epa 2010 if observations from multiple sites are ordered along a gradient a threshold or sudden change in the statistical attributes of the dependent variable will occur in the relationship between a stressor variable and a response variable cpa which is based on nonparametric cpa ncpa and bayesian hierarchical modeling bhm can therefore be used to determine the point at which the change occurs breiman et al 1984 qian et al 2003 in this study the response variables can be approximated by a normal distribution and a gibbs sampling procedure was used to estimate the parameters qian et al 2004 before conducting cpa using the bhm method specific information on the distribution of the response variable is required to determine whether the distribution satisfies the assumption of normality the complementary algorithm methods and equations of cpa can be seen in s3 section in the si 2 3 2 land use nutrient regression model land use nutrient regression models were used to examine the general correlations among the nutrients or chl a and land use to derive the criterion concentrations the land use percentages were used as the predictor variables and tn tp and chl a were used as the dependent variables cart analysis was first used as a variable selection method to identify important land use patterns associated with variations in nutrients and chl a huo et al 2015b the coefficient of determination r2 in the land use nutrient regression model was used to measure how well the land use percentages explained these variations the best regression models were employed to determine nutrient and chl a concentrations in this extrapolation the variability was characterized using a 90 confidence interval ci 2 3 3 terrestrial ecosystem health assessment method the weights of the terrestrial ecosystem health assessment indicators were assessed according to an analytic hierarchy process the equation for terrestrial ecosystem health assessment was as follows i l i 1 n w i x i where i l is the health index of the terrestrial ecosystem w i is the weight of the i th assessment indicator and x i is the value of the i th assessment indicator based on the value of i l the health status of a terrestrial ecosystem can be classified as excellent i l 80 good 60 i l 80 fair 40 i l 60 poor 20 i l 40 or bad i l 2 0 prc mep 2013 the specific method for assessing terrestrial ecosystem health referred to the previous literature ma et al 2016 the concentrations of tn tp and chl a in heilongjiang lakes and reservoirs were log10 transformed to ensure that the data distributions did not produce intercept estimates that were less than zero dodds 2006 the r function rpart was used to calculate the nodes of the cart model and the changepoint of ncpa and the r function bootstrap was applied to evaluate the 90 ci of each threshold with 1000 random permutations r 3 0 2 http cran r project org bin windows base matlab software r2007b the mathworks company us was used for the bhm analysis and the calculation of the 90 ci for the changepoint analysis of covariance ancova was performed using spss 16 to test for significant differences among climate change factors while accounting for the effects of nutrients on chl a as well as land use variables on water quality reservoirs have characteristics similar to those of lakes in terms of nutrient ecological effects and human activities hence similar methods can be used to determine the reservoir nutrient criteria 3 results 3 1 nutrient criteria development by the stressor response model 3 1 1 the linear regression model the stressor response models are based on the assumption that lakes and reservoirs in heilongjiang province are likely to have similar chl a responses to nutrient variations the annual values of chl a tp and tn were collected from the study region to build the lrm and datasets from april to september were analyzed to estimate seasonal effects the slr models of lgchl a using lgtp or lgtn as predictor variables are shown in fig 2 and table 1 cis 90 were used to describe the inherent uncertainty in estimating a mean response value when deriving criteria from the lrm significant positive correlations p 0 001 were found between lgchl a and lgtp implying that reductions in lgtp are accompanied by those in lgchl a table 1 and fig 2 the p value of lgtn was much larger than 0 10 which indicated the lack of a good linear relationship between lgchl a and lgtn and lgtn did not explain variations in lgchl a in heilongjiang province the hypothesis that 5 μg l chl a concentration was served as the criteria of the response variable for lakes and reservoirs in this region to satisfy the drinking water use the upper 90 ci intersected chl a 5 0 μg l at tp 0 041 mg l the lower ci intersected at tp 0 061 mg l and the mean relationship intersected at tp 0 051 mg l arrows a c and b in fig 2 a respectively the cis of slm for tp in the lakes and reservoirs in heilongjiang province were 0 041 0 061 mg l annual data and 0 042 0 066 mg l data from april to september furthermore lgtn and lgtp were simultaneously used to construct a multiple regression model for lgchl a in the lakes and reservoirs of heilongjiang province this model was not effective or useful for accurately predicting future conditions in this region because the p value of lgtn was much greater than 0 05 table 1 this result indicated a nonlinear relationship between lgchl a and lgtn and nonlinear models such as cart and cpa were developed to establish nutrient thresholds 3 1 2 classification and regression tree analysis cart was adopted to identify important variables that influenced the variation in the response variable in heilongjiang province the observed lgchl a concentration was used as the response variable the lgtp and lgtn concentrations were selected as potential predictor variables in each model the datasets from april to september were also analyzed to obtain estimates that represented the seasonal effect the final models were selected based on their predictability which was simulated by cross validation and are presented graphically the variable selected first was the most important one or the one with the greatest effect on the lgchl a concentration cart analyses indicated a hierarchical structure between nutrient and lgchl a concentrations fig 3 the standard deviation sd of the chl a concentration data was used as a measure of dispersion the variability in the lgchl a concentration in this region was driven primarily by the lgtp concentration fig 3 the mean chl a concentration for tp concentrations less than 0 058 mg l was 4 406 μg l sd 2 294 and the mean chl a concentration at higher tp concentrations was 16 379 μg l 2 870 for tp concentrations higher than 0 058 mg l tn was the second most important variable the lower panel of fig 3 shows boxplots of chl a concentrations within each of the terminal nodes only the first two splits included in the terminal model demonstrated that further splits would not reduce the relative predictive error of the model or increase the predictive correlation coefficient r2 from april to september tp was also the decisive variable that influenced chl a concentrations in this region fig 3 indicating that the p limiting conditions were relatively stable with seasonal variations nutrient node values were frequently higher than the annual values from april to september this pattern likely stemmed from fluctuations in complex environmental factors such as the increasing water quantity deteriorating water quality and increasing tm from april to september these factors changed the response relationships between nutrients and algal growth hence seasonal variability must be considered when defining nutrient criteria the node concentrations ranged from 0 058 mg l to 0 062 mg l for the tp concentration and from 0 725 mg l to 0 908 mg l for the tn concentration the cart models were not developed to predict chl a concentrations however these models can provide valuable information for water quality management for example the boxplots of fig 3 show that a large variance in the chl a concentration corresponds to high tp and high tn concentrations hence variations in tp and tn concentrations in this region must be synergistically controlled to effectively manage water quality 3 1 3 changepoint analysis cpa was applied to verify the cart results for each node in the regression tree the changepoints mean and sd of the response variable chl a on both sides of the changepoints were estimated using the ncpa and the bhm methods table 2 uncertainty in the changepoint locations was quantified using the range of the middle 90 of the 1000 bootstrap simulation replicates for the ncpa method and the 90 cis for the bhm method the results from the ncpa method were comparable to those from the bhm method there were no significant differences between the changepoints identified via the ncpa and bhm methods for tp and tn concentrations indicating that the probability distribution assumptions for the response variable under the bhm method were appropriate table 2 because the bhm method utilized distributional information for the response variable it generated narrower cis for the changepoints see table 2 qian et al 2003 if the true probability distribution of the response variable cannot be determined the ncpa method should be used to confirm the changepoints the distributions of tp and tn concentrations as well as the lgchl a concentrations based on the annual data and data from april to september are illustrated in fig 4 the obtained changepoints of tp and tn concentrations from annual data were lower than those obtained from the april to september data the lowess curves and changepoints indicated that chl a concentration decreased until the thresholds were approximately 0 058 0 060 mg tp l and 0 865 0 976 mg tn l respectively fig 4 3 2 nutrient criteria development with land use nutrient regression models the cart model was employed to identify important land use types that influenced the variations in lgtn lgtp and lgchl a huo et al 2015b the regression tree plots of the water quality variables for heilongjiang province are presented in fig s1 in the si as shown in fig s1 forestland was the major land use pattern that affected the chl a and tp concentrations and an increase in forestland decreased lgchl a and lgtp concentrations cultivated land was the major land use pattern that influenced the tn concentration and an increase in cultivated land area would lead to an increase in the lgtn concentration the concentrations of lgtn lgtp lgchl a and the land use percentages in the 21 lake watersheds were analyzed and used to establish land use nutrient regression models table 3 these regression models were used to determine the relationships among nutrients lgchl a and land use patterns all possible subset regression with p as an index for selecting the land use models was employed to predict the nutrient and lgchl a concentrations the best regression models for the nutrient and lgchl a concentrations based on a comparison of r2 values are summarized in table 3 the analysis revealed that the regression method generally predicted all studied variables correctly due to the significant relationships among the water quality variables and land use patterns for the lakes sampled in this study p 0 05 this finding indicates that land use percentages can be used as predictor variables as shown in table 3 lgchl a and lgtp are strongly related to pf in the lakes and reservoirs in heilongjiang province this result indicates that larger percentages of forestland have stronger positive influences on the concentrations of lgtp and lgchl a this result can be attributed to the fact that vegetation cover can affect soil properties and overland flow reduce soil erosion and improve water quality cropland accounted for the variability in lgtn because the majority of fertilizers applied in cropland areas can enter the water supply through runoff and increase the nitrogen concentration the nutrient criteria deduced by the land use regression model were 3 794 μg l for chl a 0 770 mg l for tn and 0 059 mg l for tp these criteria were nearly bracketed by the values derived from the stressor response model 3 3 nutrient criteria verification based on terrestrial ecosystem health human activities primarily influence land and fluctuations in the terrestrial ecosystem exert an important influence on water quality and the development of nutrient criteria a healthy terrestrial ecosystem can rapidly recover from unexpected disturbances resulting from natural or human activities and is characterized by diversity complexity and robustness the health statuses of the terrestrial ecosystems of the 21 investigated lakes and reservoirs are illustrated in fig 1 the results of a statistical analysis of the water quality data for terrestrial ecosystems in various health statuses are listed in table 4 as shown in table 4 the average concentrations of nutrients and chl a significantly increased with the deterioration of terrestrial ecosystem health this result illustrates that lake water quality is significantly affected by terrestrial ecosystem health and that the deterioration of the terrestrial ecosystem of a lake significantly influences its water quality 3 4 effects of climate change indicators on the development of nutrient criteria climate change is an important factor that influences the development of nutrient criteria climate variability must be considered to establish scientific and reasonable nutrient criteria ancova was used to test for significant differences among climate change factors while accounting for the effects of nutrients on chl a and land use variables on water quality the climate variations were quantified using ancova in which climate change factors were the categorical predictor and the percentage of anthropogenic land use was the covariate the results of ancova are listed in table s2 the significance level was less than 0 05 indicating that the climate change indicators would significantly affect the response relationships between lgtn lgtp and lgchl a and between land use patterns and lgtn lgtp lgchl a ancova demonstrated that not all climate change indicators had a significant impact on the nutrient chl a and land use variable water quality relationships for example win and pre had significant influences on the relationships of all models except the lgchl a pf model and only tm had a significant influence on the relationship between lgchl a and pf there were significant effects on tm for the lgtn pc model and on rhu for the lgchl a lgtp lgchl a lgtn and lgtn pc models all the selected climate change indicators markedly influenced the lgtn pc model for the climate change indicators that were significantly different p 0 05 as determined by ancova nonlinear regression was used to quantitatively characterize the effects of climate change indicators on the relationships between nutrient and chl a concentrations and between land use and nutrient concentrations table 5 meteorological data showed that the meteorological factors in heilongjiang province significantly changed over the past five decades the annual tm of the land surface increased drastically from 1961 to 2016 fig 5 a rhu and pre slightly increased and exhibited notable interannual fluctuation fig 5 b and fig 5 c additionally win significantly decreased p 0 001 beginning in 1961 fig 5 d the cyanobacterial bloom was negatively correlated with win and positively correlated with tm and rhu yang et al 2016 according to the non lrms of lgchl a pf and lgtn pc the deduced criteria of chl a and tn should decrease with as increase in tm mainly because an increase in tm would stimulate the deleterious proliferation of planktonic algae and cause the algae to bloom in water furthermore increasing tm is expected to increase the rate of mineralization of soil nutrients and favor deoxygenation at the lake sediment surface which releases more nutrients into the water column hence stricter criterion values for nutrient and chl a concentrations should be developed to prevent the eutrophication of water bodies there is no known ecological relevance of the relationship between cyanobacterial blooms and humidity which may be an indirect effect caused by the great influence of wind speed on the humidity at the surface of lakes yang et al 2016 rainfall can transport large amounts of nutrients into lakes as nonpoint source pollution that enters lakes via runoff the rainfall intensity was positively correlated with the tn concentration in rivers flowing into lakes zhu et al 2015 moreover the tp concentrations in runoff were correspondingly higher after heavy rainfall but were stable when the rainfall intensity was low yang et al 2016 wet deposition is another nutrient input path from rainfall and could cause the nutrient concentrations in lakes to increase significantly in a short time for the lgtp pf and lgtn pc models the concentrations of tp and tn increased as the precipitation increased when the percentages of cropland and forestland were constant low wind speed is an important requisite for the formation of cyanobacterial blooms which are not conducive to the expansion of algae lead to the gathering of large quantities of cyanobacteria on the water surface and result in the breakout of eutrophication therefore weak wind conditions usually results in high surface concentrations of cyanobacterial cells and vast bloom areas in addition lake sediments are not easily suspended in the water column under low wind conditions nutrients in the sediments are released into the overlying water during sediment resuspension the nutrient release rates are significantly and positively correlated with the wind speed hence low wind speed in this study led to a decrease in the tn and tp concentrations 4 discussion the numeric nutrient criteria determined using the lrm cart ncpa bhm land use nutrient regression models and models based on terrestrial ecosystem health in heilongjiang province are listed in table 6 the friedman test indicated no significant differences among the nutrient criteria obtained using these various methods p 0 05 the tn and chl a concentrations obtained using the land use nutrient regression model were slightly lower than those obtained using the stressor response models this result may be because the land use nutrient regression model could not quantify all sources of anthropogenic influence because such data were not readily available huo et al 2015a ma et al 2016 the atmospheric deposition of nitrogen for example can exert a considerable impact on water quality and result in variability in biomass and nutrient variables the quantitative consideration of other factors such as atmospheric deposition animal farms and point discharges would improve the accuracy of the model huo et al 2015a ma et al 2016 the incorporation of other anthropogenic sources of nutrient inputs would further improve the reliability of nutrient criteria development the lrm cart ncpa bhm and land use nutrient regression models and methods based on terrestrial ecosystem health assessment do not require the collection of a large amount of data from reference lakes or minimally impacted lakes the lrm cart ncpa and bhm methods provide estimates of relationships between a response variable and a stressor variable in this study tn and tp were chosen as the stressor variables and chl a was selected as the biological response variable huo et al 2015b zhang et al 2014 in contrast to the lrm method the cart ncpa and bhm methods do not require the establishment of a threshold value for the response variable to determine a potential numeric criterion huo et al 2015b and can thus yield objective criteria the land use nutrient regression models presented in this article provide a basis for understanding the impacts of land use changes on water quality and extrapolating the criterion concentrations for water quality protection the criterion values estimated from the stressor response model and land use nutrient regression model were similar to the average values of the corresponding variables under excellent terrestrial ecosystem health thus the average values of water quality variables corresponding to excellent terrestrial ecosystem health can be used as nutrient criteria for the study region these results will be beneficial for assisting planners and policy makers in estimating the expected changes in water quality as land use changes over time moreover terrestrial ecosystem health assessments are beneficial for understanding the health of terrestrial ecosystems and the degree of interference from human activities climate change and human based changes in land use have the potential to influence the development of nutrient criteria one of the mechanisms by which land use and climate affect community and ecosystem properties is by altering biogeochemical cycles cultivation requires greater consumption of nutrients than does natural vegetative cover and damages the structure of the soil and the nutrient rich topsoil which results in the loss of nutrients and soil particles during rainfall and runoff processes gandhi et al 2008 gao et al 2014 forestland may improve the buffering capacity of soil and the net primary productivity of an ecosystem and plays an important role in intercepting pollutants before they enter water bodies increases in the loads of land based pollutants e g nutrients sediment and pesticides caused by changes in land use during urbanization can result in a decrease in water quality álvarez romero et al 2013 an increased percentage of impervious cover can further increase the export of nutrients from watersheds thus the increases in nutrient loading related to land use changes must be evaluated and quantitatively described using models evaluations of the relationships between anthropogenic land use and water quality indicators are beneficial for identifying specific anthropogenic land use practices that contribute to nutrient pollution and may help guide management decisions the integrated planning and management of land use is an effective approach to decreasing nitrogen and phosphorus pollutant concentrations climate change poses a serious additional challenge to formulating nutrient criteria as part of a strategy for controlling blooms havens and paerl 2015 climate change mainly includes changes in precipitation temperature and wind speed which have a significant impact on the water quality of lakes and reservoirs the global climate is projected to warm leading to increases in the frequency and severity of ewes in the future such as heavy rainfall extreme drought strong winds and heavy waves heavy rainfall and strong winds may cause algal blooms when all conditions are appropriate yang et al 2016 zhu et al 2014 the algal blooms caused by climate change can be mainly attributed to a short term increase in the nutrient concentrations in lake water induced by ewes strong winds are usually associated with internal nutrient releases from sediments therefore lake sediments are an important source of pollution yang et al 2016 the sediments are easily suspended in the water column under strong winds in shallow lakes a climate driven change in water temperature would modify the phytoplankton community by supporting bloom forming cyanobacteria which favor increased nutrients and higher water temperatures the longer we wait to take action to control blooms and the more time that climate change has to exert synergistic effects on nutrients the less likely it becomes that control will be attained havens and paerl 2015 hence climate change should be factored into mitigation strategies for eutrophication and should be considered in the development of nutrient criteria furthermore with the development of urban green infrastructures and climate change adaptation policies should be explored to mitigate nutrients loading into aquatic environment for example green roofs as stormwater management technologies can mitigate the impacts of urbanization on hydrological processes the reduction of the stormwater through green roof implementation had a positive impact on flood protection schmitter et al 2016 a structured approach for designing climate adaptation policies based on the concepts of adaptation pathways and real options analysis results in incorporation of flexibility that allows change over time in response to how the future unfolds what is learned about the system and changes in societal preferences buurman and babovic 2016 the approach incorporates flexibility as intelligent decision making mechanisms that enable systems to avoid incorporate uncertainties such as amount of rainfall unit cost of water and other uncertainties associated with future changes in technological domains deng et al 2013 a framework which combines the process based models and data assimilation technique could efficiently run offline to directly correct and update the output of water quality models which can fast and efficiently forecast the variation of water quality indictors as climate change persists wang et al 2016a b 5 conclusion the criterion values for tn tp and chl a were developed based on the combined consideration of stressor response models land use nutrient regression models and terrestrial ecosystem health using field investigations in heilongjiang province the results suggested that there were no significant differences in the nutrient criteria obtained by the various methods ancova was used to discern the climate change factors that significantly impacted the relationships between nutrients and chl a as well as land use and nutrients nonlinear regression was used to quantitatively characterize the impact of climate change indicators on the relationships between nutrient and chl a concentrations and between land use and nutrient concentrations these results indicated that climate change should be considered for the development of nutrient criteria and with a warmer climate achieving a desired water quality without the threat of eutrophication in the future will require stricter nutrient criteria than are required under the current climate conditions acknowledgments the national key

land use affects the connectivity between pollution sources and sinks because there are different contamination transport and transformation capacities in the different land use types van rompaey et al 2007 the human modification of natural landscapes associated with soil degradation changes in water flow and quality and other impacts may alter ecosystem functions and decrease biodiversity kissinger and rees 2010 recently climate change has altered the relationship between nutrients and primary productivity climate change is expected to modify ecological responses in the ocean and may potentially have important effects on ecosystem services henson et al 2017 climate change would enhance cyanobacterial blooms as a result of increasing nutrient inputs via heavy rainfall longer and more stable periods of thermal stratification and increasing water temperatures all of which are conducive to the growth of cyanobacteria relative to other algae hayes et al 2015 paerl and huisman 2009 paerl and paul 2012 water temperature is highly correlated with primary productivity and affects cyanobacterial development which regulates the production of carbohydrates the synthesis of gas vesicles and the rate of photosynthesis in algal cells wang et al 2016a b furthermore rising temperatures are expected to increase the rate of mineralization of soil nutrients and deoxygenation at the lake sediment surface and the rate of nutrient release into overlying water kosten et al 2012 due to greater nutrient inputs into waterbodies and flushing after rainfall rainfall at various intensities and frequencies can affect cyanobacterial biomass dynamics reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 intense precipitation events supply aquatic ecosystems with 80 of annual p loads in watersheds dominated by agriculture david et al 2006 hayes et al 2015 high surface concentrations of cyanobacterial cells and vast bloom areas usually occur under weak wind conditions because gas vesicles are negatively correlated with increasing wind and waves cao et al 2006 wu et al 2015 extreme weather events ewes such as heavy rainfall events and large storms may increase primary productivity and or the resuspension of benthic cyanobacteria and promote the formation of cyanobacterial blooms chen and tang 2012 robson and hamilton 2003 zhu et al 2014 hence land use patterns and climate change indicators should be considered when developing nutrient criteria however little research has been conducted regarding the effect of future climate change on nutrient criteria development in this paper the criterion values for total nitrogen tn total phosphorous tp and chlorophyll a chl a were developed based on the combined consideration of stressor response models land use nutrient regression models and terrestrial ecosystem health the purpose is to examine how climate change indicators and land use patterns can influence the development of nutrient criteria to achieve this objective 1 stressor response models including a linear regression model lrm a classification and regression tree cart model and changepoint analysis cpa were applied to determine nutrient criteria 2 a regression model involving land use and nutrients was used to develop nutrient criteria 3 the terrestrial ecosystem health status of the studied lake watershed was assessed to verify the reliability of the criterion values and 4 climate change indicators were applied to infer the impact of climate change on the development of nutrient criteria in heilongjiang province 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area heilongjiang province 121 11 135 05 e 43 26 53 33 n is a temperate continental monsoon climate zone located in northeastern china the lakes area 1 km2 cover a total area of approximately 3241 3 km2 liu 2011 and are mainly distributed in the watersheds of the heilongjiang river songhuajiang river and wusulijiang river some lakes and reservoirs in this area have suffered from serious eutrophication in recent decades and environmental quality continues to decline with the rapid economic development in heilongjiang province in this study 21 water bodies were investigated to establish nutrient criteria in this region fig 1 the information regarding the 21 studied lakes and reservoirs is listed in table s1 supporting information si meteorological data show that the annual mean temperature of the land surface tm in heilongjiang province increased significantly from 1961 to 2016 and the heating rate was 0 35 c per decade fig 5 a the warming rate of the land surface tm in china was 0 23 c per decade national climate center 2016 indicating that heilongjiang province is sensitive to climate change 2 2 data sources and data quality the tn tp and chl a concentrations land use patterns and climate change indicators were collected for each studied lake watershed data on the nutrient and chl a concentrations in the lakes of heilongjiang province were obtained from the ambient lake monitoring network administered by the department of environmental protection of heilongjiang province in total 21 water bodies were selected for this analysis which spanned the period from 1988 to 2015 the tn tp and chl a indices were analyzed in a laboratory using the standard testing procedures recommended by the ministry of environmental protection of china prc mep 2002 the annual mean concentrations of the aforementioned variables for all samples from each lake were used as the dependent variables geographic information system gis software was used to extract lake watersheds interpret land use data and assess soil erosion land use data from heilongjiang province at a resolution of 30 30 m were obtained from the institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research igsnrr chinese academy of sciences for five periods 1988 1995 2000 2007 and 2015 the original land use was further grouped into six main categories 1 cropland including paddy fields and dry land 2 forestland 3 grassland 4 water bodies including rivers and sandy beaches 5 urban and rural land including urban land rural residential areas and other construction lands and 6 unused land arcgis 10 2 desktop gis software was used to calculate the area corresponding to each land use type within the region the percentages of cropland forestland grassland water bodies urban and rural land and unused land in the watershed were abbreviated as pc pf pg pw pur and pun respectively climate change indicators such as annual tm c annual precipitation pre mm year annual mean wind speed win m s and annual relative humidity rhu in heilongjiang province were obtained from the cn05 1 dataset which was constructed by the anomaly approach during interpolation based on many station observations 2400 in china wu and gao 2013 xu et al 2009 2 3 methods for establishing nutrient criteria 2 3 1 stressor response models stressor response models incorporating lrm cart and cpa were used to estimate and interpret numeric nutrient criteria to handle both nitrogen and phosphorus pollution us epa 2010 the lrm method evaluates the linear relationship between one response variable and more than one stressor variables a lrm can be further split into simple linear regression slr and multiple linear regression mlr models the results of slr are two coefficients specifying the intercept and slope of a straight line representing the modeled relationship between the two variables us epa 2010 mlr is useful for modeling the combined effects of different nutrients and other environmental factors that influence the response variable huo et al 2014 the complementary equations for lrm can be seen in s1 section in the si cart is beneficial for environmental and ecological research because it can predict interactive effects handle both continuous and discrete variables and establish a hierarchical structure qian and anderson 1999 qian 2009 cart analysis does not need to assume the possible distribution of the predictor variables and it can use numerical data that are highly skewed or multimodal as well as categorical predictors this approach shortens the time required to determine whether variables are normally distributed and to convert non normally distributed data qian and anderson 1999 the complementary algorithm methods and equations for cart model can be seen in s2 section in the si cpa is applied to calculate the locations of thresholds or changepoints in bivariate nonlinear stressor response relationships us epa 2010 if observations from multiple sites are ordered along a gradient a threshold or sudden change in the statistical attributes of the dependent variable will occur in the relationship between a stressor variable and a response variable cpa which is based on nonparametric cpa ncpa and bayesian hierarchical modeling bhm can therefore be used to determine the point at which the change occurs breiman et al 1984 qian et al 2003 in this study the response variables can be approximated by a normal distribution and a gibbs sampling procedure was used to estimate the parameters qian et al 2004 before conducting cpa using the bhm method specific information on the distribution of the response variable is required to determine whether the distribution satisfies the assumption of normality the complementary algorithm methods and equations of cpa can be seen in s3 section in the si 2 3 2 land use nutrient regression model land use nutrient regression models were used to examine the general correlations among the nutrients or chl a and land use to derive the criterion concentrations the land use percentages were used as the predictor variables and tn tp and chl a were used as the dependent variables cart analysis was first used as a variable selection method to identify important land use patterns associated with variations in nutrients and chl a huo et al 2015b the coefficient of determination r2 in the land use nutrient regression model was used to measure how well the land use percentages explained these variations the best regression models were employed to determine nutrient and chl a concentrations in this extrapolation the variability was characterized using a 90 confidence interval ci 2 3 3 terrestrial ecosystem health assessment method the weights of the terrestrial ecosystem health assessment indicators were assessed according to an analytic hierarchy process the equation for terrestrial ecosystem health assessment was as follows i l i 1 n w i x i where i l is the health index of the terrestrial ecosystem w i is the weight of the i th assessment indicator and x i is the value of the i th assessment indicator based on the value of i l the health status of a terrestrial ecosystem can be classified as excellent i l 80 good 60 i l 80 fair 40 i l 60 poor 20 i l 40 or bad i l 2 0 prc mep 2013 the specific method for assessing terrestrial ecosystem health referred to the previous literature ma et al 2016 the concentrations of tn tp and chl a in heilongjiang lakes and reservoirs were log10 transformed to ensure that the data distributions did not produce intercept estimates that were less than zero dodds 2006 the r function rpart was used to calculate the nodes of the cart model and the changepoint of ncpa and the r function bootstrap was applied to evaluate the 90 ci of each threshold with 1000 random permutations r 3 0 2 http cran r project org bin windows base matlab software r2007b the mathworks company us was used for the bhm analysis and the calculation of the 90 ci for the changepoint analysis of covariance ancova was performed using spss 16 to test for significant differences among climate change factors while accounting for the effects of nutrients on chl a as well as land use variables on water quality reservoirs have characteristics similar to those of lakes in terms of nutrient ecological effects and human activities hence similar methods can be used to determine the reservoir nutrient criteria 3 results 3 1 nutrient criteria development by the stressor response model 3 1 1 the linear regression model the stressor response models are based on the assumption that lakes and reservoirs in heilongjiang province are likely to have similar chl a responses to nutrient variations the annual values of chl a tp and tn were collected from the study region to build the lrm and datasets from april to september were analyzed to estimate seasonal effects the slr models of lgchl a using lgtp or lgtn as predictor variables are shown in fig 2 and table 1 cis 90 were used to describe the inherent uncertainty in estimating a mean response value when deriving criteria from the lrm significant positive correlations p 0 001 were found between lgchl a and lgtp implying that reductions in lgtp are accompanied by those in lgchl a table 1 and fig 2 the p value of lgtn was much larger than 0 10 which indicated the lack of a good linear relationship between lgchl a and lgtn and lgtn did not explain variations in lgchl a in heilongjiang province the hypothesis that 5 μg l chl a concentration was served as the criteria of the response variable for lakes and reservoirs in this region to satisfy the drinking water use the upper 90 ci intersected chl a 5 0 μg l at tp 0 041 mg l the lower ci intersected at tp 0 061 mg l and the mean relationship intersected at tp 0 051 mg l arrows a c and b in fig 2 a respectively the cis of slm for tp in the lakes and reservoirs in heilongjiang province were 0 041 0 061 mg l annual data and 0 042 0 066 mg l data from april to september furthermore lgtn and lgtp were simultaneously used to construct a multiple regression model for lgchl a in the lakes and reservoirs of heilongjiang province this model was not effective or useful for accurately predicting future conditions in this region because the p value of lgtn was much greater than 0 05 table 1 this result indicated a nonlinear relationship between lgchl a and lgtn and nonlinear models such as cart and cpa were developed to establish nutrient thresholds 3 1 2 classification and regression tree analysis cart was adopted to identify important variables that influenced the variation in the response variable in heilongjiang province the observed lgchl a concentration was used as the response variable the lgtp and lgtn concentrations were selected as potential predictor variables in each model the datasets from april to september were also analyzed to obtain estimates that represented the seasonal effect the final models were selected based on their predictability which was simulated by cross validation and are presented graphically the variable selected first was the most important one or the one with the greatest effect on the lgchl a concentration cart analyses indicated a hierarchical structure between nutrient and lgchl a concentrations fig 3 the standard deviation sd of the chl a concentration data was used as a measure of dispersion the variability in the lgchl a concentration in this region was driven primarily by the lgtp concentration fig 3 the mean chl a concentration for tp concentrations less than 0 058 mg l was 4 406 μg l sd 2 294 and the mean chl a concentration at higher tp concentrations was 16 379 μg l 2 870 for tp concentrations higher than 0 058 mg l tn was the second most important variable the lower panel of fig 3 shows boxplots of chl a concentrations within each of the terminal nodes only the first two splits included in the terminal model demonstrated that further splits would not reduce the relative predictive error of the model or increase the predictive correlation coefficient r2 from april to september tp was also the decisive variable that influenced chl a concentrations in this region fig 3 indicating that the p limiting conditions were relatively stable with seasonal variations nutrient node values were frequently higher than the annual values from april to september this pattern likely stemmed from fluctuations in complex environmental factors such as the increasing water quantity deteriorating water quality and increasing tm from april to september these factors changed the response relationships between nutrients and algal growth hence seasonal variability must be considered when defining nutrient criteria the node concentrations ranged from 0 058 mg l to 0 062 mg l for the tp concentration and from 0 725 mg l to 0 908 mg l for the tn concentration the cart models were not developed to predict chl a concentrations however these models can provide valuable information for water quality management for example the boxplots of fig 3 show that a large variance in the chl a concentration corresponds to high tp and high tn concentrations hence variations in tp and tn concentrations in this region must be synergistically controlled to effectively manage water quality 3 1 3 changepoint analysis cpa was applied to verify the cart results for each node in the regression tree the changepoints mean and sd of the response variable chl a on both sides of the changepoints were estimated using the ncpa and the bhm methods table 2 uncertainty in the changepoint locations was quantified using the range of the middle 90 of the 1000 bootstrap simulation replicates for the ncpa method and the 90 cis for the bhm method the results from the ncpa method were comparable to those from the bhm method there were no significant differences between the changepoints identified via the ncpa and bhm methods for tp and tn concentrations indicating that the probability distribution assumptions for the response variable under the bhm method were appropriate table 2 because the bhm method utilized distributional information for the response variable it generated narrower cis for the changepoints see table 2 qian et al 2003 if the true probability distribution of the response variable cannot be determined the ncpa method should be used to confirm the changepoints the distributions of tp and tn concentrations as well as the lgchl a concentrations based on the annual data and data from april to september are illustrated in fig 4 the obtained changepoints of tp and tn concentrations from annual data were lower than those obtained from the april to september data the lowess curves and changepoints indicated that chl a concentration decreased until the thresholds were approximately 0 058 0 060 mg tp l and 0 865 0 976 mg tn l respectively fig 4 3 2 nutrient criteria development with land use nutrient regression models the cart model was employed to identify important land use types that influenced the variations in lgtn lgtp and lgchl a huo et al 2015b the regression tree plots of the water quality variables for heilongjiang province are presented in fig s1 in the si as shown in fig s1 forestland was the major land use pattern that affected the chl a and tp concentrations and an increase in forestland decreased lgchl a and lgtp concentrations cultivated land was the major land use pattern that influenced the tn concentration and an increase in cultivated land area would lead to an increase in the lgtn concentration the concentrations of lgtn lgtp lgchl a and the land use percentages in the 21 lake watersheds were analyzed and used to establish land use nutrient regression models table 3 these regression models were used to determine the relationships among nutrients lgchl a and land use patterns all possible subset regression with p as an index for selecting the land use models was employed to predict the nutrient and lgchl a concentrations the best regression models for the nutrient and lgchl a concentrations based on a comparison of r2 values are summarized in table 3 the analysis revealed that the regression method generally predicted all studied variables correctly due to the significant relationships among the water quality variables and land use patterns for the lakes sampled in this study p 0 05 this finding indicates that land use percentages can be used as predictor variables as shown in table 3 lgchl a and lgtp are strongly related to pf in the lakes and reservoirs in heilongjiang province this result indicates that larger percentages of forestland have stronger positive influences on the concentrations of lgtp and lgchl a this result can be attributed to the fact that vegetation cover can affect soil properties and overland flow reduce soil erosion and improve water quality cropland accounted for the variability in lgtn because the majority of fertilizers applied in cropland areas can enter the water supply through runoff and increase the nitrogen concentration the nutrient criteria deduced by the land use regression model were 3 794 μg l for chl a 0 770 mg l for tn and 0 059 mg l for tp these criteria were nearly bracketed by the values derived from the stressor response model 3 3 nutrient criteria verification based on terrestrial ecosystem health human activities primarily influence land and fluctuations in the terrestrial ecosystem exert an important influence on water quality and the development of nutrient criteria a healthy terrestrial ecosystem can rapidly recover from unexpected disturbances resulting from natural or human activities and is characterized by diversity complexity and robustness the health statuses of the terrestrial ecosystems of the 21 investigated lakes and reservoirs are illustrated in fig 1 the results of a statistical analysis of the water quality data for terrestrial ecosystems in various health statuses are listed in table 4 as shown in table 4 the average concentrations of nutrients and chl a significantly increased with the deterioration of terrestrial ecosystem health this result illustrates that lake water quality is significantly affected by terrestrial ecosystem health and that the deterioration of the terrestrial ecosystem of a lake significantly influences its water quality 3 4 effects of climate change indicators on the development of nutrient criteria climate change is an important factor that influences the development of nutrient criteria climate variability must be considered to establish scientific and reasonable nutrient criteria ancova was used to test for significant differences among climate change factors while accounting for the effects of nutrients on chl a and land use variables on water quality the climate variations were quantified using ancova in which climate change factors were the categorical predictor and the percentage of anthropogenic land use was the covariate the results of ancova are listed in table s2 the significance level was less than 0 05 indicating that the climate change indicators would significantly affect the response relationships between lgtn lgtp and lgchl a and between land use patterns and lgtn lgtp lgchl a ancova demonstrated that not all climate change indicators had a significant impact on the nutrient chl a and land use variable water quality relationships for example win and pre had significant influences on the relationships of all models except the lgchl a pf model and only tm had a significant influence on the relationship between lgchl a and pf there were significant effects on tm for the lgtn pc model and on rhu for the lgchl a lgtp lgchl a lgtn and lgtn pc models all the selected climate change indicators markedly influenced the lgtn pc model for the climate change indicators that were significantly different p 0 05 as determined by ancova nonlinear regression was used to quantitatively characterize the effects of climate change indicators on the relationships between nutrient and chl a concentrations and between land use and nutrient concentrations table 5 meteorological data showed that the meteorological factors in heilongjiang province significantly changed over the past five decades the annual tm of the land surface increased drastically from 1961 to 2016 fig 5 a rhu and pre slightly increased and exhibited notable interannual fluctuation fig 5 b and fig 5 c additionally win significantly decreased p 0 001 beginning in 1961 fig 5 d the cyanobacterial bloom was negatively correlated with win and positively correlated with tm and rhu yang et al 2016 according to the non lrms of lgchl a pf and lgtn pc the deduced criteria of chl a and tn should decrease with as increase in tm mainly because an increase in tm would stimulate the deleterious proliferation of planktonic algae and cause the algae to bloom in water furthermore increasing tm is expected to increase the rate of mineralization of soil nutrients and favor deoxygenation at the lake sediment surface which releases more nutrients into the water column hence stricter criterion values for nutrient and chl a concentrations should be developed to prevent the eutrophication of water bodies there is no known ecological relevance of the relationship between cyanobacterial blooms and humidity which may be an indirect effect caused by the great influence of wind speed on the humidity at the surface of lakes yang et al 2016 rainfall can transport large amounts of nutrients into lakes as nonpoint source pollution that enters lakes via runoff the rainfall intensity was positively correlated with the tn concentration in rivers flowing into lakes zhu et al 2015 moreover the tp concentrations in runoff were correspondingly higher after heavy rainfall but were stable when the rainfall intensity was low yang et al 2016 wet deposition is another nutrient input path from rainfall and could cause the nutrient concentrations in lakes to increase significantly in a short time for the lgtp pf and lgtn pc models the concentrations of tp and tn increased as the precipitation increased when the percentages of cropland and forestland were constant low wind speed is an important requisite for the formation of cyanobacterial blooms which are not conducive to the expansion of algae lead to the gathering of large quantities of cyanobacteria on the water surface and result in the breakout of eutrophication therefore weak wind conditions usually results in high surface concentrations of cyanobacterial cells and vast bloom areas in addition lake sediments are not easily suspended in the water column under low wind conditions nutrients in the sediments are released into the overlying water during sediment resuspension the nutrient release rates are significantly and positively correlated with the wind speed hence low wind speed in this study led to a decrease in the tn and tp concentrations 4 discussion the numeric nutrient criteria determined using the lrm cart ncpa bhm land use nutrient regression models and models based on terrestrial ecosystem health in heilongjiang province are listed in table 6 the friedman test indicated no significant differences among the nutrient criteria obtained using these various methods p 0 05 the tn and chl a concentrations obtained using the land use nutrient regression model were slightly lower than those obtained using the stressor response models this result may be because the land use nutrient regression model could not quantify all sources of anthropogenic influence because such data were not readily available huo et al 2015a ma et al 2016 the atmospheric deposition of nitrogen for example can exert a considerable impact on water quality and result in variability in biomass and nutrient variables the quantitative consideration of other factors such as atmospheric deposition animal farms and point discharges would improve the accuracy of the model huo et al 2015a ma et al 2016 the incorporation of other anthropogenic sources of nutrient inputs would further improve the reliability of nutrient criteria development the lrm cart ncpa bhm and land use nutrient regression models and methods based on terrestrial ecosystem health assessment do not require the collection of a large amount of data from reference lakes or minimally impacted lakes the lrm cart ncpa and bhm methods provide estimates of relationships between a response variable and a stressor variable in this study tn and tp were chosen as the stressor variables and chl a was selected as the biological response variable huo et al 2015b zhang et al 2014 in contrast to the lrm method the cart ncpa and bhm methods do not require the establishment of a threshold value for the response variable to determine a potential numeric criterion huo et al 2015b and can thus yield objective criteria the land use nutrient regression models presented in this article provide a basis for understanding the impacts of land use changes on water quality and extrapolating the criterion concentrations for water quality protection the criterion values estimated from the stressor response model and land use nutrient regression model were similar to the average values of the corresponding variables under excellent terrestrial ecosystem health thus the average values of water quality variables corresponding to excellent terrestrial ecosystem health can be used as nutrient criteria for the study region these results will be beneficial for assisting planners and policy makers in estimating the expected changes in water quality as land use changes over time moreover terrestrial ecosystem health assessments are beneficial for understanding the health of terrestrial ecosystems and the degree of interference from human activities climate change and human based changes in land use have the potential to influence the development of nutrient criteria one of the mechanisms by which land use and climate affect community and ecosystem properties is by altering biogeochemical cycles cultivation requires greater consumption of nutrients than does natural vegetative cover and damages the structure of the soil and the nutrient rich topsoil which results in the loss of nutrients and soil particles during rainfall and runoff processes gandhi et al 2008 gao et al 2014 forestland may improve the buffering capacity of soil and the net primary productivity of an ecosystem and plays an important role in intercepting pollutants before they enter water bodies increases in the loads of land based pollutants e g nutrients sediment and pesticides caused by changes in land use during urbanization can result in a decrease in water quality álvarez romero et al 2013 an increased percentage of impervious cover can further increase the export of nutrients from watersheds thus the increases in nutrient loading related to land use changes must be evaluated and quantitatively described using models evaluations of the relationships between anthropogenic land use and water quality indicators are beneficial for identifying specific anthropogenic land use practices that contribute to nutrient pollution and may help guide management decisions the integrated planning and management of land use is an effective approach to decreasing nitrogen and phosphorus pollutant concentrations climate change poses a serious additional challenge to formulating nutrient criteria as part of a strategy for controlling blooms havens and paerl 2015 climate change mainly includes changes in precipitation temperature and wind speed which have a significant impact on the water quality of lakes and reservoirs the global climate is projected to warm leading to increases in the frequency and severity of ewes in the future such as heavy rainfall extreme drought strong winds and heavy waves heavy rainfall and strong winds may cause algal blooms when all conditions are appropriate yang et al 2016 zhu et al 2014 the algal blooms caused by climate change can be mainly attributed to a short term increase in the nutrient concentrations in lake water induced by ewes strong winds are usually associated with internal nutrient releases from sediments therefore lake sediments are an important source of pollution yang et al 2016 the sediments are easily suspended in the water column under strong winds in shallow lakes a climate driven change in water temperature would modify the phytoplankton community by supporting bloom forming cyanobacteria which favor increased nutrients and higher water temperatures the longer we wait to take action to control blooms and the more time that climate change has to exert synergistic effects on nutrients the less likely it becomes that control will be attained havens and paerl 2015 hence climate change should be factored into mitigation strategies for eutrophication and should be considered in the development of nutrient criteria furthermore with the development of urban green infrastructures and climate change adaptation policies should be explored to mitigate nutrients loading into aquatic environment for example green roofs as stormwater management technologies can mitigate the impacts of urbanization on hydrological processes the reduction of the stormwater through green roof implementation had a positive impact on flood protection schmitter et al 2016 a structured approach for designing climate adaptation policies based on the concepts of adaptation pathways and real options analysis results in incorporation of flexibility that allows change over time in response to how the future unfolds what is learned about the system and changes in societal preferences buurman and babovic 2016 the approach incorporates flexibility as intelligent decision making mechanisms that enable systems to avoid incorporate uncertainties such as amount of rainfall unit cost of water and other uncertainties associated with future changes in technological domains deng et al 2013 a framework which combines the process based models and data assimilation technique could efficiently run offline to directly correct and update the output of water quality models which can fast and efficiently forecast the variation of water quality indictors as climate change persists wang et al 2016a b 5 conclusion the criterion values for tn tp and chl a were developed based on the combined consideration of stressor response models land use nutrient regression models and terrestrial ecosystem health using field investigations in heilongjiang province the results suggested that there were no significant differences in the nutrient criteria obtained by the various methods ancova was used to discern the climate change factors that significantly impacted the relationships between nutrients and chl a as well as land use and nutrients nonlinear regression was used to quantitatively characterize the impact of climate change indicators on the relationships between nutrient and chl a concentrations and between land use and nutrient concentrations these results indicated that climate change should be considered for the development of nutrient criteria and with a warmer climate achieving a desired water quality without the threat of eutrophication in the future will require stricter nutrient criteria than are required under the current climate conditions acknowledgments the national key

7156,random walk path methods including walk on spheres and walk on rectangles have been used to solve elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations pdes these methods are able to provide not only the pointwise solutions to the linear pdes but also contributions of boundaries and all source sink terms as an analytical solution does however due to difficulty in dealing with heterogeneity these methods cannot be applied to groundwater flow problems in highly heterogeneous aquifers a novel method called walk on grid wog is proposed based on lattice random walk to overcome the difficulty wog algorithm is verified in a 1d homogeneous transient problem a 1d heterogeneous steady state problem a 2d heterogeneous transient problem and a 3d optimization problem it is demonstrated that wog is effective in solving groundwater flow problems in highly heterogeneous confined aquifers probabilities of walkers arriving at prescribed boundaries terminal weights and source counts may be useful for characterization of medium heterogeneity wog method sheds a new light on solving the pdes of complicated groundwater problems in a changing environment and on analyzing medium heterogeneity keywords random walk walk on grid heterogeneity groundwater flow equation feynman kac theorem 1 introduction in groundwater modelling researchers generally use a set of governing equations to describe physical processes like water flow solute or heat transport and so on most if not all of these governing equations are pdes of diffusion type which often have to be solved through analytical or numerical approaches analytical solutions are able to provide comprehensive information of variables in the spatial temporal domain under study including contributions from each component in the model unfortunately analytical methods strongly rely on models simplification often oversimplification of reality and substantially impose remarkable restrictions on range of application when analytical solutions are unavailable hydrogeologists resort to numerical methods e g finite difference fdm and finite element methods fem for approximate solutions traditional numerical methods solve the governing equations for values of variables which hardly allow one to explicitly check the contributions of model components source terms boundary or initial conditions in those values without assistance of additional tools e g sensitivity analysis random walk path method is a pde solving method that solves elliptic and parabolic pdes via random walk simulation based on feynman kac formula it expresses the pointwise solutions in form of linear combinations of prescribed conditions and source sink terms it is noteworthy to distinguish this method with particle tracking method though based on random walk brownian motion as well the widely documented particle tracking method labolle et al 1996 valocchi and malmstead 1992 ramirez et al 2008 among many others is substantially different from the random walk path method on mathematical bases the particle tracking method is sometimes known as random walk particle method or random walk method to avoid confusion we refer to it as particle tracking method and the method demonstrated in this paper is termed random walk path rwp method the particle tracking relies on similarity between advection diffusion equation and fokker planck equation labolle et al 1996 or more precisely smoluchowski equation risken 1984 it is based on snapshotting of a large number of particles and known as one of lagrangian methods to solve solute transport problems fokker planck equation is also known as kolmogorov forward equation kfe which describes time evolution of probability density after time t given that probability density at time t is known in contrast kolmogorov backward equation kbe the adjoint of kfe traces back the historical probability density before time t under the condition of an occurrence at location x and time t kbe directly results in feynman kac theorem and rwp method is an application of the theorem interested readers are referred to literature on stochastic differential equations e g kallianpur and sundar 2014 for rigorous formulations and proofs behind kbe and kfe below it will be shown that rwp method relies on trackback of many random paths linking a single point with prescribed boundaries feynman kac theorem and implementation of rwp will be explained below in context of groundwater flow simulation first scheme of rwp method random walk on spheres wos was proposed by muller 1956 to solve the laplace equation with dirichlet boundaries muller s method is efficient for elliptic steady state equations but not for parabolic equations due to difficulty in simulating the first exit time i e the moment the walker stops at terminals later walk on rectangles wor was used to overcome this difficulty milstein and tretyakov 1999 but preferably applicable to problems with boundaries of polygonal shape deaconu and lejay 2006 some applied wos and wor to simulate pressure in dual porosity media campillo and lejay 2002 evaluating some physical properties of large molecules such as reaction rates and electrostatic energy mascagni and simonov 2004 estimate effective permeability based on pore geometry simonov and mascagni 2004 and so on both wos and wor work in the grid free spatial domain but time is discretized to steps that is a temporally stepwise random walk occurs in a spatially continuous domain since the walk path is not subject to predetermined discrete grid in theory the walker may make a huge step in a single move and exit the domain quickly it allows the walker completing a walk path fast and reduces computational cost in homogeneous media in heterogeneous media it is much harder to simulate random walks bhattacharya and gupta 1984 studied simulation of random walk in a cylinder with smoothly varying properties the result of which is quite limited to simple problems as to a single interface of discontinuity some models such as skew brownian motion itô and mckean 1963 1974 etore 2006 ramirez et al 2008 can be used to handle layered media if the medium shows heterogeneity of irregular shape the walker has to be replaced to a new position according to medium heterogeneity every time the walker passes an interface of parameter discontinuity lejay and martinez 2006 lejay and marie 2013 lejay and pichot 2012 some studies attempted to apply wos in bi material problems lejay and pichot 2016 maire and nguyen 2016 when the medium is highly heterogeneous the interface passage may occur in uncertain high frequency and the aforementioned replacement is extremely hard and impractical besides how to handle various boundary conditions including pure neumann mixing robin boundaries has recently been studied maire and tanré 2012 maire and nguyen 2016 for these reasons rwp method has not been tested or investigated in subsurface modelling which deals with complex components including high heterogeneity various boundary conditions time variant sink source terms in practical problems in this study a novel rwp scheme called walk on grids wog based on lattice random walk is proposed the objectives of this study include summarizing the theoretical background of rwp methods and ways of dealing with various boundary conditions introducing the implementation of wog method in groundwater modelling context and preliminarily demonstrating the capability of wog solution in groundwater modelling and management the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the theory and implementation of rwp method are introduced in section 3 we conduct a series of experiments one two three dimensional homogeneous heterogeneous steady state transient problems to explore the capability of wog the experimental results are discussed in section 4 and conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 formulation of the problem the basic governing equation for transient groundwater flow in confined and isotropic aquifers is 1 k x h x t w x t s s t h x t x d h x 0 h 0 x h x t h d x t x γ d k x n h x t q x t x γ n where x is a spatial vector k x is the location dependent hydraulic conductivity w x t is the source sink term s s is specific storage d is the aquifer domain γ d and γ n are dirichlet and neumann boundaries respectively n is the outward length normal to the boundary γ n we would like to solve this equation via monte carlo method in the domain d what we are interested in is not only the certain value of h x t but also the explicit contribution of h 0 x h d x t q x t and w x t in h x t 2 2 theoretic basis of rwp method 2 2 1 the link between pdes and random walk consider a simple 1d laplace equation δ u 0 assume that the values at points i 1 and i 2 u i 1 and u i 2 are already known and that one wants to solve the equation at point i on a uniform grid see fig 1 below intuitively one can express the approximate solution u i in terms of u i 1 and u i 2 according to the original equation one has an approximation second order central difference u i 1 u i 1 2 u i 0 and u i u i 2 2 u i 1 0 that is 2 u i 1 2 u i 1 1 2 u i 1 u i 1 1 2 u i 1 2 u i 2 and one can easily solve the equation set to obtain 3 u i 2 3 u i 1 1 3 u i 2 or in more general form 4 u i k 1 n t r k u k t where u k t denotes known values at prescribed boundaries the subscript t stands for terminal which terminates the chains of unknowns by known values here u 1 t u i 1 u 2 t u i 2 r 1 2 3 r 2 1 3 eqs 2 4 can be understood in perspective of probability though it seems totally irrelevant to any randomness assume u i to be a random variable at point i and that the probability of u i u i 1 is p 1 2 and the probability of u i u i 1 is p 1 2 similar for point i 1 we can define a random walk on a domain shown in fig 1 based on these probabilities at points i or i 1 a walker can move to left or right with probability p and p respectively and the walker will continue moving based on either or operation until it reaches point i 1 or i 2 i e it arrives at any terminal and exits the domain the walkers stops because the random variable equals a known value instead of another random variable i e u i u i 1 at point i 1 and u i u i 2 at point i 2 it can be easily shown by statistics that the walker stops at point i 1 with probability 2 3 i e exit probability or hitting probability r 1 and stops at point i 2 with probability 1 3 i e exit probability r 2 in the sense of probability u i u i 2 3 u i 1 1 3 u i 2 which is exactly eq 3 denotes expectation the coefficient r k represents the conditional probability that the walker exits the domain at i 1 or i 2 under the condition of starting from point i conventionally we solve sets of equations to obtain r k now we see that it is possible to get them by random walk in this simple example the exit probability or hitting probability can be analytically found via statistics or green s function method however in complicated high dimensional heterogeneous problems below numerical methods e g monte carlo simulation have to be used to obtain approximation of r k for all k contributions of source sink terms can also be considered which is demonstrated in next subsection rigid mathematical basis of this simple example is provided by feynman kac theorem which is briefly explained in the following subsection 2 2 2 feynman kac theorem and diffusion process equations feynman kac theorem establishes the relation between stochastic processes and pdes of diffusive processes for simplicity let s consider an elliptic pde with a piecewise smooth dirichlet boundary 5 k x h x w x 0 x d h x φ x x γ d for a bounded continuous function w x in d and a continuous function φ x on boundary feynman kac theorem states that the probabilistic representation of solution to eq 5 can be represented as 6 h x 0 0 t e 1 2 w z t d t z t 0 x 0 φ z e z t 0 x 0 where x 0 is the starting point of random walk path at which the pointwise solution is going to be solved z t is a random walk path starting from x 0 at t 0 and ending once hitting the boundary the time of hitting boundary t e is termed the first hitting time or exit time and the corresponding exit position is denoted as z e note that both z e and t e are random variables denotes conditional expectation with respect to the random path z originating from x 0 and ending at any boundary point the integral 0 t e 1 2 w z t d t represents cumulative impact of source sink terms along the path which vanishes if w 0 φ z e represents the head value at exit point and φ z e z t 0 x 0 is the conditional expectation of prescribed head at boundary with respect to z e k x influences h x 0 by impacting stochastic path z t the random walk path z is a markov chain and reversible loosely speaking according to reversibility the path z starting from x 0 and ending at z e can also be considered as a random walk path z starting from z e and ending at x 0 due to reversibility hence eq 6 can be equivalently written as h x 0 0 t e 1 2 w z s d s z t e x 0 φ z e z t e x 0 the way of expression in eq 6 is preferable in numerical implementation since it is much easier to simulate a path from x 0 to boundary nodes than to find a path arriving at x 0 it is also noteworthy that it is better to interpret eqs 1 and 5 as equations describing energy transfer rather than mass movement recall that hydraulic head is substantially a measure of energy normalized by specific weight having this in mind may be critical to understand several important issues e g effects of various boundaries why the walker goes randomly regardless of actual flow directions why downstream heads can influence upstream heads significantly why sources sinks increase decrease head values but don t add reduce the number of walkers and so on analog to temperature equations in context of heat transfer makes these issues much easier to understand for transient problems a parabolic equation shown below is to be solved 7 k x h x t w x t s s t h x t x d h x 0 ψ x h x t φ x t x γ d the idea is very similar to eq 5 except that time is treated as another dimension and the initial condition is taken as a prescribed head boundary γ d in time dimension γ d and γ d are sometimes termed terminal conditions together where the random walk terminates the solution is lejay and marie 2013 8 h x 0 t 0 t e t 1 2 w z s d s z t x 0 φ z e t e 1 z e γ d z t x 0 ψ z e 1 z e γ d z t x 0 where 1 z e γ d is an indicator function i e 1 z e γ d 1 when z e γ d is true and zero otherwise similar for 1 z e γ d it is noteworthy that standard feynman kac theorem applies to linear second order pdes in the form below see e g klebaner 2005 9 u t j 1 n μ j x t u x j j 1 n k 1 n ρ jk x t 2 u x j x k v x t u w x t where n is the dimension number ρ jk x t is the element of a matrix ρ x t σ σ t later on it was proved that the theorem also applies to the following linear second order pde eq 10 and parabolic equation eq 11 villa morales 2016 lejay and marie 2013 and references therein 10 k 1 n a j x t 2 u x j 2 j 1 n b j x u x j w x t with a j x t 0 and 11 t u x t a x u x t w x t therefore the solutions eqs 6 and 8 hold however due to difficulty in simulating random walk in highly heterogeneous media application of rwp to highly heterogeneous problems have not been investigated it partly motivates this study which requires efficient numerical implementations to evaluate the conditional expectations in eqs 6 and 8 2 3 numerical implementation as demonstrated above the key point of solving the eqs 5 and 7 transfers to how to evaluate eqs 6 and 8 analytically or numerically analytical evaluation of eqs 6 and 8 are often impossible or very difficult thus we focus on numerical method below i e monte carlo method a flowchart of numerically implementing rwp method is demonstrated in fig 2 the numerical implementation includes three major parts i e simulation of random walk paths determination of head at exit position and source accumulation along the path in each realization and averaging of head at exit position and source accumulation over all realizations the workflow is quite general and suitable for any boundary conditions the impacts of various boundary conditions are only reflected in the process of simulating random walk realizations which are discussed in section 2 4 as mentioned above there are two reported schemes in literature to simulate a random walk path realization wos and wor fig 3 a and b for either of them a number of independent random walk realizations which all start at point a are required below it is briefly shown how to implement a single realization for wos and wor in space a two dimensional case with dirichlet boundary for simplicity 2 3 1 wos scheme wos is the original scheme of rwp method and can date back to muller 1956 it relies on isotropy of brownian motion and is effective for homogeneous models to simulate a single realization of wos one needs to a starting from the initial position point a find the maximum circle centered at a inside the domain blue circle in fig 3 a denoted by ca b in homogeneous media since the exit position from circle ca is uniformly distributed on the circle select one point on ca randomly say point b as the exit point from ca c if the exit position b from ca is close enough to the domain boundary take b as the exit position from the entire domain and terminate the random walk otherwise continue the walk until a new exit position from circle is close enough to the boundary a large number of such realizations are needed as shown in fig 2 2 3 2 wor scheme wor scheme is very efficient when the domain boundary is polygonal and provides an exact way to simulate the exit time however it requires the green s function known which is mathematically complicated and not always possible a use each edge of the boundary to construct a rectangle as large as possible inside the domain fig 3 b b starting from the initial position point a select a rectangle which contains point a e g blue rectangle in fig 3 b denoted by ra c in homogeneous media calculate the probability distribution of the exit point from ra via green s function method and select one point randomly say point b on edges of ra as the exit point from ra d terminate the random walk if point b is also on the domain boundary otherwise continue the walk until a new exit point from rectangle is also on the domain boundary 2 3 3 wog scheme in heterogeneous media a random walk is distorted by the media and no longer homogeneous or isotropic wos and wor need a relocation including refraction every time the walker goes across any interface of discontinuous parameter e g k x in this study though the property of grid free in wos and wor is regarded as a significant advantage in some studies lejay and marie 2010 2013 its function is severely confined by ubiquitous high heterogeneity in geologic formations to apply rwp to groundwater modelling here we employ lattice random walk révész 2013 to replace standard grid free brownian motion to form a new scheme called random walk on grid wog the idea of wog is very similar to tour du wino tour of the drunk in french in mathematical and engineering applications e g farlow 1993 mikhailov and makarov 1997 as is known grid discretization based on finite difference method pervades in numerical simulation wog works on grids and is more compatible with the convention of gridding in numerical simulation of groundwater flow and transport besides it is straightforward more accurate with uniform grid and easy to implement take the solution to eq 5 for example the implementation of wog is explained below a discretize the domain with a regular or irregular grid in fig 3 c we use block centered grid i e each node represents a block or cell like those in modflow b like eq 2 find the finite difference approximation of the governing pde at each node and rewrite it into the form see appendix a for more details 12 h 0 i 1 n p i h i e 0 w 0 where h 0 is the head at current node the subscript denoting position zero h i is the head at a neighboring node i involved in the approximation w 0 in t 1 is the corresponding source term and e 0 in lt is a source coefficient determined by the approximation see e i j k of eq a8 in appendix a make sure that p i 0 for all i and i 1 n p i 1 less than occurs at robin boundaries see section 2 4 4 below check eq a9 for detailed expression of eq 12 not all finite difference fd schemes satisfy the prerequisite of probability non negativity appendix b demonstrates the validity of a popular scheme backward time centered space scheme btcs new fd schemes should be verified before usage c p i is the probability that the walker moves from the current node to node i depending on heterogeneity and discretization d starting from the initial position node a randomly move the walker to the next node say node b according to the probability p i e terminate the random walk if node b is a terminal node prescribed by dirichlet boundary or initial condition otherwise start from node b and continue walking until a terminal node assume the random walk path starts at node a and ends at the ith terminal node finally h a can be written in vector form h a d h t f w where h t is a vector containing heads at all terminal node d is a kronecker vector with its entry d j δ ij if the walker exits at node i w is an effective source vector with its entry w j e j w j e j is a source coefficient corresponding to the source term w j at node j f is a source count vector recording how many times each source node has been passed by on this walk path its entry f j corresponds to w j indicating how many times node j was visited by the walker in this path realization the inner product of vectors f w can be treated as head variation like drawdown induced by sink source terms along the path note that here h a d h t f w should be taken in the sense of probability according to eq 6 when a large number of realizations are conducted in a monte carlo experiment and ensemble mean is taken one has 13 h a d h t f w 1 n mc k 1 n mc d k h t f k w d h t f w where n mc is the number of realizations d 1 n mc k 1 n mc d k and f 1 n mc k 1 n mc f k the first and second terms on the right hand side of eq 13 reflect the influence of terminal conditions and the source term on h a respectively the entries of d show the occurrence frequency the walker exits the domain at every terminal node it is obvious that the summation of all entries in d equals 1 on the other hand d also represents the relative weight of prescribed heads at each terminal node to h a a larger d j value suggests a stronger hydraulic connection between the j th terminal node and node a the mean source count vector f directly reflects the impact of all source sink terms to h a and a larger entry represents higher importance to h a the procedure above can be easily extended to solve a parabolic equation in transient problems several major modifications include 1 time is an extra dimension thus the walker may walk in a four dimensional domain for three dimensional transient flow problems 2 at present only implicit schemes of finite difference are used such that the walker may walk in space to neighboring nodes or walk in time to a previous time step according to kbe the walker is prevented to walk forward in time to future unknowns 3 terminal conditions consist of not only dirichlet boundaries but also initial conditions see appendix a for more details about finite difference approximation and walker move in transient problems 2 4 boundary conditions when the walker in random walk motion hits a boundary the boundary type determines how the walker reacts the standard rwp methods work directly with dirichlet boundary below initial conditions in transient problems are treated as prescribed dirichlet conditions in time dimension as well in this subsection how to deal with various boundary conditions including dirichlet neumann mixed and robin types in wog are discussed 2 4 1 dirichlet boundary rwp method tries to link the solution to the terminals while counting the impact of source terms so that in a single realization h a h t j f j w note h t j is the information from dirichlet boundary the terminals consist of prescribed heads on dirichlet boundaries or initial conditions some treat the terminals as the location where the walker is absorbed or killed and thus where the random walk ends the convergence existence and uniqueness of the solution to dirichlet problems was well studied e g villa morales 2016 2 4 2 neumann boundary the simplest neumann boundary is no flux boundary for which one easily has equality between heads at points e and f in fig 4 h e h f it can be interpreted in the sense of probability i e h f p e h e where p e 1 p e 1 means that the walker will surely return to point e once it reaches point f in other words the walker will be reflected with probability 1 for a general neumann boundary condition k x n h x t q x t x γ n in finite difference approximation one has h f h e q ef d ef k ef where d ef is the discretization distance normal to the boundary the second term on the right side shows the impact of flux on head in some simulation tools e g mofflow neumann boundaries are treated as no flux boundaries plus a set of wells this kind of decomposition works in rwp as well that is neumann boundaries will reflect the walker and add a head variation produced by the boundary flux in a pure neumann problem only neumann boundary involved the walker reflection never stops and a general solution rather than specific solution exists maire and tanré 2012 investigated the behavior of rwp solution to a pure neumann steady state problem and proved that the solution has asymptotically a mean value zero and its variance increases linearly with steps in groundwater practice there always exist head observations and mixed boundary conditions are very common in wog the finite difference approximation h f h e q ef d ef k ef is sufficient in general situations 2 4 3 mixed boundary mixed boundary means the existence of dirichlet and neumann boundaries at different segments in one problem accordingly the walker is reflected at neumann boundaries until it is killed at dirichlet boundary 2 4 4 robin boundary robin boundary involves both head and its derivative i e a x h x t b x h x t n g x t x γ r by finite difference approximation one has a relation between heads at points u and v h v p u h u 1 p u g uv a uv where p u b uv b uv a uv d uv 1 and d uv is the discretization distance normal to the boundary according to maire and nguyen 2016 at point v g uv a uv is added to the head the walker is killed with probability 1 p u otherwise reflected to point u when b uv 0 and a uv 0 the boundary is equivalent to a dirichlet boundary and kills walkers with probability 1 when b uv 0 and a uv 0 the boundary is equivalent to a neumann boundary and reflects walkers with probability 1 hence robin boundary which may kill or reflect walkers is a mixture of dirichlet and neumann boundaries 2 5 heterogeneity in wos and wor every time the walker is at the interface of discontinuous parameters the walker is replaced at a new position and the random walk is restarted lejay and marie 2013 summarized three documented methods skew hoteit and 1d finite difference methods see references therein to handle medium heterogeneity in 1d problems neither skew method nor hoteit method is compatible with wog besides skew method cumulates errors fast of order o δ where δ is the step length of each move in problems of higher dimension other methods e g kinetic method mixing method and occupation method are required there is no general method valid for various problems in wor or wos in contrast wog introduced in this study is able to embody heterogeneity naturally in the finite difference approximation in fact heterogeneity information is included in p i value in eq 12 neighbors having higher k corresponds to higher p i value see appendix a for evaluation of p i furthermore finite difference approximation of the governing equation in wog also naturally guarantees energy balance at every node including the impact of source terms therefore wog is able to deal with heterogeneity in general multidimensional problems without any major modifications contrarily in wos and wor methods particular equations have to be separately derived to move walkers and evaluate the contribution of sources sinks for different dimensions lejay and marie 2013 which limits their applications in practice 3 numerical results the aim of this section is to verify the applicability of wog to solve common groundwater flow equations and investigate the characteristics and accuracy of the resulting solutions solving steady state problems in homogeneous media is fundamental for rwp methods and has been well studied see e g lejay and marie 2010 however transient problems are barely touched in literature so far lejay and marie 2013 lejay and pichot 2016 and highly heterogeneous problems have not been investigated here we solve transient and or highly heterogeneous problems with wog and compare the pointwise solutions to analytical or modflow simulation results 3 1 a one dimensional transient flow in homogeneous medium consider a one dimensional initial value problem below 14 t δ h x t s t h x t 0 x 1 h x 0 e x h 0 t e t h 1 t e t 1 for brevity consistent time and length units t and l are used for all quantities units are omitted below unless they are required for clarity without loss of generality let t s 1 l 2 t so that the simplified problem has an analytical solution h x t e x t in order to verify the capability of wog wog is used to solve this problem at a number of space time points and the results are compared to the analytical solution let δ t 10 4 δ x 10 2 realization number n mc 10 4 10 5 and 10 6 the numerical solutions compared to analytical solutions at time t 10 2 and t 1 0 are shown in figs 5 and 6 it can be seen that wog solutions are extremely close to the analytical ones unsurprisingly increases in realization number reduce the errors in solutions rmse root mean square error and mape mean absolute percentage error are used to quantify the deviation of wog solutions from analytical solutions or modflow rmse is defined as rmse i 1 n h rw i h i 2 n with h rw i denoting the i th head from random walk wog and h i denoting the true value of the i th head from analytical solution or modflow mape is defined as mape i 1 n h rw i h i h i n using the same numbers of realizations solutions at t 1 0 contain greater errors figs 5 and 6 and relative errors s1and s2 in table 1 than those at t 10 2 error growth may result from the increase in number of random walk steps before exit the observations that accuracy improves with increasing realizations and that errors grow with steps also occur in wos and wor deaconu and lejay 2006 lejay and marie 2013 quantitative investigation of error growth rate will be studied in future work the byproduct of wog solution is the terminal weight d 1 n mc k 1 n mc d k in eq 10 which represents the contribution each terminal node has on the solution fig 7 shows the terminal weights for h x 0 2 t 0 01 h x 0 5 t 0 01 h x 0 2 t 1 and h x 0 5 t 1 it can be seen that at early stage t 0 01 the initial conditions have the dominating weight blue lines and is the major factor of the solution and at late stage the impact of initial conditions tends to die out and the boundary conditions take over the contributions the weight distribution seems symmetric for solutions at x 0 5 and asymmetric for solutions at x 0 2 the reason is straightforward in homogeneous problems the relative distance to boundaries is the factor influencing the hitting probability of homogeneous random walk if one takes a close look at the terminal weight of a solution at late stage say h x 0 2 t 1 two significant facts can be noticed first though the weight curves look smooth in linear scale they oscillate remarkably in logarithmic scale due to sampling error especially for low values if the terminal conditions are discontinuous and strongly vary with time or space e g high frequency fluctuations the solution by rwp method may have large errors to avoid the oscillation some smoothing techniques e g moving average smoothing spline etc are possible as long as the weight summation and distribution shape remain unchanged second for sufficiently large t the terminal weight of the solution h x t at t 0 is negligible in theoretical and practical sense and the solution is nearly independent of the initial condition which we call quasi independence of initial condition all transient problems will become quasi independent of initial condition after a sufficiently long warm up period note that under quasi independence of initial condition the problem is not necessarily a steady state problem because the boundary conditions and source terms may be time variant in this case conventional methods like fdm or fem always require results from the previous time step as initial conditions for solutions in the current step in contrast the boundary weight in wog still works no matter whether boundary conditions and source terms are time invariant as long as the system structure including governing equation medium property and boundary type remains unchanged the procedure doesn t rely on any form of initial conditions even for transient problems like eq 14 in case of quasi independence of initial condition once the boundary weight is estimated one is able to evaluate the solution based on the weight and the new boundary conditions manually in seconds even for a problem of high dimension it is especially useful for subsurface system warning which requires quick estimation of the system state using newly collected state observations problems with source terms can also be considered which will be discussed below 3 2 a one dimensional steady state flow experiment in heterogeneous medium in this subsection a steady state flow problem in a heterogeneous medium is investigated the governing equation is expressed as 15 x k x x h x w x 0 x d h x φ x x γ d the domain 0 1 is evenly divided into 100 elements the log hydraulic conductivity lnk distribution is generated via sequential gaussian simulation in gslib toolbox deutsch and journel 1998 and shown in fig 9 the lnk field has the minimum maximum and mean values equal to 5 55 3 05 and 4 04 respectively dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed at two ends x 0 and x 1 with head equal to 100 and 90 respectively an injection well is located at x 0 5 with the injection rate w 0 2 l 2 t static head distribution with wog is solved using n mc 10 4 10 5 10 6 realizations and the results are compared to head values simulated by modflow code fig 9 fig 10 presents the errors in wog solutions relative to modflow result it can be seen that wog solutions match the result from modflow well the errors are noticeable when n mc 10 4 however increase in n mc reduces the errors efficiently when n mc 10 6 rmse reduces from 0 0385 to 0 0054 and mape reduces from 0 035 to 0 005 see s3 in table 1 fig 11 provides the terminal weights i e hitting probability of solutions at x 0 0 1 0 2 0 9 for boundary x 0 which is compared to the weights in an imaginary homogeneous case the impact of heterogeneity on weights is obvious in fact for a fixed location the structure of heterogeneity is the dominating factor besides the governing equation impact of heterogeneity on source counts is also obvious fig 12 presents the spatial distribution of source counts f for solutions at x 0 0 1 0 2 0 9 the x 0 for each curve is shown by a colored dot of the same color as the curve one may notice two interesting things first f is always zero at dirichlet boundaries and close to zero near dirichlet boundaries due to dirichlet boundary s absorbing impact to the walker second variations of f match quite well variations of k especially for solutions away from boundaries it suggests that f is able to reflect the structure of heterogeneity to some extent 3 3 a two dimensional transient flow experiment in heterogeneous medium consider a two dimensional problem of confined transient flow in heterogeneous medium with dirichlet and no flux boundaries the corresponding governing equation is 16 k x y h x y t w x y t s s t h x y t x d h x y 0 h 0 x y h x y t h d x y t x γ d n h x t 0 x γ n more specifically the model we consider here is a two dimensional confined aquifer of size 1440 800 l 2 evenly discretized into a grid of 72 40 cells with 20 l side length in x and y directions the aquifer thickness is 1 l and the top elevation is set to zero dirichlet boundaries with heads of 203 l and 197 l above datum are imposed on the left and right sides and the other four sides are prescribed as no flux boundaries a pumping well and an injection well are located at x 240 y 240 and x 1200 y 560 respectively with a same constant volumetric rate of 150 l 3 t initial heads are all equal to 197 l specific storage is assumed to be a constant equal to 0 0001 constant time step δ t 0 01 is used in both wog and modflow the lnk field is assumed to be a gaussian random field with zero mean and unit variance characterized by a separable exponential function having correlation lengths of 200 l and 100 l in x and y directions respectively the lnk sample field a fig 13 a is generated by karhunen loeve expansion zhang and lu 2004 in the sampled lnk field the maximum minimum and mean values are 3 711 2 487 and 0 429 respectively the standard deviation is equal to 0 853 k x y in the model is transformed from this lnk field which will be used for both wog solutions and modflow simulation in order to consider stronger heterogeneity one fault of high permeability k 100 l t lnk 4 6 and one fault of low permeability k 0 01 l t lnk 4 6 are implanted in the field in fig 13 a to form a new field field b in fig 13 b head contours for field a and b at t 10 simulated by modflow are shown in fig 13 c and d it seems that two additional faults in field b indeed influence the head distribution so that depression cone of the pumping well reaches the right boundary at t 10 with assistance of high conductivity fault heads at 68 positions and two moments t 1 and t 10 are solved via wog using n mc 10 4 10 5 10 6 realizations fig 14 shows the positions of wog solutions and compares head values calculated by modflow and wog at these positions for field a at t 1 for field a at t 10 and for field b at t 10 the corresponding rmse and mape are reported in table 1 s4 s5 and s6 it can be seen that 1 all head errors are very small 2 increases in n mc further reduce errors 3 errors are larger at t 10 than at t 1 when n mc 10 6 the largest absolute error is less than 0 2 not shown rmse 0 07 mape 0 027 for both fields a and b even mape 0 08 as n mc 10 5 is enough for many applications the terminal weight for h x 240 y 240 t 1 i e head at the pumping well with t 1 is shown in fig 15 when the number of realization increases from 104 to 105 the terminal weight distribution becomes remarkably finer further improvement is limited when the realization number further increases to 106 fig 16 presents the spatial distribution of source count in solutions located at two wells for field a at t 1 field a at t 10 and field b at t 10 note that all source counts shown in this figure are actually cumulated values of source count with respect to time from t 0 to specified time t m i e m 1 m f x i y j z k t m denoted by f s x i y j z k t m for example the value at x 240 y 240 in fig 16 a are the sum of source counts from t 0 to t 1 at that node i e m 1 m f 240 240 0 t m where m t m δ t 100 recall that f w in eq 13 represents the source impact to the solution in transient problems f w i 1 n x j 1 n y k 1 n z m 1 m f x i y j z k t m w x i y j z k t m if source terms w are time invariant and time step length is constant then w x i y j z k t m w x i y j z k and f w i 1 n x j 1 n y k 1 n z w x i y j z k m 1 m f x i y j z k t m i 1 n x j 1 n y k 1 n z w x i y j z k f s x i y j z k t m one can do the summation with respect to time step above because the sources are constant in time the differences between fig 16 a and c between b and d demonstrate time evolution of f s a x i y j z k t m the subscript a stands for field a the growth of f s a x i y j z k t m with time results from the gradual increase in numbers of random walk paths terminated at dirichlet boundaries that is the number of random walk paths killed at t 0 gradually decreases with time in fact the percentage of random walk paths ending at t 0 is negligible 0 1 after t m 100 not shown suggesting that f s x i y j z k t m tends to be steady after t m when t m 100 the model is under quasi independent of initial conditions and the model state can be approximated based on time series of boundary conditions and source terms during the latest period of 100 t it doesn t mean that the model reaches steady state since the boundaries or source terms may be time varying in that case f x i y j z k t m should not be summed up with respect to time furthermore heterogeneity can be identified in f s as well especially for the state of quasi independence ofinitial conditions if one compares fig 16 c with e he can easily identify the impact of high conductivity through abrupt areas of high or low source count similar observation can be found in fig 16 d and f fig 17 shows more clearly the impact of time and lnk fields 3 4 solution to a three dimensional flow experiment and application to a simple optimization example in this subsection the capability of wog is further explored in a three dimensional flow problem consider a confined system consisting of two aquifers and one aquitard fig 18 k x y for the top and bottom aquifers are generated using the same approach and statistics as in the previous subsection the middle aquitard is assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous with k 0 0005 l t the top elevation is set to zero each layer has the same size 1440 800 1 l 3 and is uniformly discretized into a grid of 72 40 1 with 20 l side length in x and y directions the dirichlet boundaries with heads equal to 100 above datum are imposed to two sides of x 0 and x 1440 other sides of the system are no flux boundaries two pumping wells are put in the bottom aquifer at point r1 x 240 y 240 z 2 5 and r4 x 1200 y 560 z 2 5 with a constant volumetric rate 100 l 3 t 3 4 1 validation of wog solution table 2 compares heads at seven nodes three within top layer two within middle layer and two within bottom layer evaluated by wog and modflow the resulting heads from two approaches are very close 3 4 2 application of wog solution to a simple optimization example assume that the head at r7 has to satisfy a constraint due to water management rule say h r 7 90 one wants to know the maximum total pumping rates of two wells traditional optimization methods are certainly able to solve this problem here wog solution provides a more straightforward alternative note that we have solved the source counts of two wells at r7 0 5327 for r1 and 0 3865 for r4 according to eq 10 h r 7 d r 7 h t f r 7 w 100 0 5327 c r 1 w r 1 0 3865 c r 2 w r 2 where c r 1 1 6 8854 c r 2 1 3 8267 hence the optimization problem transforms to min w r 1 w r 2 100 0 0774 w r 1 0 1010 w r 2 90 which can be solved by hand using linear programming the optimal solution is w r 1 129 1990 w r 2 0 it is validated by substituting the well pumping rates into modflow and calculating the head at r7 the resulting h r 7 90 0896 with the optimal pumping rates it suggests that optimal rates calculated by wog is reliable here the optimization problem is very simple which can definitely be solved by a number of approaches for instance response matrix method gorelick 1983 or influence coefficient method saffi and cheddadi 2007 and many optimization methods e g yeh 2015 etc a comprehensive comparison study of them may be of interest to groundwater community here the simple example is used to verify the accuracy of wog solutions 4 discussions 4 1 effectiveness of wog to high heterogeneity in all four experiments conducted in the previous section it is found that wog provides sufficiently accurate head solutions to one two three dimensional steady state transient flow problems in homogeneous or highly heterogeneous media in the one dimensional homogeneous experiment in section 3 1 the relative errors compared to the analytical solution are all less than 10 3 and mape is about 0 015 when n mc 10 6 in section 3 2 the heterogeneous case does not have an analytical solution hence wog solution is verified by comparison to modflow results in the present of an injection well absolute head errors are all less than 10 2 and mape 0 04 with n mc 10 6 in sections 3 3 and 3 4 for the 2d and 3d problems the largest absolute errors are 10 1 in spite of errors in modflow heads the reasons for larger errors may include two aspects first the walker walks in a space time grid of larger dimensions which may lead to larger sampling errors second according to eq 13 error in estimating f will be proportionally magnified by w in other words for a given wog solution larger pumping or injection rates result in larger head errors in the head results which also happens in fdm and other methods in sections 3 3 and 3 4 pumping injection rates 150 and 100 l 3 t are much higher than those in one dimensional experiments 0 and 0 2 l 3 t certainly the errors can be reduced by increasing numbers of realizations though the relation between errors and computational cost is not investigated in this study other studies on wos suggest that there exists a nearly linear relation between logarithmic of error and computational cost lejay and marie 2013 maire and nguyen 2016 it is highly probable that a similar relation may be valid in wog as well 4 2 terminal weights and source counts one strong point of wog or other rwp methods is that one is able to obtain the explicit information about contributions of each component in the system to the solution like initial condition dirichlet boundaries flux at neumann boundaries and all source terms the initial condition and dirichlet boundaries are contained in the terminal vector h t and the corresponding weights are in the terminal weight vector d fluxes at neumann boundaries and all source terms are collected in w and the source count vector f represents their contributions figs 7 8 11 and 15 demonstrate the spatial temporal distributions of terminal weights in three experiments figs 12 16 and 17 report the distribution of source count f in one or two dimensional spaces in those figures the hydraulic connections to the model components can be identified in a straightforward and quantitative manner such weight and source count results were seldom reported in literature of wos and wor probably because the media in which they are applied are more or less homogeneous thus weight results are less informative and helpful in fact terminal weight and source count contain information of medium heterogeneity figs 11 12 16 and 17 in fig 12 we have found that variations of f match variation of k x pretty well except near dirichlet boundaries where f tends to be zero besides f tends to have larger values near its corresponding starting point x 0 thus the distribution of f is the joint result of hydraulic conductivity dirichlet boundaries and location relative to starting position these points can also be verified in figs 16 and 17 one point which cannot be reflected in fig 12 is connectivity of f in 2d cases figs 16 17 it is found that the spatial pattern of k impacts f remarkably for instance inserting two faults leads to redistribution of f including decreases near low permeability fault decreases near the left part and increase near the right part of high permeability fault in fig 17 d and f in typical problems e g darcy s famous experiments constant heads will be applied on two opposite faces of the medium and no flux boundaries will be on the remaining faces such conditions are often used to measure the effective hydraulic conductivity in the domain when the same conditions are combined with wog method one can capture much information on medium heterogeneity in the perspective of hydrodynamics the underlying reason is that the pressure or energy diffusion controlled by heterogeneity can be mimicked by random walk probability terminal weight and source count are the final manifestation of sequential random walk probability it seems feasible to characterize medium heterogeneity predict effective hydraulic conductivity and measure connectivity based on terminal weight and source count in fact simonov and mascagni 2004 estimated effective permeability based on pore geometry which treated porous medium as absorbing boundaries and measured mean penetration depth of random walk into the medium to conjecture permeability systematic investigation is required to explore the link between heterogeneity pattern and distribution of source counts which will be studied in future 4 3 computational efficiency of wog computational efficiency is one of the most important aspects of an algorithm table 3 lists time costs in all experiments in this study as well as corresponding costs by modflow if applied it seems that wog using n mc 10 5 is less efficient than modflow which is based on fdm it is well known that fdm generally has the best efficiency compared to other common methods like fem fvm finite volume method or spectral methods there are still many reasons rather than efficiency to apply other methods higher cost of wog in table 3 doesn t mean that wog is necessarily less efficient than fdm or other methods unlike modflow which has been well developed for several decades and undergone professional code optimization wog code used in this study has potentials for speedup for example the mixing matlab fortran programming used in this study can be translated to pure fortran for higher efficiency and the property of monte carlo simulation is friendly to parallel computation feasible even in multi core personal computers which has not been equipped yet in this study furthermore the computational cost of wog is once and for all wog can be preferable for at least two foreseeable reasons first its terminal weights and source counts can be pre prepared then quickly and repetitively applied afterwards even for transient problems like the example in section 3 1 it can be very efficient to update the model state if used in such manners especially in engineering applications second its solutions as algebraic expression of terminal weights and source counts consider all possibilities of boundary values and temporal spatial distributions of sources sinks it allows the solution working as a highly simplified surrogate model when considering potential exploitation at known or unknown locations with known or unknown flow rates which may save a lot of computational cost in groundwater management simulation optimization or source identification problems these capabilities have not been explored in this single study but worthy of further investigation 4 4 strengths and limitations of wog one strength of wog is already discussed above i e the explicit contributions of each component in the system the second strength is the ability of wog solution to variations in terminal conditions and source terms again based on eq 13 h a d h t f w d and f will not change with specific values in h t and w it means when a new set of values in terminal conditions and source terms are given the new solution h a can be efficiently calculated it can be very useful in simulating different scenarios of groundwater exploitation as shown in section 3 4 2 expressing the solutions as a time series of time varying boundary conditions fast computation in groundwater warning system identifying unknown pumping or injection activities working as hydraulic surrogate models and so on the third strength is that all rwp methods including wog are computationally stable the last not least like other rwp methods wog does not solve any equation set and its solutions are pointwise solutions which allow one to obtain the solution to the pde without solving all other unknown variables simultaneously it could be helpful if one is only interested in variables at certain positions rather spatial distribution of variables in the entire domain nevertheless this point can be a limitation too if used in a situation where variables at a large number of points need to be solved since wog has to be run once for a point another significant limitation is that feynman kac formula seems valid for only linear pde and so does rwp methods wog included some theoretical attempts have been made in literature in order to extend the formula to nonlinear pdes peng 1991 bossy and talay 1995 fahim et al 2011 however more efforts are required before these extensions become applicable to high dimensional real problems an application of wog to a real steady state groundwater problem at ordos basin china was reported in nan et al 2018 in that study the water table was assumed to be nearly time invariant and known so that the water table can be treated as a neumann boundary more studies are required before wog can be applied to nonlinear groundwater problems 5 conclusions in this study two documented algorithms to implement random walk path methods wos and wor are summarized due to difficulty of applying wos or wor in highly heterogeneous media a novel algorithm called wog is proposed and verified in one two three dimensional steady state transient flow problems in homogeneous or highly heterogeneous media heads calculated by wog match well those evaluated by analytical solution or modflow code errors can be reduced by increasing the number of realizations used in monte carlo simulation it is demonstrated that wog is effective to obtain the pointwise solution to pdes of steady state or transient groundwater flow in heterogeneous media with or without source terms the byproduct of wog is the terminal weight and source counts which contain information of heterogeneity and may be useful in characterization of heterogeneity wog solutions do not rely on specific values in terminal conditions or source terms when a new set of values in terminal conditions and source terms are given the new solution can be quickly evaluated this property can be very useful in simulating different scenarios of groundwater exploitation exampled in section 3 4 2 expressing the solutions as a time series of time varying boundary conditions fast updating of model states in groundwater warning system and so on it seems that wog is able to deals with complex components in groundwater systems including high heterogeneity various boundary conditions sink source terms and transient behaviors wog method sheds a new light on solving the pdes of complicated groundwater problems in a changing environment in future the applicability of wog to unconfined aquifers and parabolic hyperbolic equations e g advection dispersion equations d x c x t v c r x t t c x t will be explored further investigation is required to fully recognize the applicability and capabilities of this method in many groundwater simulation problems acknowledgements this work is funded by the national natural science foundation of china grant

of three dimensional elliptic and parabolic pdes in a heterogeneous anisotropic aquifer in this appendix we explain in detail how to translate a general parabolic pde into a rule of random walk by

fig a1 k xx i 1 2 j k denotes the effective hydraulic conductivity between nodes i j k and i 1 j k in l t for brevity here we adopt the expression of hydraulic conductance used in modflow mcdonald and

section 2 3 3 eq 12 and w i j k m e i j k w i j k m in l then eq a6 can be rewritten as a9 h i j k m p x h i 1 j k m p x h i 1 j k m p y h i j 1 k m p y h i j 1 k m p z h i j k 1 m p z h i j k 1 m p t h i j k m 1 w i j k m where p x p x p y p y p z and p z represent the probabilities the walker moves from node i j k to nodes i 1 j k i 1 j k i j 1 k i j 1 k i j k 1 i j k 1 respectively p t denotes the probabilities the walker moves from time step m to time step m 1 obviously all these probabilities are within 0 1 and their summation is equal to 1 if a neighboring node say i 1 j k is out of the domain cc i 1 2 j k automatically becomes zero and p x 0 ensuring that the walker won t go out of the domain if cc i 1 2 j k is much larger than other terms in it leads to a dominating move to i 1 j k if s s 0 eq a1 becomes an elliptic equation for steady state problems and eq a9 still applies with p t 0 implying no change in time step note that when time step length t m t m 1 varies with time step m c s and p x p t will vary with time as well appendix b constraint of probability non negativity on finite difference schemes in appendix a it is shown that backward time centered space scheme btcs satisfy the prerequisite of probability non negativity one may wonder if other fd schemes satisfy the condition for simplicity let us consider a weighted six point scheme wsp for one dimensional flow in eq b1 without loss of generality assume that the discretization grid is uniform with space interval dx and time interval dt b1 t 2 x 2 h x t w x t s t h x t using wsp one has b2 θ t δ x 2 h i 1 m h

2 t s h i 1 m 1 h i 1 m 1 1 2 1 θ δ t δ x 2 t s h i m 1 δ t s w i m probability non negativity requires 1 2 1 θ δ t δ x 2 t s 0 i e 1 θ δ t δ x 2 t s 1 2 when 0 θ 1 it imposes a constraint on discretization length in space and time i e δ t δ x 2 s 2 t 1 θ for three dimensional cases the constraint is 1 2 1 θ δ t 1 δ x 2 k xx s s 1 δ y 2 k yy s s 1 δ z 2 k zz s s 0 which is more demanding than one dimensional case in heterogeneous problems it is hard to ensure the condition satisfied everywhere due to local heterogeneity in hydraulic properties however when θ 1 equivalent to btcs the condition is always satisfied that is θ 1 guarantees the non negativity regardless of discretization grid thus btcs is used in this study and recommended though other schemes are also possible the prerequisite of probability non negativity should be verified first such attempts can be done in further studies it is easy to check probability non negativity after finding the expression of probabilities at this stage implicit scheme will be sufficient for many applications 
7156,random walk path methods including walk on spheres and walk on rectangles have been used to solve elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations pdes these methods are able to provide not only the pointwise solutions to the linear pdes but also contributions of boundaries and all source sink terms as an analytical solution does however due to difficulty in dealing with heterogeneity these methods cannot be applied to groundwater flow problems in highly heterogeneous aquifers a novel method called walk on grid wog is proposed based on lattice random walk to overcome the difficulty wog algorithm is verified in a 1d homogeneous transient problem a 1d heterogeneous steady state problem a 2d heterogeneous transient problem and a 3d optimization problem it is demonstrated that wog is effective in solving groundwater flow problems in highly heterogeneous confined aquifers probabilities of walkers arriving at prescribed boundaries terminal weights and source counts may be useful for characterization of medium heterogeneity wog method sheds a new light on solving the pdes of complicated groundwater problems in a changing environment and on analyzing medium heterogeneity keywords random walk walk on grid heterogeneity groundwater flow equation feynman kac theorem 1 introduction in groundwater modelling researchers generally use a set of governing equations to describe physical processes like water flow solute or heat transport and so on most if not all of these governing equations are pdes of diffusion type which often have to be solved through analytical or numerical approaches analytical solutions are able to provide comprehensive information of variables in the spatial temporal domain under study including contributions from each component in the model unfortunately analytical methods strongly rely on models simplification often oversimplification of reality and substantially impose remarkable restrictions on range of application when analytical solutions are unavailable hydrogeologists resort to numerical methods e g finite difference fdm and finite element methods fem for approximate solutions traditional numerical methods solve the governing equations for values of variables which hardly allow one to explicitly check the contributions of model components source terms boundary or initial conditions in those values without assistance of additional tools e g sensitivity analysis random walk path method is a pde solving method that solves elliptic and parabolic pdes via random walk simulation based on feynman kac formula it expresses the pointwise solutions in form of linear combinations of prescribed conditions and source sink terms it is noteworthy to distinguish this method with particle tracking method though based on random walk brownian motion as well the widely documented particle tracking method labolle et al 1996 valocchi and malmstead 1992 ramirez et al 2008 among many others is substantially different from the random walk path method on mathematical bases the particle tracking method is sometimes known as random walk particle method or random walk method to avoid confusion we refer to it as particle tracking method and the method demonstrated in this paper is termed random walk path rwp method the particle tracking relies on similarity between advection diffusion equation and fokker planck equation labolle et al 1996 or more precisely smoluchowski equation risken 1984 it is based on snapshotting of a large number of particles and known as one of lagrangian methods to solve solute transport problems fokker planck equation is also known as kolmogorov forward equation kfe which describes time evolution of probability density after time t given that probability density at time t is known in contrast kolmogorov backward equation kbe the adjoint of kfe traces back the historical probability density before time t under the condition of an occurrence at location x and time t kbe directly results in feynman kac theorem and rwp method is an application of the theorem interested readers are referred to literature on stochastic differential equations e g kallianpur and sundar 2014 for rigorous formulations and proofs behind kbe and kfe below it will be shown that rwp method relies on trackback of many random paths linking a single point with prescribed boundaries feynman kac theorem and implementation of rwp will be explained below in context of groundwater flow simulation first scheme of rwp method random walk on spheres wos was proposed by muller 1956 to solve the laplace equation with dirichlet boundaries muller s method is efficient for elliptic steady state equations but not for parabolic equations due to difficulty in simulating the first exit time i e the moment the walker stops at terminals later walk on rectangles wor was used to overcome this difficulty milstein and tretyakov 1999 but preferably applicable to problems with boundaries of polygonal shape deaconu and lejay 2006 some applied wos and wor to simulate pressure in dual porosity media campillo and lejay 2002 evaluating some physical properties of large molecules such as reaction rates and electrostatic energy mascagni and simonov 2004 estimate effective permeability based on pore geometry simonov and mascagni 2004 and so on both wos and wor work in the grid free spatial domain but time is discretized to steps that is a temporally stepwise random walk occurs in a spatially continuous domain since the walk path is not subject to predetermined discrete grid in theory the walker may make a huge step in a single move and exit the domain quickly it allows the walker completing a walk path fast and reduces computational cost in homogeneous media in heterogeneous media it is much harder to simulate random walks bhattacharya and gupta 1984 studied simulation of random walk in a cylinder with smoothly varying properties the result of which is quite limited to simple problems as to a single interface of discontinuity some models such as skew brownian motion itô and mckean 1963 1974 etore 2006 ramirez et al 2008 can be used to handle layered media if the medium shows heterogeneity of irregular shape the walker has to be replaced to a new position according to medium heterogeneity every time the walker passes an interface of parameter discontinuity lejay and martinez 2006 lejay and marie 2013 lejay and pichot 2012 some studies attempted to apply wos in bi material problems lejay and pichot 2016 maire and nguyen 2016 when the medium is highly heterogeneous the interface passage may occur in uncertain high frequency and the aforementioned replacement is extremely hard and impractical besides how to handle various boundary conditions including pure neumann mixing robin boundaries has recently been studied maire and tanré 2012 maire and nguyen 2016 for these reasons rwp method has not been tested or investigated in subsurface modelling which deals with complex components including high heterogeneity various boundary conditions time variant sink source terms in practical problems in this study a novel rwp scheme called walk on grids wog based on lattice random walk is proposed the objectives of this study include summarizing the theoretical background of rwp methods and ways of dealing with various boundary conditions introducing the implementation of wog method in groundwater modelling context and preliminarily demonstrating the capability of wog solution in groundwater modelling and management the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the theory and implementation of rwp method are introduced in section 3 we conduct a series of experiments one two three dimensional homogeneous heterogeneous steady state transient problems to explore the capability of wog the experimental results are discussed in section 4 and conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 formulation of the problem the basic governing equation for transient groundwater flow in confined and isotropic aquifers is 1 k x h x t w x t s s t h x t x d h x 0 h 0 x h x t h d x t x γ d k x n h x t q x t x γ n where x is a spatial vector k x is the location dependent hydraulic conductivity w x t is the source sink term s s is specific storage d is the aquifer domain γ d and γ n are dirichlet and neumann boundaries respectively n is the outward length normal to the boundary γ n we would like to solve this equation via monte carlo method in the domain d what we are interested in is not only the certain value of h x t but also the explicit contribution of h 0 x h d x t q x t and w x t in h x t 2 2 theoretic basis of rwp method 2 2 1 the link between pdes and random walk consider a simple 1d laplace equation δ u 0 assume that the values at points i 1 and i 2 u i 1 and u i 2 are already known and that one wants to solve the equation at point i on a uniform grid see fig 1 below intuitively one can express the approximate solution u i in terms of u i 1 and u i 2 according to the original equation one has an approximation second order central difference u i 1 u i 1 2 u i 0 and u i u i 2 2 u i 1 0 that is 2 u i 1 2 u i 1 1 2 u i 1 u i 1 1 2 u i 1 2 u i 2 and one can easily solve the equation set to obtain 3 u i 2 3 u i 1 1 3 u i 2 or in more general form 4 u i k 1 n t r k u k t where u k t denotes known values at prescribed boundaries the subscript t stands for terminal which terminates the chains of unknowns by known values here u 1 t u i 1 u 2 t u i 2 r 1 2 3 r 2 1 3 eqs 2 4 can be understood in perspective of probability though it seems totally irrelevant to any randomness assume u i to be a random variable at point i and that the probability of u i u i 1 is p 1 2 and the probability of u i u i 1 is p 1 2 similar for point i 1 we can define a random walk on a domain shown in fig 1 based on these probabilities at points i or i 1 a walker can move to left or right with probability p and p respectively and the walker will continue moving based on either or operation until it reaches point i 1 or i 2 i e it arrives at any terminal and exits the domain the walkers stops because the random variable equals a known value instead of another random variable i e u i u i 1 at point i 1 and u i u i 2 at point i 2 it can be easily shown by statistics that the walker stops at point i 1 with probability 2 3 i e exit probability or hitting probability r 1 and stops at point i 2 with probability 1 3 i e exit probability r 2 in the sense of probability u i u i 2 3 u i 1 1 3 u i 2 which is exactly eq 3 denotes expectation the coefficient r k represents the conditional probability that the walker exits the domain at i 1 or i 2 under the condition of starting from point i conventionally we solve sets of equations to obtain r k now we see that it is possible to get them by random walk in this simple example the exit probability or hitting probability can be analytically found via statistics or green s function method however in complicated high dimensional heterogeneous problems below numerical methods e g monte carlo simulation have to be used to obtain approximation of r k for all k contributions of source sink terms can also be considered which is demonstrated in next subsection rigid mathematical basis of this simple example is provided by feynman kac theorem which is briefly explained in the following subsection 2 2 2 feynman kac theorem and diffusion process equations feynman kac theorem establishes the relation between stochastic processes and pdes of diffusive processes for simplicity let s consider an elliptic pde with a piecewise smooth dirichlet boundary 5 k x h x w x 0 x d h x φ x x γ d for a bounded continuous function w x in d and a continuous function φ x on boundary feynman kac theorem states that the probabilistic representation of solution to eq 5 can be represented as 6 h x 0 0 t e 1 2 w z t d t z t 0 x 0 φ z e z t 0 x 0 where x 0 is the starting point of random walk path at which the pointwise solution is going to be solved z t is a random walk path starting from x 0 at t 0 and ending once hitting the boundary the time of hitting boundary t e is termed the first hitting time or exit time and the corresponding exit position is denoted as z e note that both z e and t e are random variables denotes conditional expectation with respect to the random path z originating from x 0 and ending at any boundary point the integral 0 t e 1 2 w z t d t represents cumulative impact of source sink terms along the path which vanishes if w 0 φ z e represents the head value at exit point and φ z e z t 0 x 0 is the conditional expectation of prescribed head at boundary with respect to z e k x influences h x 0 by impacting stochastic path z t the random walk path z is a markov chain and reversible loosely speaking according to reversibility the path z starting from x 0 and ending at z e can also be considered as a random walk path z starting from z e and ending at x 0 due to reversibility hence eq 6 can be equivalently written as h x 0 0 t e 1 2 w z s d s z t e x 0 φ z e z t e x 0 the way of expression in eq 6 is preferable in numerical implementation since it is much easier to simulate a path from x 0 to boundary nodes than to find a path arriving at x 0 it is also noteworthy that it is better to interpret eqs 1 and 5 as equations describing energy transfer rather than mass movement recall that hydraulic head is substantially a measure of energy normalized by specific weight having this in mind may be critical to understand several important issues e g effects of various boundaries why the walker goes randomly regardless of actual flow directions why downstream heads can influence upstream heads significantly why sources sinks increase decrease head values but don t add reduce the number of walkers and so on analog to temperature equations in context of heat transfer makes these issues much easier to understand for transient problems a parabolic equation shown below is to be solved 7 k x h x t w x t s s t h x t x d h x 0 ψ x h x t φ x t x γ d the idea is very similar to eq 5 except that time is treated as another dimension and the initial condition is taken as a prescribed head boundary γ d in time dimension γ d and γ d are sometimes termed terminal conditions together where the random walk terminates the solution is lejay and marie 2013 8 h x 0 t 0 t e t 1 2 w z s d s z t x 0 φ z e t e 1 z e γ d z t x 0 ψ z e 1 z e γ d z t x 0 where 1 z e γ d is an indicator function i e 1 z e γ d 1 when z e γ d is true and zero otherwise similar for 1 z e γ d it is noteworthy that standard feynman kac theorem applies to linear second order pdes in the form below see e g klebaner 2005 9 u t j 1 n μ j x t u x j j 1 n k 1 n ρ jk x t 2 u x j x k v x t u w x t where n is the dimension number ρ jk x t is the element of a matrix ρ x t σ σ t later on it was proved that the theorem also applies to the following linear second order pde eq 10 and parabolic equation eq 11 villa morales 2016 lejay and marie 2013 and references therein 10 k 1 n a j x t 2 u x j 2 j 1 n b j x u x j w x t with a j x t 0 and 11 t u x t a x u x t w x t therefore the solutions eqs 6 and 8 hold however due to difficulty in simulating random walk in highly heterogeneous media application of rwp to highly heterogeneous problems have not been investigated it partly motivates this study which requires efficient numerical implementations to evaluate the conditional expectations in eqs 6 and 8 2 3 numerical implementation as demonstrated above the key point of solving the eqs 5 and 7 transfers to how to evaluate eqs 6 and 8 analytically or numerically analytical evaluation of eqs 6 and 8 are often impossible or very difficult thus we focus on numerical method below i e monte carlo method a flowchart of numerically implementing rwp method is demonstrated in fig 2 the numerical implementation includes three major parts i e simulation of random walk paths determination of head at exit position and source accumulation along the path in each realization and averaging of head at exit position and source accumulation over all realizations the workflow is quite general and suitable for any boundary conditions the impacts of various boundary conditions are only reflected in the process of simulating random walk realizations which are discussed in section 2 4 as mentioned above there are two reported schemes in literature to simulate a random walk path realization wos and wor fig 3 a and b for either of them a number of independent random walk realizations which all start at point a are required below it is briefly shown how to implement a single realization for wos and wor in space a two dimensional case with dirichlet boundary for simplicity 2 3 1 wos scheme wos is the original scheme of rwp method and can date back to muller 1956 it relies on isotropy of brownian motion and is effective for homogeneous models to simulate a single realization of wos one needs to a starting from the initial position point a find the maximum circle centered at a inside the domain blue circle in fig 3 a denoted by ca b in homogeneous media since the exit position from circle ca is uniformly distributed on the circle select one point on ca randomly say point b as the exit point from ca c if the exit position b from ca is close enough to the domain boundary take b as the exit position from the entire domain and terminate the random walk otherwise continue the walk until a new exit position from circle is close enough to the boundary a large number of such realizations are needed as shown in fig 2 2 3 2 wor scheme wor scheme is very efficient when the domain boundary is polygonal and provides an exact way to simulate the exit time however it requires the green s function known which is mathematically complicated and not always possible a use each edge of the boundary to construct a rectangle as large as possible inside the domain fig 3 b b starting from the initial position point a select a rectangle which contains point a e g blue rectangle in fig 3 b denoted by ra c in homogeneous media calculate the probability distribution of the exit point from ra via green s function method and select one point randomly say point b on edges of ra as the exit point from ra d terminate the random walk if point b is also on the domain boundary otherwise continue the walk until a new exit point from rectangle is also on the domain boundary 2 3 3 wog scheme in heterogeneous media a random walk is distorted by the media and no longer homogeneous or isotropic wos and wor need a relocation including refraction every time the walker goes across any interface of discontinuous parameter e g k x in this study though the property of grid free in wos and wor is regarded as a significant advantage in some studies lejay and marie 2010 2013 its function is severely confined by ubiquitous high heterogeneity in geologic formations to apply rwp to groundwater modelling here we employ lattice random walk révész 2013 to replace standard grid free brownian motion to form a new scheme called random walk on grid wog the idea of wog is very similar to tour du wino tour of the drunk in french in mathematical and engineering applications e g farlow 1993 mikhailov and makarov 1997 as is known grid discretization based on finite difference method pervades in numerical simulation wog works on grids and is more compatible with the convention of gridding in numerical simulation of groundwater flow and transport besides it is straightforward more accurate with uniform grid and easy to implement take the solution to eq 5 for example the implementation of wog is explained below a discretize the domain with a regular or irregular grid in fig 3 c we use block centered grid i e each node represents a block or cell like those in modflow b like eq 2 find the finite difference approximation of the governing pde at each node and rewrite it into the form see appendix a for more details 12 h 0 i 1 n p i h i e 0 w 0 where h 0 is the head at current node the subscript denoting position zero h i is the head at a neighboring node i involved in the approximation w 0 in t 1 is the corresponding source term and e 0 in lt is a source coefficient determined by the approximation see e i j k of eq a8 in appendix a make sure that p i 0 for all i and i 1 n p i 1 less than occurs at robin boundaries see section 2 4 4 below check eq a9 for detailed expression of eq 12 not all finite difference fd schemes satisfy the prerequisite of probability non negativity appendix b demonstrates the validity of a popular scheme backward time centered space scheme btcs new fd schemes should be verified before usage c p i is the probability that the walker moves from the current node to node i depending on heterogeneity and discretization d starting from the initial position node a randomly move the walker to the next node say node b according to the probability p i e terminate the random walk if node b is a terminal node prescribed by dirichlet boundary or initial condition otherwise start from node b and continue walking until a terminal node assume the random walk path starts at node a and ends at the ith terminal node finally h a can be written in vector form h a d h t f w where h t is a vector containing heads at all terminal node d is a kronecker vector with its entry d j δ ij if the walker exits at node i w is an effective source vector with its entry w j e j w j e j is a source coefficient corresponding to the source term w j at node j f is a source count vector recording how many times each source node has been passed by on this walk path its entry f j corresponds to w j indicating how many times node j was visited by the walker in this path realization the inner product of vectors f w can be treated as head variation like drawdown induced by sink source terms along the path note that here h a d h t f w should be taken in the sense of probability according to eq 6 when a large number of realizations are conducted in a monte carlo experiment and ensemble mean is taken one has 13 h a d h t f w 1 n mc k 1 n mc d k h t f k w d h t f w where n mc is the number of realizations d 1 n mc k 1 n mc d k and f 1 n mc k 1 n mc f k the first and second terms on the right hand side of eq 13 reflect the influence of terminal conditions and the source term on h a respectively the entries of d show the occurrence frequency the walker exits the domain at every terminal node it is obvious that the summation of all entries in d equals 1 on the other hand d also represents the relative weight of prescribed heads at each terminal node to h a a larger d j value suggests a stronger hydraulic connection between the j th terminal node and node a the mean source count vector f directly reflects the impact of all source sink terms to h a and a larger entry represents higher importance to h a the procedure above can be easily extended to solve a parabolic equation in transient problems several major modifications include 1 time is an extra dimension thus the walker may walk in a four dimensional domain for three dimensional transient flow problems 2 at present only implicit schemes of finite difference are used such that the walker may walk in space to neighboring nodes or walk in time to a previous time step according to kbe the walker is prevented to walk forward in time to future unknowns 3 terminal conditions consist of not only dirichlet boundaries but also initial conditions see appendix a for more details about finite difference approximation and walker move in transient problems 2 4 boundary conditions when the walker in random walk motion hits a boundary the boundary type determines how the walker reacts the standard rwp methods work directly with dirichlet boundary below initial conditions in transient problems are treated as prescribed dirichlet conditions in time dimension as well in this subsection how to deal with various boundary conditions including dirichlet neumann mixed and robin types in wog are discussed 2 4 1 dirichlet boundary rwp method tries to link the solution to the terminals while counting the impact of source terms so that in a single realization h a h t j f j w note h t j is the information from dirichlet boundary the terminals consist of prescribed heads on dirichlet boundaries or initial conditions some treat the terminals as the location where the walker is absorbed or killed and thus where the random walk ends the convergence existence and uniqueness of the solution to dirichlet problems was well studied e g villa morales 2016 2 4 2 neumann boundary the simplest neumann boundary is no flux boundary for which one easily has equality between heads at points e and f in fig 4 h e h f it can be interpreted in the sense of probability i e h f p e h e where p e 1 p e 1 means that the walker will surely return to point e once it reaches point f in other words the walker will be reflected with probability 1 for a general neumann boundary condition k x n h x t q x t x γ n in finite difference approximation one has h f h e q ef d ef k ef where d ef is the discretization distance normal to the boundary the second term on the right side shows the impact of flux on head in some simulation tools e g mofflow neumann boundaries are treated as no flux boundaries plus a set of wells this kind of decomposition works in rwp as well that is neumann boundaries will reflect the walker and add a head variation produced by the boundary flux in a pure neumann problem only neumann boundary involved the walker reflection never stops and a general solution rather than specific solution exists maire and tanré 2012 investigated the behavior of rwp solution to a pure neumann steady state problem and proved that the solution has asymptotically a mean value zero and its variance increases linearly with steps in groundwater practice there always exist head observations and mixed boundary conditions are very common in wog the finite difference approximation h f h e q ef d ef k ef is sufficient in general situations 2 4 3 mixed boundary mixed boundary means the existence of dirichlet and neumann boundaries at different segments in one problem accordingly the walker is reflected at neumann boundaries until it is killed at dirichlet boundary 2 4 4 robin boundary robin boundary involves both head and its derivative i e a x h x t b x h x t n g x t x γ r by finite difference approximation one has a relation between heads at points u and v h v p u h u 1 p u g uv a uv where p u b uv b uv a uv d uv 1 and d uv is the discretization distance normal to the boundary according to maire and nguyen 2016 at point v g uv a uv is added to the head the walker is killed with probability 1 p u otherwise reflected to point u when b uv 0 and a uv 0 the boundary is equivalent to a dirichlet boundary and kills walkers with probability 1 when b uv 0 and a uv 0 the boundary is equivalent to a neumann boundary and reflects walkers with probability 1 hence robin boundary which may kill or reflect walkers is a mixture of dirichlet and neumann boundaries 2 5 heterogeneity in wos and wor every time the walker is at the interface of discontinuous parameters the walker is replaced at a new position and the random walk is restarted lejay and marie 2013 summarized three documented methods skew hoteit and 1d finite difference methods see references therein to handle medium heterogeneity in 1d problems neither skew method nor hoteit method is compatible with wog besides skew method cumulates errors fast of order o δ where δ is the step length of each move in problems of higher dimension other methods e g kinetic method mixing method and occupation method are required there is no general method valid for various problems in wor or wos in contrast wog introduced in this study is able to embody heterogeneity naturally in the finite difference approximation in fact heterogeneity information is included in p i value in eq 12 neighbors having higher k corresponds to higher p i value see appendix a for evaluation of p i furthermore finite difference approximation of the governing equation in wog also naturally guarantees energy balance at every node including the impact of source terms therefore wog is able to deal with heterogeneity in general multidimensional problems without any major modifications contrarily in wos and wor methods particular equations have to be separately derived to move walkers and evaluate the contribution of sources sinks for different dimensions lejay and marie 2013 which limits their applications in practice 3 numerical results the aim of this section is to verify the applicability of wog to solve common groundwater flow equations and investigate the characteristics and accuracy of the resulting solutions solving steady state problems in homogeneous media is fundamental for rwp methods and has been well studied see e g lejay and marie 2010 however transient problems are barely touched in literature so far lejay and marie 2013 lejay and pichot 2016 and highly heterogeneous problems have not been investigated here we solve transient and or highly heterogeneous problems with wog and compare the pointwise solutions to analytical or modflow simulation results 3 1 a one dimensional transient flow in homogeneous medium consider a one dimensional initial value problem below 14 t δ h x t s t h x t 0 x 1 h x 0 e x h 0 t e t h 1 t e t 1 for brevity consistent time and length units t and l are used for all quantities units are omitted below unless they are required for clarity without loss of generality let t s 1 l 2 t so that the simplified problem has an analytical solution h x t e x t in order to verify the capability of wog wog is used to solve this problem at a number of space time points and the results are compared to the analytical solution let δ t 10 4 δ x 10 2 realization number n mc 10 4 10 5 and 10 6 the numerical solutions compared to analytical solutions at time t 10 2 and t 1 0 are shown in figs 5 and 6 it can be seen that wog solutions are extremely close to the analytical ones unsurprisingly increases in realization number reduce the errors in solutions rmse root mean square error and mape mean absolute percentage error are used to quantify the deviation of wog solutions from analytical solutions or modflow rmse is defined as rmse i 1 n h rw i h i 2 n with h rw i denoting the i th head from random walk wog and h i denoting the true value of the i th head from analytical solution or modflow mape is defined as mape i 1 n h rw i h i h i n using the same numbers of realizations solutions at t 1 0 contain greater errors figs 5 and 6 and relative errors s1and s2 in table 1 than those at t 10 2 error growth may result from the increase in number of random walk steps before exit the observations that accuracy improves with increasing realizations and that errors grow with steps also occur in wos and wor deaconu and lejay 2006 lejay and marie 2013 quantitative investigation of error growth rate will be studied in future work the byproduct of wog solution is the terminal weight d 1 n mc k 1 n mc d k in eq 10 which represents the contribution each terminal node has on the solution fig 7 shows the terminal weights for h x 0 2 t 0 01 h x 0 5 t 0 01 h x 0 2 t 1 and h x 0 5 t 1 it can be seen that at early stage t 0 01 the initial conditions have the dominating weight blue lines and is the major factor of the solution and at late stage the impact of initial conditions tends to die out and the boundary conditions take over the contributions the weight distribution seems symmetric for solutions at x 0 5 and asymmetric for solutions at x 0 2 the reason is straightforward in homogeneous problems the relative distance to boundaries is the factor influencing the hitting probability of homogeneous random walk if one takes a close look at the terminal weight of a solution at late stage say h x 0 2 t 1 two significant facts can be noticed first though the weight curves look smooth in linear scale they oscillate remarkably in logarithmic scale due to sampling error especially for low values if the terminal conditions are discontinuous and strongly vary with time or space e g high frequency fluctuations the solution by rwp method may have large errors to avoid the oscillation some smoothing techniques e g moving average smoothing spline etc are possible as long as the weight summation and distribution shape remain unchanged second for sufficiently large t the terminal weight of the solution h x t at t 0 is negligible in theoretical and practical sense and the solution is nearly independent of the initial condition which we call quasi independence of initial condition all transient problems will become quasi independent of initial condition after a sufficiently long warm up period note that under quasi independence of initial condition the problem is not necessarily a steady state problem because the boundary conditions and source terms may be time variant in this case conventional methods like fdm or fem always require results from the previous time step as initial conditions for solutions in the current step in contrast the boundary weight in wog still works no matter whether boundary conditions and source terms are time invariant as long as the system structure including governing equation medium property and boundary type remains unchanged the procedure doesn t rely on any form of initial conditions even for transient problems like eq 14 in case of quasi independence of initial condition once the boundary weight is estimated one is able to evaluate the solution based on the weight and the new boundary conditions manually in seconds even for a problem of high dimension it is especially useful for subsurface system warning which requires quick estimation of the system state using newly collected state observations problems with source terms can also be considered which will be discussed below 3 2 a one dimensional steady state flow experiment in heterogeneous medium in this subsection a steady state flow problem in a heterogeneous medium is investigated the governing equation is expressed as 15 x k x x h x w x 0 x d h x φ x x γ d the domain 0 1 is evenly divided into 100 elements the log hydraulic conductivity lnk distribution is generated via sequential gaussian simulation in gslib toolbox deutsch and journel 1998 and shown in fig 9 the lnk field has the minimum maximum and mean values equal to 5 55 3 05 and 4 04 respectively dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed at two ends x 0 and x 1 with head equal to 100 and 90 respectively an injection well is located at x 0 5 with the injection rate w 0 2 l 2 t static head distribution with wog is solved using n mc 10 4 10 5 10 6 realizations and the results are compared to head values simulated by modflow code fig 9 fig 10 presents the errors in wog solutions relative to modflow result it can be seen that wog solutions match the result from modflow well the errors are noticeable when n mc 10 4 however increase in n mc reduces the errors efficiently when n mc 10 6 rmse reduces from 0 0385 to 0 0054 and mape reduces from 0 035 to 0 005 see s3 in table 1 fig 11 provides the terminal weights i e hitting probability of solutions at x 0 0 1 0 2 0 9 for boundary x 0 which is compared to the weights in an imaginary homogeneous case the impact of heterogeneity on weights is obvious in fact for a fixed location the structure of heterogeneity is the dominating factor besides the governing equation impact of heterogeneity on source counts is also obvious fig 12 presents the spatial distribution of source counts f for solutions at x 0 0 1 0 2 0 9 the x 0 for each curve is shown by a colored dot of the same color as the curve one may notice two interesting things first f is always zero at dirichlet boundaries and close to zero near dirichlet boundaries due to dirichlet boundary s absorbing impact to the walker second variations of f match quite well variations of k especially for solutions away from boundaries it suggests that f is able to reflect the structure of heterogeneity to some extent 3 3 a two dimensional transient flow experiment in heterogeneous medium consider a two dimensional problem of confined transient flow in heterogeneous medium with dirichlet and no flux boundaries the corresponding governing equation is 16 k x y h x y t w x y t s s t h x y t x d h x y 0 h 0 x y h x y t h d x y t x γ d n h x t 0 x γ n more specifically the model we consider here is a two dimensional confined aquifer of size 1440 800 l 2 evenly discretized into a grid of 72 40 cells with 20 l side length in x and y directions the aquifer thickness is 1 l and the top elevation is set to zero dirichlet boundaries with heads of 203 l and 197 l above datum are imposed on the left and right sides and the other four sides are prescribed as no flux boundaries a pumping well and an injection well are located at x 240 y 240 and x 1200 y 560 respectively with a same constant volumetric rate of 150 l 3 t initial heads are all equal to 197 l specific storage is assumed to be a constant equal to 0 0001 constant time step δ t 0 01 is used in both wog and modflow the lnk field is assumed to be a gaussian random field with zero mean and unit variance characterized by a separable exponential function having correlation lengths of 200 l and 100 l in x and y directions respectively the lnk sample field a fig 13 a is generated by karhunen loeve expansion zhang and lu 2004 in the sampled lnk field the maximum minimum and mean values are 3 711 2 487 and 0 429 respectively the standard deviation is equal to 0 853 k x y in the model is transformed from this lnk field which will be used for both wog solutions and modflow simulation in order to consider stronger heterogeneity one fault of high permeability k 100 l t lnk 4 6 and one fault of low permeability k 0 01 l t lnk 4 6 are implanted in the field in fig 13 a to form a new field field b in fig 13 b head contours for field a and b at t 10 simulated by modflow are shown in fig 13 c and d it seems that two additional faults in field b indeed influence the head distribution so that depression cone of the pumping well reaches the right boundary at t 10 with assistance of high conductivity fault heads at 68 positions and two moments t 1 and t 10 are solved via wog using n mc 10 4 10 5 10 6 realizations fig 14 shows the positions of wog solutions and compares head values calculated by modflow and wog at these positions for field a at t 1 for field a at t 10 and for field b at t 10 the corresponding rmse and mape are reported in table 1 s4 s5 and s6 it can be seen that 1 all head errors are very small 2 increases in n mc further reduce errors 3 errors are larger at t 10 than at t 1 when n mc 10 6 the largest absolute error is less than 0 2 not shown rmse 0 07 mape 0 027 for both fields a and b even mape 0 08 as n mc 10 5 is enough for many applications the terminal weight for h x 240 y 240 t 1 i e head at the pumping well with t 1 is shown in fig 15 when the number of realization increases from 104 to 105 the terminal weight distribution becomes remarkably finer further improvement is limited when the realization number further increases to 106 fig 16 presents the spatial distribution of source count in solutions located at two wells for field a at t 1 field a at t 10 and field b at t 10 note that all source counts shown in this figure are actually cumulated values of source count with respect to time from t 0 to specified time t m i e m 1 m f x i y j z k t m denoted by f s x i y j z k t m for example the value at x 240 y 240 in fig 16 a are the sum of source counts from t 0 to t 1 at that node i e m 1 m f 240 240 0 t m where m t m δ t 100 recall that f w in eq 13 represents the source impact to the solution in transient problems f w i 1 n x j 1 n y k 1 n z m 1 m f x i y j z k t m w x i y j z k t m if source terms w are time invariant and time step length is constant then w x i y j z k t m w x i y j z k and f w i 1 n x j 1 n y k 1 n z w x i y j z k m 1 m f x i y j z k t m i 1 n x j 1 n y k 1 n z w x i y j z k f s x i y j z k t m one can do the summation with respect to time step above because the sources are constant in time the differences between fig 16 a and c between b and d demonstrate time evolution of f s a x i y j z k t m the subscript a stands for field a the growth of f s a x i y j z k t m with time results from the gradual increase in numbers of random walk paths terminated at dirichlet boundaries that is the number of random walk paths killed at t 0 gradually decreases with time in fact the percentage of random walk paths ending at t 0 is negligible 0 1 after t m 100 not shown suggesting that f s x i y j z k t m tends to be steady after t m when t m 100 the model is under quasi independent of initial conditions and the model state can be approximated based on time series of boundary conditions and source terms during the latest period of 100 t it doesn t mean that the model reaches steady state since the boundaries or source terms may be time varying in that case f x i y j z k t m should not be summed up with respect to time furthermore heterogeneity can be identified in f s as well especially for the state of quasi independence ofinitial conditions if one compares fig 16 c with e he can easily identify the impact of high conductivity through abrupt areas of high or low source count similar observation can be found in fig 16 d and f fig 17 shows more clearly the impact of time and lnk fields 3 4 solution to a three dimensional flow experiment and application to a simple optimization example in this subsection the capability of wog is further explored in a three dimensional flow problem consider a confined system consisting of two aquifers and one aquitard fig 18 k x y for the top and bottom aquifers are generated using the same approach and statistics as in the previous subsection the middle aquitard is assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous with k 0 0005 l t the top elevation is set to zero each layer has the same size 1440 800 1 l 3 and is uniformly discretized into a grid of 72 40 1 with 20 l side length in x and y directions the dirichlet boundaries with heads equal to 100 above datum are imposed to two sides of x 0 and x 1440 other sides of the system are no flux boundaries two pumping wells are put in the bottom aquifer at point r1 x 240 y 240 z 2 5 and r4 x 1200 y 560 z 2 5 with a constant volumetric rate 100 l 3 t 3 4 1 validation of wog solution table 2 compares heads at seven nodes three within top layer two within middle layer and two within bottom layer evaluated by wog and modflow the resulting heads from two approaches are very close 3 4 2 application of wog solution to a simple optimization example assume that the head at r7 has to satisfy a constraint due to water management rule say h r 7 90 one wants to know the maximum total pumping rates of two wells traditional optimization methods are certainly able to solve this problem here wog solution provides a more straightforward alternative note that we have solved the source counts of two wells at r7 0 5327 for r1 and 0 3865 for r4 according to eq 10 h r 7 d r 7 h t f r 7 w 100 0 5327 c r 1 w r 1 0 3865 c r 2 w r 2 where c r 1 1 6 8854 c r 2 1 3 8267 hence the optimization problem transforms to min w r 1 w r 2 100 0 0774 w r 1 0 1010 w r 2 90 which can be solved by hand using linear programming the optimal solution is w r 1 129 1990 w r 2 0 it is validated by substituting the well pumping rates into modflow and calculating the head at r7 the resulting h r 7 90 0896 with the optimal pumping rates it suggests that optimal rates calculated by wog is reliable here the optimization problem is very simple which can definitely be solved by a number of approaches for instance response matrix method gorelick 1983 or influence coefficient method saffi and cheddadi 2007 and many optimization methods e g yeh 2015 etc a comprehensive comparison study of them may be of interest to groundwater community here the simple example is used to verify the accuracy of wog solutions 4 discussions 4 1 effectiveness of wog to high heterogeneity in all four experiments conducted in the previous section it is found that wog provides sufficiently accurate head solutions to one two three dimensional steady state transient flow problems in homogeneous or highly heterogeneous media in the one dimensional homogeneous experiment in section 3 1 the relative errors compared to the analytical solution are all less than 10 3 and mape is about 0 015 when n mc 10 6 in section 3 2 the heterogeneous case does not have an analytical solution hence wog solution is verified by comparison to modflow results in the present of an injection well absolute head errors are all less than 10 2 and mape 0 04 with n mc 10 6 in sections 3 3 and 3 4 for the 2d and 3d problems the largest absolute errors are 10 1 in spite of errors in modflow heads the reasons for larger errors may include two aspects first the walker walks in a space time grid of larger dimensions which may lead to larger sampling errors second according to eq 13 error in estimating f will be proportionally magnified by w in other words for a given wog solution larger pumping or injection rates result in larger head errors in the head results which also happens in fdm and other methods in sections 3 3 and 3 4 pumping injection rates 150 and 100 l 3 t are much higher than those in one dimensional experiments 0 and 0 2 l 3 t certainly the errors can be reduced by increasing numbers of realizations though the relation between errors and computational cost is not investigated in this study other studies on wos suggest that there exists a nearly linear relation between logarithmic of error and computational cost lejay and marie 2013 maire and nguyen 2016 it is highly probable that a similar relation may be valid in wog as well 4 2 terminal weights and source counts one strong point of wog or other rwp methods is that one is able to obtain the explicit information about contributions of each component in the system to the solution like initial condition dirichlet boundaries flux at neumann boundaries and all source terms the initial condition and dirichlet boundaries are contained in the terminal vector h t and the corresponding weights are in the terminal weight vector d fluxes at neumann boundaries and all source terms are collected in w and the source count vector f represents their contributions figs 7 8 11 and 15 demonstrate the spatial temporal distributions of terminal weights in three experiments figs 12 16 and 17 report the distribution of source count f in one or two dimensional spaces in those figures the hydraulic connections to the model components can be identified in a straightforward and quantitative manner such weight and source count results were seldom reported in literature of wos and wor probably because the media in which they are applied are more or less homogeneous thus weight results are less informative and helpful in fact terminal weight and source count contain information of medium heterogeneity figs 11 12 16 and 17 in fig 12 we have found that variations of f match variation of k x pretty well except near dirichlet boundaries where f tends to be zero besides f tends to have larger values near its corresponding starting point x 0 thus the distribution of f is the joint result of hydraulic conductivity dirichlet boundaries and location relative to starting position these points can also be verified in figs 16 and 17 one point which cannot be reflected in fig 12 is connectivity of f in 2d cases figs 16 17 it is found that the spatial pattern of k impacts f remarkably for instance inserting two faults leads to redistribution of f including decreases near low permeability fault decreases near the left part and increase near the right part of high permeability fault in fig 17 d and f in typical problems e g darcy s famous experiments constant heads will be applied on two opposite faces of the medium and no flux boundaries will be on the remaining faces such conditions are often used to measure the effective hydraulic conductivity in the domain when the same conditions are combined with wog method one can capture much information on medium heterogeneity in the perspective of hydrodynamics the underlying reason is that the pressure or energy diffusion controlled by heterogeneity can be mimicked by random walk probability terminal weight and source count are the final manifestation of sequential random walk probability it seems feasible to characterize medium heterogeneity predict effective hydraulic conductivity and measure connectivity based on terminal weight and source count in fact simonov and mascagni 2004 estimated effective permeability based on pore geometry which treated porous medium as absorbing boundaries and measured mean penetration depth of random walk into the medium to conjecture permeability systematic investigation is required to explore the link between heterogeneity pattern and distribution of source counts which will be studied in future 4 3 computational efficiency of wog computational efficiency is one of the most important aspects of an algorithm table 3 lists time costs in all experiments in this study as well as corresponding costs by modflow if applied it seems that wog using n mc 10 5 is less efficient than modflow which is based on fdm it is well known that fdm generally has the best efficiency compared to other common methods like fem fvm finite volume method or spectral methods there are still many reasons rather than efficiency to apply other methods higher cost of wog in table 3 doesn t mean that wog is necessarily less efficient than fdm or other methods unlike modflow which has been well developed for several decades and undergone professional code optimization wog code used in this study has potentials for speedup for example the mixing matlab fortran programming used in this study can be translated to pure fortran for higher efficiency and the property of monte carlo simulation is friendly to parallel computation feasible even in multi core personal computers which has not been equipped yet in this study furthermore the computational cost of wog is once and for all wog can be preferable for at least two foreseeable reasons first its terminal weights and source counts can be pre prepared then quickly and repetitively applied afterwards even for transient problems like the example in section 3 1 it can be very efficient to update the model state if used in such manners especially in engineering applications second its solutions as algebraic expression of terminal weights and source counts consider all possibilities of boundary values and temporal spatial distributions of sources sinks it allows the solution working as a highly simplified surrogate model when considering potential exploitation at known or unknown locations with known or unknown flow rates which may save a lot of computational cost in groundwater management simulation optimization or source identification problems these capabilities have not been explored in this single study but worthy of further investigation 4 4 strengths and limitations of wog one strength of wog is already discussed above i e the explicit contributions of each component in the system the second strength is the ability of wog solution to variations in terminal conditions and source terms again based on eq 13 h a d h t f w d and f will not change with specific values in h t and w it means when a new set of values in terminal conditions and source terms are given the new solution h a can be efficiently calculated it can be very useful in simulating different scenarios of groundwater exploitation as shown in section 3 4 2 expressing the solutions as a time series of time varying boundary conditions fast computation in groundwater warning system identifying unknown pumping or injection activities working as hydraulic surrogate models and so on the third strength is that all rwp methods including wog are computationally stable the last not least like other rwp methods wog does not solve any equation set and its solutions are pointwise solutions which allow one to obtain the solution to the pde without solving all other unknown variables simultaneously it could be helpful if one is only interested in variables at certain positions rather spatial distribution of variables in the entire domain nevertheless this point can be a limitation too if used in a situation where variables at a large number of points need to be solved since wog has to be run once for a point another significant limitation is that feynman kac formula seems valid for only linear pde and so does rwp methods wog included some theoretical attempts have been made in literature in order to extend the formula to nonlinear pdes peng 1991 bossy and talay 1995 fahim et al 2011 however more efforts are required before these extensions become applicable to high dimensional real problems an application of wog to a real steady state groundwater problem at ordos basin china was reported in nan et al 2018 in that study the water table was assumed to be nearly time invariant and known so that the water table can be treated as a neumann boundary more studies are required before wog can be applied to nonlinear groundwater problems 5 conclusions in this study two documented algorithms to implement random walk path methods wos and wor are summarized due to difficulty of applying wos or wor in highly heterogeneous media a novel algorithm called wog is proposed and verified in one two three dimensional steady state transient flow problems in homogeneous or highly heterogeneous media heads calculated by wog match well those evaluated by analytical solution or modflow code errors can be reduced by increasing the number of realizations used in monte carlo simulation it is demonstrated that wog is effective to obtain the pointwise solution to pdes of steady state or transient groundwater flow in heterogeneous media with or without source terms the byproduct of wog is the terminal weight and source counts which contain information of heterogeneity and may be useful in characterization of heterogeneity wog solutions do not rely on specific values in terminal conditions or source terms when a new set of values in terminal conditions and source terms are given the new solution can be quickly evaluated this property can be very useful in simulating different scenarios of groundwater exploitation exampled in section 3 4 2 expressing the solutions as a time series of time varying boundary conditions fast updating of model states in groundwater warning system and so on it seems that wog is able to deals with complex components in groundwater systems including high heterogeneity various boundary conditions sink source terms and transient behaviors wog method sheds a new light on solving the pdes of complicated groundwater problems in a changing environment in future the applicability of wog to unconfined aquifers and parabolic hyperbolic equations e g advection dispersion equations d x c x t v c r x t t c x t will be explored further investigation is required to fully recognize the applicability and capabilities of this method in many groundwater simulation problems acknowledgements this work is funded by the national natural science foundation of china grant

of three dimensional elliptic and parabolic pdes in a heterogeneous anisotropic aquifer in this appendix we explain in detail how to translate a general parabolic pde into a rule of random walk by

fig a1 k xx i 1 2 j k denotes the effective hydraulic conductivity between nodes i j k and i 1 j k in l t for brevity here we adopt the expression of hydraulic conductance used in modflow mcdonald and

the probabilities the walker moves from time step m to time step m 1 obviously all these probabilities are within 0 1 and their summation is equal to 1 if a neighboring node say i 1 j k is out of the domain cc i 1 2 j k automatically becomes zero and p x 0 ensuring that the walker won t go out of the domain if cc i 1 2 j k is much larger than other terms in it leads to a dominating move to i 1 j k if s s 0 eq a1 becomes an elliptic equation for steady state problems and eq a9 still applies with p t 0 implying no change in time step note that when time step length t m t m 1 varies with time step m c s and p x p t will vary with time as well appendix b constraint of probability non negativity on finite difference schemes in appendix a it is shown that backward time centered space scheme btcs satisfy the prerequisite of probability non negativity one may wonder if other fd schemes satisfy the condition for simplicity let us consider a weighted six point scheme wsp for one dimensional flow in eq b1 without loss of generality assume that the discretization grid is uniform with space interval dx and time interval dt b1 t 2 x 2 h x t w x t s t h x t using wsp one has b2 θ t δ x 2 h i 1 m h

2 t s h i 1 m 1 h i 1 m 1 1 2 1 θ δ t δ x 2 t s h i m 1 δ t s w i m probability non negativity requires 1 2 1 θ δ t δ x 2 t s 0 i e 1 θ δ t δ x 2 t s 1 2 when 0 θ 1 it imposes a constraint on discretization length in space and time i e δ t δ x 2 s 2 t 1 θ for three dimensional cases the constraint is 1 2 1 θ δ t 1 δ x 2 k xx s s 1 δ y 2 k yy s s 1 δ z 2 k zz s s 0 which is more demanding than one dimensional case in heterogeneous problems it is hard to ensure the condition satisfied everywhere due to local heterogeneity in hydraulic properties however when θ 1 equivalent to btcs the condition is always satisfied that is θ 1 guarantees the non negativity regardless of discretization grid thus btcs is used in this study and recommended though other schemes are also possible the prerequisite of probability non negativity should be verified first such attempts can be done in further studies it is easy to check probability non negativity after finding the expression of probabilities at this stage implicit scheme will be sufficient for many applications 
7157,the use of water temperature as a tracer has been widely utilized for characterizing the dynamics of water flow and heat transport in riparian zones by using experimental approaches we investigated the effects of water temperature hydraulic head and heat radiation on water flow and thermal dynamics in riparian zones through sand tank experiments which simulate the dynamics of water flow and heat transport in riparian zones water of low temperature was pumped into the sand tank and changes of temperature at different locations of the sand tank were measured temperature data was examined for three different water temperatures 4 0 c 6 0 c and 9 5 c two different hydraulic heads 25 cm and 45 cm and two different radiation temperatures no radiation and 22 c the thermal dynamic variation pattern in different types of water temperatures hydraulic heads and radiation combinations was also analyzed using a hydrus 2d model the temperature sensors located near the inlet infiltration boundary required a shorter time to reach the steady state because the temperature declined more rapidly near the inlet the effect of lateral inflow on the temperature gradient was obvious the temperature gradient in the horizontal direction gradually decreased and the vertical temperature gradient gradually increased in the initial stage of infiltration the temperature gradient in the horizontal direction was larger than the temperature gradient in the vertical direction however as time goes on the temperature gradient in the vertical direction was larger than the temperature gradient in the horizontal direction in addition the horizontal temperature gradient of the top sand layer was less affected by the water temperature the closer the temperature observation point of the same horizontal section was to the infiltration boundary the higher the rate of temperature difference changes comparison of the predicted and observed thermal dynamics variation of the 2 d sand tank shows good agreement indicating that the major mechanism for water flow and thermal dynamics variation was hydraulic head the sensitivity analysis results illustrate that the model was most sensitive to hydraulic head h followed by van genuchten parameter α permeability coefficient k s water temperature t van genuchten parameter n residual moisture content θ r and saturated moisture content θ s the variation of each parameter was linear with the change of temperature field parameters which were positively related to the temperature field were t α θ r and θ s which means the parameter value becomes larger as the temperature becomes larger and vice versa the parameters which were negatively related to the temperature field were h k s and n keywords water temperature laboratory experiment numerical simulation riparian zone 1 introduction water temperature is one of the important factors that influences hydrologic and aquatic ecological environments large reservoirs are stratified with depth due to their capacity and slow flow rate water temperatures decrease with depth in large reservoirs and temperatures at the deepest layer remain constant all year release of low temperature water from reservoirs can impact downstream aquatic environments for example the water temperature was low in discharges from reservoirs in spring and summer preece and jones 2002 prats et al 2010 and it was high in winter maheu et al 2016 the low temperature water from large reservoirs had an extremely important impact on aquatic organisms and even aquatic ecosystems downstream of the dam using groundwater temperature as a natural tracer as opposed to using a chemical tracer reduces negative impacts on the aquatic environment anderson 2005 constantz 2008 in recent studies water temperature as a natural tracer was used extensively to estimate heat exchange processes xie et al 2015 klepikova et al 2016 groundwater discharges to surface waters duque et al 2016 sw gw interactions hyun et al 2011 naranjo and turcotte 2015 munz et al 2016 schneidewind et al 2016 and aquifer characteristics wildemeersch et al 2014 doro et al 2015 sakata 2015 colombani et al 2015 klepikova et al 2016 duque et al 2010 studied the relations between rivers and the associated aquifers using groundwater temperature measurements and general data on river discharge and environmental and river temperatures sellwood et al 2015 used in well heat tracer tests to estimate borehole fluid flow rates and to evaluate the range of flow rates although the on site thermal tracing test has yielded positive results a more quantitative mechanism analysis is needed for the study of river ecology and solute exchange processes in recent years with the application of automated observation technology as well as the progress of data processing technology the effects of water temperature changes over time on the physical properties of river beds can be more accurately examined for example temperature time series methods were extensively used to calculate vertical water fluxes keery et al 2007 gordon et al 2012 darcy velocity mccallum et al 2012 and groundwater surface water exchange irvine et al 2015 tonina et al 2014 based on temperature time series of surface and streambed pore waters monitored local changes in streambed surface elevations at a daily time scale he found that time series analysis of paired in stream and pore water temperatures can predict variations in streambed surface elevations at the daily time scale with a 20 accuracy more recently wilson et al 2016 presented a method that inverts thermal time series data to estimate the timing and depth of transient hydrodynamic exchange they found that it was possible to identify the depth of flushing using shallow datasets in which flushing extended below the deepest sensor this finding was used to estimate the influence of streambed or riverbed sediments on groundwater surface water exchange fluxes irvine et al 2015 several research efforts were designed to characterize groundwater discharge to surface waters and ground velocities by performing distributed temperature sensing dts among them mamer and lowry 2013 represented the initial lab testing of a new combined method to assess the viability of using pairs of dts time series profiles to quantify and locate zones of discrete groundwater discharge throughout an entire stream reach bakker et al 2015 presented a new methodology for using a heat tracer test to determine groundwater velocities it inserts fiber optic cables vertically into unconsolidated sedimentary aquifers without the need for boreholes and to measure temperature along these cables using dts hare et al 2015 compared thermal infrared to fiber optic distributed temperature sensing for locating discrete groundwater discharges to surface water the above studies show that many scholars have used water temperature as a tracer to study the river related problems but the evaluation of water temperature as a tracer to study water flow and thermal variation mechanisms in riparian zones is rarely reported somewhat later sawyer et al 2009 monitored water table elevation temperature and specific conductivity along a transect perpendicular to the colorado river austin texas usa 15 km downstream of the longhorn dam to evaluate the penetration distance and rates of dam induced lateral hyporheic exchange paths they found that wooded riparian zones can reduce stream temperatures particularly in terms of maximum temperatures bowler et al 2012 conducted a systematic review of the available evidence for the effects of wooded riparian zones on stream temperature to assess the effectiveness of this intervention they used hydraulic and temperature data to calibrate the reliable conservative transport model as calibration constraints due to the interface between surface water and groundwater in riparian zones and the particularity of the hyporheic location and structure its difficult to measure water flow and heat transport in riverbed hyporheic exchange processes these exchange areas are an important manifestation of the complex edge effect of the riparian zone which have important protection functions for rivers and groundwater and it is becoming a hot topic for future research riparian zones played the key role in the function of aquatic ecosystems which could affect the chemical physical and biological processes when low temperature water from a reservoir is released it infiltrates into the riparian zones and mixes with natural groundwater allowing for heat exchange then the low temperature water released from the reservoir forms the soil non isothermal environment under the two way radiation conditions which consists of the low temperature water layer in lower part and the upper natural temperature surface and could cause the redistribution of temperature and moisture field inevitably there were significant changes on riverbed sediment and riparian saturation unsaturated zone heat state and these differences could be characterized by groundwater activities soil moisture and temperature were the most important influencing factors of geochemical and ecological processes in the unsaturated zone halloran et al 2016 the distribution and variation of soil temperature affects the physical and chemical properties of the soil and the biochemical cycle paul et al 2004 maurer and bowling 2014 studies have shown that soil temperature changes directly affected the soil respiration rate contosta et al 2016 wang et al 2016 soil respiration was one of the main fluxes of the global carbon cycle and was an important determinant of ecosystem carbon balance riveros iregui et al 2007 its strength was second only to primary productivity laganiere et al 2012 and it was mainly composed of microbial decomposition of soil organic matter and root respiration curtin et al 2012 low temperature water also had adverse effects on downstream cropland irrigation yang et al 2012 concluded that the maximum impact scope of low temperature water was 55 km and water temperature reached the minimum growth temperature of rice during april and june the use of engineering or non engineering measures to manage the reservoir discharge temperature regulation and to reduce the adverse effects of low temperature water on the environment and ecology has become a major problem in the field recent experimental studies have been concerned with the effect of hydraulic conductivity of silty clay under infiltration of low temperature water ren et al 2014 the purpose of this study was to develop a process using the 2 d riparian zone test and to use this new test to evaluate water flow and thermal dynamics in riparian zones using the injection of a heat tracer test in section 2 we present a methodology for of laboratory experiments and the numerical modeling utilized in this study in section 3 we describe laboratory experimental procedures used to evaluate water flow and thermal dynamics in a sand tank we also reconstructed a numerical model using three sets of experiments to calibrate and verify in addition we used the sensitivity analysis method to analyze the parameters of the model 2 methodology 2 1 laboratory experiments experiments were conducted in a sand tank with a precise heating cooling control system see fig 1 the total sand tank length is 80 cm the working sediment filled section is 60 cm in length 20 cm wide and 80 m in height water flow in the tank was horizontal fig 1b the inlet and outlet were furnished with perforated plates and gauze to ensure uniform flow across the entire cross section without losing any sediment the perforated plates device at the upstream end minimizes pulsing action and facilitates a smooth flow of water into the study section the upstream reservoir has two overflow holes 30 cm and 50 cm of the height respectively the downstream reservoir has one overflow hole 5 cm of the height prior to each infiltration test the hydraulic head was kept steady at an initial level of 30 cm or 50 cm from the upstream reservoir of sand tank the hydraulic head was controlled by the outlet the sand tank was equipped with a heating and cooling system and the walls and floor insulated to minimize temperature losses sand tank infiltration water temperature was controlled by a heating cooling control system for each test a constant infiltration water temperature was applied tests were run for three different water temperatures 4 0 c 6 0 c and 9 5 c two different hydraulic heads 25 cm and 45 cm and two different radiation temperatures no radiation and 22 c the summary of the experiment

tank had an average bulk density of 1 56 g cm3 and was contained in the high and low temperature alternation hydrothermal box see fig 1 the initial average water content measured on sand samples taken during packing was 0 02 cm3 cm3 the initial temperature of the sample was controlled at 20 c for over 24 h so that the sample had a uniform temperature during each infiltration test the data was collected every 1 min from the 30 temperature sensors throughout all three tests these sensors were connected to an automatic analog signals collector signals from temperature sensors were converted into digital signals through an a d converter the data were collected by computer continuously the position of the 30 temperature sensors is shown in table 2 the temperature data recorded at a frequency of 1 min show how temperature varied temporally and spatially at six locations along the surface at each location measurements were taken at six different heights as follows near the surface

boundary conditions the model domain represents a cross section of the 2 d sand tank fig 2 hydrus 2d uses the galerkin finite element method to solve the governing water flow equation and heat flow equation the numerical solution of the transport domain using hydrus 2d was obtained domain geometry was rectangular and measured 60 cm wide and 80 cm deep during the low temperature water application a constant head boundary condition was used at the location of the left infiltration boundary of 25 cm located at 55 cm below the soil surface the infiltration line was assumed to be a line source the remaining part of the left boundary was a zero flux boundary during the infiltration event a zero flux boundary condition was also used at the bottom boundary an atmospheric boundary was used at the soil surface and a free drainage boundary condition was used at the right boundary the soil heat regime was affected by water temperature then the constant water head boundary was used as the cauchy type boundary condition the dirichlet type boundary condition was used at the soil surface during water application the soil surface boundary had a constant radiation temperature of 22 c which was controlled by the solar radiation controller system the neuman type boundaries were used at the remaining part of the left and right boundaries the bottom boundary was also used the neuman type boundary condition 2 2 3 model calibration based on the indoor test results the numerical model was calibrated to determine the reasonable model parameter values experiment 1 was used as the observation data for the calibration the parameter optimization inverse module incorporated in hydrus 2d šimunek et al 2006 was employed to identify θ s θ r α and n and k s θ r 0 021 cm3 cm3 θ s 0 342 cm3 cm3 α 0 038 cm 1 n 5 275 and k s 0 49 cm min the final calibrated value of soil hydraulic parameters are shown in table 4 in this paper root mean square error rmse coefficient of determination r2 and relative error re were used to evaluate the simulation accuracy of the model the root mean square error rmse of the observed and simulated sand temperature were used to provide a quantitative comparison of the goodness of fit between observed and simulated data and assess the performance of the riparian zone r2 is the coefficient of determination between the simulated and observed values based on the y x linear regression equation re is the relative error between the simulated and observed values which are defined as 6 rmse i 1 n o i s i n 7 r 2 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 8 re i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i 2 where n number of observations s i and o i are the predicted and observed data respectively and o is the observed mean sand temperature 3 results and discussion 3 1 temperature fields fig 3 shows the heat plume movement in three different experiments of the sand tank at different times 30 60 180 270 and 500 min after the low temperature water injection considering the solar radiation impact of riparian zone experiment 1 and 3 increased the soil surface radiation temperature boundary conditions of 22 c and changed the infiltration hydraulic head conditions of 25 cm and 45 cm respectively laboratory experiments simulated the temperature distribution of the sand tank which were affected by water temperature hydraulic head and radiation fig 3 shows the patterns are obviously different for the three different heat infiltration tests the heat plume generally followed the direction of the groundwater flow which is consistent with the results obtained by klepikova et al 2016 contours shaped as a 7 were observed for temperature fields in the sand tank the phenomenon of low temperature water moving through the sand tank horizontally and vertically is evident the temperature gradient gradually decreases in the horizontal direction in the vertical direction the soil moisture was affected by the sand s matric suction so that the water flow moves upwards and drives the temperature to move upwards the temperature gradient gradually increases from lower to upper sections of the sand tank in the horizontal direction low temperatures are evident in the inlet infiltration area and high temperatures are evident in the outlet infiltration area at inlets the water temperature is dominated by its inlet conditions in the vertical direction the temperature of upper part is higher and the temperature of the lower part is low the area of the temperature zone changes with infiltration time the high temperature zone decreases and the low temperature zone increases gradually whether in the horizontal direction or in the vertical direction temperature fields of sand tank can be divided into low medium and high temperature zones this indicates that the sand tank temperature is significantly influenced by the low temperature water fig 4 shows the processed data for selected sensors after three experiments the low temperature water was injected at time t 0 min collecting 500 min of test data three color curves show the temperature recorded after injection of the low temperature water b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 and b6 represent different cross section making cross section comparisons the b1 section reached the steady state in less time than the other sections b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 and had faster descent speeds than other sections making vertical section comparison a1 t1 t11 and t16 and a2 t7 sections indicate that the nearer the temperature observation point was to the infiltration boundary the lower the temperature of the observation point and the time required to reach the steady state and the higher the rate of temperature reduction the influence of the upstream water temperature on the temperature field of the sand tank is mainly reflected in the a1 a2 and a3 sections changes in infiltration water temperature are only evident in temperature values taken in sections a1 a2 and a3 as can be seen from fig 4 the influence of the hydraulic head on the temperature field was mainly reflected in a3 a4 and a5 sections increasing hydraulic head increases the rate at which temperatures decrease and the total amount of temperature change data indicated that the higher the hydraulic head the shorter the time for the temperature drop and the greater the range of temperature decreases from the temperature monitoring data of the three sections b4 b5 and b6 it can be seen that the infiltration temperature value of experiment 3 6 0 c is between experiment 1 4 0 c and 2 9 5 c but the rate of temperature reduction and total time of experiment 3 was faster than those in experiments 1 and 2 clearly the influence of hydraulic head on the temperature field was greater than that of water temperature and radiation it can be seen from the b6 section that the radiation temperature has a certain effect on the surface temperature of the sand tank the higher the radiation temperature was the higher the surface temperature as can be seen from experiment 1 the surface temperature of the sand tank gradually increased with time and approaches the radiation temperature experiment 2 was not affected by the radiation temperature the surface temperature changed very little the surface temperature of experiment 3 increased before 100 min and then decreased gradually with the influence of low temperature water infiltration fig 5 shows that the time series record of temperature sensor in sand tank temperature time series measurements were taken at six horizontal locations b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 and b6 bottom to top rows with each location composed of five temperature sensors the effect of the water temperature on the sand tank temperature field was obvious with the passage of time the temperature values of different parts of the sand tank have changed through low temperature water and the variation is very similar in the b1 section the temperature reaches the steady state in less time than the other sections the rate of temperature reduction was faster than observed in the other sections sand tank temperatures measured in experiment 1 and experiment 3 were affected by the infiltration water temperature of upstream reservoir and soil surface radiation the temperature of every section from b1 to b5 is greatly influenced by low temperature water and the temperature at each observation point gradually decreases indicating that the infiltration water temperature had a significant impact on the time series temperatures measured in these five sections as time goes on the temperature of section b6 gradually increased approaching the radiation temperature of 22 c in experiment 1 in the first 100 min the temperature of section b6 gradually increased and the later decreased gradually in experiment 3 indicating that infiltration water temperature and surface radiation temperature were dominant factors concurrently and had the greater impact on the b6 section it can also be seen from fig 5 that under conditions of increasing hydraulic head upstream the more obvious the influence of the temperature field which was observed in the sand tank when the hydraulic head is 45 cm it can affect the temperature field of the entire sand tank but at hydraulic head of 25 cm the effects of temperature on the b5 and b6 sections were much less the sand water temperature gradient was the ratio of the difference in soil temperature to the distance in a certain direction between two points in the sand for example a4 t29 a3 t28 represented the ratio of temperature difference and horizontal straight line distance between t29 and t28 at a distance of 15 cm and depth of 5 cm the ratio of a3 t28 a3 t18 represented the temperature difference and vertical straight line distance between t28 and t18 at the distance of 25 cm and the depth of 5 cm and 30 cm fig 6 shows comparisons of sand water temperature gradients between two directions during experiment 3 one is the horizontal direction parallel to the sand surface e g a4 t29 a3 t28 and the other is the direction vertical to the sand surface e g a3 t28 a3 t18 fig 6 shows that sand water temperature gradients fluctuate greatly in the horizontal and vertical direction especially at deeper sand layers this is mainly due to the influence of water gravity and sand matrix suction first when the upstream flow infiltrates the sand tank the bottom sand layer is more easily saturated it can be seen from fig 6 that the influence of the lateral water flow on the temperature gradient changes in both the horizontal and vertical directions the horizontal temperature gradient gradually decreases and the vertical temperature gradient gradually increases during the initial stage of infiltration the temperature gradient in the horizontal direction is larger than the temperature gradient in the vertical direction over time the temperature gradient in the vertical direction exceeds the temperature gradient in the horizontal direction the horizontal temperature gradient of the top sand layer is less affected by the water temperature fig 6 shows that at the depth of 60 cm a4 t9 a3 t8 the maximum temperature gradient value in the horizontal direction is 0 59 c cm and the maximum time is 30 min which is larger and faster than that at the depth of 45 cm 30 cm and 5 cm respectively the temperature gradient of 45 cm 30 cm and 5 cm in the horizontal direction is 0 48 c cm 0 38 c cm and less than 0 20 c cm and the maximum time is 67 min 85 min and more than 300 min respectively in contrast the maximum temperature gradient value in the vertical direction a3 t8 a3 t3 is 0 20 c cm and the maximum time is 14 min which is shorter and faster than other vertical direction a3 t13 a3 t8 a3 t18 a3 t13 and a3 t28 a3 t18 respectively the temperature gradient in the vertical direction a3 t13 a3 t8 a3 t18 a3 t13 and a3 t28 a3 t18 is 0 32 c cm 0 38 c cm and 0 45 c cm and the maximum time is 20 min 33 min and 122 min respectively as can also be seen from fig 6 the horizontal temperature gradient is more affected than the vertical direction by lateral water flow the vertical direction temperature gradient is affected by both water flow and the sand substrate suction and the temperature gradient gradually increases 3 2 analysis of the temperature difference curves the evolution of the temperature measured in these selected observation points t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t18 t19 and t20 is presented in fig 7 the comparison between temperature difference curves in the experiment 1 experiment 2 and experiment 3 clearly shows that heat pulse travels fastest in the high hydraulic head experiment 3 the temperature difference curves are also characterized by longer tailings the shape is consistent with the results obtained by wildemeersch et al 2014 maximum temperature changes were observed at these temperature sensors t1 t6 t11 and t16 after the beginning of the infiltration of low temperature water the four temperature observations are closest to the infiltration boundary which are 5 cm from the infiltration boundary fig 7 shows that the temperature difference values of the same horizontal section gradually decreases from left to right sharper decrease is observed where the location is closer to the infiltration boundary the maximum temperature variation value of high hydraulic head experiment 3 is 9 6 c this observation point was t6 which was measured 3 min after the beginning of the infiltration of low temperature water the observation point is 5 cm from the infiltration boundary and 20 cm from the bottom boundary when the hydraulic head is low the maximum temperature variation value is 11 44 c experiment 1 this observation point was made 2 min after the beginning of the infiltration of low temperature water and in the temperature sensor t1 the observation point is 5 cm from the infiltration boundary and 5 cm from the bottom boundary it can be seen from the observation point t1 that although infiltration hydraulic head in experiment 1 and 2 is the same but 4 c of the infiltration water temperature of experiment 1 is lower than 9 5 c of experiment 2 in order to reduce 20 c of the initial temperature the temperature drop is faster and the temperature difference value is bigger from the observation point t11 it can be seen that the higher the infiltration water head faster temperature drops and greater temperature differences were observed 3 3 model validation fig 8 shows the temporal variation of measured and simulated temperatures for selected sensors during three different experiments root mean square error rmse coefficient of determination r2 and relative error re were used to evaluate the simulation accuracy of the model the results are shown in table 5 it can be seen from table 5 that the rmse of experiment 1 except t10 ranges from 0 29 c to 2 53 c the average is 1 12 c the fitting effect is good the rmse of t10 observation point is 4 73 c and the error is large relevance can be expressed by a coefficient of determination r2 correlated observation points accounted for 81 8 r2 0 6 among them the highly relevant observation points accounted for 63 6 r2 0 8 relative error re mostly is less than 10 the re value of observation point t2 t3 t11 t12 is large the fitting is not accurate the previous calibrated model was further validated by using experiment 2 and 3 the results are shown in figs 9 and 10 the agreement of the results is also indicated by the low values of rmse r2 and re as those listed in table 5 the rmse of experiment 2 ranges from 0 27 c to 2 24 c with an average value of 0 77 c which shows good agreement the correlation coefficient r2 of the temperature observation points t20 t21 t23 t24 t27 and t28 are less than 0 it shows that there is a great deviation between the simulated values and the experimental values the r2 of other observation points are within a reasonable range the relative error re are less than 10 except observation point t10 in experiment 2 rmse of experiment 3 ranges from 0 36 c to 2 83 c the average is 1 1 c and the fitting effect is good r2 is the range of 0 12 to 0 98 where r2 0 6 accounts for 85 7 the experimental value agrees well with the simulated value the re value of t10 t11 t12 t15 and t16 is large and other temperature observation point value within a reasonable range fig 11 shows the temporal variation at different deeps in vertical direction length 30 cm of three experiments the soil temperature profile shows two stages of the infiltration which can clearly reveal the temperature variation as infiltration proceeds the low temperature forward movement process was the first stage 0 180 min in the first 30 min soil temperature did not change with time below the surface of 35 cm soil temperature gradually decreased with the infiltration time in the depth range of 35 80 cm the temperature of the soil below hydraulic head was close to the infiltration water temperature when the infiltration time reached 180 min fig 11a b with increases in the hydraulic head fig 11c in the first 30 min the temperature of surface soil also changed with the infiltration time the temperature of the soil below the infiltration hydraulic head is close to the infiltration water temperature during the 60 min and 180 min time period fig 11c at the second stage 180 500 min the temperature profile gradually migrated to the left the temperature of the soil above the infiltration hydraulic head decreased gradually to close to the infiltration water temperature and the low temperature region increased gradually because of the influence of the high hydraulic head the low temperature area is larger than the low head it can be seen from fig 11c 0 60 min that there was a clear trend in temperature fluctuation observed in which temperature increases first and then decreases and subsequently decreased gradually this is the reason that the temperature of the soil surface 0 10 cm is affected by the surface radiation for the different depth profiles on the fitting consistency it was evaluated through rmse r2 and re and the results are shown in table 6 for rmse the variation range of experiment 1 is between 1 1 and 1 82 c and the average is 1 49 c the variation range of experiment 2 is 0 31 0 89 c and the average is 0 59 c the variation range of experiment 3 is 0 68 1 34 c the average is 1 01 c for r2 the r2 of three conditions is greater than 0 87 and therefore reflects a very strong correlation for re the value of experiment 1 and experiment 3 is large which is about 10 the re of experiment 2 is very small which has very high fitting consistency 3 4 sensitivity analysis 3 4 1 local sensitivity analysis method the local sensitivity analysis fluctuates slightly near the best estimate of a parameter the rate of change of the model result is calculated by changing the parameter in the very small range under the condition that the other parameters are kept constant the sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the main influencing factors that affect the output of the model thus contributing to better prediction of the model in the paper the experiment 1 as the analysis object was selected the sensitivity was analyzed based on the seven parameters hydraulic head h infiltration water temperature t the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s van genuchten parameters n and α residual moisture content θ r and saturated moisture content θ s the input parameters were varied 10 15 and 20 of their baseline values in each running model each step changed only one input parameter and the remaining parameters stayed unchanged as the physical units are not the same so the evaluation of indicators should be reunified in this paper the ratio between the difference of initial and changed values and initial value expressed in percentage is calculated to check the local sensitivity analyses due to the spatial nature of the numerical model the vertical section of x 30 cm was selected as the research object the varying temperature field distribution of each parameter was obtained by numerical simulations and then subtractions were made at each observation point between the varying temperature field and the rated temperature field and the difference of each observation point was averaged to describe temperature changes the time period was selected as 0 500 min the results of main input parameters are shown in fig 12 if the parameter change has little effect on the model it indicates the model is not sensitive to the factor and on the contrary it is sensitive fig 12 shows that when the hydraulic head h fluctuates 20 and 20 the temperature field fluctuates by about 11 87 and 10 08 respectively when the infiltration water temperature t fluctuates 20 and 20 the temperature field fluctuates about both 3 17 when the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks fluctuates 20 and 20 the temperature field fluctuates about 5 63 and 4 5 respectively when the α fluctuates by 20 and 20 the temperature field fluctuates by about 5 96 and 7 94 respectively temperature fluctuations caused by other parameters averaged about 1 though the variation degree varied it is apparent that the model is most sensitive to hydraulic head h followed by van genuchten parameter α permeability coefficient k s water temperature t van genuchten parameter n residual moisture content θ r saturated moisture content θ s the variation of each parameter is linear with the change of temperature field the parameters positively which are related to the temperature field are t α θ r and θ s which means the parameter value becomes larger the temperature becomes larger and vice versa the parameters which are negatively related to the temperature field are h k s and n and the results are consistent with the qualitative analysis 3 4 2 global sensitivity analysis method the local sensitivity analysis can only analyze one parameter at a time the interaction influence could not be considered between the parameters on the model therefore the global sensitivity analysis was made the morris method assumes that k parameters are included in the numerical model the number of sampling points for each parameter is p the m parameters take values at p sampling points respectively the vector x x1 x2 xk was gotten then m k m k 1 order matrix b is morris 1991 9 b 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 the value 1 and 0 indicate whether the parameter is changed or not according to the parameter arrangement the results of global sensitivity of 28 combinations of parameters were obtained and presented in table 7 a bar chart was used to reflect ranges of measured temperature fields for various combinations fig 13 the temperature of the groups of 8 14 19 23 26 and 29 decreases significantly they all contain the h parameter the hydraulic head h is an important factor affecting the temperature field two parameters h and k s are negatively correlated with the temperature field they have obvious effect on the temperature field two parameters t and α are positively correlated with the temperature field which suggest the temperature field variation can also be significant other three parameters θ s θ r and n have little effect on the temperature field 4 conclusions in our previous study ren et al 2014 the relationship between the water temperature and bulk density and hydraulic conductivity was evaluated by low temperature water infiltration tests on three kinds of sand column samples a detailed temperature measurement and analysis of the two dimensional sand tank were made the two dimensional sand tank was divided into six cross sections and five longitudinal sections thirty temperature sensors were evenly spaced and used to monitor real time changes in the temperature field of the sand tank under the influence of water temperature water level and radiation through the temperature field cloud diagram of the test low temperature water performs the phenomenon of distant diffusion on vertical upward and horizontal to the right direction the temperature gradient gradually decreases in the horizontal direction and gradually increases from lower to upper in the vertical direction there is low temperature zone at inlet infiltration area and high temperature zone at outlet infiltration area in the horizontal direction from left to right the zone was divided into low temperature medium temperature and high temperature zones from the vertical direction of the diagram the temperature ranges from high to low in the upper portion and lower portion respectively the area of the temperature zone changed with infiltration time through the study of temperature gradient of 2 d sand tank temperature fluctuations increase with the depth of the sand layer this is mainly due to the influence of water gravity and sand matrix suction when the upstream water flow infiltrates the sand tank the bottom of the sand layer is more likely to reach saturation in both the horizontal and vertical directions the temperature gradient clearly affects lateral flow the temperature gradient in the horizontal direction gradually decreases and the vertical temperature gradient gradually increases at the initial stage of infiltration the temperature gradient in the horizontal direction is larger than the vertical direction at later stages of infiltration the temperature gradient in the vertical direction is larger than in the horizontal direction the horizontal temperature gradient of the top sand layer is less affected by the water temperature through the thermal trace test the variation of the temperature difference of the three tests is obtained the temperature difference decreases gradually from left to right in the same horizontal section the closer to the infiltration boundary temperature section the greater the temperature difference changes the faster the decline as the infiltration hydraulic head increases the temperature drops more rapidly and temperature differences are greater in addition the numerical model is evaluated by root mean square error rmse coefficient of determination r2 and relative error re and its results are good the calibrated numerical model can better reflect the dynamic variation of temperature in riparian zone under low temperature water infiltration finally this study considers both local and global sensitivity analysis methods to analyze the effect of each parameter on the model the results by local sensitivity analysis method show that the model is most sensitive to hydraulic head h followed by van genuchten parameter α permeability coefficient k s water temperature t van genuchten parameter n residual moisture content θ r saturated moisture content θ s the variation of each parameter is linear with the change of temperature field the parameters which are positively related to the temperature field are t α θ r and θ s which means the parameter value becomes larger the temperature becomes larger and vice versa the parameters which are negatively related to the temperature field are h k s and n and the results are consistent with the qualitative analysis and through the global sensitivity analysis method it can be seen that the impact of hydraulic head h water temperature t permeability coefficient k s and van genuchten parameter α to the system is obvious and the model is not sensitive to van genuchten parameter n residual moisture content θ r

7157,the use of water temperature as a tracer has been widely utilized for characterizing the dynamics of water flow and heat transport in riparian zones by using experimental approaches we investigated the effects of water temperature hydraulic head and heat radiation on water flow and thermal dynamics in riparian zones through sand tank experiments which simulate the dynamics of water flow and heat transport in riparian zones water of low temperature was pumped into the sand tank and changes of temperature at different locations of the sand tank were measured temperature data was examined for three different water temperatures 4 0 c 6 0 c and 9 5 c two different hydraulic heads 25 cm and 45 cm and two different radiation temperatures no radiation and 22 c the thermal dynamic variation pattern in different types of water temperatures hydraulic heads and radiation combinations was also analyzed using a hydrus 2d model the temperature sensors located near the inlet infiltration boundary required a shorter time to reach the steady state because the temperature declined more rapidly near the inlet the effect of lateral inflow on the temperature gradient was obvious the temperature gradient in the horizontal direction gradually decreased and the vertical temperature gradient gradually increased in the initial stage of infiltration the temperature gradient in the horizontal direction was larger than the temperature gradient in the vertical direction however as time goes on the temperature gradient in the vertical direction was larger than the temperature gradient in the horizontal direction in addition the horizontal temperature gradient of the top sand layer was less affected by the water temperature the closer the temperature observation point of the same horizontal section was to the infiltration boundary the higher the rate of temperature difference changes comparison of the predicted and observed thermal dynamics variation of the 2 d sand tank shows good agreement indicating that the major mechanism for water flow and thermal dynamics variation was hydraulic head the sensitivity analysis results illustrate that the model was most sensitive to hydraulic head h followed by van genuchten parameter α permeability coefficient k s water temperature t van genuchten parameter n residual moisture content θ r and saturated moisture content θ s the variation of each parameter was linear with the change of temperature field parameters which were positively related to the temperature field were t α θ r and θ s which means the parameter value becomes larger as the temperature becomes larger and vice versa the parameters which were negatively related to the temperature field were h k s and n keywords water temperature laboratory experiment numerical simulation riparian zone 1 introduction water temperature is one of the important factors that influences hydrologic and aquatic ecological environments large reservoirs are stratified with depth due to their capacity and slow flow rate water temperatures decrease with depth in large reservoirs and temperatures at the deepest layer remain constant all year release of low temperature water from reservoirs can impact downstream aquatic environments for example the water temperature was low in discharges from reservoirs in spring and summer preece and jones 2002 prats et al 2010 and it was high in winter maheu et al 2016 the low temperature water from large reservoirs had an extremely important impact on aquatic organisms and even aquatic ecosystems downstream of the dam using groundwater temperature as a natural tracer as opposed to using a chemical tracer reduces negative impacts on the aquatic environment anderson 2005 constantz 2008 in recent studies water temperature as a natural tracer was used extensively to estimate heat exchange processes xie et al 2015 klepikova et al 2016 groundwater discharges to surface waters duque et al 2016 sw gw interactions hyun et al 2011 naranjo and turcotte 2015 munz et al 2016 schneidewind et al 2016 and aquifer characteristics wildemeersch et al 2014 doro et al 2015 sakata 2015 colombani et al 2015 klepikova et al 2016 duque et al 2010 studied the relations between rivers and the associated aquifers using groundwater temperature measurements and general data on river discharge and environmental and river temperatures sellwood et al 2015 used in well heat tracer tests to estimate borehole fluid flow rates and to evaluate the range of flow rates although the on site thermal tracing test has yielded positive results a more quantitative mechanism analysis is needed for the study of river ecology and solute exchange processes in recent years with the application of automated observation technology as well as the progress of data processing technology the effects of water temperature changes over time on the physical properties of river beds can be more accurately examined for example temperature time series methods were extensively used to calculate vertical water fluxes keery et al 2007 gordon et al 2012 darcy velocity mccallum et al 2012 and groundwater surface water exchange irvine et al 2015 tonina et al 2014 based on temperature time series of surface and streambed pore waters monitored local changes in streambed surface elevations at a daily time scale he found that time series analysis of paired in stream and pore water temperatures can predict variations in streambed surface elevations at the daily time scale with a 20 accuracy more recently wilson et al 2016 presented a method that inverts thermal time series data to estimate the timing and depth of transient hydrodynamic exchange they found that it was possible to identify the depth of flushing using shallow datasets in which flushing extended below the deepest sensor this finding was used to estimate the influence of streambed or riverbed sediments on groundwater surface water exchange fluxes irvine et al 2015 several research efforts were designed to characterize groundwater discharge to surface waters and ground velocities by performing distributed temperature sensing dts among them mamer and lowry 2013 represented the initial lab testing of a new combined method to assess the viability of using pairs of dts time series profiles to quantify and locate zones of discrete groundwater discharge throughout an entire stream reach bakker et al 2015 presented a new methodology for using a heat tracer test to determine groundwater velocities it inserts fiber optic cables vertically into unconsolidated sedimentary aquifers without the need for boreholes and to measure temperature along these cables using dts hare et al 2015 compared thermal infrared to fiber optic distributed temperature sensing for locating discrete groundwater discharges to surface water the above studies show that many scholars have used water temperature as a tracer to study the river related problems but the evaluation of water temperature as a tracer to study water flow and thermal variation mechanisms in riparian zones is rarely reported somewhat later sawyer et al 2009 monitored water table elevation temperature and specific conductivity along a transect perpendicular to the colorado river austin texas usa 15 km downstream of the longhorn dam to evaluate the penetration distance and rates of dam induced lateral hyporheic exchange paths they found that wooded riparian zones can reduce stream temperatures particularly in terms of maximum temperatures bowler et al 2012 conducted a systematic review of the available evidence for the effects of wooded riparian zones on stream temperature to assess the effectiveness of this intervention they used hydraulic and temperature data to calibrate the reliable conservative transport model as calibration constraints due to the interface between surface water and groundwater in riparian zones and the particularity of the hyporheic location and structure its difficult to measure water flow and heat transport in riverbed hyporheic exchange processes these exchange areas are an important manifestation of the complex edge effect of the riparian zone which have important protection functions for rivers and groundwater and it is becoming a hot topic for future research riparian zones played the key role in the function of aquatic ecosystems which could affect the chemical physical and biological processes when low temperature water from a reservoir is released it infiltrates into the riparian zones and mixes with natural groundwater allowing for heat exchange then the low temperature water released from the reservoir forms the soil non isothermal environment under the two way radiation conditions which consists of the low temperature water layer in lower part and the upper natural temperature surface and could cause the redistribution of temperature and moisture field inevitably there were significant changes on riverbed sediment and riparian saturation unsaturated zone heat state and these differences could be characterized by groundwater activities soil moisture and temperature were the most important influencing factors of geochemical and ecological processes in the unsaturated zone halloran et al 2016 the distribution and variation of soil temperature affects the physical and chemical properties of the soil and the biochemical cycle paul et al 2004 maurer and bowling 2014 studies have shown that soil temperature changes directly affected the soil respiration rate contosta et al 2016 wang et al 2016 soil respiration was one of the main fluxes of the global carbon cycle and was an important determinant of ecosystem carbon balance riveros iregui et al 2007 its strength was second only to primary productivity laganiere et al 2012 and it was mainly composed of microbial decomposition of soil organic matter and root respiration curtin et al 2012 low temperature water also had adverse effects on downstream cropland irrigation yang et al 2012 concluded that the maximum impact scope of low temperature water was 55 km and water temperature reached the minimum growth temperature of rice during april and june the use of engineering or non engineering measures to manage the reservoir discharge temperature regulation and to reduce the adverse effects of low temperature water on the environment and ecology has become a major problem in the field recent experimental studies have been concerned with the effect of hydraulic conductivity of silty clay under infiltration of low temperature water ren et al 2014 the purpose of this study was to develop a process using the 2 d riparian zone test and to use this new test to evaluate water flow and thermal dynamics in riparian zones using the injection of a heat tracer test in section 2 we present a methodology for of laboratory experiments and the numerical modeling utilized in this study in section 3 we describe laboratory experimental procedures used to evaluate water flow and thermal dynamics in a sand tank we also reconstructed a numerical model using three sets of experiments to calibrate and verify in addition we used the sensitivity analysis method to analyze the parameters of the model 2 methodology 2 1 laboratory experiments experiments were conducted in a sand tank with a precise heating cooling control system see fig 1 the total sand tank length is 80 cm the working sediment filled section is 60 cm in length 20 cm wide and 80 m in height water flow in the tank was horizontal fig 1b the inlet and outlet were furnished with perforated plates and gauze to ensure uniform flow across the entire cross section without losing any sediment the perforated plates device at the upstream end minimizes pulsing action and facilitates a smooth flow of water into the study section the upstream reservoir has two overflow holes 30 cm and 50 cm of the height respectively the downstream reservoir has one overflow hole 5 cm of the height prior to each infiltration test the hydraulic head was kept steady at an initial level of 30 cm or 50 cm from the upstream reservoir of sand tank the hydraulic head was controlled by the outlet the sand tank was equipped with a heating and cooling system and the walls and floor insulated to minimize temperature losses sand tank infiltration water temperature was controlled by a heating cooling control system for each test a constant infiltration water temperature was applied tests were run for three different water temperatures 4 0 c 6 0 c and 9 5 c two different hydraulic heads 25 cm and 45 cm and two different radiation temperatures no radiation and 22 c the summary of the experiment conditions is given in table 1 in all experiments the sample used was sand with the 50th percentile grain diameter d50 0 68 mm and the uniformity coefficient cu 0 5 air dried sand used in the sand tank had an average bulk density of 1 56 g cm3 and was contained in the high and low temperature alternation hydrothermal box see fig 1 the initial average water content measured on sand samples taken during packing was 0 02 cm3 cm3 the initial temperature of the sample was controlled at 20 c for over 24 h so that the sample had a uniform temperature during each infiltration test the data was collected every 1 min from the 30 temperature sensors throughout all three tests these sensors were connected to an automatic analog signals collector signals from temperature sensors were converted into digital signals through an a d converter the data were collected by computer continuously the position of the 30 temperature sensors is shown in table 2 the temperature data recorded at a frequency of 1 min show how temperature varied temporally and spatially at six locations along the surface at each location measurements were taken at six different heights as follows near the surface

the soil thermal regime was modeled with the conduction convection heat flow equation sophocleous 1979 3 c θ t t x λ xz θ t z c w q x t x where c θ and c w are the volumetric heat capacity of the bulk soil and the liquid phase respectively λ xz is the soil thermal conductivity and q x for the water flux density while t is soil temperature the effects of water vapor diffusion is ignored the volumetric heat capacity c θ was determined according to de vries 1963 4 c θ 1 92 θ n 2 51 θ 0 4 18 θ 10 6 where θ n and θ 0 represent the volume fractions of solid phase and organic matter in soil

boundary conditions the model domain represents a cross section of the 2 d sand tank fig 2 hydrus 2d uses the galerkin finite element method to solve the governing water flow equation and heat flow equation the numerical solution of the transport domain using hydrus 2d was obtained domain geometry was rectangular and measured 60 cm wide and 80 cm deep during the low temperature water application a constant head boundary condition was used at the location of the left infiltration boundary of 25 cm located at 55 cm below the soil surface the infiltration line was assumed to be a line source the remaining part of the left boundary was a zero flux boundary during the infiltration event a zero flux boundary condition was also used at the bottom boundary an atmospheric boundary was used at the soil surface and a free drainage boundary condition was used at the right boundary the soil heat regime was affected by water temperature then the constant water head boundary was used as the cauchy type boundary condition the dirichlet type boundary condition was used at the soil surface during water application the soil surface boundary had a constant radiation temperature of 22 c which was controlled by the solar radiation controller system the neuman type boundaries were used at the remaining part of the left and right boundaries the bottom boundary was also used the neuman type boundary condition 2 2 3 model calibration based on the indoor test results the numerical model was calibrated to determine the reasonable model parameter values experiment 1 was used as the

and relative error re were used to evaluate the simulation accuracy of the model the root mean square error rmse of the observed and simulated sand temperature were used to provide a quantitative comparison of the goodness of fit between observed and simulated data and assess the performance of the riparian zone r2 is the coefficient of determination between the simulated and observed values based on the y x linear regression equation re is the relative error between the simulated and observed values which are defined as 6 rmse i 1 n o i s i n 7 r 2 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 8 re i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i 2 where n number of observations s i and o i are the predicted and observed data respectively and o is the observed mean sand temperature 3 results and discussion 3 1 temperature fields fig 3 shows the heat plume movement in three different experiments of the sand tank at different times 30 60 180 270 and 500 min after the low temperature water injection considering the solar radiation impact of riparian zone experiment 1 and 3 increased the soil surface radiation temperature boundary conditions of 22 c and changed the infiltration hydraulic head conditions of 25 cm and 45 cm respectively laboratory experiments simulated the temperature distribution of the sand tank which were affected by water temperature hydraulic head and radiation fig 3 shows the patterns are obviously different for the three different heat infiltration tests the heat plume generally followed the direction of the groundwater flow which is consistent with the results obtained by klepikova et al 2016 contours shaped as a 7 were observed for temperature fields in the sand tank the phenomenon of low temperature water moving through the sand tank horizontally and vertically is evident the temperature gradient gradually decreases in the horizontal direction in the vertical direction the soil moisture was affected by the sand s matric suction so that the water flow moves upwards and drives the temperature to move upwards the temperature gradient gradually increases from lower to upper sections of the sand tank in the horizontal direction low temperatures are evident in the inlet infiltration area and high temperatures are evident in the outlet infiltration area at inlets the water temperature is dominated by its inlet conditions in the vertical direction the temperature of upper part is higher and the temperature of the lower part is low the area of the temperature zone changes with infiltration time the high temperature zone decreases and the low temperature zone increases gradually whether in the horizontal direction or in the vertical direction temperature fields of sand tank can be divided into low medium and high temperature zones this indicates that the sand tank temperature is significantly influenced by the low temperature water fig 4 shows the processed data for selected sensors after three experiments the low temperature water was injected at time t 0 min collecting 500 min of test data three color curves show the temperature recorded after injection of the low temperature water b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 and b6 represent different cross section making cross section comparisons the b1 section reached the steady state in less time than the other sections b2 b3 b4 b5 b6 and had faster descent speeds than other sections making vertical section comparison a1 t1 t11 and t16 and a2 t7 sections indicate that the nearer the temperature observation point was to the infiltration boundary the lower the temperature of the observation point and the time required to reach the steady state and the higher the rate of temperature reduction the influence of the upstream water temperature on the temperature field of the sand tank is mainly reflected in the a1 a2 and a3 sections changes in infiltration water temperature are only evident in temperature values taken in sections a1 a2 and a3 as can be seen from fig 4 the influence of the hydraulic head on the temperature field was mainly reflected in a3 a4 and a5 sections increasing hydraulic head increases the rate at which temperatures decrease and the total amount of temperature change data indicated that the higher the hydraulic head the shorter the time for the temperature drop and the greater the range of temperature decreases from the temperature monitoring data of the three sections b4 b5 and b6 it can be seen that the infiltration temperature value of experiment 3 6 0 c is between experiment 1 4 0 c and 2 9 5 c but the rate of temperature reduction and total time of experiment 3 was faster than those in experiments 1 and 2 clearly the influence of hydraulic head on the temperature field was greater than that of water temperature and radiation it can be seen from the b6 section that the radiation temperature has a certain effect on the surface temperature of the sand tank the higher the radiation temperature was the higher the surface temperature as can be seen from experiment 1 the surface temperature of the sand tank gradually increased with time and approaches the radiation temperature experiment 2 was not affected by the radiation temperature the surface temperature changed very little the surface temperature of experiment 3 increased before 100 min and then decreased gradually with the influence of low temperature water infiltration fig 5 shows that the time series record of temperature sensor in sand tank temperature time series measurements were taken at six horizontal locations b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 and b6 bottom to top rows with each location composed of five temperature sensors the effect of the water temperature on the sand tank temperature field was obvious with the passage of time the temperature values of different parts of the sand tank have changed through low temperature water and the variation is very similar in the b1 section the temperature reaches the steady state in less time than the other sections the rate of temperature reduction was faster than observed in the other sections sand tank temperatures measured in experiment 1 and experiment 3 were affected by the infiltration water temperature of upstream reservoir and soil surface radiation the temperature of every section from b1 to b5 is greatly influenced by low temperature water and the temperature at each observation point gradually decreases indicating that the infiltration water temperature had a significant impact on the time series temperatures measured in these five sections as time goes on the temperature of section b6 gradually increased approaching the radiation temperature of 22 c in experiment 1 in the first 100 min the temperature of section b6 gradually increased and the later decreased gradually in experiment 3 indicating that infiltration water temperature and surface radiation temperature were dominant factors concurrently and had the greater impact on the b6 section it can also be seen from fig 5 that under conditions of increasing hydraulic head upstream the more obvious the influence of the temperature field which was observed in the sand tank when the hydraulic head is 45 cm it can affect the temperature field of the entire sand tank but at hydraulic head of 25 cm the effects of temperature on the b5 and b6 sections were much less the sand water temperature gradient was the ratio of the difference in soil temperature to the distance in a certain direction between two points in the sand for example a4 t29 a3 t28 represented the ratio of temperature difference and horizontal straight line distance between t29 and t28 at a distance of 15 cm and depth of 5 cm the ratio of a3 t28 a3 t18 represented the temperature difference and vertical straight line distance between t28 and t18 at the distance of 25 cm and the depth of 5 cm and 30 cm fig 6 shows comparisons of sand water temperature gradients between two directions during experiment 3 one is the horizontal direction parallel to the sand surface e g a4 t29 a3 t28 and the other is the direction vertical to the sand surface e g a3 t28 a3 t18 fig 6 shows that sand water temperature gradients fluctuate greatly in the horizontal and vertical direction especially at deeper sand layers this is mainly due to the influence of water gravity and sand matrix suction first when the upstream flow infiltrates the sand tank the bottom sand layer is more easily saturated it can be seen from fig 6 that the influence of the lateral water flow on the temperature gradient changes in both the horizontal and vertical directions the horizontal temperature gradient gradually decreases and the vertical temperature gradient gradually increases during the initial stage of infiltration the temperature gradient in the horizontal direction is larger than the temperature gradient in the vertical direction over time the temperature gradient in the vertical direction exceeds the temperature gradient in the horizontal direction the horizontal temperature gradient of the top sand layer is less affected by the water temperature fig 6 shows that at the depth of 60 cm a4 t9 a3 t8 the maximum temperature gradient value in the horizontal direction is 0 59 c cm and the maximum time is 30 min which is larger and faster than that at the depth of 45 cm 30 cm and 5 cm respectively the temperature gradient of 45 cm 30 cm and 5 cm in the horizontal direction is 0 48 c cm 0 38 c cm and less than 0 20 c cm and the maximum time is 67 min 85 min and more than 300 min respectively in contrast the maximum temperature gradient value in the vertical direction a3 t8 a3 t3 is 0 20 c cm and the maximum time is 14 min which is shorter and faster than other vertical direction a3 t13 a3 t8 a3 t18 a3 t13 and a3 t28 a3 t18 respectively the temperature gradient in the vertical direction a3 t13 a3 t8 a3 t18 a3 t13 and a3 t28 a3 t18 is 0 32 c cm 0 38 c cm and 0 45 c cm and the maximum time is 20 min 33 min and 122 min respectively as can also be seen from fig 6 the horizontal temperature gradient is more affected than the vertical direction by lateral water flow the vertical direction temperature gradient is affected by both water flow and the sand substrate suction and the temperature gradient gradually increases 3 2 analysis of the temperature difference curves the evolution of the temperature measured in these selected observation points t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t9 t11 t12 t13 t15 t16 t18 t19 and t20 is presented in fig 7 the comparison between temperature difference curves in the experiment 1 experiment 2 and experiment 3 clearly shows that heat pulse travels fastest in the high hydraulic head experiment 3 the temperature difference curves are also characterized by longer tailings the shape is consistent with the results obtained by wildemeersch et al 2014 maximum temperature changes were observed at these temperature sensors t1 t6 t11 and t16 after the beginning of the infiltration of low temperature water the four temperature observations are closest to the infiltration boundary which are 5 cm from the infiltration boundary fig 7 shows that the temperature difference values of the same horizontal section gradually decreases from left to right sharper decrease is observed where the location is closer to the infiltration boundary the maximum temperature variation value of high hydraulic head experiment 3 is 9 6 c this observation point was t6 which was measured 3 min after the beginning of the infiltration of low temperature water the observation point is 5 cm from the infiltration boundary and 20 cm from the bottom boundary when the hydraulic head is low the maximum temperature variation value is 11 44 c experiment 1 this observation point was made 2 min after the beginning of the infiltration of low temperature water and in the temperature sensor t1 the observation point is 5 cm from the infiltration boundary and 5 cm from the bottom boundary it can be seen from the observation point t1 that although infiltration hydraulic head in experiment 1 and 2 is the same but 4 c of the infiltration water temperature of experiment 1 is lower than 9 5 c of experiment 2 in order to reduce 20 c of the initial temperature the temperature drop is faster and the temperature difference value is bigger from the observation point t11 it can be seen that the higher the infiltration water head faster temperature drops and greater temperature differences were observed 3 3 model validation fig 8 shows the temporal variation of measured and simulated temperatures for selected sensors during three different experiments root mean square error rmse coefficient of determination r2 and relative error re were used to evaluate the simulation accuracy of the model the results are shown in table 5 it can be seen from table 5 that the rmse of experiment 1 except t10 ranges from 0 29 c to 2 53 c the average is 1 12 c the fitting effect is good the rmse of t10 observation point is 4 73 c and the error is large relevance can be expressed by a coefficient of determination r2 correlated observation points accounted for 81 8 r2 0 6 among them the highly relevant observation points accounted for 63 6 r2 0 8 relative error re mostly is less than 10 the re value of observation point t2 t3 t11 t12 is large the fitting is not accurate the previous calibrated model was further validated by using experiment 2 and 3 the results are shown in figs 9 and 10 the agreement of the results is also indicated by the low values of rmse r2 and re as those listed in table 5 the rmse of experiment 2 ranges from 0 27 c to 2 24 c with an average value of 0 77 c which shows good agreement the correlation coefficient r2 of the temperature observation points t20 t21 t23 t24 t27 and t28 are less than 0 it shows that there is a great deviation between the simulated values and the experimental values the r2 of other observation points are within a reasonable range the relative error re are less than 10 except observation point t10 in experiment 2 rmse of experiment 3 ranges from 0 36 c to 2 83 c the average is 1 1 c and the fitting effect is good r2 is the range of 0 12 to 0 98 where r2 0 6 accounts for 85 7 the experimental value agrees well with the simulated value the re value of t10 t11 t12 t15 and t16 is large and other temperature observation point value within a reasonable range fig 11 shows the temporal variation at different deeps in vertical direction length 30 cm of three experiments the soil temperature profile shows two stages of the infiltration which can clearly reveal the temperature variation as infiltration proceeds the low temperature forward movement process was the first stage 0 180 min in the first 30 min soil temperature did not change with time below the surface of 35 cm soil temperature gradually decreased with the infiltration time in the depth range of 35 80 cm the temperature of the soil below hydraulic head was close to the infiltration water temperature when the infiltration time reached 180 min fig 11a b with increases in the hydraulic head fig 11c in the first 30 min the temperature of surface soil also changed with the infiltration time the temperature of the soil below the infiltration hydraulic head is close to the infiltration water temperature during the 60 min and 180 min time period fig 11c at the second stage 180 500 min the temperature profile gradually migrated to the left the temperature of the soil above the infiltration hydraulic head decreased gradually to close to the infiltration water temperature and the low temperature region increased gradually because of the influence of the high hydraulic head the low temperature area is larger than the low head it can be seen from fig 11c 0 60 min that there was a clear trend in temperature fluctuation observed in which temperature increases first and then decreases and subsequently decreased gradually this is the reason that the temperature of the soil surface 0 10 cm is affected by the surface radiation for the different depth profiles on the fitting consistency it was evaluated through rmse r2 and re and the results are shown in table 6 for rmse the variation range of experiment 1 is between 1 1 and 1 82 c and the average is 1 49 c the variation range of experiment 2 is 0 31 0 89 c and the average is 0 59 c the variation range of experiment 3 is 0 68 1 34 c the average is 1 01 c for r2 the r2 of three conditions is greater than 0 87 and therefore reflects a very strong correlation for re the value of experiment 1 and experiment 3 is large which is about 10 the re of experiment 2 is very small which has very high fitting consistency 3 4 sensitivity analysis 3 4 1 local sensitivity analysis method the local sensitivity analysis fluctuates slightly near the best estimate of a parameter the rate of change of the model result is calculated by changing the parameter in the very small range under the condition that the other parameters are kept constant the sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the main influencing factors that affect the output of the model thus contributing to better prediction of the model in the paper the experiment 1 as the analysis object was selected the sensitivity was analyzed based on the seven parameters hydraulic head h infiltration water temperature t the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s van genuchten parameters n and α residual moisture content θ r and saturated moisture content θ s the input parameters were varied 10 15 and 20 of their baseline values in each running model each step changed only one input parameter and the remaining parameters stayed unchanged as the physical units are not the same so the evaluation of indicators should be reunified in this paper the ratio between the difference of initial and changed values and initial value expressed in percentage is calculated to check the local sensitivity analyses due to the spatial nature of the numerical model the vertical section of x 30 cm was selected as the research object the varying temperature field distribution of each parameter was obtained by numerical simulations and then subtractions were made at each observation point between the varying temperature field and the rated temperature field and the difference of each observation point was averaged to describe temperature changes the time period was selected as 0 500 min the results of main input parameters are shown in fig 12 if the parameter change has little effect on the model it indicates the model is not sensitive to the factor and on the contrary it is sensitive fig 12 shows that when the hydraulic head h fluctuates 20 and 20 the temperature field fluctuates by about 11 87 and 10 08 respectively when the infiltration water temperature t fluctuates 20 and 20 the temperature field fluctuates about both 3 17 when the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks fluctuates 20 and 20 the temperature field fluctuates about 5 63 and 4 5 respectively when the α fluctuates by 20 and 20 the temperature field fluctuates by about 5 96 and 7 94 respectively temperature fluctuations caused by other parameters averaged about 1 though the variation degree varied it is apparent that the model is most sensitive to hydraulic head h followed by van genuchten parameter α permeability coefficient k s water temperature t van genuchten parameter n residual moisture content θ r saturated moisture content θ s the variation of each parameter is linear with the change of temperature field the parameters positively which are related to the temperature field are t α θ r and θ s which means the parameter value becomes larger the temperature becomes larger and vice versa the parameters which are negatively related to the temperature field are h k s and n and the results are consistent with the qualitative analysis 3 4 2 global sensitivity analysis method the local sensitivity analysis can only analyze one parameter at a time the interaction influence could not be considered between the parameters on the model therefore the global sensitivity analysis was made the morris method assumes that k parameters are included in the numerical model the number of sampling points for each parameter is p the m parameters take values at p sampling points respectively the vector x x1 x2 xk was gotten then m k m k 1 order matrix b is morris 1991 9 b 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 the value 1 and 0 indicate whether the parameter is changed or not according to the parameter arrangement the results of global sensitivity of 28 combinations of parameters were obtained and presented in table 7 a bar chart was used to reflect ranges of measured temperature fields for various combinations fig 13 the temperature of the groups of 8 14 19 23 26 and 29 decreases significantly they all contain the h parameter the hydraulic head h is an important factor affecting the temperature field two parameters h and k s are negatively correlated with the temperature field they have obvious effect on the temperature field two parameters t and α are positively correlated with the temperature field which suggest the temperature field variation can also be significant other three parameters θ s θ r and n have little effect on the temperature field 4 conclusions in our previous study ren et al 2014 the relationship between the water temperature and bulk density and hydraulic conductivity was evaluated by low temperature water infiltration tests on three kinds of sand column samples a detailed temperature measurement and analysis of the two dimensional sand tank were made the two dimensional sand tank was divided into six cross sections and five longitudinal sections thirty temperature sensors were evenly spaced and used to monitor real time changes in the temperature field of the sand tank under the influence of water temperature water level and radiation through the temperature field cloud diagram of the test low temperature water performs the phenomenon of distant diffusion on vertical upward and horizontal to the right direction the temperature gradient gradually decreases in the horizontal direction and gradually increases from lower to upper in the vertical direction there is low temperature zone at inlet infiltration area and high temperature zone at outlet infiltration area in the horizontal direction from left to right the zone was divided into low temperature medium temperature and high temperature zones from the vertical direction of the diagram the temperature ranges from high to low in the upper portion and lower portion respectively the area of the temperature zone changed with infiltration time through the study of temperature gradient of 2 d sand tank temperature fluctuations increase with the depth of the sand layer this is mainly due to the influence of water gravity and sand matrix suction when the upstream water flow infiltrates the sand tank the bottom of the sand layer is more likely to reach saturation in both the horizontal and vertical directions the temperature gradient clearly affects lateral flow the temperature gradient in the horizontal direction gradually decreases and the vertical temperature gradient gradually increases at the initial stage of infiltration the temperature gradient in the horizontal direction is larger than the vertical direction at later stages of infiltration the temperature gradient in the vertical direction is larger than in the horizontal direction the horizontal temperature gradient of the top sand layer is less affected by the water temperature through the thermal trace test the variation of the temperature difference of the three tests is obtained the temperature difference decreases gradually from left to right in the same horizontal section the closer to the infiltration boundary temperature section the greater the temperature difference changes the faster the decline as the infiltration hydraulic head increases the temperature drops more rapidly and temperature differences are greater in addition the numerical model is evaluated by root mean square error rmse coefficient of determination r2 and relative error re and its results are good the calibrated numerical model can better reflect the dynamic variation of temperature in riparian zone under low temperature water infiltration finally this study considers both local and global sensitivity analysis methods to analyze the effect of each parameter on the model the results by local sensitivity analysis method show that the model is most sensitive to hydraulic head h followed by van genuchten parameter α permeability coefficient k s water temperature t van genuchten parameter n residual moisture content θ r saturated moisture content θ s the variation of each parameter is linear with the change of temperature field the parameters which are positively related to the temperature field are t α θ r and θ s which means the parameter value becomes larger the temperature becomes larger and vice versa the parameters which are negatively related to the temperature field are h k s and n and the results are consistent with the qualitative analysis and through the global sensitivity analysis method it can be seen that the impact of hydraulic head h water temperature t permeability coefficient k s and van genuchten parameter α to the system is obvious and the model is not sensitive to van genuchten parameter n residual moisture content θ r saturated moisture content θ s acknowledgements the authors thank kenneth a kuhl and a literacy volunteer of leon county tallahassee fl united states for his insightful comment that has helped to

7158,accurate evaluation of the relative contribution of climatic and vegetative drivers on land evapotranspiration et is critical for interpreting the et controlling mechanism modeling and predicting however how to accurately separate and estimate the contribution of climatic and vegetative changes on et variation remains uncertain our study attempted to interpret the interannual variation in et during 2007 2013 over a maize field in northwest china using four methods simultaneously such as the penman monteith pm model the modified crop coefficient method the priestly taylor pt model and the regression linear model results indicate that compared to the et in 2007 the et decreased averagely by 12 30 29 and 73 w m 2 in 2008 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively all models yielded similar results and showed that the vegetative controls played a more important role in regulating et relative to climatic drives and that more than half of decrease in et was caused by vegetative factors while the differences in net radiation water vapor pressure deficit and air temperature among years were lesser source of variation in et furthermore the advantage and disadvantage of the four methods were discussed our study confirmed the great effect of vegetative drivers in regulating crop et highlighted the importance of estimating canopy conductance accurately in et modeling and prediction and provided new approaches for separating the climatic and vegetative contribution on et changes keywords climatic change evapotranspiration maize penman monteith model vegetative control 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is controlled by climactic and vegetative drivers both of which are projected to change on multiple spatial and temporal scales due to the coupled effects of climate change and anthropogenic ecosystem management pielke et al 1998 houghton et al 2001 wear and greis 2002 foley et al 2003 stoy et al 2006 thus studying the relative roles of vegetation vs climate on et is critical for predicting how water cycling will respond to future climatic and biological changes such as radiation air temperature and humidity and crop variety changes stoy et al 2006 roderick et al 2007 zheng et al 2009 meng and mo 2012 li et al 2013a until recently many methods have been developed to isolate the relative contribution of physical and biological drivers on et wilson and baldocchi 2000 used the linear perturbation analysis approach to estimate the percentage in et due to changes in surface conductance humidity deficit net radiation and energy balance closure errors stoy et al 2006 combined the eddy covariance measurements with a linear perturbation analysis method to separate the contribution of physical and biological factors on et in three ecosystems in the southeast us they also compared the linear perturbation analysis with the penman monteith model and found the good agreement between the two approaches roderick et al 2007 used a generic physical model based on mass and energy balances to attribute pan evaporation changes to changes in radiation temperature humidity and wind speed yang and yang 2011 separated the contribution to annual runoff by combining budyko equation and penman equation in 2012 they quantified the contributions of climatic factors to epan using partial derivatives and found that the decrease in epan was mainly determined by changes in radiation and wind speed the study provided a new insight for understanding the effect of climatic change on evaporation yang and yang 2012 meng and mo 2012 applied an approach based on budyko type equation to separate the contributions of climatic factors to changes in annual runoff from 1960 to 2008 through multiplying their partial derivatives by the slopes of trends in climate factors li et al 2013a evaluated the relative role of climatic and biological control on energy partition based on solving the partial derivation of the penman monteith model in a latest paper of gong et al 2014 they used a model similar to the crop coefficient method of fao56 to evaluate the effects of vegetation change on et in a semiarid shrubland of the loess plateau china yang et al 2014 estimated the error of mezentsev choudhury yang equation for assessing the contribution of climate change to runoff based on the budyko hypothesis the previous studies generally used one method to separate the climatic and vegetative control the results lacked of comparison and whether the result was accurate is uncertain for example the penman monteith model and the partial derivative method are widely used to quantify the relative contribution of climatic and vegetative changes on et however whether the approach is reliable and accurate remains uncertain other et models such as the priestly taylor pt method the crop coefficient method and the empiric linear models can be used to estimate et but whether they can quantify and interpret et changes still requires further study thus we attempted to separate the contribution of climatic and vegetative changes on et using four approaches simultaneously namely pm pt the modified crop coefficient methods and the empirical linear et model and examine the reliability of different methods in evaluating contributions of all drives the long term et data for maize measured by the eddy covariance method during 2007 2013 were adopted to analyze the interannual variation in crop et and interpret the mechanism of interannual variation from different perspectives 2 models for quantifying the variability in evapotranspiration 2 1 quantifying the climatic and vegetative controls on et variability using the penman monteith model the penman monteith pm model can be written as monteith 1965 1 λ e t δ r n g c p ρ a v p d r a δ γ γ r c r a where λet is the crop evapotranspiration w m 2 λ is the latent heat of vaporization j kg 1 is is the slope of the saturation water vapor pressure versus temperature curve kpa k 1 rn is the net radiation w m

resistance s m 1 γ is the psychrometric constant pa k 1 rc is the canopy resistance s m 1 the aerodynamic resistance ra can be expressed as paulson 1970 businger et al 1971 2 r a in z z 0 ψ h in z z 0 ψ m k 2 u where z is the reference height m z 0 the roughness length of the crop relative to momentum transfer m k is the von karman constant 0 41 ψh is the stability correction function for heat and water transfer ψm is the stability correction function for momentum transfers these stability correction functions are taken from the models of paulson 1970 u is the wind speed at the reference height m s 1 according to monteith 1965 z 0 can be estimated as 0 13 hc where hc is the mean crop height m thus et can be expressed as a continuous function of four climatic and one vegetative variables stoy et al 2006 3 et f r n g v p d t a r a r c our study adopted the partial derivative method to calculate the variation in et the method also has been used to examine the changes in pan and potential evaporation by previous studies roderick et al 2007 meng and mo 2012 li et al 2013a according to the method et variation can be estimated as 4 δ e t e t r n g δ r n g e t v p d δ v p d e t t a δ t a e

measured p c p b in our study δet between the five years was measured by the eddy covariance system the partial derivations of et to the variables were calculated with the measured meteorological data we chose the meteorological data which made the least error of eq 12 the actual value of canopy resistance was obtained by the re ranged penman monteith model li et al 2013a 2 2 quantifying the climatic and vegetative controls on et variability using the modified crop coefficient method the crop coefficient method can be expressed as follows allen et al 1998 13 e t c k c e t 0 where etc represents the crop water requirement mm d 1 kc the crop coefficient et0 the reference crop water requirement mm d 1 when the soil water is adequately supplied the measured crop evapotranspiration can be nearly considered as the water requirement of maize thus we can estimate kc as the ratio of etc to et0 et0 was calculated by the standard method recommended by fao 56 manual allen et al 1998 in our study we normalized etc and et0 by dividing rn simultaneously 14 er λ e t c r n k c λ e t 0 r n where λetc rn represents the ratio of energy partition into evapotranspiration the variability in etc rn can be calculated as 15 δ λ e t c r n δ k c λ e t 0 r n k c δ λ e t 0 r n e r r o r k c λ e t 0 r n thus the changes due to climatic controls can be expressed as 16 δ c k c δ e t 0 r n while the

taylor 1972 allen et al 1998 19 λ e t α c δ δ γ r n g where αc represents the characteristics of vegetation values of αc during different years were obtained by dividing etc to the equilibrium evapotranspiration in the study the alpha of pt equation was obtained by the et measured by eddy covariance and the re arranged pt equation according to eq 18 it can be inferred that 20 ef λ e t r n g

while the changes due to vegetative controls can be expressed as 23 δ v δ α c δ δ γ the errors can be estimated by taylor expansion method 24 error α c δ δ γ 1 2 2 e f α c 2 δ α c 2 1 2 2 e f δ δ γ 2

stoy et al 2006 we constructed an empirical model to quantify the relationship between et and rn g and the canopy conductance gc using the daily data during the five years as follows 25 et 0 0432 r n

soil is desert soil siltigic orthic anthrosols and soil texture is sandy loam with a mean dry bulk density of 1 43 g cm 3 and volumetric soil water content at a field capacity of 0 29 cm3 cm 3 li et al 2013a b li et al 2015 li et al 2016 3 2 measurements in the maize field during 2017 2013 spring maize was planted with row spacing of 40 cm and plant spacing of 30 cm the plant density was about 66 000 plants per hectare and the total area was about 39 ha crops were also extensively cultivated in the surrounding fields in 2007 and 2008 the common spring corn was cultivated while in 2011 2012 and 2013 the seeding maize was planted thus the crop height and lai varied significantly across the different years the experimental field was irrigated with a total amount of 320 mm 420 mm 320 mm 350 mm and 350 mm in 2007 2008 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively border irrigation was adopted to deliver water in the field the precipitation was 153 71 220 130 and 80 mm during the whole growing stage in the five years the main root was located at depth of 0 60 cm an open path eddy covariance ec system was installed in the northwest of the maize field the sensors were 1 0 m above the maize canopy maize is the principal crop cultivated in the surrounding region and its planting area is large enough to provide adequate fetch length for ec measurement the ec system consisted of a 3 d sonic anemometer thermometer model csat3 a krypton hygrometer model kh20 and a temperature and humidity sensor model hmp45c model csat3 and kh20 measured vertical fluctuations of wind temperature and water vapor density at 0 1 s intervals and temperature and humidity at 10 min intervals net radiation rn was measured by a net radiometer model nr lite kipp zonen delft netherlands at a height of 1 5 m above the canopy two soil heat flux plates model hfp01 hukseflux netherlands were used to measure soil heat flux all the sensors were connected to a data logger model cr5000 campbell scientific inc usa and the

the normalized soil water content is calculated by the equation of f θ θ θw θf θw where θ is the measured soil water content θf is the field capacity θw is the wilting coefficient the leaf area index of maize was calculated by summing lamina length maximum width of each leaf and multiplied by a factor of 0 74 the detailed measurements for these parameters have been depicted in li et al 2016 4 results 4 1 interannual variability of climatic and vegetative factors over the maize field in order to reveal the relationship between crop evapotranspiration et and environmental factors study should be carried out on the seasonal and interannual variation of climatic and vegetative factors such as net radiation rn water vapor pressure deficit vpd air temperature ta wind speed at height of 2 m u2 the normalized soil moisture f θ leaf area index lai canopy height hc and canopy conductance gc on the maize field during 2007 2013 in order to control the data quality we only used the daytime data from 8 00 to 17 00 during 15th june to 15th september in every year when the underlying surface can be treated as a whole fig 1 shows the seasonal and interannual variation of daytime rn vpd ta and u2 during 15th june to 15th september in 2007 2008 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively daytime rn varied from 0 to 500 w m 2 with an average of 373 384 343 347 and 304 w m 2 in 2007 2008 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively rn in 2008 was the highest while the value in 2013 was the lowest among the five years table 1 compared with rn vpd showed a similar interannual trend it had a peak value of 1 73 kpa in 2011 a minimum value of 1 59 kpa in 2013 and an average of 1 66 kpa among the five years table 1 as for the air temperature daytime ta changed from 10 to 35 c with a mean of 23 5 c during the five years while the ta of 2011 was the highest with a value of 23 77 c and that of 2013 was the lowest with a value of 23 16 c table 1 the daytime wind speed at height of 2 m u2 varied from 0 to 4 m s 1 with the highest mean value of 1 39 m s 1 in 2008 and the lowest of 1 07 m s 1 in 2012 table 1 fig 2 shows the seasonal variation of daytime f θ lai hc and gc during 15th june to 15th september in the five years the normalized soil water content f θ for most of the time was higher than 0 6 indicating that soil water could meet crop need adequately and non water stress occurred thus the crop evapotranspiration measured by eddy covariance could be nearly considered as crop requirement amount and was only controlled by climatic and vegetative factors in the latter analysis we only analyzed the effect of meteorological and crop factors on et and neglected the soil water control the maize lai during june to september varied from 2 0 to 5 6 over the five years the maximum lai laimax was 5 7 4 48 4 88 4 43 and 3 65 m2 m 2 in 2007 2008 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively table 1 accordingly the maximum crop height hc was 2 69 2 01 1 18 1 72 and 1 19 m over the five years the canopy conductance gc varied from 0 to 25 mm s 1 with an average of 10 42 9 3 8 6 8 68 and 7 28 mm s 1 over the five years thus the year of 2007 had the maximum lai hc and gc table 1 the sharp decrease in maize lai and height over 2011 2013 relative to 2017 2018 was mainly caused by the crop variety changes in 2007 and 2008 the grain maize was planted while in 2011 2012 and 2013 the seeding maize was cultivated 4 2 seasonal and interannual variability of maize evapotranspiration and its components during 2007 2013 fig 3 shows the seasonal and interannual variation of the equilibrium evapotranspiration λeteq the imposed evapotranspiration λetimp and the decoupling factor ω during 15th june to 15th september in the five years λeteq ranged from 0 to 400 w m 2 during 2007 2013 while λetimp from 0 to 600 w m 2 during the five years as for the decoupling factor ω the mean ω was 0 23 0 40 0 37 0 24 and 0 31 for 2007 2008 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively these indicated that the coupling degree between canopy and atmosphere was high and maize evapotranspiration was more sensitive to atmosphere environmental changes than radiation changes according to the jarvis coupling theory fig 4 depicts the seasonal variation of the radiation evapotranspiration λetrad and the aerodynamic evapotranspiration λetaero during the five years mean λetrad was 62 21 105 86 97 06 64 67 and 74 90 w m 2 for the five years respectively compared to λetrad λetaero was significantly higher than λetrad in every year which was 221 23 184 92 159 17 193 02 and 138 45 w m 2 for the five years these implicate a larger aerodynamic influence on et relative to radiation influence 4 3 seasonal and interannual variability of energy partition over the maize field during 2007 2013 fig 5 indicates the seasonal variation of the λet ec rn hs rn and g rn between 15th june to 15th september over the five years most of λet ec rn ranged from 0 5 to 1 0 during 2007 2013 which reveals that more than half of the energy was consumed by maize evapotranspiration the average value of λet ec rn was 0 64 0 78 0 71 0 81 and 0 77 over the five years respectively on the contrary most of hs rn varied from 0 to 0 5 during the five years suggesting that less than half of the energy was partitioned to sensible heat flux mean value of hs rn was 0 32 0 14 0 23 0 16 and 0 24 over the five years respectively the low value of hs rn was mainly due to the adequate irrigation under the full irrigation the land surface evapotranspiration was close to the potential evapotranspiration thus only a small amount of the energy was used to heat surface air compared to hs rn g rn was lower and most values were less than 0 1 results indicate that the average value of g rn during the five years was 0 04 0 09 0 05 0 03 and 0 01 thus the ground heat flux of the maize field was close to zero on the seasonal or interannual time scales and the radiation energy was mainly partitioned to crop evapotranspiration 4 4 interpreting the interannual variability in evapotranspiration due to climatic and vegetative changes in 2008 2011 2012 and 2013 using four methods table 2 shows the changes in et caused by available energy p rn g water vapor pressure deficit p vpd air temperature p ta aerodynamic resistance p ra and canopy resistance p rc variation in et due to climatic changes p c was defined as the sum of p rn g p vpd p ta and p ra while the variation in et caused by vegetative changes p b was defined as p rc which included the combined effect of crop variety leaf area and so on results indicate that vegetative changes made more contribution to et changes than climatic changes and the et changes due to vegetative regulation accounted for 84 64 51 and 62 of the total et changes while the changes due to climatic regulation accounted for 16 36 49 and 38 for 2008 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively table 3 shows that the difference in et rn between 2008 and 2007 δ et rn was 0 0535 while the difference in et0 rn between the two years was 0 0177 and the partial derivative det et0 rn was 0 9978 thus the difference in evapotranspiration between the two years due to changes in et0 rn was 0 0176 which accounted for 33 of the total difference in et as for the kc the difference in kc between the two years was 0 0483 and the partial derivative det kc was 0 7423 thus the difference in evapotranspiration due to changes in kc was 0 0359 which accounted for 67 of the total difference in et these indicate that reduction in et during 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to the reduced crop coefficient approximately a 67 decrease in et in 2008 to vegetative control the same as the year of 2008 we could also approximate a 76 46 and 100 decrease in et in 2011 2012 and 2013 to crop control and a 24 54 and 0 reduction in et in the three years to climatic control thus the vegetative control played a more important role in regulating et relative to climatic effect table 4 shows the result yielded by the priestly taylor method similar to the result produced by the crop coefficient method table 3 we also could infer a 66 67 73 and 94 decrease in et in 2008 2011 2012 and 2013 caused by vegetative effect and a 34 33 27 and 6 reduction in et in the four years to climatic effect as same as table 3 the table also implicated a greater effect of vegetative control against climatic control table 5 presents the results determined by the linear perturbation analysis since the radiation and canopy conductance were the predominant factors for determining et we constructed a linear model to quantify the relationship between et with rn and gc the perturbation analysis was conducted based on the linear model similar to tables 3 and 4 the 67 60 62 and 59 decrease in et in 2008 2011 2012 and 2013 were due to the reduction in canopy conductance while 33 40 38 and 41 of et decrease to net radiation fall respectively these analyses also indicate the more weight of vegetative factors in determining et process than climatic variables 5 discussion 5 1 why the vegetative control played a more important role in regulating et against climatic effect all results yielded by the four approaches show that vegetative control made more contribution in changing et against climatic effects on the annual time scale tables 2 5 relative to et in 2007 et decreased by 12 30 29 and 73 w m 2 in 2008 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively all methods show that more than half of the decrease in et was caused by the vegetative factors whether the climatic and vegetative controls played a more important role in affecting et has been investigated by many scientists wilson and baldocchi 2000 indicated that the reduction in evapotranspiration of a broadleaved temperate deciduous forest during 1995 compared to 1997 was primarily due to a reduced surface conductance especially during middle and late summer however in another literature gholz and clark 2002 found that et was mainly controlled by climate rather than ecosystem type along a chronosequence of slash pine p elliottii englm net radiation rn explained more than 80 of the variation in et stoy et al 2006 indicated that decreased leaf area index under mild and severe drought conditions reduced growing season et etgs by 80 mm compared with a year with normal precipitation in an old field site under wet conditions higher intrinsic stomatal conductance gs increased etgs by 50 mm et at a pine forest site was generally larger than the other ecosystems and highly sensitive to climate a 50 mm decrease in etgs due to the loss of lai from an ice storm equaled the increase in et from high precipitation during a wet year in contrast et at a hardwood forest was relatively insensitive to climatic variation stoy et al 2006 in a paper of li et al 2013a the authors found that the canopy conductance dominated the energy partition process relative to other factors in our research we found that the interannual variability in et was mainly attributed to canopy conductance changes rather than climatic factors changes these were mainly due to 1 stomatal conductance is the key factor for regulating canopy transpiration and land et is sensitive to surface conductance changes these opinions have been proved by physiological and ecological scientists and not needed to repeat wilson and baldocchi 2000 2 relative to 2007 the canopy conductance gc in 2008 2011 2012 and 2013 decreased significantly gc reduced by 11 17 17 and 30 in the four years respectively the reduction in lai predominated the gc decrease these results highlight the critical importance of canopy conductance in global evapotranspiration modeling estimation and prediction under the future climate condition 5 2 evaluation of four methods in interpreting the interannual variability in crop et the pm method indicates that the biological drives made more contribution in the interannual variability of et against climatic drives table 2 the method is widely used in isolating and evaluating the relative roles of climate and vegetation on et wilson and baldocchi 2000 stoy et al 2006 meng and mo 2012 li et al 2013a the approach can quantify the variability in et and distinguish the effects of radiation air temperature and humidity wind speed and canopy conductance on et changes approximately based on the derivative method thus it was considered a standard method to assess the contribution of climatic and vegetative drives stoy et al 2006 li et al 2013a as for the modified crop coefficient method and the priestly taylor pt method these methods also can separate the effects of climate and vegetation on et well and yield similar results tables 3 and 4 the crop coefficient method is generally used to estimate crop water requirement in our study irrigation was supplied fully and no water stress occurred thus the et measured by eddy covariance could be nearly considered as crop water requirement based on the measured et the accurate crop coefficient can be obtained which represents the combined effect of vegetative drives such as leaf area leaf stomatal conductance and so on after solving partial derivation of the modified crop coefficient equation the contributions of et0 and kc can be estimated the modified crop coefficient model gave similar and accurate results with pm pt and our linear models additionally the method is simpler and easier compared to the pm model the pt method is similar to crop coefficient method which also can separate the effects of energy and vegetative controls well the linear model which adopted the linear function to describe the relationship between et and rn and gc also provide the similar results with pm pt and crop coefficient methods the model separated the relative role of rn and gc in controlling et and indicated that gc played the critical role in et process however the uncertainty of the results yielded by the four methods should be considered the first order and high order errors of pm pt kc and the linear methods could be derived by the taylor expansion method which was introduced in yang et al 2014 in our study the pm method yielded the errors less than 5 table 2 while the linear method showed great errors especially during 2008 2007 table 5 since the linear model was an empirical method the uncertainty of the model should be highlighted in the application the pm pt and kc methods are more reliable in separating et contributions 6 conclusion the average daytime maize et during june 15th to september 15th in 2007 2008 2011 2012 and 2013 was 286 274 256 258 and 213 w m 2 respectively compared to et in 2007 et decreased averagely by 12 30 29 and 73 w m 2 over the other four years respectively the penman monteith pm model the modified crop coefficient method the priestly taylor pt model and the regression linear model were used to separate the climatic and vegetative controls on interannual variation in et simultaneously all methods provided similar results and demonstrated that the vegetative controls played a more important role in regulating annual et relative to climatic drivers more than half of the decrease in annual et was attributed to vegetative factors while the differences in climatic variables such as net radiation water vapor pressure deficit and air temperature among years were a lesser source of et changes furthermore the advantage and disadvantage of four methods for separating the relative contribution of physical and biological factors were also discussed the penman monteith pm model can estimate the contribution of rn vpd ta ga and gc approximately which is considered as a standard method for separating et changes the modified crop coefficient method can distinguish the effect of crop coefficient and et0 well and is especially reliable under the non water stress condition the priestly taylor pt model and the regression linear model can separate the contribution of rn and gc changes on et variation our study confirmed the importance of vegetative drives in effecting crop et and provided different approaches for separating the climatic and vegetative controls on et changes

7158,accurate evaluation of the relative contribution of climatic and vegetative drivers on land evapotranspiration et is critical for interpreting the et controlling mechanism modeling and predicting however how to accurately separate and estimate the contribution of climatic and vegetative changes on et variation remains uncertain our study attempted to interpret the interannual variation in et during 2007 2013 over a maize field in northwest china using four methods simultaneously such as the penman monteith pm model the modified crop coefficient method the priestly taylor pt model and the regression linear model results indicate that compared to the et in 2007 the et decreased averagely by 12 30 29 and 73 w m 2 in 2008 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively all models yielded similar results and showed that the vegetative controls played a more important role in regulating et relative to climatic drives and that more than half of decrease in et was caused by vegetative factors while the differences in net radiation water vapor pressure deficit and air temperature among years were lesser source of variation in et furthermore the advantage and disadvantage of the four methods were discussed our study confirmed the great effect of vegetative drivers in regulating crop et highlighted the importance of estimating canopy conductance accurately in et modeling and prediction and provided new approaches for separating the climatic and vegetative contribution on et changes keywords climatic change evapotranspiration maize penman monteith model vegetative control 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is controlled by climactic and vegetative drivers both of which are projected to change on multiple spatial and temporal scales due to the coupled effects of climate change and anthropogenic ecosystem management pielke et al 1998 houghton et al 2001 wear and greis 2002 foley et al 2003 stoy et al 2006 thus studying the relative roles of vegetation vs climate on et is critical for predicting how water cycling will respond to future climatic and biological changes such as radiation air temperature and humidity and crop variety changes stoy et al 2006 roderick et al 2007 zheng et al 2009 meng and mo 2012 li et al 2013a until recently many methods have been developed to isolate the relative contribution of physical and biological drivers on et wilson and baldocchi 2000 used the linear perturbation analysis approach to estimate the percentage in et due to changes in surface conductance humidity deficit net radiation and energy balance closure errors stoy et al 2006 combined the eddy covariance measurements with a linear perturbation analysis method to separate the contribution of physical and biological factors on et in three ecosystems in the southeast us they also compared the linear perturbation analysis with the penman monteith model and found the good agreement between the two approaches roderick et al 2007 used a generic physical model based on mass and energy balances to attribute pan evaporation changes to changes in radiation temperature humidity and wind speed yang and yang 2011 separated the contribution to annual runoff by combining budyko equation and penman equation in 2012 they quantified the contributions of climatic factors to epan using partial derivatives and found that the decrease in epan was mainly determined by changes in radiation and wind speed the study provided a new insight for understanding the effect of climatic change on evaporation yang and yang 2012 meng and mo 2012 applied an approach based on budyko type equation to separate the contributions of climatic factors to changes in annual runoff from 1960 to 2008 through multiplying their partial derivatives by the slopes of trends in climate factors li et al 2013a evaluated the relative role of climatic and biological control on energy partition based on solving the partial derivation of the penman monteith model in a latest paper of gong et al 2014 they used a model similar to the crop coefficient method of fao56 to evaluate the effects of vegetation change on et in a semiarid shrubland of the loess plateau china yang et al 2014 estimated the error of mezentsev choudhury yang equation for assessing the contribution of climate change to runoff based on the budyko hypothesis the previous studies generally used one method to separate the climatic and vegetative control the results lacked of comparison and whether the result was accurate is uncertain for example the penman monteith model and the partial derivative method are widely used to quantify the relative contribution of climatic and vegetative changes on et however whether the approach is reliable and accurate remains uncertain other et models such as the priestly taylor pt method the crop coefficient method and the empiric linear models can be used to estimate et but whether they can quantify and interpret et changes still requires further study thus we attempted to separate the contribution of climatic and vegetative changes on et using four approaches simultaneously namely pm pt the modified crop coefficient methods and the empirical linear et model and examine the reliability of different methods in evaluating contributions of all drives the long term et data for maize measured by the eddy covariance method during 2007 2013 were adopted to analyze the interannual variation in crop et and interpret the mechanism of interannual variation from different perspectives 2 models for quantifying the variability in evapotranspiration 2 1 quantifying the climatic and vegetative controls on et variability using the penman monteith model the penman monteith pm model can be written as monteith 1965 1 λ e t δ r n g c p ρ a v p d r a δ γ γ r c r a where λet is the crop evapotranspiration w m 2 λ is the latent heat of vaporization j kg 1 is is the slope of the saturation water vapor pressure versus temperature curve kpa k 1 rn is the net radiation w m

resistance s m 1 γ is the psychrometric constant pa k 1 rc is the canopy resistance s m 1 the aerodynamic resistance ra can be expressed as paulson 1970 businger et al 1971 2 r a in z z 0 ψ h in z z 0 ψ m k 2 u where z is the reference height m z 0 the roughness length of the crop relative to momentum transfer m k is the von karman constant 0 41 ψh is the stability correction function for heat and water transfer ψm is the stability correction function for momentum transfers these stability correction functions are taken from the models of paulson 1970 u is the wind speed at the reference height m s 1 according to monteith 1965 z 0 can be estimated as 0 13 hc where hc is the mean crop height m thus et can be expressed as a continuous function of four climatic and one vegetative variables stoy et al 2006 3 et f r n g v p d t a r a r c our study adopted the partial derivative method to calculate the variation in et the method also has been used to examine the changes in pan and potential evaporation by previous studies roderick et al 2007 meng and mo 2012 li et al 2013a according to the method et variation can be estimated as 4 δ e t e t r n g δ r n g e t v p d δ v p d e t t a δ t a e

measured p c p b in our study δet between the five years was measured by the eddy covariance system the partial derivations of et to the variables were calculated with the measured meteorological data we chose the meteorological data which made the least error of eq 12 the actual value of canopy resistance was obtained by the re ranged penman monteith model li et al 2013a 2 2 quantifying the climatic and vegetative controls on et variability using the modified crop coefficient method the crop coefficient method can be expressed as follows allen et al 1998 13 e t c k c e t 0 where etc represents the crop water requirement mm d 1 kc the crop coefficient et0 the reference crop water requirement mm d 1 when the soil water is adequately supplied the measured crop evapotranspiration can be nearly considered as the water requirement of maize thus we can estimate kc as the ratio of etc to et0 et0 was calculated by the standard method recommended by fao 56 manual allen et al 1998 in our study we normalized etc and et0 by dividing rn simultaneously 14 er λ e t c r n k c λ e t 0 r n where λetc rn represents the ratio of energy partition into evapotranspiration the variability in etc rn can be calculated as 15 δ λ e t c r n δ k c λ e t 0 r n k c δ λ e t 0 r n e r r o r k c λ e t 0 r n thus the changes due to climatic controls can be expressed as 16 δ c k c δ e t 0 r n while the

taylor 1972 allen et al 1998 19 λ e t α c δ δ γ r n g where αc represents the characteristics of vegetation values of αc during different years were obtained by dividing etc to the equilibrium evapotranspiration in the study the alpha of pt equation was obtained by the et measured by eddy covariance and the re arranged pt equation according to eq 18 it can be inferred that 20 ef λ e t r n g

while the changes due to vegetative controls can be expressed as 23 δ v δ α c δ δ γ the errors can be estimated by taylor expansion method 24 error α c δ δ γ 1 2 2 e f α c 2 δ α c 2 1 2 2 e f δ δ γ 2

stoy et al 2006 we constructed an empirical model to quantify the relationship between et and rn g and the canopy conductance gc using the daily data during the five years as follows 25 et 0 0432 r n

soil is desert soil siltigic orthic anthrosols and soil texture is sandy loam with a mean dry bulk density of 1 43 g cm 3 and volumetric soil water content at a field capacity of 0 29 cm3 cm 3 li et al 2013a b li et al 2015 li et al 2016 3 2 measurements in the maize field during 2017 2013 spring maize was planted with row spacing of 40 cm and plant spacing of 30 cm the plant density was about 66 000 plants per hectare and the total area was about 39 ha crops were also extensively cultivated in the surrounding fields in 2007 and 2008 the common spring corn was cultivated while in 2011 2012 and 2013 the seeding maize was planted thus the crop height and lai varied significantly across the different years the experimental field was irrigated with a total amount of 320 mm 420 mm 320 mm 350 mm and 350 mm in 2007 2008 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively border irrigation was adopted to deliver water in the field the precipitation was 153 71 220 130 and 80 mm during the whole growing stage in the five years the main root was located at depth of 0 60 cm an open path eddy covariance ec system was installed in the northwest of the maize field the sensors were 1 0 m above the maize canopy maize is the principal crop cultivated in the surrounding region and its planting area is large enough to provide adequate fetch length for ec measurement the ec system consisted of a 3 d sonic anemometer thermometer model csat3 a krypton hygrometer model kh20 and a temperature and humidity sensor model hmp45c model csat3 and kh20 measured vertical fluctuations of wind temperature and water vapor density at 0 1 s intervals and temperature and humidity at 10 min intervals net radiation rn was measured by a net radiometer model nr lite kipp zonen delft netherlands at a height of 1 5 m above the canopy two soil heat flux plates model hfp01 hukseflux netherlands were used to measure soil heat flux all the sensors were connected to a data logger model cr5000 campbell scientific inc usa and the 10 min statistics were computed the long term and continuous measurements over the crop season were made from 2007 to 2008 and 2011 to 2013 the detailed procedure of data corrections for eddy

the normalized soil water content is calculated by the equation of f θ θ θw θf θw where θ is the measured soil water content θf is the field capacity θw is the wilting coefficient the leaf area index of maize was calculated by summing lamina length maximum width of each leaf and multiplied by a factor of 0 74 the detailed measurements for these parameters have been depicted in li et al 2016 4 results 4 1 interannual variability of climatic and vegetative factors over the maize field in order to reveal the relationship between crop evapotranspiration et and environmental factors study should be carried out on the seasonal and interannual variation of climatic and vegetative factors such as net radiation rn water vapor pressure deficit vpd air temperature ta wind speed at height of 2 m u2 the normalized soil moisture f θ leaf area index lai canopy height hc and canopy conductance gc on the maize field during 2007 2013 in order to control the data quality we only used the daytime data from 8 00 to 17 00 during 15th june to 15th september in every year when the underlying surface can be treated as a whole fig 1 shows the seasonal and interannual variation of daytime rn vpd ta and u2 during 15th june to 15th september in 2007 2008 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively daytime rn varied from 0 to 500 w m 2 with an average of 373 384 343 347 and 304 w m 2 in 2007 2008 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively rn in 2008 was the highest while the value in 2013 was the lowest among the five years table 1 compared with rn vpd showed a similar interannual trend it had a peak value of 1 73 kpa in 2011 a minimum value of 1 59 kpa in 2013 and an average of 1 66 kpa among the five years table 1 as for the air temperature daytime ta changed from 10 to 35 c with a mean of 23 5 c during the five years while the ta of 2011 was the highest with a value of 23 77 c and that of 2013 was the lowest with a value of 23 16 c table 1 the daytime wind speed at height of 2 m u2 varied from 0 to 4 m s 1 with the highest mean value of 1 39 m s 1 in 2008 and the lowest of 1 07 m s 1 in 2012 table 1 fig 2 shows the seasonal variation of daytime f θ lai hc and gc during 15th june to 15th september in the five years the normalized soil water content f θ for most of the time was higher than 0 6 indicating that soil water could meet crop need adequately and non water stress occurred thus the crop evapotranspiration measured by eddy covariance could be nearly considered as crop requirement amount and was only controlled by climatic and vegetative factors in the latter analysis we only analyzed the effect of meteorological and crop factors on et and neglected the soil water control the maize lai during june to september varied from 2 0 to 5 6 over the five years the maximum lai laimax was 5 7 4 48 4 88 4 43 and 3 65 m2 m 2 in 2007 2008 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively table 1 accordingly the maximum crop height hc was 2 69 2 01 1 18 1 72 and 1 19 m over the five years the canopy conductance gc varied from 0 to 25 mm s 1 with an average of 10 42 9 3 8 6 8 68 and 7 28 mm s 1 over the five years thus the year of 2007 had the maximum lai hc and gc table 1 the sharp decrease in maize lai and height over 2011 2013 relative to 2017 2018 was mainly caused by the crop variety changes in 2007 and 2008 the grain maize was planted while in 2011 2012 and 2013 the seeding maize was cultivated 4 2 seasonal and interannual variability of maize evapotranspiration and its components during 2007 2013 fig 3 shows the seasonal and interannual variation of the equilibrium evapotranspiration λeteq the imposed evapotranspiration λetimp and the decoupling factor ω during 15th june to 15th september in the five years λeteq ranged from 0 to 400 w m 2 during 2007 2013 while λetimp from 0 to 600 w m 2 during the five years as for the decoupling factor ω the mean ω was 0 23 0 40 0 37 0 24 and 0 31 for 2007 2008 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively these indicated that the coupling degree between canopy and atmosphere was high and maize evapotranspiration was more sensitive to atmosphere environmental changes than radiation changes according to the jarvis coupling theory fig 4 depicts the seasonal variation of the radiation evapotranspiration λetrad and the aerodynamic evapotranspiration λetaero during the five years mean λetrad was 62 21 105 86 97 06 64 67 and 74 90 w m 2 for the five years respectively compared to λetrad λetaero was significantly higher than λetrad in every year which was 221 23 184 92 159 17 193 02 and 138 45 w m 2 for the five years these implicate a larger aerodynamic influence on et relative to radiation influence 4 3 seasonal and interannual variability of energy partition over the maize field during 2007 2013 fig 5 indicates the seasonal variation of the λet ec rn hs rn and g rn between 15th june to 15th september over the five years most of λet ec rn ranged from 0 5 to 1 0 during 2007 2013 which reveals that more than half of the energy was consumed by maize evapotranspiration the average value of λet ec rn was 0 64 0 78 0 71 0 81 and 0 77 over the five years respectively on the contrary most of hs rn varied from 0 to 0 5 during the five years suggesting that less than half of the energy was partitioned to sensible heat flux mean value of hs rn was 0 32 0 14 0 23 0 16 and 0 24 over the five years respectively the low value of hs rn was mainly due to the adequate irrigation under the full irrigation the land surface evapotranspiration was close to the potential evapotranspiration thus only a small amount of the energy was used to heat surface air compared to hs rn g rn was lower and most values were less than 0 1 results indicate that the average value of g rn during the five years was 0 04 0 09 0 05 0 03 and 0 01 thus the ground heat flux of the maize field was close to zero on the seasonal or interannual time scales and the radiation energy was mainly partitioned to crop evapotranspiration 4 4 interpreting the interannual variability in evapotranspiration due to climatic and vegetative changes in 2008 2011 2012 and 2013 using four methods table 2 shows the changes in et caused by available energy p rn g water vapor pressure deficit p vpd air temperature p ta aerodynamic resistance p ra and canopy resistance p rc variation in et due to climatic changes p c was defined as the sum of p rn g p vpd p ta and p ra while the variation in et caused by vegetative changes p b was defined as p rc which included the combined effect of crop variety leaf area and so on results indicate that vegetative changes made more contribution to et changes than climatic changes and the et changes due to vegetative regulation accounted for 84 64 51 and 62 of the total et changes while the changes due to climatic regulation accounted for 16 36 49 and 38 for 2008 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively table 3 shows that the difference in et rn between 2008 and 2007 δ et rn was 0 0535 while the difference in et0 rn between the two years was 0 0177 and the partial derivative det et0 rn was 0 9978 thus the difference in evapotranspiration between the two years due to changes in et0 rn was 0 0176 which accounted for 33 of the total difference in et as for the kc the difference in kc between the two years was 0 0483 and the partial derivative det kc was 0 7423 thus the difference in evapotranspiration due to changes in kc was 0 0359 which accounted for 67 of the total difference in et these indicate that reduction in et during 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to the reduced crop coefficient approximately a 67 decrease in et in 2008 to vegetative control the same as the year of 2008 we could also approximate a 76 46 and 100 decrease in et in 2011 2012 and 2013 to crop control and a 24 54 and 0 reduction in et in the three years to climatic control thus the vegetative control played a more important role in regulating et relative to climatic effect table 4 shows the result yielded by the priestly taylor method similar to the result produced by the crop coefficient method table 3 we also could infer a 66 67 73 and 94 decrease in et in 2008 2011 2012 and 2013 caused by vegetative effect and a 34 33 27 and 6 reduction in et in the four years to climatic effect as same as table 3 the table also implicated a greater effect of vegetative control against climatic control table 5 presents the results determined by the linear perturbation analysis since the radiation and canopy conductance were the predominant factors for determining et we constructed a linear model to quantify the relationship between et with rn and gc the perturbation analysis was conducted based on the linear model similar to tables 3 and 4 the 67 60 62 and 59 decrease in et in 2008 2011 2012 and 2013 were due to the reduction in canopy conductance while 33 40 38 and 41 of et decrease to net radiation fall respectively these analyses also indicate the more weight of vegetative factors in determining et process than climatic variables 5 discussion 5 1 why the vegetative control played a more important role in regulating et against climatic effect all results yielded by the four approaches show that vegetative control made more contribution in changing et against climatic effects on the annual time scale tables 2 5 relative to et in 2007 et decreased by 12 30 29 and 73 w m 2 in 2008 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively all methods show that more than half of the decrease in et was caused by the vegetative factors whether the climatic and vegetative controls played a more important role in affecting et has been investigated by many scientists wilson and baldocchi 2000 indicated that the reduction in evapotranspiration of a broadleaved temperate deciduous forest during 1995 compared to 1997 was primarily due to a reduced surface conductance especially during middle and late summer however in another literature gholz and clark 2002 found that et was mainly controlled by climate rather than ecosystem type along a chronosequence of slash pine p elliottii englm net radiation rn explained more than 80 of the variation in et stoy et al 2006 indicated that decreased leaf area index under mild and severe drought conditions reduced growing season et etgs by 80 mm compared with a year with normal precipitation in an old field site under wet conditions higher intrinsic stomatal conductance gs increased etgs by 50 mm et at a pine forest site was generally larger than the other ecosystems and highly sensitive to climate a 50 mm decrease in etgs due to the loss of lai from an ice storm equaled the increase in et from high precipitation during a wet year in contrast et at a hardwood forest was relatively insensitive to climatic variation stoy et al 2006 in a paper of li et al 2013a the authors found that the canopy conductance dominated the energy partition process relative to other factors in our research we found that the interannual variability in et was mainly attributed to canopy conductance changes rather than climatic factors changes these were mainly due to 1 stomatal conductance is the key factor for regulating canopy transpiration and land et is sensitive to surface conductance changes these opinions have been proved by physiological and ecological scientists and not needed to repeat wilson and baldocchi 2000 2 relative to 2007 the canopy conductance gc in 2008 2011 2012 and 2013 decreased significantly gc reduced by 11 17 17 and 30 in the four years respectively the reduction in lai predominated the gc decrease these results highlight the critical importance of canopy conductance in global evapotranspiration modeling estimation and prediction under the future climate condition 5 2 evaluation of four methods in interpreting the interannual variability in crop et the pm method indicates that the biological drives made more contribution in the interannual variability of et against climatic drives table 2 the method is widely used in isolating and evaluating the relative roles of climate and vegetation on et wilson and baldocchi 2000 stoy et al 2006 meng and mo 2012 li et al 2013a the approach can quantify the variability in et and distinguish the effects of radiation air temperature and humidity wind speed and canopy conductance on et changes approximately based on the derivative method thus it was considered a standard method to assess the contribution of climatic and vegetative drives stoy et al 2006 li et al 2013a as for the modified crop coefficient method and the priestly taylor pt method these methods also can separate the effects of climate and vegetation on et well and yield similar results tables 3 and 4 the crop coefficient method is generally used to estimate crop water requirement in our study irrigation was supplied fully and no water stress occurred thus the et measured by eddy covariance could be nearly considered as crop water requirement based on the measured et the accurate crop coefficient can be obtained which represents the combined effect of vegetative drives such as leaf area leaf stomatal conductance and so on after solving partial derivation of the modified crop coefficient equation the contributions of et0 and kc can be estimated the modified crop coefficient model gave similar and accurate results with pm pt and our linear models additionally the method is simpler and easier compared to the pm model the pt method is similar to crop coefficient method which also can separate the effects of energy and vegetative controls well the linear model which adopted the linear function to describe the relationship between et and rn and gc also provide the similar results with pm pt and crop coefficient methods the model separated the relative role of rn and gc in controlling et and indicated that gc played the critical role in et process however the uncertainty of the results yielded by the four methods should be considered the first order and high order errors of pm pt kc and the linear methods could be derived by the taylor expansion method which was introduced in yang et al 2014 in our study the pm method yielded the errors less than 5 table 2 while the linear method showed great errors especially during 2008 2007 table 5 since the linear model was an empirical method the uncertainty of the model should be highlighted in the application the pm pt and kc methods are more reliable in separating et contributions 6 conclusion the average daytime maize et during june 15th to september 15th in 2007 2008 2011 2012 and 2013 was 286 274 256 258 and 213 w m 2 respectively compared to et in 2007 et decreased averagely by 12 30 29 and 73 w m 2 over the other four years respectively the penman monteith pm model the modified crop coefficient method the priestly taylor pt model and the regression linear model were used to separate the climatic and vegetative controls on interannual variation in et simultaneously all methods provided similar results and demonstrated that the vegetative controls played a more important role in regulating annual et relative to climatic drivers more than half of the decrease in annual et was attributed to vegetative factors while the differences in climatic variables such as net radiation water vapor pressure deficit and air temperature among years were a lesser source of et changes furthermore the advantage and disadvantage of four methods for separating the relative contribution of physical and biological factors were also discussed the penman monteith pm model can estimate the contribution of rn vpd ta ga and gc approximately which is considered as a standard method for separating et changes the modified crop coefficient method can distinguish the effect of crop coefficient and et0 well and is especially reliable under the non water stress condition the priestly taylor pt model and the regression linear model can separate the contribution of rn and gc changes on et variation our study confirmed the importance of vegetative drives in effecting crop et and provided different approaches for separating the climatic and vegetative controls on et changes

7159,solute and or heat penetration into a fracture matrix system is an important subject in subsurface transport solute and or heat partitions among the fracture and its surrounding rock matrixes are based on coupled transport processes that are closely related to transport properties of the media the penetration processes in an asymmetric fracture matrix system are more complicated than that in a symmetric fracture matrix system due to different matrix properties accurate quantification of plume distribution in such a system is the basis of remediation design and risk assessment of a contaminated fracture matrix system closed form analytical and semi analytical solutions involving integrations are obtained in this study to quantify the influences of asymmetric matrix properties on solute penetration processes in a fracture matrix system advection matrix diffusion sorption source decay and aqueous phase decay are considered numerical simulations are performed using hydrogeosphere to test the solutions well matched curves of the numerical results and the closed form solutions and semi analytical solutions are obtained the matrix porosity and retardation factor appear to significantly affect the spatiotemporal distribution of solute in a fracture matrix system penetration depth in the matrix is a linear attenuation function of the horizontal distance from the source and a new dimensionless number called the z number or the matrix penetration number is defined to quantify the maximal penetration depth into the matrix the solutions obtained can act as an effective tool for assessment of solute and or heat transport in a fracture matrix system the solutions are also applicable to advection dominated solute and or heat transport in a thin aquifer bounded by two different aquitards keywords asymmetric matrix diffusion fracture matrix system solute transport aquifer aquitard system heat transport 1 introduction groundwater quality and subsurface contaminant transport have drawn much attention in the hydrological and environmental communities over five decades as key channels of fluid flow and solute heat transport fractures and fracture networks play an important role in controlling subsurface environments novakowski and lapcevic 1994 consequently numerous investigators have made great efforts to study the mechanism of transport processes in fractured rocks dai et al 2009 dejam et al 2016 roubinet et al 2012 sudicky and frind 1982 tang et al 1981 fractured porous medium is typically characterized by less permeable matrix blocks and a more permeable network of fractures as solutes enter a fracture matrix system the plume will penetrate into the fracture as well as into the surrounded matrixes solute mass transfer between the fracture and matrix is through molecular diffusion sometimes accompanied by other chemical reaction processes in the matrix dai et al 2009 many studies have shown that solute diffusion from a fracture into matrix plays an important role in controlling the transport process and could not be ignored for instance matrix diffusion has been proven to retard the solute migration velocity and to decrease the solute peak concentration in the fracture jardine et al 1999 liu et al 2004 maloszewski and zuber 1985 neretnieks 1980 a paradigm developed over the past several decades for solute transport in a fracture matrix system makes use of the assumptions that the matrixes adjacent to the fractures have the same transport properties including porosity effective diffusion coefficient and reaction rate such a paradigm is termed the symmetric matrix scenario in which one only needs to deal with a half plane because of the symmetry of the problem roubinet et al 2012 shahkarami et al 2015 tang et al 1981 zhu et al 2016 the symmetric matrix scenario is a special case of a more general asymmetric matrix scenario which allows matrixes bounding the fracture to have different transport properties examples of asymmetric matrix scenario are not uncommon in real geological setting for instance fractures surrounded by different rock matrixes are commonly seen in interlayer fault zones in which some rapid transport pathways can act as conduits for transmitting subsurface flows over large distances walker et al 2013 fairley et al 2003 transport properties vary significantly for different parts of the fault zones depending on displacement rates offsets and host rocks evans et al 1997 fairley and hinds 2004 caine et al 1996 presented field and laboratory observations in brittle fault zones which are lithologically heterogeneous and structurally anisotropic chester and logan 1986 explored the punchbowl fault zone which is bounded by extensively damaged host rock and field observations showed that the texture and fabric of the surrounded layers varied greatly cipollari and cosentino 1995 studied several unconformities controlled by tectonic processes or eustasy and indicated that the layers near the unconformities may have different transport properties similar situations were shown by raffensperger and garven 1995 who investigated two unconformity type uranium deposits in australia and canada in which the upper and lower layers are separated by faults these unconformities could act as preferential pathways for water and solute transport zhou and zhan 2018 have documented various cases of different lithology bounded a single fracture which will lead to asymmetric matrix diffusion in a fracture matrix system for solute transport mentioned above the symmetric fracture matrix models are not practicable and asymmetric models are more applicable instead since matrix diffusion can be of considerable importance to transport process in fractured media the asymmetric matrix properties may significantly affect the solute spatiotemporal distribution especially for cases in which large parameter differences exist between different matrixes determining the impact of different matrix properties on the transport process through a cost effective way such as using analytical and semi analytical methods would be instructive regarding physical process that controls the solute transport zhou and zhan 2018 considered different values of properties for the surrounded matrixes bounding a horizontal single fracture when developing a semi analytical solution using laplace transform considering longitudinal dispersion in the fracture among other factors numerical inverse laplace transform is adopted by zhou and zhan 2018 to obtain solutions in real time domain as numerical inverse laplace transform techniques may involve various degrees of numerical errors if it is not done properly wang and zhan 2015 the semi analytical solution developed in such a fashion must be tested preferably against a closed form analytical solution which is unfortunately not available alternatively zhou and zhan 2018 compared their semi analytical solution with a high resolution finite element numerical solution using comsol and found that both solutions agreed with each other very well no closed form analytical solution was obtained in zhou and zhan 2018 the purpose of this study is to develop closed form analytical solutions as well as semi analytical solutions involving integrations to describe the solute penetration process in an asymmetric fracture matrix system and to evaluate the effect of various matrix parameters on the spatiotemporal concentration profiles in the system the closed form solutions are simply algebraic functions of spatial and temporal coordinates which is the case in section 2 1 for a conservative solute and the semi analytical solutions in this work do not involve numerical inverse laplace transform but have functions that include integrations which can be computed straightforwardly at almost any given degree of accuracy our work differs from the previous studies with symmetric matrix properties on the consideration of different matrix properties specially we try to figure out the extent of influences of different matrix parameters on solute penetration and to evaluate under what conditions such influences can be ignored this work can be applied to deal with asymmetric matrix diffusion for heat penetration in a fracture matrix system simply by replacing the solute transport properties with the heat transport properties furthermore the work may be applied to study solute and or heat penetration in an aquifer bounded by two different aquitards from above and below provided that the transport in the aquifer is advection dominated or aquifer dispersions are negligible which can be true when the aquifer is relatively thin in respect to the scale of transport the paper is organized as follows a conceptual model of the problem will be established first followed by the mathematical model and the development of associated closed form solutions and semi analytical solutions involving integrations closed form steady state solutions are also provided the obtained solutions are tested extensively against the uniquely designed high resolution numerical simulations using hydrogeosphere and against previous solutions under special circumstances the tested solution will be used as a diagnostic tool to assess the impact of different matrix properties on the transport process after that applications of the developed solutions will be discussed before summarizing the findings in the conclusion 2 conceptual model the conceptual model presented here takes place in a single horizontal fracture with an aperture of b adjacent with two semi infinite rock matrixes which have different transport properties fig 1 both matrixes are much less permeable as compared to the fracture advective transport with a constant flow velocity takes place in the fracture and molecular diffusion takes place in the matrix the dimensions of matrix and fracture are sufficiently large in the horizontal direction thus the lateral boundaries far from the source will not impose any noticeable influence on the domain of interest the thicknesses of both matrix blocks are also sufficiently large so that their vertical dimensions will not affect the transport process this assumption is generally valid as the penetration depth of solute into the matrix via molecular diffusion is usually quite limited to the near fracture regions zhu et al 2016 origin of the coordinate system is at the bottom of the fracture on the left boundary from which the solute enters the fracture see fig 1 the x axis is along the constant flow direction in the fracture horizontal and the vertical axis z is positive upward the fracture matrix system is free of solute of concern at t 0 for the sake of developing closed form analytical solutions a series of assumptions are inevitable for simplifying the fracture matrix system first the fracture matrix interfaces are assumed to be two parallel horizontal planes like that described by zhou and zhan 2018 second the fracture is assumed to have a constant aperture without any filling meaning that any hydromechanical effect due to the stress strain changes is not a concern and the fracture porosity is 1 this assumption can be relaxed to deal with a filled single fracture by considering a less than unity fracture porosity as investigated by zhou et al 2017 third longitudinal and transverse dispersions in the fracture are neglected as transport in the fracture is usually advection dominated with limited dispersive spreading this is understandable if one recalls that dispersion is caused by velocity variation for an idealized single fracture as shown in fig 1 the only velocity variation inside the fracture is the parabolic velocity distribution along the z axis over the fracture aperture which is quite limited we are aware that above assumptions are quite idealized from real single fractures which are often tortuous filled with sediments and with spatially and temporally variable aperture distributions unfortunately such assumptions are inevitable for developing closed form solutions such solutions are not recommended for directly solving real world transport problems involving complex fracture geometries instead they are more useful for understanding the fundamental process of transports in a fracture matrix system with specific consideration of the asymmetric matrix properties it is our hope that the insights gained from such closed form solutions may be advisable for further understanding of transport in a complex fracture matrix system by knowing the most important controlling parameters of the transport process nevertheless in accordance with these constraints the mathematical models are established as follows 3 mathematical models and solutions 3 1 case 1 solute penetration without reaction for a conservative solute penetration with no reactions in an asymmetric fracture matrix system we develop the following models for the fracture 1 c f t v c f x q 1 b q 2 b 2 q 1 n 1 d 1 c m 1 z z b 3 q 2 n 2 d 2 c m 2 z z 0 4 c f x 0 t c 0 5 c f x t 0 0 for the

x z t 0 0 where cf is solute concentration in the fracture ml 3 v is the groundwater flow velocity in the fracture which is assumed to be a constant lt 1 qi is the diffusive mass fluxes into the matrix ml 2t 1 where i 1 and 2 respectively represent the upper and lower matrixes hereinafter b is the fracture aperture l x and z represent the horizontal and vertical coordinates respectively l t is time since the release of the solute t cmi is solute concentrations in the matrix ml 3 c 0 is the constant source concentration in the inlet of the fracture ml 3 ni and di are the porosity dimensionless and effective diffusion coefficient l2t 1 of the matrix where di equals to τid 0 in which τi and d 0 are the matrix tortuosity dimensionless between 0 and 1 and the diffusion coefficient in free solution l2t 1 respectively a minor point to note is that eqs 2 and 3 have opposite signs on the right sides of equations that is because the matrix diffusions in the upper and lower matrixes have opposite directions in addition we used terms q 1 b and q 2 b in the governing eq 1 to represent the mass exchanges between the fracture and two bounding matrixes this means that the mass fluxes through the fracture matrix interfaces are uniformly distributed across the fracture aperture the assumption is reasonable because the fracture aperture is very small as compared to the scale of flow and transport along the fracture thus the mass flux is assumed to be completely mixed across the fracture aperture regardless of a symmetric or an asymmetric fracture matrix system this is a standard approach to deal with transport problems in fracture matrix systems and has been used numerously in previous studies tang et al 1981 sudicky and frind 1982 zhou and zhan 2018 however if it is an aquifer aquitard system rather than a fracture matrix system where the aquifer thickness is comparable with the scale of flow and transport along the aquifer one probably should consider both longitudinal and vertical dispersions in the aquifer as well as continuities of concentration and mass flux at the fracture matrix interfaces zhan et al 2009 this is because the concept of instantaneous mixture of solute across the aquifer thickness does not hold anymore in an aquifer aquitard system with above preparation we apply laplace transforms to the governing equations and boundary conditions to obtain the solutions in laplace domain and then transform the solutions to real time domains after using analytical inverse laplace transform techniques the details of derivations are provided in supplementary materials and the results are as follows c f x t c 0 erfc n 1 d 1 n 2 d 2 x 2 v b vt x c m 1 x z t c 0 erfc z b v d 1 n 1 d 1 n 2 d 2 x v b 2 vt x c m 2 x z t

solutions of solute transport in a fracture matrix system with asymmetric matrix properties it is interesting to see that if the upper and lower matrixes have identical parameter values then the solutions degrade into the closed form solutions for a symmetric fracture matrix system as reported previously by zhu et al 2016 3 2 case 2 solute penetration with sorption and first order reaction sorption and first order reaction are the most common reactions existing in the subsurface transport here we consider the sorption as an instantaneous and reversible process which is too fast to be influenced by flow velocity freeze and cherry 1979 when reactions exist in the fracture and matrixes the solute transport model in a fracture matrix system is as follows for the fracture 16 r f c f t

and r 2 ri 1 ρiki ni are the retardation factors of the fracture and upper and lower matrixes respectively in which kf k 1 and k 2 are the distribution coefficients of the fracture and upper and lower matrixes respectively ρi is the bulk density of the porous matrix freeze and cherry 1979 i 1 2 λ f λ1 and λ2 are the first order reaction rate constants of the fracture and upper and lower matrixes

exp xr f λ f v x n 1 r 1 d 1 n 2 r 2 d 2 vb z r 2 d 2 λ m with eqs 36 38 it is easy to assess the long term spatial solute distribution in the fracture matrix system one possible application of these equations is to assess the final penetration length of solute into the fracture or penetration depth into the upper or lower matrix zhu et al 2016 for instance if one wants to check the penetration length of solute into the fracture for reducing the concentration from c 0 to a sufficiently small threshold of c f such as the drinking water standard of the chemical of concern one can define c f c 0 ψ thus the ψ penetration length into the fracture l ψ can be obtained from eq 36 as 39 l ψ vb ln ψ r f λ f b λ m n 1 r 1 d 1 n 2 r 2 d 2 similarly if one wants to find out the penetration depth into the upper or lower matrix one could define c m 1 c 0 ψ or c m 2 c 0 ψ where c m 1 and c m 2 are pre defined sufficiently small thresholds which can be the drinking water standard of the chemical of concern as well in the upper and lower matrixes respectively after employing above eqs 37 and 38 one can obtain the final penetration depths into the upper and lower matrixes as follows 40 l ψ 1 ln ψ d 1 r 1 λ m x r f λ f v d 1 r 1 λ m n 1 r 1 d 1 n 2 r 2 d 2 vb d 1 r 1 x vt 41 l ψ 2 ln ψ d 2 r 2 λ m x r f λ f v d 2 r 2 λ m n 1 r 1 d 1 n 2 r 2 d 2 vb d 2 r 2 x vt the penetration depths in the matrixes are linearly attenuated functions of x the maximal penetration depths occur at x 0 which mean the farthest penetration depths into the matrixes at the level of ψ and they can be obtained as 42 l ψ 01 ln ψ d 1 r 1 λ m l ψ 02 ln ψ d 2 r 2 λ m we define dimensionless numbers zi which are called the z numbers or the matrix penetration numbers 43 z i 1 b d i r i λ m i 1 2 the z number can be understood as follows in eq 43 di ri is the effective diffusion coefficient in matrix considering the retardation factor while 1 λ m τ d is the characteristic time scale for the first order reaction or decay therefore d i r i λ m l d represents the characteristic diffusive length into the matrix at a given characteristic time scale determined by the first order reaction so the z number is essentially a ratio of such a characteristic diffusive length into the matrix over the fracture aperture with the use of the z number the maximal penetration depths become 44 l ψ 0 i z i b ln ψ i 1 2 further discussions about the effect of asymmetric matrix properties on the penetration lengths in the fracture and penetration depths in the matrixes are presented in section 5 3 3 case 3 solute penetration with source decay and aqueous phase decay to investigate the transport process of the radioactive wastes in such an asymmetric fracture matrix system we change the boundary condition to a decay source and the same decay constant is assigned for the fracture and matrixes the boundary condition expressed as eq 4 will become 45 c f x 0 t c 0 e λ 3 t the governing equations and other control conditions remain the same as in section 3 2 except that the decay constants of the fracture and matrixes are all changed to λ 3 then we obtain the solutions as 46 c f x t c 0 e xr f λ 3 v xr

different matrix rocks in terms of lithology the surrounded matrix could be igneous rocks like granite and basalt metamorphic rocks such as slate and marble and also could be sedimentary rocks like sandstone and shale transport properties differ significantly for matrixes of different rock types tang et al 1981 pointed out that the effect diffusion coefficient for most geologic media is in a range of 0 0 10 10 m2 s similarly the porosity of different matrixes can also vary considerably for igneous or metamorphic rocks the porosities near the fracture surfaces are in the range of 1 7 abelin et al 1991 whereas for the matrixes of sedimentary rocks such as sandstone or limestone the porosities may reach 10 20 bodin et al 2003 boving and grathwohl 2001 even found some field core samples of sedimentary rocks whose porosities are more than 20 the sorption reactions are significantly affected by many factors such as mineralogy and solute characteristics like ph and eh conditions bear et al 1993 thus the values of distribution coefficients of different chemicals on different rocks can vary on several orders of magnitude mckinley and scholits 1993 in view of the discussion above we choose a group of parameter values for our models including the base value table 1 used in section 4 2 to test the solutions as well as the parameter variations applied in section 5 to assess the influences of different matrix properties on solute transport process 4 2 test of solutions with numerical simulations and previous study hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2006 is chosen for the numerical simulations for its advantage of studying flow and reactive species transport through fractures in hydrogeosphere fracture and matrix are coupled by colocation as well as equal hydraulic head and solute concentration our model setup is a 50 m long section of a fracture matrix system with a width of 4 001 m the 0 001 m here is used to accommodate the 1 mm fracture aperture b the upper and lower matrixes both have a thickness of 2 m to obtain a result independent of numerical discretization the model domain is discretized with variable rectangular elements which provide a sufficiently fine grid around the fracture matrix interface with 500 elements along the x direction and 78 elements across the z direction totaling 39 000 elements a constant hydraulic gradient is assigned along the fracture to form a steady flow field in the fracture with a velocity of 0 1 m day molecular diffusion and dispersion in the fracture are not considered because these two processes may not significantly affect the transport process in the case of such a high flow velocity roubinet et al 2012 sudicky and frind 1982 tang et al 1981 compared to fracture the permeability values of matrixes are negligible thus they are assigned to be zeroes molecular diffusion is the only transport mechanism in the matrix three cases of simulations are conducted case 1 solute penetration without reaction case 2 solute penetration with sorption and first order reaction case 3 solute penetration with a decay source and decay reaction an observation point is chosen at the centerline of the fracture 0 5 m away from the source location the simulation period is chosen as 3000 days a point to note is that the boundary condition is set at the infinity in the analytical solution so when setting up the numerical models we should make sure that the lateral boundaries far from the source will not impose any influence on the domain of interest this means that the solute penetration length in the fracture should not go beyond the scope of domain for the time scale of interest in our numerical model for case 1 no reactions we set the domain length as 50 m 100 m 150 m and matrix widths as 2 m 3 m and 4 m and found that there were no obvious changes on the results this implies that the solute penetration length in the fracture is far less than 50 m and the solute penetration depths into both matrixes are far less than 2 m therefore we choose a domain length of 50 m and a matrix width of 2 m for all the rest simulations for case 1 such a setup of domain dimensions is sufficient to eliminate any influence of boundary conditions far from the source for case 1 in case 2 and case 3 reactions such as sorption and first order reaction will shorten the degrees of penetration in the fracture and matrixes thus the domain dimensions used in case 1 are sufficiently large for cases 2 and 3 the closed form analytical and semi analytical solutions are also tested against zhou and zhan 2018 in which reactive solute penetration in a fracture surrounded by rock matrixes with asymmetrically distributed transport properties was studied considering longitudinal dispersion in the fracture the de hoog numerical inverse laplace transform algorithm de hoog et al 1982 was used in zhou and zhan 2018 to obtain the final solutions in real time domain this procedure for numerical inverse laplace transforms could accelerate the convergence of the fourier series derived from the inversion integral with the trapezoidal rule fig 2 compares the hydrogeosphere simulation results with the analytical and semi analytical solutions obtained in section 3 as well as the numerical inverse laplace transform solution of zhou and zhan 2018 in the specified scenario without fracture longitudinal dispersion the circles represent the hydrogeosphere simulation results the symbols represent the solutions of zhou and zhan 2018 without dispersion and the lines represent the analytical or semi analytical solutions in this study integrations of the semi analytical solutions in fig 2 the blue line and black line are performed with the matlab function quadl which is based on gauss lobatto quadrature well fit curves prove that the analytical and semi analytical solutions are reliable 5 results and analysis in each of the following three subsections we quantify the influences of the asymmetric effective diffusion coefficient the matrix porosity and the retardation factor on solute penetration process in a fracture matrix system by allowing one parameter to vary with the rest parameters fixed 5 1 effect of the effective diffusion coefficient on solute penetration the effects of the matrix effective diffusion coefficients are shown by breakthrough curves btcs and spatiotemporal concentration distribution profiles in fig 3 fig 3 a and c exhibit btcs at the observation point p1 in case 1 and case 3 respectively the effective diffusion coefficient of the upper matrix d 1 is assigned to be 1 16 10 10 m2 s and the other parameter set is shown in table 1 in order to study the influences of asymmetric matrix diffusion on the penetration process a series of effective diffusion coefficients of the lower matrix d 2 are assigned ranging from1 16 10 13 m2 s to 1 16 10 10 m2 s which is representative of most geologic media tang et al 1981 the solid lines represent the case in which the upper and lower matrixes have the same parameter sets symmetric case and the dashed lines represent that they have difference parameter sets asymmetric case as fig 3 a shows when time is less than 300 days the difference of diffusion coefficient between the upper and lower matrix could affect the solute concentration in the fracture to some extent however as time goes on such differences become less obvious for instance even when the diffusion coefficient has a difference equal or more than three orders of magnitude see the purple and black curves in fig 3 a the concentration difference is insignificant at late stage similarly in fig 3 c the concentration differences induced by different diffusion sets are relatively obvious in the early stage however there is less difference in the peak values what is more after the peak the differences will decrease with time in addition when d 2 is less than a certain value btcs are nearly overlapped see the black and blue curves in fig 3 c approaching the case without diffusion in the lower matrix this demonstrates that when both the upper and lower matrixes have relatively smaller diffusion coefficients the differences of diffusion coefficients between the matrixes hardly have any influences on the solute transport process fig 3 b illustrates the steady state concentration distributions along the fracture centerline for case 2 asymmetric diffusion coefficient sets induce different penetration lengths along the fracture at the steady state according to eq 39 if ψ 0 01 when the values of d 2 are1 16 10 13 m2 s 1 16 10 12 m2 s 1 16 10 11 m2 s the final penetration lengths along the fracture are 37 4 m 35 4 m and 30 3 m respectively while if the upper and lower matrix have the same diffusion coefficient equaling to d 1 1 16 10 10 m2 s the penetration length along the fracture is 20 9 m the different penetration lengths in the fracture can also be verified in fig 3 b 5 2 effect of the matrix porosity on solute penetration matrix porosity is one of the most significant physical parameters that control solute transport process in a fracture matrix system with a large matrix porosity there would be a large void space available for solute migration from the fracture into the matrix which obviously would retard the solute penetration in the fracture the effects of the asymmetric matrix porosity on the fracture solute concentration are illustrated in fig 4 fig 4 a presents btcs at p1 with different matrix porosity sets in case 1 porosity of the upper matrix n 1 is assigned to be 0 1 porosity of the lower matrix n 2 is specified as 0 3 0 2 0 1 0 05 and 0 01 and the corresponding curves are red purple green blue and black respectively as fig 4 a shows different matrix porosities could significantly affect the solute migration process in the fracture for example the green solid line represents the case in which both n 1 and n 2 equal to 0 1 symmetric case the purple line means n 1 is 0 1 while n 2 is 0 2 at the time of 100 days solute concentrations in these two cases have a difference about 10 c 0 even at the late stage when the curves tend to be smooth for instance at 1000 days the concentration differences are still more than 3 c 0 fig 4 c presents btcs at p1 with different matrix porosity sets in case 3 in which a decay source is assigned and decay reaction occurs it is obvious to see that on account of the asymmetric porosities btcs exhibit a characteristic with different peak values as well as different time to reach the peaks for instance the time to reach the peak of the black line is more than 300 days earlier than that of the red line furthermore the peak value of the black line is about 13 c 0 higher than that of the red line thus we conclude that the difference of the matrix porosity plays an important role in controlling the solute migration process in the fracture this can also be seen from fig 4 b which gives the steady state solute concentration distribution along the fracture in case 2 base on eq 39 when n 1 is 0 1 and ψ is 0 01 if n 2 is 0 01 0 05 0 2 and 0 3 the corresponding final penetration lengths into the fracture are 35 4 m 27 1 m 14 4 m and 11 0 m respectively however if the matrixes have the same porosity i e n 1 n 2 0 1 the penetration length in the fracture as mentioned before is 20 9 m just as the green line shown in fig 4 b fig 5 depicts the effect of asymmetric matrix porosity on btcs of different spatial points p1 0 5 m 0 m p2 5 m 0 m and p3 15 m 0 m in the fracture for different cases from this figure one can see that as matrix porosities increase more solutes transfer into the matrixes and the solute concentration in the fracture obviously decreases the dashed lines moreover the effect of asymmetric matrix porosities on solute concentration at the point far from the source is increasing over time as shown for all the three cases it is obvious that the btcs at such three different scales 0 5 m 5 m and 15 m from the source are significantly different from each other for all cases 1 3 5 3 effect of the retardation factor on solute penetration sorption is one of the commonly seen reactions for solute transport in the subsurface and it would significantly retard the solute migration process curtis et al 1986 tang et al 1981 in fig 6 the influences of different retardation factor sets on solute transport in the fracture are shown fig 6 a depicts the steady state solute concentration distribution in the fracture for case 2 and fig 6 b illustrates btcs at p1 for case 3 the solid black line represents the case that the retardation factors of the upper r 1 and lower r 2 matrixes are both equal to 1 which means that both matrixes have no sorption keeping r 1 of 1 and gradually increasing r 2 one can inspect the influence of sorption in the lower matrix the corresponding r 2 to blue green purple and red lines are 10 100 300 and 500 respectively and the corresponding steady state penetration lengths along the fracture are 10 5 m 4 1 m 2 5 m and 2 0 m respectively this indicates that the retardation factor of the matrix can impose significant effect on the solute transport process as fig 6 b exhibits the time of solute reaching the peak concentration and the peak concentration values in the fracture both change greatly due to the variation of r 2 the black line represents the case in which both matrixes have no sorption i e r 1 r 2 1 the blue line is for the condition of r 1 1 r 2 10 difference of the time reaching the peak concentration between these two cases would be 200 days moreover the peak concentration value of the black line is about 10 c 0 higher than that of the blue line when ψ 0 01 the final penetration length in the fracture of the blue line is about 10 m as shown in fig 6 a while the penetration length in the fracture of the black line is more than 20 m as it turns out sorption reaction can play a significantly important role in controlling the migration process 5 4 effect on the plume distribution the asymmetric transport properties of the upper and lower matrixes not only affect the solute penetration process in the fracture but also significantly affect the concentration distribution in the matrix inducing an asymmetric concentration distribution in the fracture matrix system for example if the matrix on one side of the fracture has a smaller diffusion coefficient than the matrix on the other side the mass flux diffuse into this matrix may be smaller thus solute concentration would be lower in this way an asymmetric plume is formed fig 7 depicts the solute concentration distribution in a fracture matrix system at 3000 days in case 2 results of the hydrogeosphere simulation in section 4 2 the plume distribution in fig 7 a is symmetric as the upper and lower matrixes have the same transport parameters fig 7 b d describe the cases in which the effective diffusion coefficient the matrix porosity and the retardation factor are asymmetric respectively obviously asymmetric parameter sets of matrixes prominently influence the shape and size of contaminated plumes clear recognition of the plume distribution in such an asymmetric system would be helpful when one tries to make more suitable remediation plans in such systems 5 5 penetration depth into the matrix base on eqs 40 and 41 we know that the penetration depth into the matrix is a function of x usually one is concerned about the greatest penetration depth into the matrix at x 0 with which one could judge the range of the contaminant plume and ascertain whether the plume will encounter and interact with the contaminant diffuse away from other fractures eq 42 shows that the greatest penetration depth into a matrix is only related to the transport parameters of the matrix of concern i e the effective diffusion coefficient the retardation factor and the first order reaction coefficient a dimensionless number is defined to quantify the greatest penetration depth into the matrix namely the z number or the penetration number which is proportional to the penetration depth eq 44 to study the influence of the asymmetric properties on the penetration depth we take the data used in section 5 1 as an example if d 1 is 1 16 10 10 m2 s and other parameters are as in table 1 then the z number for the upper matrix z 1 is 100 11 and the corresponding penetration depth lψ 1 is 0 46 m changing d 2 from 1 16 10 10 m2 s to 1 16 10 11 m2 s 1 16 10 12 m2 s and 1 16 10 13 m2 s and keeping the rest parameters as in table 1 the corresponding z numbers for the lower matrix z 2 are 100 11 31 65 10 01 and 3 165 respectively and the final penetration depths into the lower matrix l ψ 2 are 0 46 m 0 15 m 0 046 m and 0 015 m respectively obviously the asymmetric properties of the matrixes would induce differences in the penetration depths into the matrixes and with the help of the example above and eq 44 it is easy to see that the difference between the penetration depths into the upper and the lower matrixes l ψ 1 l ψ 2 is proportional to the difference between the z number of the upper and the lower matrixes z 1 z 2 5 6 mass stored in the matrix and integrated flux through interface the amount of mass transferred into the matrixes provides important information for the long term contaminant transport process as discussed above the asymmetric transport properties of the upper and lower matrixes could induce an asymmetric solute concentration distribution in the fracture matrix system which means that the masses stored in the matrixes could be different depending on the matrix parameters the following equations are given to calculate the mass transferred in the matrixes 49 m 1 b 0 n 1 c m 1 dxdz 50 m 2 0 0 n 2 c m 2 dxdz where m 1 and m 1 represent the masses stored in the upper and lower matrixes per unit width along the direction perpendicular to the x z plane respectively substituting eqs 33 and 34 eqs 37 and 38 and eqs 47 and 48 into eqs 49 and 50 one could obtain the mass storages in matrixes as a function of time for case 1 case 2 and case 3 respectively a matlab script file has been generated to facilitate the computation of mass storages at any given time the closed form solutions of steady state mass storages can also be calculated based on eqs 49 and 50 we choose case 2 as an example for calculating the steady state mass storages in the matrixes based on a few considerations first the steady state mass storages in the matrixes represent the long term impact caused by the fracture matrix mass transfer which is usually the concern from a remediation or risk assessment perspective second the result of case 2 can be applicable for case 1 if excluding the reaction components third the steady state mass storages in the matrixes for case 3 is zeroes because of the use of a decaying source thus is trivial and not included in the following analysis substituting eqs 37 and 38 into eqs 49 and 50 one can obtain the steady state masses stored in the matrixes in case 2 51 m 1 n 1 vb d 1 r f λ f b n 1 r 1 d 1 n 2 r 2 d 2 λ m r 1 λ m 52 m 2 n 2 vb d 2 r f λ f b n 1 r 1 d 1 n 2 r 2 d 2 λ m r 2 λ m fig 8 shows the differences of masses stored in the matrixes as a function of time due to different matrix porosities n 1 0 1 n 2 0 05 other parameters are the same for two matrixes for the three cases studied all cases indicate that the masses stored in the matrix domains are sensitive to the asymmetric porosities for case 1 in which conservative solute transport is presented the stored masses in both matrixes gradually increase with time in case 2 solute transport is accompanied by first order reactions and sorption thus the storage masses in the matrixes approach their steady state values with time going on case 3 shows a decay transport in which the stored masses increase first and then decrease over time and eventually tend to be zero after a sufficiently long time of transport based on eqs 2 and 3 and the analytical and semi analytical solutions derived for different cases a matlab script file was generated to compute the integrated diffusive mass flux q along the whole fracture through the fracture matrix interface at any given time fig 9 shows such an integrated diffusive mass flux as a function of time for different cases comparisons between the symmetric parameter settings black lines and the asymmetric parameter settings red lines indicate that the asymmetric transport properties obviously affect the diffusive flux and the tends of diffusive flux through the interface over time are similar with that of mass stored in the matrix that is to say the integrated flux is rapidly increasing initially and slowly increasing over the entire time of concern for case 1 such an integrated flux is rapidly increasing initially and slowly approaching a steady state value for case 2 it is rapidly increasing initially and decreasing with time for case 3 a minor point to note for case 1 is that although the rate of increase at late times is relatively slow the integrated flux never approaches a steady state which is different from case 2 in which a steady state condition can be reached after a sufficiently long time 5 7 discussions the models developed and the parameter analysis in this study are appropriate for a fracture matrix system where the upper and lower matrixes have different properties one example of such a system is the interlayer fault zones in which some rapid transport pathways exist as conduits for transmitting subsurface flows over large distances walker et al 2013 the problem discussed here also concerns faults in which the upper and lower matrixes are formed in different ages with different compositions and lithology evans et al 1997 caine et al 1996 chester and logan 1986 one important application of the analytical models is to interpret field tracer experiment data thereby obtaining the transport parameters of the fault zones maloszewski and zuber 1990 developed one dimensional single fissure model coupled with diffusion process into the surrounded matrixes although the fissure with a constant aperture differs from reality the model is well applicable to interpret the short term tracer experiments performed by garnier et al 1985 in a fissured chalk formation especially the values of fitting parameters obtained with different tracers used by garnier et al 1985 are surprisingly consistent with each other himmelsbach et al 1998 also used the analytical model of maloszewski and zuber 1990 to interpret the tracer experiments conducted in the lindau fractured rock site southern black forest germany the agreement of the fitting parameters with the values found from independent laboratory measurements provides a piece of evidence on the applicability of the analytical transport models the fracture matrix system in maloszewski and zuber 1990 is symmetric our asymmetric models will be more applicable for the interpretation of tracer experiments in a fault zone with different matrix properties which are seen in some geological setting as illustrated in the introduction another possible application of the models of this study is to understand the heat transfer in an asymmetric fracture matrix system or an asymmetric aquifer aquitard system provided that the aquifer thickness is sufficiently thin in respect to the scale of transport along the aquifer for instance fairley and hinds 2004 developed a one dimensional analytical model of convective geothermal fluid transport to infer the distributions of hydraulic conductivity in an active fault zone based on more than 700 spring temperature measurements in the field the same thermal conductivity was assumed for the surrounding mediums in the analytical models of fairley and hinds 2004 although different thermal conductivity values were very likely to occur because of different media surrounding the fault zone with the help of the new solutions developed for an asymmetric fracture matrix system in this study one is possible to obtain more realistic results considering different textures of the overlying deposit and the underlying base rock however the model applications are more than that for solute penetration in a fracture matrix system the results of this study are applicable for solute transport problems in a multiple layer aquifer aquitard system zhan et al 2009 provided that the following conditions are satisfied 1 transport in the aquifer is advection dominated with negligible longitudinal dispersion 2 the aquifer thickness is much smaller than the distance of concern in the horizontal direction so that the solute is well mixed along the vertical direction 3 advective transport in the aquitard does not exist because of the absence of cross formation flow in addition the models developed in this study can also be applied to heat penetration problems in an asymmetric fracture matrix system as well as in an aquifer aquitard system in which the thermal properties differ among the overlying porous media the aquifer and the underlying porous media burns et al 2016 2017 this can be done straightforwardly by replacing the solute transport parameters with the heat transport parameters the analytical methods used in this study provide cost efficient ways to understand the importance of different transport processes and parameters in an asymmetric fracture matrix system they can be employed to precisely quantify the spatiotemporal distributions of transport species and can serve as a powerful tool to interpret the tracer experiments thereby yielding transport parameters of the formations despite the merits of the developed solutions this study also have some limitations first this study does not concern the possible scale dependent or other types of anonymous transport which requires different approaches or governing equations second as dispersions in the fracture are excluded for the benefit of developing the analytical solutions this study is thus not applicable for transport problems with very low groundwater flow velocity in the fracture or dispersion dominated problems third the study does not specifically consider the media heterogeneity which may require stochastic and statistical approaches or numerical simulations provided that the media heterogeneity can be characterized in sufficient details fourth fracture irregularity and roughness which are often quite challenging to be incorporated into the conceptual and analytical models are not considered in this study fifth the length of fracture and the thickness of rock matrix are both assumed to be sufficiently large to affect the transport process while as griffiths et al 2013 and ling et al 2016 showed the transport properties are associated with the matrix geometry which allows one to examine in more porous matrix cases how porosity and or permeability can affect transport therefore the result of this study may not apply when the dimensions of fracture and or matrixes are relatively small in respect to the scale of transport more endeavors should be taken to remove such limitations in the future studies 6 conclusions closed form analytical solutions and semi analytical solutions involving integrations are derived to quantify the solute penetration in a fracture matrix system with a novelty of considering asymmetry of matrix properties the transport processes include advection in the fracture matrix diffusion sorption decay reaction and first order reaction in general three cases are studied case 1 solute penetration without reaction case 2 solute penetration with sorption and first order reaction case 3 solute penetration with sorption source decay and aqueous phase decay reaction a closed form solution is derived for case 1 and semi analytical solutions are derived for both case 2 and case 3 closed form steady state solutions are given for case 2 when the first order reaction rates are the same in the upper and lower matrixes which is often the case in actual applications such as radioactive decay numerical simulations are conducted using hydrogeosphere to test the robustness of the analytical and semi analytical solutions the well fitted curves mean that the developed solutions are reliable the influences of the asymmetric matrix diffusive transport caused by asymmetric matrix properties on the solute penetration process are evaluated in general the differences of the diffusion coefficient the matrix porosity and the retardation factor between the upper and lower matrixes could affect both the solute penetration and the penetration distances in fracture and matrixes examination of influences of the retardation factor illustrates that the asymmetric matrix retardation factor could lead to a different spatiotemporal distribution of solute in a fracture matrix system a new dimensionless number called the z number or the matrix penetration number is defined to quantify the maximal penetration depth into the matrix the z number is essentially a ratio of a characteristic diffusive length into the matrix over the fracture aperture the penetration depth in the matrix is a linearly attenuated function of the horizontal distance from the source in which the maximal penetration depth can be seen the developed closed form solution and the semi analytical solutions can be applied directly to deal with asymmetric heat penetration in a fracture matrix system such solutions can also be applied for solute and or heat transport in an aquifer aquitard system provided that the assumptions involved in this study are also satisfied acknowledgement

7159,solute and or heat penetration into a fracture matrix system is an important subject in subsurface transport solute and or heat partitions among the fracture and its surrounding rock matrixes are based on coupled transport processes that are closely related to transport properties of the media the penetration processes in an asymmetric fracture matrix system are more complicated than that in a symmetric fracture matrix system due to different matrix properties accurate quantification of plume distribution in such a system is the basis of remediation design and risk assessment of a contaminated fracture matrix system closed form analytical and semi analytical solutions involving integrations are obtained in this study to quantify the influences of asymmetric matrix properties on solute penetration processes in a fracture matrix system advection matrix diffusion sorption source decay and aqueous phase decay are considered numerical simulations are performed using hydrogeosphere to test the solutions well matched curves of the numerical results and the closed form solutions and semi analytical solutions are obtained the matrix porosity and retardation factor appear to significantly affect the spatiotemporal distribution of solute in a fracture matrix system penetration depth in the matrix is a linear attenuation function of the horizontal distance from the source and a new dimensionless number called the z number or the matrix penetration number is defined to quantify the maximal penetration depth into the matrix the solutions obtained can act as an effective tool for assessment of solute and or heat transport in a fracture matrix system the solutions are also applicable to advection dominated solute and or heat transport in a thin aquifer bounded by two different aquitards keywords asymmetric matrix diffusion fracture matrix system solute transport aquifer aquitard system heat transport 1 introduction groundwater quality and subsurface contaminant transport have drawn much attention in the hydrological and environmental communities over five decades as key channels of fluid flow and solute heat transport fractures and fracture networks play an important role in controlling subsurface environments novakowski and lapcevic 1994 consequently numerous investigators have made great efforts to study the mechanism of transport processes in fractured rocks dai et al 2009 dejam et al 2016 roubinet et al 2012 sudicky and frind 1982 tang et al 1981 fractured porous medium is typically characterized by less permeable matrix blocks and a more permeable network of fractures as solutes enter a fracture matrix system the plume will penetrate into the fracture as well as into the surrounded matrixes solute mass transfer between the fracture and matrix is through molecular diffusion sometimes accompanied by other chemical reaction processes in the matrix dai et al 2009 many studies have shown that solute diffusion from a fracture into matrix plays an important role in controlling the transport process and could not be ignored for instance matrix diffusion has been proven to retard the solute migration velocity and to decrease the solute peak concentration in the fracture jardine et al 1999 liu et al 2004 maloszewski and zuber 1985 neretnieks 1980 a paradigm developed over the past several decades for solute transport in a fracture matrix system makes use of the assumptions that the matrixes adjacent to the fractures have the same transport properties including porosity effective diffusion coefficient and reaction rate such a paradigm is termed the symmetric matrix scenario in which one only needs to deal with a half plane because of the symmetry of the problem roubinet et al 2012 shahkarami et al 2015 tang et al 1981 zhu et al 2016 the symmetric matrix scenario is a special case of a more general asymmetric matrix scenario which allows matrixes bounding the fracture to have different transport properties examples of asymmetric matrix scenario are not uncommon in real geological setting for instance fractures surrounded by different rock matrixes are commonly seen in interlayer fault zones in which some rapid transport pathways can act as conduits for transmitting subsurface flows over large distances walker et al 2013 fairley et al 2003 transport properties vary significantly for different parts of the fault zones depending on displacement rates offsets and host rocks evans et al 1997 fairley and hinds 2004 caine et al 1996 presented field and laboratory observations in brittle fault zones which are lithologically heterogeneous and structurally anisotropic chester and logan 1986 explored the punchbowl fault zone which is bounded by extensively damaged host rock and field observations showed that the texture and fabric of the surrounded layers varied greatly cipollari and cosentino 1995 studied several unconformities controlled by tectonic processes or eustasy and indicated that the layers near the unconformities may have different transport properties similar situations were shown by raffensperger and garven 1995 who investigated two unconformity type uranium deposits in australia and canada in which the upper and lower layers are separated by faults these unconformities could act as preferential pathways for water and solute transport zhou and zhan 2018 have documented various cases of different lithology bounded a single fracture which will lead to asymmetric matrix diffusion in a fracture matrix system for solute transport mentioned above the symmetric fracture matrix models are not practicable and asymmetric models are more applicable instead since matrix diffusion can be of considerable importance to transport process in fractured media the asymmetric matrix properties may significantly affect the solute spatiotemporal distribution especially for cases in which large parameter differences exist between different matrixes determining the impact of different matrix properties on the transport process through a cost effective way such as using analytical and semi analytical methods would be instructive regarding physical process that controls the solute transport zhou and zhan 2018 considered different values of properties for the surrounded matrixes bounding a horizontal single fracture when developing a semi analytical solution using laplace transform considering longitudinal dispersion in the fracture among other factors numerical inverse laplace transform is adopted by zhou and zhan 2018 to obtain solutions in real time domain as numerical inverse laplace transform techniques may involve various degrees of numerical errors if it is not done properly wang and zhan 2015 the semi analytical solution developed in such a fashion must be tested preferably against a closed form analytical solution which is unfortunately not available alternatively zhou and zhan 2018 compared their semi analytical solution with a high resolution finite element numerical solution using comsol and found that both solutions agreed with each other very well no closed form analytical solution was obtained in zhou and zhan 2018 the purpose of this study is to develop closed form analytical solutions as well as semi analytical solutions involving integrations to describe the solute penetration process in an asymmetric fracture matrix system and to evaluate the effect of various matrix parameters on the spatiotemporal concentration profiles in the system the closed form solutions are simply algebraic functions of spatial and temporal coordinates which is the case in section 2 1 for a conservative solute and the semi analytical solutions in this work do not involve numerical inverse laplace transform but have functions that include integrations which can be computed straightforwardly at almost any given degree of accuracy our work differs from the previous studies with symmetric matrix properties on the consideration of different matrix properties specially we try to figure out the extent of influences of different matrix parameters on solute penetration and to evaluate under what conditions such influences can be ignored this work can be applied to deal with asymmetric matrix diffusion for heat penetration in a fracture matrix system simply by replacing the solute transport properties with the heat transport properties furthermore the work may be applied to study solute and or heat penetration in an aquifer bounded by two different aquitards from above and below provided that the transport in the aquifer is advection dominated or aquifer dispersions are negligible which can be true when the aquifer is relatively thin in respect to the scale of transport the paper is organized as follows a conceptual model of the problem will be established first followed by the mathematical model and the development of associated closed form solutions and semi analytical solutions involving integrations closed form steady state solutions are also provided the obtained solutions are tested extensively against the uniquely designed high resolution numerical simulations using hydrogeosphere and against previous solutions under special circumstances the tested solution will be used as a diagnostic tool to assess the impact of different matrix properties on the transport process after that applications of the developed solutions will be discussed before summarizing the findings in the conclusion 2 conceptual model the conceptual model presented here takes place in a single horizontal fracture with an aperture of b adjacent with two semi infinite rock matrixes which have different transport properties fig 1 both matrixes are much less permeable as compared to the fracture advective transport with a constant flow velocity takes place in the fracture and molecular diffusion takes place in the matrix the dimensions of matrix and fracture are sufficiently large in the horizontal direction thus the lateral boundaries far from the source will not impose any noticeable influence on the domain of interest the thicknesses of both matrix blocks are also sufficiently large so that their vertical dimensions will not affect the transport process this assumption is generally valid as the penetration depth of solute into the matrix via molecular diffusion is usually quite limited to the near fracture regions zhu et al 2016 origin of the coordinate system is at the bottom of the fracture on the left boundary from which the solute enters the fracture see fig 1 the x axis is along the constant flow direction in the fracture horizontal and the vertical axis z is positive upward the fracture matrix system is free of solute of concern at t 0 for the sake of developing closed form analytical solutions a series of assumptions are inevitable for simplifying the fracture matrix system first the fracture matrix interfaces are assumed to be two parallel horizontal planes like that described by zhou and zhan 2018 second the fracture is assumed to have a constant aperture without any filling meaning that any hydromechanical effect due to the stress strain changes is not a concern and the fracture porosity is 1 this assumption can be relaxed to deal with a filled single fracture by considering a less than unity fracture porosity as investigated by zhou et al 2017 third longitudinal and transverse dispersions in the fracture are neglected as transport in the fracture is usually advection dominated with limited dispersive spreading this is understandable if one recalls that dispersion is caused by velocity variation for an idealized single fracture as shown in fig 1 the only velocity variation inside the fracture is the parabolic velocity distribution along the z axis over the fracture aperture which is quite limited we are aware that above assumptions are quite idealized from real single fractures which are often tortuous filled with sediments and with spatially and temporally variable aperture distributions unfortunately such assumptions are inevitable for developing closed form solutions such solutions are not recommended for directly solving real world transport problems involving complex fracture geometries instead they are more useful for understanding the fundamental process of transports in a fracture matrix system with specific consideration of the asymmetric matrix properties it is our hope that the insights gained from such closed form solutions may be advisable for further understanding of transport in a complex fracture matrix system by knowing the most important controlling parameters of the transport process nevertheless in accordance with these constraints the mathematical models are established as follows 3 mathematical models and solutions 3 1 case 1 solute penetration without reaction for a conservative solute penetration with no reactions in an asymmetric fracture matrix system we develop the following models for the fracture 1 c f t v c f x q 1 b q 2 b 2 q 1 n 1 d 1 c m 1 z z b 3 q 2 n 2 d 2 c m 2 z z 0 4 c f x 0 t c 0 5 c f x t 0 0 for the

x z t 0 0 where cf is solute concentration in the fracture ml 3 v is the groundwater flow velocity in the fracture which is assumed to be a constant lt 1 qi is the diffusive mass fluxes into the matrix ml 2t 1 where i 1 and 2 respectively represent the upper and lower matrixes hereinafter b is the fracture aperture l x and z represent the horizontal and vertical coordinates respectively l t is time since the release of the solute t cmi is solute concentrations in the matrix ml 3 c 0 is the constant source concentration in the inlet of the fracture ml 3 ni and di are the porosity dimensionless and effective diffusion coefficient l2t 1 of the matrix where di equals to τid 0 in which τi and d 0 are the matrix tortuosity dimensionless between 0 and 1 and the diffusion coefficient in free solution l2t 1 respectively a minor point to note is that eqs 2 and 3 have opposite signs on the right sides of equations that is because the matrix diffusions in the upper and lower matrixes have opposite directions in addition we used terms q 1 b and q 2 b in the governing eq 1 to represent the mass exchanges between the fracture and two bounding matrixes this means that the mass fluxes through the fracture matrix interfaces are uniformly distributed across the fracture aperture the assumption is reasonable because the fracture aperture is very small as compared to the scale of flow and transport along the fracture thus the mass flux is assumed to be completely mixed across the fracture aperture regardless of a symmetric or an asymmetric fracture matrix system this is a standard approach to deal with transport problems in fracture matrix systems and has been used numerously in previous studies tang et al 1981 sudicky and frind 1982 zhou and zhan 2018 however if it is an aquifer aquitard system rather than a fracture matrix system where the aquifer thickness is comparable with the scale of flow and transport along the aquifer one probably should consider both longitudinal and vertical dispersions in the aquifer as well as continuities of concentration and mass flux at the fracture matrix interfaces zhan et al 2009 this is because the concept of instantaneous mixture of solute across the aquifer thickness does not hold anymore in an aquifer aquitard system with above preparation we apply laplace transforms to the governing equations and boundary conditions to obtain the solutions in laplace domain and then transform the solutions to real time domains after using analytical inverse laplace transform techniques the details of derivations are provided in supplementary materials and the results are as follows c f x t c 0 erfc n 1 d 1 n 2 d 2 x 2 v b vt x c m 1 x z t c 0 erfc z b v d 1 n 1 d 1 n 2 d 2 x v b 2 vt x c m 2 x z t

solutions of solute transport in a fracture matrix system with asymmetric matrix properties it is interesting to see that if the upper and lower matrixes have identical parameter values then the solutions degrade into the closed form solutions for a symmetric fracture matrix system as reported previously by zhu et al 2016 3 2 case 2 solute penetration with sorption and first order reaction sorption and first order reaction are the most common reactions existing in the subsurface transport here we consider the sorption as an instantaneous and reversible process which is too fast to be influenced by flow velocity freeze and cherry 1979 when reactions exist in the fracture and matrixes the solute transport model in a fracture matrix system is as follows for the fracture 16 r f c f t

exp xr f λ f v x n 1 r 1 d 1 n 2 r 2 d 2 vb z r 2 d 2 λ m with eqs 36 38 it is easy to assess the long term spatial solute distribution in the fracture matrix system one possible application of these equations is to assess the final penetration length of solute into the fracture or penetration depth into the upper or lower matrix zhu et al 2016 for instance if one wants to check the penetration length of solute into the fracture for reducing the concentration from c 0 to a sufficiently small threshold of c f such as the drinking water standard of the chemical of concern one can define c f c 0 ψ thus the ψ penetration length into the fracture l ψ can be obtained from eq 36 as 39 l ψ vb ln ψ r f λ f b λ m n 1 r 1 d 1 n 2 r 2 d 2 similarly if one wants to find out the penetration depth into the upper or lower matrix one could define c m 1 c 0 ψ or c m 2 c 0 ψ where c m 1 and c m 2 are pre defined sufficiently small thresholds which can be the drinking water standard of the chemical of concern as well in the upper and lower matrixes respectively after employing above eqs 37 and 38 one can obtain the final penetration depths into the upper and lower matrixes as follows 40 l ψ 1 ln ψ

matrixes are linearly attenuated functions of x the maximal penetration depths occur at x 0 which mean the farthest penetration depths into the matrixes at the level of ψ and they can be obtained as 42 l ψ 01 ln ψ d 1 r 1 λ m l ψ 02 ln ψ d 2 r 2 λ m we define dimensionless numbers zi which are called the z numbers or the matrix penetration numbers 43 z i 1 b d i r i λ m i 1 2 the z number can be understood as follows in eq 43 di ri is the effective diffusion coefficient in matrix considering the retardation factor while 1 λ m τ d is the characteristic time scale for the first order reaction or decay therefore d i r i λ m l d represents the characteristic diffusive length into the matrix at a given characteristic time scale determined by the first order reaction so the z number is essentially a ratio of such a characteristic diffusive length into the matrix over the fracture aperture with the use of the z number the maximal penetration depths become 44 l ψ 0 i z i b ln ψ i 1 2 further discussions about the effect of asymmetric matrix properties on the penetration lengths in the fracture and penetration depths in the matrixes are presented in section 5 3 3 case 3 solute penetration with source decay and aqueous phase decay to investigate the transport process of the radioactive wastes in such an asymmetric fracture matrix system we change the boundary condition to a decay source and the same decay constant is assigned for the fracture and matrixes the boundary condition expressed as eq 4 will become 45 c f x 0 t c 0 e λ 3 t the governing equations and other control conditions remain the same as in section 3 2 except that the decay constants of the fracture and matrixes are all changed to λ 3 then we obtain the solutions as 46 c f x t c 0 e xr f λ 3 v xr

different matrix rocks in terms of lithology the surrounded matrix could be igneous rocks like granite and basalt metamorphic rocks such as slate and marble and also could be sedimentary rocks like sandstone and shale transport properties differ significantly for matrixes of different rock types tang et al 1981 pointed out that the effect diffusion coefficient for most geologic media is in a range of 0 0 10 10 m2 s similarly the porosity of different matrixes can also vary considerably for igneous or metamorphic rocks the porosities near the fracture surfaces are in the range of 1 7 abelin et al 1991 whereas for the matrixes of sedimentary rocks such as sandstone or limestone the porosities may reach 10 20 bodin et al 2003 boving and grathwohl 2001 even found some field core samples of sedimentary rocks whose porosities are more than 20 the sorption reactions are significantly affected by many factors such as mineralogy and solute characteristics like ph and eh conditions bear et al 1993 thus the values of distribution coefficients of different chemicals on different rocks can vary on several orders of magnitude mckinley and scholits 1993 in view of the discussion above we choose a group of parameter values for our models including the base value table 1 used in section 4 2 to test the solutions as well as the parameter variations applied in section 5 to assess the influences of different matrix properties on solute transport process 4 2 test of solutions with numerical simulations and previous study hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2006 is chosen for the numerical simulations for its advantage of studying flow and reactive species transport through fractures in hydrogeosphere fracture and matrix are coupled by colocation as well as equal hydraulic head and solute concentration our model setup is a 50 m long section of a fracture matrix system with a width of 4 001 m the 0 001 m here is used to accommodate the 1 mm fracture aperture b the upper and lower matrixes both have a thickness of 2 m to obtain a result independent of numerical discretization the model domain is discretized with variable rectangular elements which provide a sufficiently fine grid around the fracture matrix interface with 500 elements along the x direction and 78 elements across the z direction totaling 39 000 elements a constant hydraulic gradient is assigned along the fracture to form a steady flow field in the fracture with a velocity of 0 1 m day molecular diffusion and dispersion in the fracture are not considered because these two processes may not significantly affect the transport process in the case of such a high flow velocity roubinet et al 2012 sudicky and frind 1982 tang et al 1981 compared to fracture the permeability values of matrixes are negligible thus they are assigned to be zeroes molecular diffusion is the only transport mechanism in the matrix three cases of simulations are conducted case 1 solute penetration without reaction case 2 solute penetration with sorption and first order reaction case 3 solute penetration with a decay source and decay reaction an observation point is chosen at the centerline of the fracture 0 5 m away from the source location the simulation period is chosen as 3000 days a point to note is that the boundary condition is set at the infinity in the analytical solution so when setting up the numerical models we should make sure that the lateral boundaries far from the source will not impose any influence on the domain of interest this means that the solute penetration length in the fracture should not go beyond the scope of domain for the time scale of interest in our numerical model for case 1 no reactions we set the domain length as 50 m 100 m 150 m and matrix widths as 2 m 3 m and 4 m and found that there were no obvious changes on the results this implies that the solute penetration length in the fracture is far less than 50 m and the solute penetration depths into both matrixes are far less than 2 m therefore we choose a domain length of 50 m and a matrix width of 2 m for all the rest simulations for case 1 such a setup of domain dimensions is sufficient to eliminate any influence of boundary conditions far from the source for case 1 in case 2 and case 3 reactions such as sorption and first order reaction will shorten the degrees of penetration in the fracture and matrixes thus the domain dimensions used in case 1 are sufficiently large for cases 2 and 3 the closed form analytical and semi analytical solutions are also tested against zhou and zhan 2018 in which reactive solute penetration in a fracture surrounded by rock matrixes with asymmetrically distributed transport properties was studied considering longitudinal dispersion in the fracture the de hoog numerical inverse laplace transform algorithm de hoog et al 1982 was used in zhou and zhan 2018 to obtain the final solutions in real time domain this procedure for numerical inverse laplace transforms could accelerate the convergence of the fourier series derived from the inversion integral with the trapezoidal rule fig 2 compares the hydrogeosphere simulation results with the analytical and semi analytical solutions obtained in section 3 as well as the numerical inverse laplace transform solution of zhou and zhan 2018 in the specified scenario without fracture longitudinal dispersion the circles represent the hydrogeosphere simulation results the symbols represent the solutions of zhou and zhan 2018 without dispersion and the lines represent the analytical or semi analytical solutions in this study integrations of the semi analytical solutions in fig 2 the blue line and black line are performed with the matlab function quadl which is based on gauss lobatto quadrature well fit curves prove that the analytical and semi analytical solutions are reliable 5 results and analysis in each of the following three subsections we quantify the influences of the asymmetric effective diffusion coefficient the matrix porosity and the retardation factor on solute penetration process in a fracture matrix system by allowing one parameter to vary with the rest parameters fixed 5 1 effect of the effective diffusion coefficient on solute penetration the effects of the matrix effective diffusion coefficients are shown by breakthrough curves btcs and spatiotemporal concentration distribution profiles in fig 3 fig 3 a and c exhibit btcs at the observation point p1 in case 1 and case 3 respectively the effective diffusion coefficient of the upper matrix d 1 is assigned to be 1 16 10 10 m2 s and the other parameter set is shown in table 1 in order to study the influences of asymmetric matrix diffusion on the penetration process a series of effective diffusion coefficients of the lower matrix d 2 are assigned ranging from1 16 10 13 m2 s to 1 16 10 10 m2 s which is representative of most geologic media tang et al 1981 the solid lines represent the case in which the upper and lower matrixes have the same parameter sets symmetric case and the dashed lines represent that they have difference parameter sets asymmetric case as fig 3 a shows when time is less than 300 days the difference of diffusion coefficient between the upper and lower matrix could affect the solute concentration in the fracture to some extent however as time goes on such differences become less obvious for instance even when the diffusion coefficient has a difference equal or more than three orders of magnitude see the purple and black curves in fig 3 a the concentration difference is insignificant at late stage similarly in fig 3 c the concentration differences induced by different diffusion sets are relatively obvious in the early stage however there is less difference in the peak values what is more after the peak the differences will decrease with time in addition when d 2 is less than a certain value btcs are nearly overlapped see the black and blue curves in fig 3 c approaching the case without diffusion in the lower matrix this demonstrates that when both the upper and lower matrixes have relatively smaller diffusion coefficients the differences of diffusion coefficients between the matrixes hardly have any influences on the solute transport process fig 3 b illustrates the steady state concentration distributions along the fracture centerline for case 2 asymmetric diffusion coefficient sets induce different penetration lengths along the fracture at the steady state according to eq 39 if ψ 0 01 when the values of d 2 are1 16 10 13 m2 s 1 16 10 12 m2 s 1 16 10 11 m2 s the final penetration lengths along the fracture are 37 4 m 35 4 m and 30 3 m respectively while if the upper and lower matrix have the same diffusion coefficient equaling to d 1 1 16 10 10 m2 s the penetration length along the fracture is 20 9 m the different penetration lengths in the fracture can also be verified in fig 3 b 5 2 effect of the matrix porosity on solute penetration matrix porosity is one of the most significant physical parameters that control solute transport process in a fracture matrix system with a large matrix porosity there would be a large void space available for solute migration from the fracture into the matrix which obviously would retard the solute penetration in the fracture the effects of the asymmetric matrix porosity on the fracture solute concentration are illustrated in fig 4 fig 4 a presents btcs at p1 with different matrix porosity sets in case 1 porosity of the upper matrix n 1 is assigned to be 0 1 porosity of the lower matrix n 2 is specified as 0 3 0 2 0 1 0 05 and 0 01 and the corresponding curves are red purple green blue and black respectively as fig 4 a shows different matrix porosities could significantly affect the solute migration process in the fracture for example the green solid line represents the case in which both n 1 and n 2 equal to 0 1 symmetric case the purple line means n 1 is 0 1 while n 2 is 0 2 at the time of 100 days solute concentrations in these two cases have a difference about 10 c 0 even at the late stage when the curves tend to be smooth for instance at 1000 days the concentration differences are still more than 3 c 0 fig 4 c presents btcs at p1 with different matrix porosity sets in case 3 in which a decay source is assigned and decay reaction occurs it is obvious to see that on account of the asymmetric porosities btcs exhibit a characteristic with different peak values as well as different time to reach the peaks for instance the time to reach the peak of the black line is more than 300 days earlier than that of the red line furthermore the peak value of the black line is about 13 c 0 higher than that of the red line thus we conclude that the difference of the matrix porosity plays an important role in controlling the solute migration process in the fracture this can also be seen from fig 4 b which gives the steady state solute concentration distribution along the fracture in case 2 base on eq 39 when n 1 is 0 1 and ψ is 0 01 if n 2 is 0 01 0 05 0 2 and 0 3 the corresponding final penetration lengths into the fracture are 35 4 m 27 1 m 14 4 m and 11 0 m respectively however if the matrixes have the same porosity i e n 1 n 2 0 1 the penetration length in the fracture as mentioned before is 20 9 m just as the green line shown in fig 4 b fig 5 depicts the effect of asymmetric matrix porosity on btcs of different spatial points p1 0 5 m 0 m p2 5 m 0 m and p3 15 m 0 m in the fracture for different cases from this figure one can see that as matrix porosities increase more solutes transfer into the matrixes and the solute concentration in the fracture obviously decreases the dashed lines moreover the effect of asymmetric matrix porosities on solute concentration at the point far from the source is increasing over time as shown for all the three cases it is obvious that the btcs at such three different scales 0 5 m 5 m and 15 m from the source are significantly different from each other for all cases 1 3 5 3 effect of the retardation factor on solute penetration sorption is one of the commonly seen reactions for solute transport in the subsurface and it would significantly retard the solute migration process curtis et al 1986 tang et al 1981 in fig 6 the influences of different retardation factor sets on solute transport in the fracture are shown fig 6 a depicts the steady state solute concentration distribution in the fracture for case 2 and fig 6 b illustrates btcs at p1 for case 3 the solid black line represents the case that the retardation factors of the upper r 1 and lower r 2 matrixes are both equal to 1 which means that both matrixes have no sorption keeping r 1 of 1 and gradually increasing r 2 one can inspect the influence of sorption in the lower matrix the corresponding r 2 to blue green purple and red lines are 10 100 300 and 500 respectively and the corresponding steady state penetration lengths along the fracture are 10 5 m 4 1 m 2 5 m and 2 0 m respectively this indicates that the retardation factor of the matrix can impose significant effect on the solute transport process as fig 6 b exhibits the time of solute reaching the peak concentration and the peak concentration values in the fracture both change greatly due to the variation of r 2 the black line represents the case in which both matrixes have no sorption i e r 1 r 2 1 the blue line is for the condition of r 1 1 r 2 10 difference of the time reaching the peak concentration between these two cases would be 200 days moreover the peak concentration value of the black line is about 10 c 0 higher than that of the blue line when ψ 0 01 the final penetration length in the fracture of the blue line is about 10 m as shown in fig 6 a while the penetration length in the fracture of the black line is more than 20 m as it turns out sorption reaction can play a significantly important role in controlling the migration process 5 4 effect on the plume distribution the asymmetric transport properties of the upper and lower matrixes not only affect the solute penetration process in the fracture but also significantly affect the concentration distribution in the matrix inducing an asymmetric concentration distribution in the fracture matrix system for example if the matrix on one side of the fracture has a smaller diffusion coefficient than the matrix on the other side the mass flux diffuse into this matrix may be smaller thus solute concentration would be lower in this way an asymmetric plume is formed fig 7 depicts the solute concentration distribution in a fracture matrix system at 3000 days in case 2 results of the hydrogeosphere simulation in section 4 2 the plume distribution in fig 7 a is symmetric as the upper and lower matrixes have the same transport parameters fig 7 b d describe the cases in which the effective diffusion coefficient the matrix porosity and the retardation factor are asymmetric respectively obviously asymmetric parameter sets of matrixes prominently influence the shape and size of contaminated plumes clear recognition of the plume distribution in such an asymmetric system would be helpful when one tries to make more suitable remediation plans in such systems 5 5 penetration depth into the matrix base on eqs 40 and 41 we know that the penetration depth into the matrix is a function of x usually one is concerned about the greatest penetration depth into the matrix at x 0 with which one could judge the range of the contaminant plume and ascertain whether the plume will encounter and interact with the contaminant diffuse away from other fractures eq 42 shows that the greatest penetration depth into a matrix is only related to the transport parameters of the matrix of concern i e the effective diffusion coefficient the retardation factor and the first order reaction coefficient a dimensionless number is defined to quantify the greatest penetration depth into the matrix namely the z number or the penetration number which is proportional to the penetration depth eq 44 to study the influence of the asymmetric properties on the penetration depth we take the data used in section 5 1 as an example if d 1 is 1 16 10 10 m2 s and other parameters are as in table 1 then the z number for the upper matrix z 1 is 100 11 and the corresponding penetration depth lψ 1 is 0 46 m changing d 2 from 1 16 10 10 m2 s to 1 16 10 11 m2 s 1 16 10 12 m2 s and 1 16 10 13 m2 s and keeping the rest parameters as in table 1 the corresponding z numbers for the lower matrix z 2 are 100 11 31 65 10 01 and 3 165 respectively and the final penetration depths into the lower matrix l ψ 2 are 0 46 m 0 15 m 0 046 m and 0 015 m respectively obviously the asymmetric properties of the matrixes would induce differences in the penetration depths into the matrixes and with the help of the example above and eq 44 it is easy to see that the difference between the penetration depths into the upper and the lower matrixes l ψ 1 l ψ 2 is proportional to the difference between the z number of the upper and the lower matrixes z 1 z 2 5 6 mass stored in the matrix and integrated flux through interface the amount of mass transferred into the matrixes provides important information for the long term contaminant transport process as discussed above the asymmetric transport properties of the upper and lower matrixes could induce an asymmetric solute concentration distribution in the fracture matrix system which means that the masses stored in the matrixes could be different depending on the matrix parameters the following equations are given to calculate the mass transferred in the matrixes 49 m 1 b 0 n 1 c m 1 dxdz 50 m 2 0 0 n 2 c m 2 dxdz where m 1 and m 1 represent the masses stored in the upper and lower matrixes per unit width along the direction perpendicular to the x z plane respectively substituting eqs 33 and 34 eqs 37 and 38 and eqs 47 and 48 into eqs 49 and 50 one could obtain the mass storages in matrixes as a function of time for case 1 case 2 and case 3 respectively a matlab script file has been generated to facilitate the computation of mass storages at any given time the closed form solutions of steady state mass storages can also be calculated based on eqs 49 and 50 we choose case 2 as an example for calculating the steady state mass storages in the matrixes based on a few considerations first the steady state mass storages in the matrixes represent the long term impact caused by the fracture matrix mass transfer which is usually the concern from a remediation or risk assessment perspective second the result of case 2 can be applicable for case 1 if excluding the reaction components third the steady state mass storages in the matrixes for case 3 is zeroes because of the use of a decaying source thus is trivial and not included in the following analysis substituting eqs 37 and 38 into eqs 49 and 50 one can obtain the steady state masses stored in the matrixes in case 2 51 m 1 n 1 vb d 1 r f λ f b n 1 r 1 d 1 n 2 r 2 d 2 λ m r 1

05 other parameters are the same for two matrixes for the three cases studied all cases indicate that the masses stored in the matrix domains are sensitive to the asymmetric porosities for case 1 in which conservative solute transport is presented the stored masses in both matrixes gradually increase with time in case 2 solute transport is accompanied by first order reactions and sorption thus the storage masses in the matrixes approach their steady state values with time going on case 3 shows a decay transport in which the stored masses increase first and then decrease over time and eventually tend to be zero after a sufficiently long time of transport based on eqs 2 and 3 and the analytical and semi analytical solutions derived for different cases a matlab script file was generated to compute the integrated diffusive mass flux q along the whole fracture through the fracture matrix interface at any given time fig 9 shows such an integrated diffusive mass flux as a function of time for different cases comparisons between the symmetric parameter settings black lines and the asymmetric parameter settings red lines indicate that the asymmetric transport properties obviously affect the diffusive flux and the tends of diffusive flux through the interface over time are similar with that of mass stored in the matrix that is to say the integrated flux is rapidly increasing initially and slowly increasing over the entire time of concern for case 1 such an integrated flux is rapidly increasing initially and slowly approaching a steady state value for case 2 it is rapidly increasing initially and decreasing with time for case 3 a minor point to note for case 1 is that although the rate of increase at late times is relatively slow the integrated flux never approaches a steady state which is different from case 2 in which a steady state condition can be reached after a sufficiently long time 5 7 discussions the models developed and the parameter analysis in this study are appropriate for a fracture matrix system where the upper and lower matrixes have different properties one example of such a system is the interlayer fault zones in which some rapid transport pathways exist as conduits for transmitting subsurface flows over large distances walker et al 2013 the problem discussed here also concerns faults in which the upper and lower matrixes are formed in different ages with different compositions and lithology evans et al 1997 caine et al 1996 chester and logan 1986 one important application of the analytical models is to interpret field tracer experiment data thereby obtaining the transport parameters of the fault zones maloszewski and zuber 1990 developed one dimensional single fissure model coupled with diffusion process into the surrounded matrixes although the fissure with a constant aperture differs from reality the model is well applicable to interpret the short term tracer experiments performed by garnier et al 1985 in a fissured chalk formation especially the values of fitting parameters obtained with different tracers used by garnier et al 1985 are surprisingly consistent with each other himmelsbach et al 1998 also used the analytical model of maloszewski and zuber 1990 to interpret the tracer experiments conducted in the lindau fractured rock site southern black forest germany the agreement of the fitting parameters with the values found from independent laboratory measurements provides a piece of evidence on the applicability of the analytical transport models the fracture matrix system in maloszewski and zuber 1990 is symmetric our asymmetric models will be more applicable for the interpretation of tracer experiments in a fault zone with different matrix properties which are seen in some geological setting as illustrated in the introduction another possible application of the models of this study is to understand the heat transfer in an asymmetric fracture matrix system or an asymmetric aquifer aquitard system provided that the aquifer thickness is sufficiently thin in respect to the scale of transport along the aquifer for instance fairley and hinds 2004 developed a one dimensional analytical model of convective geothermal fluid transport to infer the distributions of hydraulic conductivity in an active fault zone based on more than 700 spring temperature measurements in the field the same thermal conductivity was assumed for the surrounding mediums in the analytical models of fairley and hinds 2004 although different thermal conductivity values were very likely to occur because of different media surrounding the fault zone with the help of the new solutions developed for an asymmetric fracture matrix system in this study one is possible to obtain more realistic results considering different textures of the overlying deposit and the underlying base rock however the model applications are more than that for solute penetration in a fracture matrix system the results of this study are applicable for solute transport problems in a multiple layer aquifer aquitard system zhan et al 2009 provided that the following conditions are satisfied 1 transport in the aquifer is advection dominated with negligible longitudinal dispersion 2 the aquifer thickness is much smaller than the distance of concern in the horizontal direction so that the solute is well mixed along the vertical direction 3 advective transport in the aquitard does not exist because of the absence of cross formation flow in addition the models developed in this study can also be applied to heat penetration problems in an asymmetric fracture matrix system as well as in an aquifer aquitard system in which the thermal properties differ among the overlying porous media the aquifer and the underlying porous media burns et al 2016 2017 this can be done straightforwardly by replacing the solute transport parameters with the heat transport parameters the analytical methods used in this study provide cost efficient ways to understand the importance of different transport processes and parameters in an asymmetric fracture matrix system they can be employed to precisely quantify the spatiotemporal distributions of transport species and can serve as a powerful tool to interpret the tracer experiments thereby yielding transport parameters of the formations despite the merits of the developed solutions this study also have some limitations first this study does not concern the possible scale dependent or other types of anonymous transport which requires different approaches or governing equations second as dispersions in the fracture are excluded for the benefit of developing the analytical solutions this study is thus not applicable for transport problems with very low groundwater flow velocity in the fracture or dispersion dominated problems third the study does not specifically consider the media heterogeneity which may require stochastic and statistical approaches or numerical simulations provided that the media heterogeneity can be characterized in sufficient details fourth fracture irregularity and roughness which are often quite challenging to be incorporated into the conceptual and analytical models are not considered in this study fifth the length of fracture and the thickness of rock matrix are both assumed to be sufficiently large to affect the transport process while as griffiths et al 2013 and ling et al 2016 showed the transport properties are associated with the matrix geometry which allows one to examine in more porous matrix cases how porosity and or permeability can affect transport therefore the result of this study may not apply when the dimensions of fracture and or matrixes are relatively small in respect to the scale of transport more endeavors should be taken to remove such limitations in the future studies 6 conclusions closed form analytical solutions and semi analytical solutions involving integrations are derived to quantify the solute penetration in a fracture matrix system with a novelty of considering asymmetry of matrix properties the transport processes include advection in the fracture matrix diffusion sorption decay reaction and first order reaction in general three cases are studied case 1 solute penetration without reaction case 2 solute penetration with sorption and first order reaction case 3 solute penetration with sorption source decay and aqueous phase decay reaction a closed form solution is derived for case 1 and semi analytical solutions are derived for both case 2 and case 3 closed form steady state solutions are given for case 2 when the first order reaction rates are the same in the upper and lower matrixes which is often the case in actual applications such as radioactive decay numerical simulations are conducted using hydrogeosphere to test the robustness of the analytical and semi analytical solutions the well fitted curves mean that the developed solutions are reliable the influences of the asymmetric matrix diffusive transport caused by asymmetric matrix properties on the solute penetration process are evaluated in general the differences of the diffusion coefficient the matrix porosity and the retardation factor between the upper and lower matrixes could affect both the solute penetration and the penetration distances in fracture and matrixes examination of influences of the retardation factor illustrates that the asymmetric matrix retardation factor could lead to a different spatiotemporal distribution of solute in a fracture matrix system a new dimensionless number called the z number or the matrix penetration number is defined to quantify the maximal penetration depth into the matrix the z number is essentially a ratio of a characteristic diffusive length into the matrix over the fracture aperture the penetration depth in the matrix is a linearly attenuated function of the horizontal distance from the source in which the maximal penetration depth can be seen the developed closed form solution and the semi analytical solutions can be applied directly to deal with asymmetric heat penetration in a fracture matrix system such solutions can also be applied for solute and or heat transport in an aquifer aquitard system provided that the assumptions involved in this study are also satisfied acknowledgement
