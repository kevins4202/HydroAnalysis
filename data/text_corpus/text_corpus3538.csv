17690,the water planetary boundary pb has attracted wide academic attention but empirical water footprint research that accommodates local biophysical boundaries remains scarce here we develop two novel quantitative footprint indicators the water exceedance footprint and the surplus water footprint the first measures the amount of excessive water withdrawal exceeded amount of water withdrawn against local water pbs and the latter evaluates the potential of surplus water that can be sustainably utilised amount of surplus water available within local water pbs we quantify the extent to which demand for goods and services in chinese provinces and cities are driving excessive withdrawal of local and global water resources we investigate both territorial and consumption based water withdrawal deficit and surplus against local water withdrawal pbs we also trace how pb exceeded water and surplus water are appropriated for producing certain commodities in 2015 china s domestic water exceedance reaches 101 km3 while the total water exceedance footprint is 92 km3 we find that 47 of domestic excessive water withdrawal is associated with interprovincial trade exceeded water transfers were dominated by agricultural trade from the drier north to the wetter south a revised virtual water trade network informed by exceedance and surplus water footprint metrics could help address sustainability concerns that arise from the trade of water intensive commodities our findings highlight that policy targets need to accommodate pb exceedance of both direct and virtual water

introduction absolute sustainability assumes that natural capital stocks are not substitutable and that human activities must always remain within the carrying capacity of natural capital meadows et al 1972 the idea of revisiting carrying capacity of natural capital has gained momentum in the scientific community the planetary boundaries pbs framework formulated by rockström et al 2009 and recently updated by steffen et al 2015b proposes absolute biophysical limits that delineate a safe operating space for human prosperity at the global level by quantifying collective human modifications of the earth system in the anthropocene steffen et al 2015a while the global freshwater use pb has not been exceeded many regional boundaries have been exceeded or are increasingly under threat lade et al 2019 current unsustainable patterns of freshwater use exert pressure on a number of highly stressed watersheds and basins mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 motoshita et al 2020 since 2009 absolute water pb thresholds have been proposed by the academic community bogardi et al 2013 falkenmark et al 2019 gerten et al 2013 2020 gleeson et al 2020b jaramillo and destouni 2015 the wide uptake of water footprint studies in recent years highlights their increasingly recognised policy relevance hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 hoekstra and wiedmann 2014 environmental footprints in general are becoming an indispensable dimension in analysing pb related research questions as they link global production and consumption patterns to biophysical limits häyhä et al 2016 laurent and owsianiak 2017 the key strengths of footprint studies are their ability in a world of trade to encompass all upstream environmental implications of the consumptive use of natural resources as well as to examine the inequalities and interdependencies across borders wiedmann and lenzen 2018 virtual water trade i e water scarce regions import water intensive products to conserve local water resources is seen as a measure to alleviate pressure on scarce water resources to improve overall water use efficiency and to future proof domestic water and food security hogeboom 2020 we argue that in order to enable absolute water footprinting assessment a logical and necessary step is to incorporate local water pbs into water footprint accounting it is the additional water extracted above a threshold that must be avoided from an absolute sustainability perspective as this would give rise to exceedance which significantly increases the probability of local ecological impacts gerten et al 2015 2020 gleeson et al 2020b understanding which economic sectors or commodities create water exceedance indirectly along a given supply chain is essential li et al 2019 the embodied part of the water footprint may often lead to exceedance of local water pbs somewhere far away from the point of consumption this absolute sustainability perspective conveys environmental risk in a much more explicit manner compared to conventional water footprint assessments which typically encompass water thresholds in one of two ways they either account for local water thresholds by multiplying water use with water scarcity characterisation factors in order to calculate a stress normalised measure of water use chenoweth et al 2014 iso 2014 this method is useful for seeking relatively more sustainable options based on overall scarcity contributions as determined through universally applied thresholds but does not fully encompass absolute sustainability thresholds because the degree of biophysical exceedance is not explicitly quantified liu et al 2017 ridoutt et al 2018 wang and zimmerman 2016 alternatively recent approaches also directly compare footprint results with local water thresholds in absolute terms often on a per capita basis dao et al 2018 lucas and wilting 2018 nykvist et al 2013 o neill et al 2018 this latter approach tends to be more suited to globally relevant e g carbon footprint indicators that do not require a locally specific threshold and will only provide aggregated consumption based impacts thus missing location specific impacts allocation along the supply chain and effective intervention points empirical consumption based water footprint research that measures the extent of transgression and regional allocation of the locally specific water pb control variable remains underexplored the purpose of this paper is to introduce two novel quantitative footprint indicators to evaluate the territorial withdrawal of water in relation to its local water pbs the water exceedance footprint measures the exceeded amount of water withdrawn in relation to local water pbs sensitive to the specific demand in a province or city the surplus water footprint measures the amount of surplus water available within local water pbs that can be sustainably utilised to meet the demand of a province or city the merits of using both metrics as a complementary tool to the conventional water footprint support the reconciliation of sustainable appropriation of water resources within biophysical boundaries these novel indicators offer a new lens to explore how pb exceeded and surplus water are appropriated and allow comparisons across key commodities and geographical areas we use china as a case study as its sub national level water availability is highly uneven seasonal and vulnerable to climate change feng et al 2019 li et al 2015 piao et al 2010 within a nation production in resource scarce regions can be redistributed to avoid the transgression of local pbs huang et al 2020 while ensuring social equity and economic efficiency at the national level a localised evaluation of the extent of transgression at a much greater spatial resolution is necessary northern china is highly water stressed with only 18 of the nation s freshwater resources whereas the south by contrast is relatively water abundant with most runoff wasted through flooding and some significant water quality issues guan et al 2014 liu and yang 2012 china has a per capita water availability of 2100 m3 cap only 28 of the global average cai et al 2020 the north china plain a major food basket region and home to 200 million people only has a per capita water availability of less than 150 m3 year liu et al 2013 outsourcing of increasing food water and energy demand from major centers of consumption appears to exacerbate water stress elsewhere for instance the jing jin ji area zhao et al 2017 zheng et al 2019 the greater bay area chen et al 2019 and the yangtze river delta zhao et al 2016 continuing development of provinces and mega cities may be hampered by water stress risks in their supplying hinterlands and overconsumption by a growing middle class may further exacerbate their vulnerabilities liao et al 2020 qu et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a the role of virtual water trade in redistributing scarce water resources within china is not always effective in particular due to the consumption disparities between east china and west china as well as a mismatch of arable land and water between arid north china and temperate south china feng et al 2014 guan and hubacek 2007 zhao et al 2015 most interprovincial water footprint studies find that affluent eastern provinces and coastal cities in addition to their significant local domestic water use are typically net virtual water importers from other often water scarce northern and western provinces liu et al 2020 meanwhile irrigation intensive provinces in the drier north tend to export agricultural products to relatively wetter south regions where crop production is predominantly rainfed dalin et al 2014 internationally china is a net virtual water importer for agricultural products 25 km3 but net virtual water exporter if both agricultural and industrial products are considered 47 km3 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 wang and zimmerman 2016 in this paper we demonstrate how novel pb integrated water footprint indicators can be used to address ongoing challenges for water conservation policy in china these quantitative footprint indicators link pbs at various scales to final consumption and quantify the magnitude and spatial extent required for water exceedance mitigation using the newly developed indicators we further explore how pb informed virtual water trade can effectively redistribute resources within biophysical boundaries therefore achieving absolute water sustainability 2 material and method 2 1 defining two novel water footprint indicators we follow li et al 2019 s exceedance concept to define our water extensions territorially an over withdrawal of water that exceeds the local water pb can be defined as domestic water exceedance dwe i e water withdrawal subtracted by local water pb see graphical abstract dwe is measured in km3 for example if the water withdrawal of the paddy rice sector in jiangsu is 18 2 km3 and the local water pb is 9 3 km3 then the dwe of this sector is 8 9 km3 from a consumption perspective we define the term water exceedance footprint wef of a province or city as the amount of global dwe that can be allocated to the final demand of that province or city the wef is made up of some of the province or city s own dwe that remains in the environment of that province or city rwe and dwe of other provinces cities and countries that is virtually imported water exceedance embodied in imports weei some of the dwe becomes virtually embodied in exports to meet consumption elsewhere water exceedance embodied in exports weee we also define a domestic surplus water dsw concept for countries and regions where local water pb has not been exceeded i e local water pb subtracted by water withdrawal dsw is measured in km3 for example if the water withdrawal of the paddy rice sector in guangdong is 18 km3 and the local water pb is 36 5 km3 then the dsw of this sector is 18 5 km3 from a consumption perspective we define the surplus water footprint swf of a province or city as the amount of global dsw that can be sustainably utilised to meet the demand of this province or city without transgressing territorial boundaries for instance of the 28 7 km3 of guangdong s total dsw 23 7 km3 can become virtually embodied in exports to meet consumption elsewhere surplus water embodied in exports swee 4 9 km3 remains in guangdong remaining surplus water rsw guangdong also imports an additional 7 9 km3 of virtual surplus water surplus water embodied in imports swei to meet its demand 2 2 deriving mrio tables we construct a novel global multi regional input output gmrio framework with 10 chinese mega cities 27 chinese provinces and 139 countries and regions worldwide for the year 2015 this is developed by linking a subnational chinese mrio table from industrial ecology virtual laboratory ielab www ielab info lenzen et al 2014 2017a with the global mrio table from gtap v10 aguiar et al 2019 the original gtap v10 model features 65 sectors among 141 countries and regions aguiar et al 2019 we adapt it into 140 countries and regions merging tajikistan into rest of former soviet union and 57 sector resolution as in gtap v9 model 2011 for analytical purpose the model is then updated from year 2014 to year 2015 by adjusting final demand we follow the analytical approach of malik et al 2014 to upscale and assume that all final demand of each country for 2015 grew in line with the national gross domestic product gdp the 2015 gdp growth rate for 140 countries and regions obtained from the world bank is used to adjust the gtap mrio table into year 2015 wb 2015 the analysis concentrates on the top 10 mega cities with a combined population of over 85 million namely shanghai beijing guangzhou shenzhen tianjin chongqing wuhan nanjing chengdu and hangzhou the emphasis on these selected mega cities is decided because it is relevant to china s aim to develop three mega city clusters namely the jing jin ji the yangtze river delta and the greater bay area with a population of 20 of the nation and accounting for 40 of the national gdp national bureau of statistics 2015 the sub national chinese mrio model is generated from the china ielab following the methodology of wang 2017 we choose 27 provinces and 10 cities from the root classification 2874 chinese counties and 396 economic sectors to form the sub national matrices by root to base concordance matrices this initial estimate is constructed based on non survey methods lenzen et al 2017a 2017b and features 396 economic sectors and five final demand categories including rural household consumption urban household consumption government consumption fixed capital formation and changes in inventories we follow lenzen et al 2012 s approach to aggregate the 396 sectors into 57 sectors as in gtap sector classification see supplementary materials for the concordance matrix to align with the commodity by commodity format in gtap the model is transformed from a multi regional supply use mr su table type using eurostat model b i e following the industry technology assumption each industry has its own specific way of production irrespective of its product mix european commission 2008 the integration of the sub national chinese mrio model into the global gtap mrio model is achieved by nesting based on the methodology developed for constructing nested mrios described elsewhere wang et al 2017 the model assumes that international exports and imports of a sector in a province or a city are distributed to all foreign countries in the same proportion as the nation s exports and imports of the sector two types of constraint data are imposed to refine and optimise the initial estimate the first is the 2015 china customs dataset which contains corporate level product exports and imports in monetary terms it features 8000 commodity types and more than 200 economies of origin or destination at a highly disaggregated level totaling to 14 52 million data items china customs statistics 2015 the second is the incoming and outgoing trade between 37 chinese provinces and cities in relation to other nations from national bureau of statistics of china national bureau of statistics 2016 see fig s1 in supporting information 2 3 deriving mrio extensions for exceeded water and surplus water we refer to water withdrawal as the quantity of water distributed to users including water lost in transmission henceforth we use the term water footprint to refer to the footprint of water withdrawal for chinese agricultural sectors total provincial and city water withdrawal data are obtained from 37 provincial and city china water resources bulletin 2016 provincial water resources bureau 2015 with regard to sector allocation the provincial or city level water withdrawal is distributed according to eight agricultural commodity sectors in gtap v9 the distributional principle is the water consumption per crop production mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 and actual crop production in each province national bureau of statistics 2016 for chinese 43 industrial sectors provincial and city water withdrawal data are obtained directly from zhang et al 2020b city sector allocation follows the provincial allocation the global water withdrawal data for each sector in 2015 is directly generated from global mrio lab using the gtap configuration lenzen et al 2017a we use the total water withdrawal extension that is extrapolated directly from aquastat see water extensions withdrawal in supplementary materials provincial and city water availability are obtained from 37 provincial and city china water resources bulletins 2015 provincial water resources bureau 2015 global water availability is retrieved from the aquastat database from the food and agriculture organization fao 2020 provincial water withdrawal and availability extensions do not include those from the cities themselves there are few studies focusing on defining and operationalising the water pb at economic sectoral levels pb practitioners either focus on local water pbs at basin level bogardi et al 2013 falkenmark et al 2019 gerten et al 2013 gleeson et al 2020b jaramillo and destouni 2015 steffen et al 2015b or use less stringent bottom up local water pbs that do not relate directly to global boundaries such as lake water levels dearing et al 2014 and regulated instream flows to sustain ecological functioning cole et al 2014 similar to huang et al 2020 s approach of using a water stress index of 0 5 as a proxy for the local water consumption pb pfister et al 2009 we adopt the concept of a water scarcity indicator to define a local water pb relative to withdrawals a number of water scarcity indicators have been developed including the water availability indicator ratio of water withdrawal to annual renewable freshwater the falkenmark indicator per capita water availability the aware indicator and the quantity quality environmental flow requirement ratios liu et al 2017 adopting the widely accepted withdrawals to availability w t a threshold of 40 originally defined by alcamo and henrichs 2002 as indicative of severe water stress we set local water pbs as a w t a of 40 this threshold applies for all nations provinces and cities these local water pbs are distributed to 57 sectors using grandfathering as the downscaling principle grandfathering is a right based approach that allocates global pbs based on current shares of environmental pressure lucas et al 2020 the share of the local water pbs available for a sector is calculated based on its relative contribution to the total water withdrawal in 2015 see water local pbs in supplementary materials section 4 1 and 4 3 for a discussion on the uncertainty associated with the determination of the boundaries 2 4 water exceedance footprint and surplus water footprint calculation wef and swf are calculated as follows 1 we f n m n d w e x 1 ˆ i a 1 y n ˆ 2 sw f n m n d s w x 1 ˆ i a 1 y n ˆ where w e f n is a water exceedance map specific to one province or city n m n d w e x 1 ˆ is the diagonalised vector

map specific to one province or city n m n d s w x 1 ˆ is the diagonalised vector of direct surplus water intensities calculated as the product of a vector of the amount of surplus water available within local water pbs and the inverse matrix x 1 of diagonalised total industry output i is an identity matrix with ones on the diagonal and zeroes elsewhere a is the technology coefficient matrix calculated as the product of the input output transaction matrix t and the inverse matrix x 1 of diagonalised total industry output y n ˆ is a 10 089 1 vector of total final demand for a city province or country n which has been diagonalised note that the wef and swf for each province or city n can only be calculated once at a time 3 results 3 1 provincial and city wef and swf in china china s domestic water exceedance in 2015 reach 101 km3 while the water exceedance footprint is 92 km3 fig 1 a foreign export accounts for 26 of the national dwe and foreign import accounts for 18 of the national total wef rwe amounts to 28 km3 all provinces and cities compromise the water sustainability of other provinces or nations by significantly products and services causing local water exceedance shaded in orange bars fig 1a of the 65 km3 weei 77 51 km3 are imported from water stressed provinces and countries w t a 0 4 of the top eight wef consumers who import exclusively from water stressed areas henan hebei shandong and shanxi are typical major crop producers in north china plain the remaining four xinjiang and liaoning are also characterised with intensive agricultural export orientation whereas jiangsu and guangdong are wealthy manufacturing product export oriented provinces of the 73 km3 weee 34 25 km3 shaded in yellow bars and 66 48 km3 are exported to water stressed and abundant provinces and countries respectively this implies one third of chinese exceeded water is exported to alleviate the water stress areas meanwhile two thirds of the weee are ultimately consumed by water abundant provinces and countries there are 27 provinces and cities that do not over withdraw water within their own territory that is their water use does not exceed 40 of their water availability if measured in territorial perspective for instance guangdong zhejiang hangzhou and chongqing fall in the absolute water sustainable category however they import and consumer goods and services with embodied water exceedance from a consumption perspective they still contribute significantly to the transgression of local water pbs elsewhere at the city level the 10 mega cities accounts for 8 of the national population and 22 of the national gdp in comparison their dwe with a range of 0 3 km3 and wef with a range of 0 2 1 8 km3 are at 16 and 9 7 of the national total respectively from an equal per capita perspective their wef far exceeds their share of safe operating space 8 it is worth pointing out that a few cities exceed some provinces in terms of wef and dwe for instance shanghai ranks 17th and outranks hubei heilongjiang sichuan and fujian of the 10 cities shanghai and chongqing have the highest wef 1 4 1 9 km3 other cities show wef levels of around 0 6 1 2 km3 e g beijing guangzhou hangzhou with shenzhen at the lower end of 0 3 km3 china domestic surplus water is 388 km3 with the surplus water footprint at 319 km3 fig 1b in 2015 dsw and swf of a given province range from 2 to 40 km3 foreign export accounts for 11 of the national swe and foreign import account for 3 of the national total swf of the 275 km3 surplus water embodied in exports 29 81 km3 shaded in blue bars could be exported to alleviate the water stressed areas w t a 0 4 rsw amounted to 113 km3 the top six exceeded water consumers can benefit from importing surplus water at a scale around 10 km3 chongqing and hangzhou are the only cities that have surplus water 9 km3 and 5 km3 guangxi and sichuan have approximately 18 km3 remaining surplus water to sustain territorially and hunan jiangxi and guizhou have 10 km3 abundant water resources in some provinces can be further utilised sustainably to support the economic development of others there are eight provinces that are able to provide additional water to support others at a scale larger than 20 km3 namely guangdong 24 km3 guangxi 39 km3 zhejiang 20 km3 hunan 24 km3 jiangxi 33 km3 sichuan 27 km3 guizhou 20 km3 fujian 23 km3 these are exclusively water abundant provinces with an annual average water availability of 1153 2434 km3 compared to the national average of 666 km3 3 2 interprovincial virtual water flow net trade deficit of virtual pb exceeded water of a given province is shown in fig 2 a dwe wef net wef importers have an increased share of responsibility than net wef exporters the top net wef exporters spans less than 12 km3 shades in yellow and are either located in north china plain such as shandong 5 km3 and hebei 4 km3 agricultural product exporting provinces such as xinjiang 11 km3 ningxia 4 km3 and manufacturing product exporting province such as jiangsu 12 km3 net wef importers have a net trade deficit range from 0 to 4 km3 if aggregated to the economic zone level net virtual pb exceeded water largely flows from three hinterlands the northwest region 13 km3 the central coast region 11 km3 and the north region 10 km3 fig 2b the net importing economic zones are the southwest region receive 11 km3 the central region receive 8 km3 the southern coast region and the northeastern region have relative balanced net trade deficit at only 3 km3 this pattern implies that goods and services consumed by most regions come at the cost of water exceedance in the hinterland regions the three hinterlands contribute to 86 of the dwe for vegetables fruits and nuts production 74 of the dwe used for national wheat production 40 of the dwe used for national paddy rice production and accounts for 69 of national nonfood manufactured products production fig 3 net trade deficit of virtual surplus water of a given province is shown in fig 2c dsw swf net swf importers have an increased share of responsibility than net swf exporters the top net swf exporters spans less than 32 km3 shades in blue and cluster at water abundant south china net swf importers have a net trade deficit range from 0 to 18 km3 cities are all net swf importers with a range of 0 5 km3 at economic zone level net virtual surplus water largely flows from three hinterlands the southwest region 76 km3 the southern coast region 34 km3 and the northeastern region 12 km3 fig 2d the relative less affluent southwest region has considerable potential to support the economic development of the central region export 15 km3 and the north region export 13 km3 the southern coast is the wealthiest region and it also supports the north region export 5 km3 the net swf importing economic zones are the north region receive 32 km3 and the central region receive 14 km3 the central coast region and the northwestern region have relative balanced net trade deficit at only 3 4 km3 the magnitude of net virtual surplus water withdrawn in each province and city on average 10 km3 far exceeds the pb exceeded water in each province and city on average 2 km3 by 5 times meanwhile virtual pb exceeded water flow from drier north china to wetter south china while the largest virtual surplus water flow the opposite direction this implies that the current situation of north china transgressing its water boundaries can be largely remediated if surplus south water is better utilised 3 3 commodity level dwe and wef within china the reallocation of pb exceeded water from primary crop sectors to secondary and tertiary industries is apparent fig 3h from a production based point of view pb exceeded water occurs predominantly in wheat 40 of the dwe paddy rice 19 nonfood manufactured products 16 vegetables fruit and nuts 7 commercial and public services 6 cereal grains 3 plant based fibers 3 and electricity 3 in contrast virtual pb exceeded water flows into non food sectors and tends to be finally consumed by commercial and public services 27 of the wef processed food and beverages 16 nonfood manufactured products 12 wheat paddy rice vegetables fruit and nuts still account for 19 9 and 7 of the wef respectively most water is directly consumed by primary crops and embedded in processed food and non food products for export we observe significant differences of pb exceeded water withdrawn and its consumption across commodities between economic zones among the hinterland regions the northwestern region fig 3f use 28 km3 pb exceeded water to produce paddy rice wheat cereal grains vegetables fruits and nuts plant based fibers oil and seeds in which 18 km3 are exported in the north region fig 3a 16 km3 is used to produce wheat and 12 km3 is exported wheat sector accounts for 64 of its total withdrawal in contrast the central coast region fig 3b use 9 km3 to produce non food manufactured products and 12 km3 for crop production among the net pb exceeded water importing regions the central and southwest region fig 3d and g import more than 10 km3 to meet its secondary and tertiary sector demand the southern coast region and the northeastern region fig 3c and e export less than 3 km3 of crop production and import less than 4 km3 to meet its industrial demand 3 4 regional wef disparities our results show the weee dwe ratios range from 60 to 100 and the weei wef exhibits a varying ratio from 18 to 100 fig 4 a this suggests a highly interconnected and intertwined water intensive commodity trade structure within china more than half of territorial pb exceeded is exported elsewhere most cities except for chengdu and wuhan sit at the upper right corner in the high export range 85 weee dwe 100 and high import range 70 weei wef 100 they exhibit a high reliance on import with significant export oriented industries the self reliance ratio dwe wef measures the magnitude of territorial water exceedance over their wef dwe of yellow upper left provinces is smaller than their wef 1 due to significant water outsourcing activities they are import dependent countries who compromise the absolute water sustainability of other provinces ethically they will have to take major or increasing responsibility from a consumption based point of view these include jilin shanxi and henan the beige provinces are self reliant as their water exceedance seems to commensurate with their wef the light red and dark red provinces are exporting oriented provinces and extremely compromised dwe wef 2 as their water exceedances are at least two times larger than their water footprints this category includes jiangsu the biggest non food manufactured products exporting provinces xinjiang the biggest agricultural product exporting provinces wuhan chengdu and nanjing the swee dsw ratios range from 60 to 100 and the swei swf exhibit a varying ratio from 10 to 100 fig 4b inner mongolia shaanxi heilongjiang and anhui shaded in dark green have an importing trade structure that can import a high portion of surplus water 80 of their swf to meet its demand provinces whose dsw are less than 2 times than their water footprints shaded in light green have a trade structure the can moderately import surplus water 20 60 of their swf guangdong fujian jiangxi guizhou guangxi and qinghai shaded in blue are characterised with a dsw at least 2 times higher than their surplus water footprints their current trade structure could thus enable them to export 65 85 of their abundant surplus water to generate economic multipliers and help with the nation s food security 4 discussion 4 1 advances in planetary boundary integrated footprint indicators the global water pb delineates a safe operating space for collective human modifications of the water cycle but the challenge is to translate the global water pb framework to local scales at which water management and governance occurs our paper directly addresses this gap by introducing two novel quantitative footprint indicators to contextualise the water pb framework at sub national scale following li et al 2019 s appraisal of global phosphorus exceedance footprint this study developed a similar water exceedance footprint to measure the impacts of excessive water withdrawal exceeded amount of water withdrawn against local water pbs we also introduce a footprint indicator that evaluates the potential of surplus water i e the proportion of territorial safe operating space sos that can be utilised to sustain human well being our water surplus footprint results can inform decision makers with respect to the remaining sos to satisfy local demand to sustainably supply and consume from others while staying within biophysical boundaries the water exceedance and surplus footprints advance current knowledge on how the existing virtual water trade structure can become more sustainable the appeal of these indicators is that they can inform demand side solutions provide alternative view on consumption based responsibility allocation and reconcile trade offs between multi scalar sustainability goals lucas and wilting 2018 decision makers can visualise which regions are consuming commodities that embody scarce water along the supply chain as well as how a sustainably sourced amount of surplus water can potentially be harnessed or imported to satisfy domestic demand precautionary principle should still be respected when considering the use of surplus water footprints cai et al 2020 d odorico et al 2018 van vuuren et al 2019 environmental pressure should be minimised and the use of surplus water needs to adhere to other important constraints such as equity parrique et al 2019 teixidó figueras et al 2016 motoshita et al 2020 recently found a 19 of total freshwater consumption is characterised as superfluous consumption or overconsumption beyond basic human needs another important consideration is that surplus water should not encourage water use inefficiency or profligacy any consideration for re allocation of water use must also encompass the efficiency of production across a given product or service we acknowledge that pb integrated water footprints will only become robust when consensus on allocation of local safe operating space to a wide range of stakeholders is determined both in terms of top down scaled pbs and bottom up local thresholds a number of studies have emerged in recent years on standardisation and harmonisation of the sos sharing allocation process across scales for examples häyhä et al 2016 and häyhä et al 2018 propose a pb operational framework that addresses the biophysical socio economic and ethical dimensions of pbs hossain et al 2017 and hossain and ifejika speranza 2020 develop a framework for seeking a safe and just operating space for regional social ecological systems zipper et al 2020 recently propose a water pb framework that could guide local water management at water basin level around political boundaries and for commercial entities all of these socio economic considerations can be incorporated in the approach presented in this paper to enhance the utility and policy relevance of the proposed exceedance and surplus indicators a range of water control variables and sub boundaries may better differentiate spatiotemporal variability of the eco hydrological regime and socio economic drivers of the water cycle gleeson et al 2020a 2020b for example water withdrawals compatible with environmental flows gerten et al 2013 spatio temporal heterogeneity differentiated river flows hoekstra et al 2012 water function based boundaries falkenmark et al 2019 local flow regulation and irrigation expansion induced water boundaries jaramillo and destouni 2015 and blue water consumption boundaries for a healthy diet and sustainable food production gerten et al 2011 a society also demands consumptive water services to support local livelihoods freshwater drinking and fisheries non consumptive water services recreational aesthetic and cultural and ecosystem resilience service coastal mangroves liu et al 2019a in this work we have adopted a bottom up approach that uses the principles of the pb framework to generate locally meaningful control variable water withdrawal and associated boundary values further research is needed to determine both local biophysical and social thresholds that delineate a safe and just operating space for human water appropriation raworth 2017 4 2 policy implications of research our findings provide new insights in terms of how demand for goods and services in chinese provinces and cities are driving the excessive withdrawal of local and global water we investigate both territorial and consumption based water withdrawal deficit and surplus against local water withdrawal planetary boundaries we focus on how pb exceeded water and surplus water are appropriated for producing certain commodities to achieve absolute sustainability of water use the opportunity cost and the impacts associated with each provincial water withdrawal and consumption differ the chinese water resource management regime the performance assessment methods for the implementation of the most stringent water resources management system set water use water use efficiency and water quality compliance targets for 31 provinces in 2015 2020 and 2030 often referred to as three red lines general office of the state council 2013 we argue our exceedance and surplus water withdrawal footprint metrics provide complementary metrics and better inform water sufficiency policy management three broad strategies apply first policy targets should encompass the difference of virtual pb exceeded and surplus water trade pattern from conventional water footprint studies we found the existing virtual water trade vwt network enable pb exceeded water flow from arid north to temperate south and this transfer is dominated by 16 5 km3 agricultural trade out of the 41 km3 weee of north china fig s3 south china in total exports only 29 km3 exceeded water out of its territory of which 8 km3 are exported to north china and 14 km3 are exported to row this pattern aligns with most chinese water footprint studies which reach the same conclusion that current vwt strategy is not effective in saving national level water resources liu et al 2019b nor mitigating north china water stress i e water scarce north china export rather than import water intensive products thus fail to conserve local water resources dalin et al 2014 feng et al 2014 guan and hubacek 2007 zhao et al 2015 2019 our findings suggest that affluent eastern provinces and coastal cities do not necessarily cause water exceedance through their imported goods and services this contrasts traditional footprint studies which often find affluence is the main driver of virtual water flow both internationally wang et al 2016 and within china zhao et al 2015 net wef importers include both rich eastern provinces and cities zhejiang shanghai and hangzhou but also most of the less developed provinces located inlands in contrast top net wef exporters or hinterlands include both rich coastal regions central coast region net trade deficit at 12 km3 north region 10 km3 and less developed northwestern provinces 13 km3 second a revised vwt network informed by exceedance and surplus water footprint metrics could help address sustainability issue that arise from the trade of water intensive commodities our findings reveal that the current situation of north china transgressing its water pbs can be largely remediated if surplus water from the south is imported virtual surplus water flows from the south to the north theoretically major net virtual surplus water providers such as the southwest region and the southern coast region can export 76 km3 and 34 km3 of surplus water china has already built intra nation south north physical water transfer projects 18 4 km3 to alleviate the water stress in north china liu et al 2013 the north region could import a further 32 km3 of net surplus water to sustain its crop production this revised vwt strategy necessitates an optimal balance between swee and weei for import dependent northern provinces preference should be given to import pathways where water stress is less concerning i e reduce their imported exceeded fraction weei wef or at least shift the weei portion from water stressed areas to water abundant areas a further shift towards importing southern surplus water is optimal southern provinces can increase their surplus water export fraction swee dsw to help alleviate water scarce northern regions importing weei meanwhile their domestic surplus water dsw can be utilised to raise their own living standards and pursue prosperity the implementation of such a vwt strategy to reduce water scarcity would naturally face distinct challenges this is because water scarcity concerns and water endowment are unlikely to be a primary driver of inter regional commodity trade amongst other more decisive factors such as availability of land resources cai et al 2020 socio economic dynamic and government policies if water from the south is to be better utilised a shared responsibility between surplus water importing and exporting provinces would need to be optimised due to the high opportunity costs of water land and labor resources in south china zhao et al 2019 argue that economic factors may limit the scope of a revised vwt network as it is more profitable for south china to use their land water and labor to yield higher economic returns while importing food from other provinces duchin and lópez morales 2019 comment that not only resource endowment but also policies e g agricultural subsidies dietary changes and technological advances across sectors e g the food and energy sectors will shape the comparative advantage of an economic entity to use water water markets and tradable water permits are thus optimisation options to encourage such shifts as they create incentives for water to be moved to higher value uses i e a shift towards labor intensive and higher valued crops such as vegetables or from agricultural to industrial water use grafton and horne 2014 the third strategy is to reduce national level water withdrawal by promoting domestic water saving in north china and increasing water productivities in south china hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 northern provinces with large dwe shall limit their water withdrawal to avoid transgressing pbs and focus on both production and demand side measures huang et al 2020 found to operate within the water pb national irrigation for grain production needs to be reduced by 18 at water scarce northern regions and that production loss can be compensated by closing yield gaps in water rich regions optimisation work shows significant water savings can be achieved if crops locations are optimised and crops are produced where the conditions are ideal and water productivity is highest davis et al 2017 west et al 2014 great caution in replacing a certain crop type is necessary as a shift may lead to a negative impact in maintaining food diversity a more foreign import dependent food trade network and become vulnerable to shocks from a food system resilience perspective kummu et al 2020 to increase water use efficiency and productivity available options include rainfed agricultural production investment better crop varieties irrigation infrastructure improvement de fraiture and wichelns 2010 technological advancements in rainfed system crop water management in irrigated systems microirrigation and in livestock systems mixed pastoral and industrial livestock grazing technologies graham et al 2018 springer and duchin 2014 at the city level eight cities are net water exceedance exporters and their trade balance is maintained at less than an absolute value of 2 km3 decision makers need to visualise the spillover impacts of their water use decisions both directly and indirectly across sectors paterson et al 2015 the former includes water resource management such as water utility provision agriculture land use appraisal agri ecological zoning water recycling flood control hadjikakou et al 2019 sørup et al 2020 the latter includes consumption pattern of water embodied goods and services equitable appropriation of local water water intensive commodities import and ecosystem service payment for instance to protect water quantity in the only surface water reservoir for beijing its neighboring hebei province convert nearly 7000 ha paddy land to dry land crop at the compensation of 1031 per ha to decrease water use zheng et al 2013 4 3 limitations as stated our primary contribution is to highlight the importance of integrating absolute sustainability thresholds into consumption based footprint indicators our water withdrawal exceedance footprint and surplus water withdrawal footprint complement existing water footprint metrics however we acknowledge that the full accounting of water footprint and an accurate depiction of human domination of the global water cycle would provide a more complete set of solutions abbott et al 2019 rainfed agricultural production in china is crucial but unaccounted for for instance virtual water embodied in rice production in heilongjiang china s largest rice exporter is 731 l kg crop compared to 963 l kg crop in jiangxi province the 3rd largest exporter however greater water use efficiency in the former province relies largely on irrigation 17 from blue water whereas the latter province is mostly rainfed and uses less blue water 9 dalin et al 2014 future research should encompass the complete water cycle including soil moisture and water quality impairment such as through green and grey water proxies and focus on water sub boundaries and control variables that may have a significant local impact but insignificant global impact e g a lake in a city zipper et al 2020 only by taking account of all other types of water stores e g atmospheric water soil moisture groundwater frozen water gleeson et al 2020a would a complete set of water supply and demand solutions and virtual water strategies become robust our sectoral water withdrawal boundaries rely on the grandfathering assumption allocation of sos from one entity to another often involves ethical choices that reflect competing socio economic interests such as inequality historic responsibility capacity to act right to development affordability and anticipated future requirements sei 2017 2018 normative criteria include a country s share in global population land area economic output economic efficiency and capacity and resource efficiency in this study sectoral economic throughput data is available but it is not an egalitarian proxy as monetary exchange does not reflect human basic needs for water muñoz and gladek 2017 future research should look into the implications of different distributive choices in deriving equitable and inclusive safe operating space lucas et al 2020 in this regard only state actors can create and design a market based approach with corrective redistribution mechanisms such as economic efficiency economic capacity and historical justice to reach economical optimum across sectors sterner et al 2019 we also acknowledge that watershed or basin level water footprint research is more policy relevant lutter et al 2016 investigated the eu water footprints using exiobase 2 2 and its associated water basin layer functions wang and zimmerman 2016 explored process based water footprints using aqueduct global maps 2 0 and gtap future research should focus on the development of gmrio databases with both political boundaries and geospatial watershed layers the usual assumptions and limitations of gmrio modelling apply for the mrio model compiled in this paper first our sub national chinese mrio model is generated by regionalising national input output tables based on non survey methods lenzen et al 2017a 2017b and employ the flegg s adjusted location quotient to set up the initial estimate flegg and webber 2000 however uncertainties arise from the flq formula to realistically reflect sub national specialisation in linking the national production structure other non survey interregional input output techniques could be used to improve the robustness of the model second although the gtap gmrio database provides a suitable resolution of agricultural sectors eight chinese provincial and city exports and imports value by crop type in monetary terms are only available in few sectors we provide the highest level of agricultural sector resolution allowed by gtap and rely on the chinese ielab regionalisation algorithms and constraint data to optimise the transaction matrices further research should focus on imposing more constraint datasets with high agricultural commodity level detail to enable a sectorally explicit assessment of the driving forces of agricultural water withdrawal 5 conclusions by comparing volumetric water footprints with water planetary boundaries at the local scale we quantify the extent of pb transgression and the proportion of safe operating space that is appropriated by final demand for goods and services at the regional and inter regional level we argue that accounting for water exceedance or surplus is one tool that will help achieve china s ambition of an ecological civilization while remaining within local water planetary boundaries a revised virtual water trade from south china to north china can help with water redistribution but would face distinct challenges due to economic factors and government policies that govern current virtual water trade it should also be noted that the translation of surplus water footprints into policy design shall follow sufficiency oriented principle in adherence to the precautionary principle water use should always be kept at minimum levels even if the water surplus footprint indicates that there is surplus water that is not appropriated water use generally comes with other impacts on energy food and other resources which also need to be minimised furthermore the calculation of surplus footprints should be dynamic and sensitive to the impacts of climate change changes in future water availability would be expected to have a significant impact in the determination of future exceedance and surplus estimates therefore the current surplus water footprint values should be seen as the very upper bound of the maximum permissible measure for total direct plus indirect water use future research should focus on the role and driver of inter regional virtual water trade in adjusting for disparities in water endowments and the significant heterogeneity in comparative advantages in local water use efficiencies and productivities across different commodities we envisage that a shift to planetary boundary integrated water footprint accounting will inform producers consumers and policy makers

17690,the water planetary boundary pb has attracted wide academic attention but empirical water footprint research that accommodates local biophysical boundaries remains scarce here we develop two novel quantitative footprint indicators the water exceedance footprint and the surplus water footprint the first measures the amount of excessive water withdrawal exceeded amount of water withdrawn against local water pbs and the latter evaluates the potential of surplus water that can be sustainably utilised amount of surplus water available within local water pbs we quantify the extent to which demand for goods and services in chinese provinces and cities are driving excessive withdrawal of local and global water resources we investigate both territorial and consumption based water withdrawal deficit and surplus against local water withdrawal pbs we also trace how pb exceeded water and surplus water are appropriated for producing certain commodities in 2015 china s domestic water exceedance reaches 101 km3 while the total water exceedance footprint is 92 km3 we find that 47 of domestic excessive water withdrawal is associated with interprovincial trade exceeded water transfers were dominated by agricultural trade from the drier north to the wetter south a revised virtual water trade network informed by exceedance and surplus water footprint metrics could help address sustainability concerns that arise from the trade of water intensive commodities our findings highlight that policy targets need to accommodate pb exceedance of both direct and virtual water use graphical abstract image 1 keywords planetary boundary transgression virtual water water exceedance footprint surplus water footprint global multi regional input output analysis trade 1 introduction absolute sustainability assumes that natural capital stocks are not substitutable and that human activities must always remain within the carrying capacity of natural capital meadows et al 1972 the idea of revisiting carrying capacity of natural capital has gained momentum in the scientific community the planetary boundaries pbs framework formulated by rockström et al 2009 and recently updated by steffen et al 2015b proposes absolute biophysical limits that delineate a safe operating space for human prosperity at the global level by quantifying collective human modifications of the earth system in the anthropocene steffen et al 2015a while the global freshwater use pb has not been exceeded many regional boundaries have been exceeded or are increasingly under threat lade et al 2019 current unsustainable patterns of freshwater use exert pressure on a number of highly stressed watersheds and basins mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 motoshita et al 2020 since 2009 absolute water pb thresholds have been proposed by the academic community bogardi et al 2013 falkenmark et al 2019 gerten et al 2013 2020 gleeson et al 2020b jaramillo and destouni 2015 the wide uptake of water footprint studies in recent years highlights their increasingly recognised policy relevance hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 hoekstra and wiedmann 2014 environmental footprints in general are becoming an indispensable dimension in analysing pb related research questions as they link global production and consumption patterns to biophysical limits häyhä et al 2016 laurent and owsianiak 2017 the key strengths of footprint studies are their ability in a world of trade to encompass all upstream environmental implications of the consumptive use of natural resources as well as to examine the inequalities and interdependencies across borders wiedmann and lenzen 2018 virtual water trade i e water scarce regions import water intensive products to conserve local water resources is seen as a measure to alleviate pressure on scarce water resources to improve overall water use efficiency and to future proof domestic water and food security hogeboom 2020 we argue that in order to enable absolute water footprinting assessment a logical and necessary step is to incorporate local water pbs into water footprint accounting it is the additional water extracted above a threshold that must be avoided from an absolute sustainability perspective as this would give rise to exceedance which significantly increases the probability of local ecological impacts gerten et al 2015 2020 gleeson et al 2020b understanding which economic sectors or commodities create water exceedance indirectly along a given supply chain is essential li et al 2019 the embodied part of the water footprint may often lead to exceedance of local water pbs somewhere far away from the point of consumption this absolute sustainability perspective conveys environmental risk in a much more explicit manner compared to conventional water footprint assessments which typically encompass water thresholds in one of two ways they either account for local water thresholds by multiplying water use with water scarcity characterisation factors in order to calculate a stress normalised measure of water use chenoweth et al 2014 iso 2014 this method is useful for seeking relatively more sustainable options based on overall scarcity contributions as determined through universally applied thresholds but does not fully encompass absolute sustainability thresholds because the degree of biophysical exceedance is not explicitly quantified liu et al 2017 ridoutt et al 2018 wang and zimmerman 2016 alternatively recent approaches also directly compare footprint results with local water thresholds in absolute terms often on a per capita basis dao et al 2018 lucas and wilting 2018 nykvist et al 2013 o neill et al 2018 this latter approach tends to be more suited to globally relevant e g carbon footprint indicators that do not require a locally specific threshold and will only provide aggregated consumption based impacts thus missing location specific impacts allocation along the supply chain and effective intervention points empirical consumption based water footprint research that measures the extent of transgression and regional allocation of the locally specific water pb control variable remains underexplored the purpose of this paper is to introduce two novel quantitative footprint indicators to evaluate the territorial withdrawal of water in relation to its local water pbs the water exceedance footprint measures the exceeded amount of water withdrawn in relation to local water pbs sensitive to the specific demand in a province or city the surplus water footprint measures the amount of surplus water available within local water pbs that can be sustainably utilised to meet the demand of a province or city the merits of using both metrics as a complementary tool to the conventional water footprint support the reconciliation of sustainable appropriation of water resources within biophysical boundaries these novel indicators offer a new lens to explore how pb exceeded and surplus water are appropriated and allow comparisons across key commodities and geographical areas we use china as a case study as its sub national level water availability is highly uneven seasonal and vulnerable to climate change feng et al 2019 li et al 2015 piao et al 2010 within a nation production in resource scarce regions can be redistributed to avoid the transgression of local pbs huang et al 2020 while ensuring social equity and economic efficiency at the national level a localised evaluation of the extent of transgression at a much greater spatial resolution is necessary northern china is highly water stressed with only 18 of the nation s freshwater resources whereas the south by contrast is relatively water abundant with most runoff wasted through flooding and some significant water quality issues guan et al 2014 liu and yang 2012 china has a per capita water availability of 2100 m3 cap only 28 of the global average cai et al 2020 the north china plain a major food basket region and home to 200 million people only has a per capita water availability of less than 150 m3 year liu et al 2013 outsourcing of increasing food water and energy demand from major centers of consumption appears to exacerbate water stress elsewhere for instance the jing jin ji area zhao et al 2017 zheng et al 2019 the greater bay area chen et al 2019 and the yangtze river delta zhao et al 2016 continuing development of provinces and mega cities may be hampered by water stress risks in their supplying hinterlands and overconsumption by a growing middle class may further exacerbate their vulnerabilities liao et al 2020 qu et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a the role of virtual water trade in redistributing scarce water resources within china is not always effective in particular due to the consumption disparities between east china and west china as well as a mismatch of arable land and water between arid north china and temperate south china feng et al 2014 guan and hubacek 2007 zhao et al 2015 most interprovincial water footprint studies find that affluent eastern provinces and coastal cities in addition to their significant local domestic water use are typically net virtual water importers from other often water scarce northern and western provinces liu et al 2020 meanwhile irrigation intensive provinces in the drier north tend to export agricultural products to relatively wetter south regions where crop production is predominantly rainfed dalin et al 2014 internationally china is a net virtual water importer for agricultural products 25 km3 but net virtual water exporter if both agricultural and industrial products are considered 47 km3 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 wang and zimmerman 2016 in this paper we demonstrate how novel pb integrated water footprint indicators can be used to address ongoing challenges for water conservation policy in china these quantitative footprint indicators link pbs at various scales to final consumption and quantify the magnitude and spatial extent required for water exceedance mitigation using the newly developed indicators we further explore how pb informed virtual water trade can effectively redistribute resources within biophysical boundaries therefore achieving absolute water sustainability 2 material and method 2 1 defining two novel water footprint indicators we follow li et al 2019 s exceedance concept to define our water extensions territorially an over withdrawal of water that exceeds the local water pb can be defined as domestic water exceedance dwe i e water withdrawal subtracted by local water pb see graphical abstract dwe is measured in km3 for example if the water withdrawal of the paddy rice sector in jiangsu is 18 2 km3 and the local water pb is 9 3 km3 then the dwe of this sector is 8 9 km3 from a consumption perspective we define the term water exceedance footprint wef of a province or city as the amount of global dwe that can be allocated to the final demand of that province or city the wef is made up of some of the province or city s own dwe that remains in the environment of that province or city rwe and dwe of other provinces cities and countries that is virtually imported water exceedance embodied in imports weei some of the dwe becomes virtually embodied in exports to meet consumption elsewhere water exceedance embodied in exports weee we also define a domestic surplus water dsw concept for countries and regions where local water pb has not been exceeded i e local water pb subtracted by water withdrawal dsw is measured in km3 for example if the water withdrawal of the paddy rice sector in guangdong is 18 km3 and the local water pb is 36 5 km3 then the dsw of this sector is 18 5 km3 from a consumption perspective we define the surplus water footprint swf of a province or city as the amount of global dsw that can be sustainably utilised to meet the demand of this province or city without transgressing territorial boundaries for instance of the 28 7 km3 of guangdong s total dsw 23 7 km3 can become virtually embodied in exports to meet consumption elsewhere surplus water embodied in exports swee 4 9 km3 remains in guangdong remaining surplus water rsw guangdong also imports an additional 7 9 km3 of virtual surplus water surplus water embodied in imports swei to meet its demand 2 2 deriving mrio tables we construct a novel global multi regional input output gmrio framework with 10 chinese mega cities 27 chinese provinces and 139 countries and regions worldwide for the year 2015 this is developed by linking a subnational chinese mrio table from industrial ecology virtual laboratory ielab www ielab info lenzen et al 2014 2017a with the global mrio table from gtap v10 aguiar et al 2019 the original gtap v10 model features 65 sectors among 141 countries and regions aguiar et al 2019 we adapt it into 140 countries and regions merging tajikistan into rest of former soviet union and 57 sector resolution as in gtap v9 model 2011 for analytical purpose the model is then updated from year 2014 to year 2015 by adjusting final demand we follow the analytical approach of malik et al 2014 to upscale and assume that all final demand of each country for 2015 grew in line with the national gross domestic product gdp the 2015 gdp growth rate for 140 countries and regions obtained from the world bank is used to adjust the gtap mrio table into year 2015 wb 2015 the analysis concentrates on the top 10 mega cities with a combined population of over 85 million namely shanghai beijing guangzhou shenzhen tianjin chongqing wuhan nanjing chengdu and hangzhou the emphasis on these selected mega cities is decided because it is relevant to china s aim to develop three mega city clusters namely the jing jin ji the yangtze river delta and the greater bay area with a population of 20 of the nation and accounting for 40 of the national gdp national bureau of statistics 2015 the sub national chinese mrio model is generated from the china ielab following the methodology of wang 2017 we choose 27 provinces and 10 cities from the root classification 2874 chinese counties and 396 economic sectors to form the sub national matrices by root to base concordance matrices this initial estimate is constructed based on non survey methods lenzen et al 2017a 2017b and features 396 economic sectors and five final demand categories including rural household consumption urban household consumption government consumption fixed capital formation and changes in inventories we follow lenzen et al 2012 s approach to aggregate the 396 sectors into 57 sectors as in gtap sector classification see supplementary materials for the concordance matrix to align with the commodity by commodity format in gtap the model is transformed from a multi regional supply use mr su table type using eurostat model b i e following the industry technology assumption each industry has its own specific way of production irrespective of its product mix european commission 2008 the integration of the sub national chinese mrio model into the global gtap mrio model is achieved by nesting based on the methodology developed for constructing nested mrios described elsewhere wang et al 2017 the model assumes that international exports and imports of a sector in a province or a city are distributed to all foreign countries in the same proportion as the nation s exports and imports of the sector two types of constraint data are imposed to refine and optimise the initial estimate the first is the 2015 china customs dataset which contains corporate level product exports and imports in monetary terms it features 8000 commodity types and more than 200 economies of origin or destination at a highly disaggregated level totaling to 14 52 million data items china customs statistics 2015 the second is the incoming and outgoing trade between 37 chinese provinces and cities in relation to other nations from national bureau of statistics of china national bureau of statistics 2016 see fig s1 in supporting information 2 3 deriving mrio extensions for exceeded water and surplus water we refer to water withdrawal as the quantity of water distributed to users including water lost in transmission henceforth we use the term water footprint to refer to the footprint of water withdrawal for chinese agricultural sectors total provincial and city water withdrawal data are obtained from 37 provincial and city china water resources bulletin 2016 provincial water resources bureau 2015 with regard to sector allocation the provincial or city level water withdrawal is distributed according to eight agricultural commodity sectors in gtap v9 the distributional principle is the water consumption per crop production mekonnen and hoekstra 2010 and actual crop production in each province national bureau of statistics 2016 for chinese 43 industrial sectors provincial and city water withdrawal data are obtained directly from zhang et al 2020b city sector allocation follows the provincial allocation the global water withdrawal data for each sector in 2015 is directly generated from global mrio lab using the gtap configuration lenzen et al 2017a we use the total water withdrawal extension that is extrapolated directly from aquastat see water extensions withdrawal in supplementary materials provincial and city water availability are obtained from 37 provincial and city china water resources bulletins 2015 provincial water resources bureau 2015 global water availability is retrieved from the aquastat database from the food and agriculture organization fao 2020 provincial water withdrawal and availability extensions do not include those from the cities themselves there are few studies focusing on defining and operationalising the water pb at economic sectoral levels pb practitioners either focus on local water pbs at basin level bogardi et al 2013 falkenmark et al 2019 gerten et al 2013 gleeson et al 2020b jaramillo and destouni 2015 steffen et al 2015b or use less stringent bottom up local water pbs that do not relate directly to global boundaries such as lake water levels dearing et al 2014 and regulated instream flows to sustain ecological functioning cole et al 2014 similar to huang et al 2020 s approach of using a water stress index of 0 5 as a proxy for the local water consumption pb pfister et al 2009 we adopt the concept of a water scarcity indicator to define a local water pb relative to withdrawals a number of water scarcity indicators have been developed including the water availability indicator ratio of water withdrawal to annual renewable freshwater the falkenmark indicator per capita water availability the aware indicator and the quantity quality environmental flow requirement ratios liu et al 2017 adopting the widely accepted withdrawals to availability w t a threshold of 40 originally defined by alcamo and henrichs 2002 as indicative of severe water stress we set local water pbs as a w t a of 40 this threshold applies for all nations provinces and cities these local water pbs are distributed to 57 sectors using grandfathering as the downscaling principle grandfathering is a right based approach that allocates global pbs based on current shares of environmental pressure lucas et al 2020 the share of the local water pbs available for a sector is calculated based on its relative contribution to the total water withdrawal in 2015 see water local pbs in supplementary materials section 4 1 and 4 3 for a discussion on the uncertainty associated with the determination of the boundaries 2 4 water exceedance footprint and surplus water footprint calculation wef and swf are calculated as follows 1 we f n m n d w e x 1 ˆ i a 1 y n ˆ 2 sw f n m n d s w x 1 ˆ i a 1 y n ˆ where w e f n is a water exceedance map specific to one province or city n m n d w e x 1 ˆ is the diagonalised vector

map specific to one province or city n m n d s w x 1 ˆ is the diagonalised vector of direct surplus water intensities calculated as the product of a vector of the amount of surplus water available within local water pbs and the inverse matrix x 1 of diagonalised total industry output i is an identity matrix with ones on the diagonal and zeroes elsewhere a is the technology coefficient matrix calculated as the product of the input output transaction matrix t and the inverse matrix x 1 of diagonalised total industry output y n ˆ is a 10 089 1 vector of total final demand for a city province or country n which has been diagonalised note that the wef and swf for each province or city n can only be calculated once at a time 3 results 3 1 provincial and city wef and swf in china china s domestic water exceedance in 2015 reach 101 km3 while the water exceedance footprint is 92 km3 fig 1 a foreign export accounts for 26 of the national dwe and foreign import accounts for 18 of the national total wef rwe amounts to 28 km3 all provinces and cities compromise the water sustainability of other provinces or nations by significantly products and services causing local water exceedance shaded in orange bars fig 1a of the 65 km3 weei 77 51 km3 are imported from water stressed provinces and countries w t a 0 4 of the top eight wef consumers who import exclusively from water stressed areas henan hebei shandong and shanxi are typical major crop producers in north china plain the remaining four xinjiang and liaoning are also characterised with intensive agricultural export orientation whereas jiangsu and guangdong are wealthy manufacturing product export oriented provinces of the 73 km3 weee 34 25 km3 shaded in yellow bars and 66 48 km3 are exported to water stressed and abundant provinces and countries respectively this implies one third of chinese exceeded water is exported to alleviate the water stress areas meanwhile two thirds of the weee are ultimately consumed by water abundant provinces and countries there are 27 provinces and cities that do not over withdraw water within their own territory that is their water use does not exceed 40 of their water availability if measured in territorial perspective for instance guangdong zhejiang hangzhou and chongqing fall in the absolute water sustainable category however they import and consumer goods and services with embodied water exceedance from a consumption perspective they still contribute significantly to the transgression of local water pbs elsewhere at the city level the 10 mega cities accounts for 8 of the national population and 22 of the national gdp in comparison their dwe with a range of 0 3 km3 and wef with a range of 0 2 1 8 km3 are at 16 and 9 7 of the national total respectively from an equal per capita perspective their wef far exceeds their share of safe operating space 8 it is worth pointing out that a few cities exceed some provinces in terms of wef and dwe for instance shanghai ranks 17th and outranks hubei heilongjiang sichuan and fujian of the 10 cities shanghai and chongqing have the highest wef 1 4 1 9 km3 other cities show wef levels of around 0 6 1 2 km3 e g beijing guangzhou hangzhou with shenzhen at the lower end of 0 3 km3 china domestic surplus water is 388 km3 with the surplus water footprint at 319 km3 fig 1b in 2015 dsw and swf of a given province range from 2 to 40 km3 foreign export accounts for 11 of the national swe and foreign import account for 3 of the national total swf of the 275 km3 surplus water embodied in exports 29

scale around 10 km3 chongqing and hangzhou are the only cities that have surplus water 9 km3 and 5 km3 guangxi and sichuan have approximately 18 km3 remaining surplus water to sustain territorially and hunan jiangxi and guizhou have 10 km3 abundant water resources in some provinces can be further utilised sustainably to support the economic development of others there are eight provinces that are able to provide additional water to support others at a scale larger than 20 km3 namely guangdong 24 km3 guangxi 39 km3 zhejiang 20 km3 hunan 24 km3 jiangxi 33 km3 sichuan 27 km3 guizhou 20 km3 fujian 23 km3 these are exclusively water abundant provinces with an annual average water availability of 1153 2434 km3 compared to the national average of 666 km3 3 2 interprovincial virtual water flow net trade deficit of virtual pb exceeded water of a given province is shown in fig 2 a dwe wef net wef importers have an increased share of responsibility than net wef exporters the top net wef exporters spans less than 12 km3 shades in yellow and are either located in north china plain such as shandong 5 km3 and hebei 4 km3 agricultural product exporting provinces such as xinjiang 11 km3 ningxia 4 km3 and manufacturing product exporting province such as jiangsu 12 km3 net wef importers have a net trade deficit range from 0 to 4 km3 if aggregated to the economic zone level net virtual pb exceeded water largely flows from three hinterlands the northwest region 13 km3 the central coast region 11 km3 and the north region 10 km3 fig 2b the net importing economic zones are the southwest region receive 11 km3 the central region receive 8 km3 the southern coast region and the northeastern region have relative balanced net trade deficit at only 3 km3 this pattern implies that goods and services consumed by most regions come at the cost of water exceedance in the hinterland regions the three hinterlands contribute to 86 of the dwe for vegetables fruits and nuts production 74 of the dwe used for national wheat production 40 of the dwe used for national paddy rice production and accounts for 69 of national nonfood manufactured products production fig 3 net trade deficit of virtual

each province and city on average 2 km3 by 5 times meanwhile virtual pb exceeded water flow from drier north china to wetter south china while the largest virtual surplus water flow the opposite direction this implies that the current situation of north china transgressing its water boundaries can be largely remediated if surplus south water is better utilised 3 3 commodity level dwe and wef within china the reallocation of pb exceeded water from primary crop sectors to secondary and tertiary industries is apparent fig 3h from a production based point of view pb exceeded water occurs predominantly in wheat 40 of the dwe paddy rice 19 nonfood manufactured products 16 vegetables fruit and nuts 7 commercial and public services 6 cereal grains 3 plant based fibers 3 and electricity 3 in contrast virtual pb exceeded water flows into non food sectors and tends to be finally consumed by commercial and public services 27 of the wef processed food and beverages 16 nonfood manufactured products 12 wheat paddy rice vegetables fruit and nuts still account for 19 9 and 7 of the wef respectively most water is directly consumed by primary crops and embedded in processed food and non food products for export we observe significant differences of pb exceeded water withdrawn and its consumption across commodities between economic zones among the hinterland regions the northwestern region fig 3f use 28 km3 pb exceeded water to produce paddy rice wheat cereal grains vegetables fruits and nuts plant based fibers oil and seeds in which 18 km3 are exported in the north region fig 3a 16 km3 is used to produce wheat and 12 km3 is exported wheat sector accounts for 64 of its total withdrawal in contrast the central coast region fig 3b use 9 km3 to produce non food manufactured products and 12 km3 for crop production among the net pb exceeded water importing regions the central and southwest region fig 3d and g import more than 10 km3 to meet its secondary and tertiary sector demand the southern coast region and the northeastern region fig 3c and e export less than 3 km3 of crop production and import less than 4 km3 to meet its industrial demand 3 4 regional wef disparities our results show the weee dwe ratios range from 60 to 100 and the weei wef exhibits a varying ratio from 18 to 100 fig 4 a this suggests a highly interconnected and intertwined water intensive commodity trade structure within china more than half of territorial pb exceeded is exported elsewhere most cities except for chengdu and wuhan sit at the upper right corner in the high export range 85 weee dwe 100 and high import range 70 weei wef 100 they exhibit a high reliance on import with significant export oriented industries the self reliance ratio dwe wef measures the magnitude of territorial water exceedance over their wef dwe of yellow upper left provinces is smaller than their wef 1 due to significant water outsourcing activities they are import dependent countries who compromise the absolute water sustainability of other provinces ethically they will have to take major or increasing responsibility from a consumption based point of view these include jilin shanxi and henan the beige provinces are self reliant as their water exceedance seems to commensurate with their wef the light red and dark red provinces are exporting oriented provinces and extremely compromised dwe wef 2 as their water exceedances are at least two times larger than their water footprints this category includes jiangsu the biggest non food manufactured products exporting provinces xinjiang the biggest agricultural product exporting provinces wuhan chengdu and nanjing the swee dsw ratios range from 60 to 100 and the swei swf exhibit a varying ratio from 10 to 100 fig 4b inner mongolia shaanxi heilongjiang and anhui shaded in dark green have an importing trade structure that can import a high portion of surplus water 80 of their swf to meet its demand provinces whose dsw are less than 2 times than their water footprints shaded in light green have a trade structure the can moderately import surplus water 20 60 of their swf guangdong fujian jiangxi guizhou guangxi and qinghai shaded in blue are characterised with a dsw at least 2 times higher than their surplus water footprints their current trade structure could thus enable them to export 65 85 of their abundant surplus water to generate economic multipliers and help with the nation s food security 4 discussion 4 1 advances in planetary boundary integrated footprint indicators the global water pb delineates a safe operating space for collective human modifications of the water cycle but the challenge is to translate the global water pb framework to local scales at which water management and governance occurs our paper directly addresses this gap by introducing two novel quantitative footprint indicators to contextualise the water pb framework at sub national scale following li et al 2019 s appraisal of global phosphorus exceedance footprint this study developed a similar water exceedance footprint to measure the impacts of excessive water withdrawal exceeded amount of water withdrawn against local water pbs we also introduce a footprint indicator that evaluates the potential of surplus water i e the proportion of territorial safe operating space sos that can be utilised to sustain human well being our water surplus footprint results can inform decision makers with respect to the remaining sos to satisfy local demand to sustainably supply and consume from others while staying within biophysical boundaries the water exceedance and surplus footprints advance current knowledge on how the existing virtual water trade structure can become more sustainable the appeal of these indicators is that they can inform demand side solutions provide alternative view on consumption based responsibility allocation and reconcile trade offs between multi scalar sustainability goals lucas and wilting 2018 decision makers can visualise which regions are consuming commodities that embody scarce water along the supply chain as well as how a sustainably sourced amount of surplus water can potentially be harnessed or imported to satisfy domestic demand precautionary principle should still be respected when considering the use of surplus water footprints cai et al 2020 d odorico et al 2018 van vuuren et al 2019 environmental pressure should be minimised and the use of surplus water needs to adhere to other important constraints such as equity parrique et al 2019 teixidó figueras et al 2016 motoshita et al 2020 recently found a 19 of total freshwater consumption is characterised as superfluous consumption or overconsumption beyond basic human needs another important consideration is that surplus water should not encourage water use inefficiency or profligacy any consideration for re allocation of water use must also encompass the efficiency of production across a given product or service we acknowledge that pb integrated water footprints will only become robust when consensus on allocation of local safe operating space to a wide range of stakeholders is determined both in terms of top down scaled pbs and bottom up local thresholds a number of studies have emerged in recent years on standardisation and harmonisation of the sos sharing allocation process across scales for examples häyhä et al 2016 and häyhä et al 2018 propose a pb operational framework that addresses the biophysical socio economic and ethical dimensions of pbs hossain et al 2017 and hossain and ifejika speranza 2020 develop a framework for seeking a safe and just operating space for regional social ecological systems zipper et al 2020 recently propose a water pb framework that could guide local water management at water basin level around political boundaries and for commercial entities all of these socio economic considerations can be incorporated in the approach presented in this paper to enhance the utility and policy relevance of the proposed exceedance and surplus indicators a range of water control variables and sub boundaries may better differentiate spatiotemporal variability of the eco hydrological regime and socio economic drivers of the water cycle gleeson et al 2020a 2020b for example water withdrawals compatible with environmental flows gerten et al 2013 spatio temporal heterogeneity differentiated river flows hoekstra et al 2012 water function based boundaries falkenmark et al 2019 local flow regulation and irrigation expansion induced water boundaries jaramillo and destouni 2015 and blue water consumption boundaries for a healthy diet and sustainable food production gerten et al 2011 a society also demands consumptive water services to support local livelihoods freshwater drinking and fisheries non consumptive water services recreational aesthetic and cultural and ecosystem resilience service coastal mangroves liu et al 2019a in this work we have adopted a bottom up approach that uses the principles of the pb framework to generate locally meaningful control variable water withdrawal and associated boundary values further research is needed to determine both local biophysical and social thresholds that delineate a safe and just operating space for human water appropriation raworth 2017 4 2 policy implications of research our findings provide new insights in terms of how demand for goods and services in chinese provinces and cities are driving the excessive withdrawal of local and global water we investigate both territorial and consumption based water withdrawal deficit and surplus against local water withdrawal planetary boundaries we focus on how pb exceeded water and surplus water are appropriated for producing certain commodities to achieve absolute sustainability of water use the opportunity cost and the impacts associated with each provincial water withdrawal and consumption differ the chinese water resource management regime the performance assessment methods for the implementation of the most stringent water resources management system set water use water use efficiency and water quality compliance targets for 31 provinces in 2015 2020 and 2030 often referred to as three red lines general office of the state council 2013 we argue our exceedance and surplus water withdrawal footprint metrics provide complementary metrics and better inform water sufficiency policy management three broad strategies apply first policy targets should encompass the difference of virtual pb exceeded and surplus water trade pattern from conventional water footprint studies we found the existing virtual water trade vwt network enable pb exceeded water flow from arid north to temperate south and this transfer is dominated by 16 5 km3 agricultural trade out of the 41 km3 weee of north china fig s3 south china in total exports only 29 km3 exceeded water out of its territory of which 8 km3 are exported to north china and 14 km3 are exported to row this pattern aligns with most chinese water footprint studies which reach the same conclusion that current vwt strategy is not effective in saving national level water resources liu et al 2019b nor mitigating north china water stress i e water scarce north china export rather than import water intensive products thus fail to conserve local water resources dalin et al 2014 feng et al 2014 guan and hubacek 2007 zhao et al 2015 2019 our findings suggest that affluent eastern provinces and coastal cities do not necessarily cause water exceedance through their imported goods and services this contrasts traditional footprint studies which often find affluence is the main driver of virtual water flow both internationally wang et al 2016 and within china zhao et al 2015 net wef importers include both rich eastern provinces and cities zhejiang shanghai and hangzhou but also most of the less developed provinces located inlands in contrast top net wef exporters or hinterlands include both rich coastal regions central coast region net trade deficit at 12 km3 north region 10 km3 and less developed northwestern provinces 13 km3 second a revised vwt network informed by exceedance and surplus water footprint metrics could help address sustainability issue that arise from the trade of water intensive commodities our findings reveal that the current situation of north china transgressing its water pbs can be largely remediated if surplus water from the south is imported virtual surplus water flows from the south to the north theoretically major net virtual surplus water providers such as the southwest region and the southern coast region can export 76 km3 and 34 km3 of surplus water china has already built intra nation south north physical water transfer projects 18 4 km3 to alleviate the water stress in north china liu et al 2013 the north region could import a further 32 km3 of net surplus water to sustain its crop production this revised vwt strategy necessitates an optimal balance between swee and weei for import dependent northern provinces preference should be given to import pathways where water stress is less concerning i e reduce their imported exceeded fraction weei wef or at least shift the weei portion from water stressed areas to water abundant areas a further shift towards importing southern surplus water is optimal southern provinces can increase their surplus water export fraction swee dsw to help alleviate water scarce northern regions importing weei meanwhile their domestic surplus water dsw can be utilised to raise their own living standards and pursue prosperity the implementation of such a vwt strategy to reduce water scarcity would naturally face distinct challenges this is because water scarcity concerns and water endowment are unlikely to be a primary driver of inter regional commodity trade amongst other more decisive factors such as availability of land resources cai et al 2020 socio economic dynamic and government policies if water from the south is to be better utilised a shared responsibility between surplus water importing and exporting provinces would need to be optimised due to the high opportunity costs of water land and labor resources in south china zhao et al 2019 argue that economic factors may limit the scope of a revised vwt network as it is more profitable for south china to use their land water and labor to yield higher economic returns while importing food from other provinces duchin and lópez morales 2019 comment that not only resource endowment but also policies e g agricultural subsidies dietary changes and technological advances across sectors e g the food and energy sectors will shape the comparative advantage of an economic entity to use water water markets and tradable water permits are thus optimisation options to encourage such shifts as they create incentives for water to be moved to higher value uses i e a shift towards labor intensive and higher valued crops such as vegetables or from agricultural to industrial water use grafton and horne 2014 the third strategy is to reduce national level water withdrawal by promoting domestic water saving in north china and increasing water productivities in south china hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 northern provinces with large dwe shall limit their water withdrawal to avoid transgressing pbs and focus on both production and demand side measures huang et al 2020 found to operate within the water pb national irrigation for grain production needs to be reduced by 18 at water scarce northern regions and that production loss can be compensated by closing yield gaps in water rich regions optimisation work shows significant water savings can be achieved if crops locations are optimised and crops are produced where the conditions are ideal and water productivity is highest davis et al 2017 west et al 2014 great caution in replacing a certain crop type is necessary as a shift may lead to a negative impact in maintaining food diversity a more foreign import dependent food trade network and become vulnerable to shocks from a food system resilience perspective kummu et al 2020 to increase water use efficiency and productivity available options include rainfed agricultural production investment better crop varieties irrigation infrastructure improvement de fraiture and wichelns 2010 technological advancements in rainfed system crop water management in irrigated systems microirrigation and in livestock systems mixed pastoral and industrial livestock grazing technologies graham et al 2018 springer and duchin 2014 at the city level eight cities are net water exceedance exporters and their trade balance is maintained at less than an absolute value of 2 km3 decision makers need to visualise the spillover impacts of their water use decisions both directly and indirectly across sectors paterson et al 2015 the former includes water resource management such as water utility provision agriculture land use appraisal agri ecological zoning water recycling flood control hadjikakou et al 2019 sørup et al 2020 the latter includes consumption pattern of water embodied goods and services equitable appropriation of local water water intensive commodities import and ecosystem service payment for instance to protect water quantity in the only surface water reservoir for beijing its neighboring hebei province convert nearly 7000 ha paddy land to dry land crop at the compensation of 1031 per ha to decrease water use zheng et al 2013 4 3 limitations as stated our primary contribution is to highlight the importance of integrating absolute sustainability thresholds into consumption based footprint indicators our water withdrawal exceedance footprint and surplus water withdrawal footprint complement existing water footprint metrics however we acknowledge that the full accounting of water footprint and an accurate depiction of human domination of the global water cycle would provide a more complete set of solutions abbott et al 2019 rainfed agricultural production in china is crucial but unaccounted for for instance virtual water embodied in rice production in heilongjiang china s largest rice exporter is 731 l kg crop compared to 963 l kg crop in jiangxi province the 3rd largest exporter however greater water use efficiency in the former province relies largely on irrigation 17 from blue water whereas the latter province is mostly rainfed and uses less blue water 9 dalin et al 2014 future research should encompass the complete water cycle including soil moisture and water quality impairment such as through green and grey water proxies and focus on water sub boundaries and control variables that may have a significant local impact but insignificant global impact e g a lake in a city zipper et al 2020 only by taking account of all other types of water stores e g atmospheric water soil moisture groundwater frozen water gleeson et al 2020a would a complete set of water supply and demand solutions and virtual water strategies become robust our sectoral water withdrawal boundaries rely on the grandfathering assumption allocation of sos from one entity to another often involves ethical choices that reflect competing socio economic interests such as inequality historic responsibility capacity to act right to development affordability and anticipated future requirements sei 2017 2018 normative criteria include a country s share in global population land area economic output economic efficiency and capacity and resource efficiency in this study sectoral economic throughput data is available but it is not an egalitarian proxy as monetary exchange does not reflect human basic needs for water muñoz and gladek 2017 future research should look into the implications of different distributive choices in deriving equitable and inclusive safe operating space lucas et al 2020 in this regard only state actors can create and design a market based approach with corrective redistribution mechanisms such as economic efficiency economic capacity and historical justice to reach economical optimum across sectors sterner et al 2019 we also acknowledge that watershed or basin level water footprint research is more policy relevant lutter et al 2016 investigated the eu water footprints using exiobase 2 2 and its associated water basin layer functions wang and zimmerman 2016 explored process based water footprints using aqueduct global maps 2 0 and gtap future research should focus on the development of gmrio databases with both political boundaries and geospatial watershed layers the usual assumptions and limitations of gmrio modelling apply for the mrio model compiled in this paper first our sub national chinese mrio model is generated by regionalising national input output tables based on non survey methods lenzen et al 2017a 2017b and employ the flegg s adjusted location quotient to set up the initial estimate flegg and webber 2000 however uncertainties arise from the flq formula to realistically reflect sub national specialisation in linking the national production structure other non survey interregional input output techniques could be used to improve the robustness of the model second although the gtap gmrio database provides a suitable resolution of agricultural sectors eight chinese provincial and city exports and imports value by crop type in monetary terms are only available in few sectors we provide the highest level of agricultural sector resolution allowed by gtap and rely on the chinese ielab regionalisation algorithms and constraint data to optimise the transaction matrices further research should focus on imposing more constraint datasets with high agricultural commodity level detail to enable a sectorally explicit assessment of the driving forces of agricultural water withdrawal 5 conclusions by comparing volumetric water footprints with water planetary boundaries at the local scale we quantify the extent of pb transgression and the proportion of safe operating space that is appropriated by final demand for goods and services at the regional and inter regional level we argue that accounting for water exceedance or surplus is one tool that will help achieve china s ambition of an ecological civilization while remaining within local water planetary boundaries a revised virtual water trade from south china to north china can help with water redistribution but would face distinct challenges due to economic factors and government policies that govern current virtual water trade it should also be noted that the translation of surplus water footprints into policy design shall follow sufficiency oriented principle in adherence to the precautionary principle water use should always be kept at minimum levels even if the water surplus footprint indicates that there is surplus water that is not appropriated water use generally comes with other impacts on energy food and other resources which also need to be minimised furthermore the calculation of surplus footprints should be dynamic and sensitive to the impacts of climate change changes in future water availability would be expected to have a significant impact in the determination of future exceedance and surplus estimates therefore the current surplus water footprint values should be seen as the very upper bound of the maximum permissible measure for total direct plus indirect water use future research should focus on the role and driver of inter regional virtual water trade in adjusting for disparities in water endowments and the significant heterogeneity in comparative advantages in local water use efficiencies and productivities across different commodities we envisage that a shift to planetary boundary integrated water footprint accounting will inform producers consumers and policy makers

17691,many cities are confronted with both water scarcity and urban flooding as centralized water infrastructures becoming increasingly inadequate in a changing climate decentralized infrastructures like rainwater harvesting rwh can ease both issues yet most studies find rwh offers limited infrastructure capacity at high cost previous assessments however fail to consider two critical advantages multi functionality and high adaptability by improving the incorporation of these advantages in our analysis of 1 06 million buildings with distinct design and water demand characteristics and 20 year hourly precipitation records in new york city nyc we demonstrate contrary to existing studies that strategically designed financed and implemented rooftop rwh systems in all or a subset of the buildings can meet large scale infrastructure development needs for water supply and stormwater management rwh implementation featuring public private partnerships ppp in 43 96 of the buildings can serve 17 29 of the city s non drinking water demands while reducing the public expenditure per unit of water supply by 13 85 the distributed citywide rwh implementations prevent 35 56 of rooftop runoff from entering the sewage system rivers and or waterways per month with observed rooftop runoff reductions as high as 90 for a single rain event graphical abstract image 1 keywords rainwater harvesting infrastructure decentralization data driven analysis public private partnership ppp 1 introduction global urbanization and climate change present an urgent need to develop more efficient and sustainable urban water systems worldwide nations 2019 by 2050 due to increases in urban population and wealth global urban water demand is expected to grow by 80 florke et al 2018 additionally climate change will lead to more extreme events such as floods and droughts across the world thereby further stressing current water and non water infrastructure stott 2016 sustainable urban water system research concentrates on low and middle income countries yet cities in high income countries also face analogous albeit different challenges in most high income countries drinking water treatment and delivery systems are aging and decaying while critical maintenance and repairs are backlogged or neglected posing great health risks comparable to the 2004 surprise lead contamination in washington d c s water supply renner 2004 and more recently problems of dilapidated water infrastructure exacerbated by climate change and population growth in london cooper 2019 moreover drinking water systems are under pressure to comply with more stringent water quality standards and newly identified contaminants of concern to safeguard human health cañedo argüelles et al 2016 rosario ortiz et al 2016 as an example the european parliament regularly reviews and updates the eu water directives like the enforced eu water quality standards applicable to surface water that recently added pharmaceuticals to a new watch list european union 2018 rainwater harvesting rwh is a viable but contested strategy for simultaneously addressing various water related challenges unlike existing urban water infrastructures that are centralized and single purpose a rwh system is a decentralized multifunctional infrastructure that augments water supplies substitutes high quality drinking water used for non drinking purposes and reduces stormwater runoff a major source of flooding and water pollution in cities worldwide campisano et al 2017 rwh s positive performance measured against various water supply and runoff reduction indicators is well supported basinger et al 2010 ennenbach et al 2018 jones and hunt 2010 rostad et al 2016 ward et al 2012 zhang et al 2009 some studies also highlight rwh s ability to abate water quality impairments in cities serviced by a combined sewer system css where untreated runoff sewage mixtures overflow into rivers or waterways during periods of high precipitation basinger et al 2010 gwenzi and nyamadzawo 2014 wang and zimmerman 2015 still most existing studies find that rwh promises low water supply potential with unit costs higher than centralized water supply basinger et al 2010 farreny et al 2011 roebuck et al 2011 as a result rwh s ability to improve urban water systems has been challenged the unfavorable assessments of rwh however are derived without fairly incorporating the critical advantages of decentralized infrastructure multi functionality and adaptability most economic assessments of water related infrastructures implicitly assume a single utility such as water provision boers and benasher 1982 farreny et al 2011 roebuck et al 2011 vieira et al 2014 this single utility approach works well for conventional one purpose infrastructure but underestimates the benefits realized by alternatives serving more than one infrastructure need such as rwh the neglect of rwh s high adaptability is more nuanced first existing large scale rwh studies are based on a one size rwh configuration and assume non discriminative all building implementation in a city rostad et al 2016 or country ennenbach et al 2018 however rwh system performance is contingent on the sizing of rainwater tanks imteaz et al 2011 jones and hunt 2010 wang and zimmerman 2015 and water demand patterns in buildings basinger et al 2010 environment agency 2010 retamal et al 2009 that is the performance of citywide rwh implementation can be improved by strategically sizing the rainwater tanks by building class and by targeting the buildings with good rwh performances rwh s customizability of size cost and design for individual buildings is not possible for centralized infrastructure systems further the high customizability and its decentralized nature allow rwh systems with different design and cost characteristics to be flexibly bundled to meet impending infrastructure expansion needs at a range of scales the advantages also enable rwh implementations to be highly adaptable to the different priorities of public funds e g societal benefits and private funds e g return on investment maximizing the socio economic value of capital investment against this background we examine the performance of large scale rwh implementation by more fairly incorporating its critical advantages of multi functionality and high adaptability to do so our research improves existing literature in a few respects we model citywide rwh with unprecedented spatial detail considering 1 06 million buildings with distinct design and water demand characteristics in new york city nyc based on the large and diverse building stock we present to the best of our knowledge the most consistent assessment of rwh s water saving efficiency and financial aspects by building class more crucially with the building level results we are able to identify precise implementation and funding strategies that lift the financial performance of large scale rwh implementations potentially beyond that of the centralized alternative for the first time we reveal the potential and the importance of public private partnerships ppp in improving the cost effectiveness of large scale rwh implementations the paper proceeds as follows first we introduce the method and data sources in detail next we present the assessments based on rwh implementation in all 1 06 million buildings under two primary design criteria each rwh system is sized to achieve maximum rainwater yield scenario 1 s1 or maximum benefit cost ratio scenario 2 s2 then we present a range of strategic implementation scenarios in which rwh in a subset of buildings is implemented under different ppp funding schemes 2 material and methods 2 1 research context 2 1 1 study area this rwh research was conducted in new york city nyc because of the complexity of the area the dedication of nyc to urban sustainability specifically in stormwater management practices nyc 2010 and the availability of data especially a rich building dataset nyc s intense economic activity dense population and high imperviousness show the necessity and difficulty of water management nyc comprises 1 06 million buildings fig 1 left and a population of over 8 million people within a 780 km2 area as such nyc has the highest population and population density of all cities in the united states with the population only expected to grow a vast water infrastructure system thus exists to manage the city s high water demand while a total of 3 8 mm3 million cubic meter of drinking water is supplied every day to meet both drinking and non drinking purposes nyc 2019 a large portion likely goes to non drinking purposes since an estimated 46 of the residential water use in the united states goes to toilet flushing and laundry deoreo et al even though about 60 of the city has csss the csss struggles to cope with the urban runoff load as over 70 of the city s land is paved as a result combined sewer overflows csos occur frequently with untreated runoff sewage mixtures discharged into rivers and waterways and causing inundations every other rain event fig 1 right 2 1 2 simulation and assessment period the rwh simulation and assessment period spans 20 years january 4 2000 to may 21 2019 our simulation is based on an hourly time step given previous proof that this is sufficient

modelling water demand by building class 2 3 1 building classes we divide the 1 06 million buildings into 12 building classes based on the main usage and water use types of the building table 1 distinct water use types and diurnal patterns are then modelled by building class the spatial distribution of the building classes in nyc are presented in fig 1 left 2 3 2 non drinking water demand non drinking water demand is modelled as either toilet flushing tf or laundry table 2 for every building both the non drinking water demand type and the temporal distribution of non drinking water demand are determined by the building class it belongs to e g residents use non drinking water for toilet flushing and laundry office employees use non drinking water for toilets only to quantify the magnitude of non drinking water demand we estimate occupancy rates for each building the number of residents employees and visitors in a building per day the number of residents per building are estimated as the product of the number of residential units in a building and the average household size of each borough in nyc we estimate the number of employees and visitors based on building floor area and occupancy density more detailed explanations are available in the appendix further nine different diurnal patterns are developed based on bahl et al 2006 deoreo et al gurung et al 2014 each linking to one or more building classes see appendix the diurnal non drinking water demand patterns are used to distribute daily water demand by hour e g restaurants have a high water demand at dinner time for the three residential classes we apply detailed diurnal patterns of non drinking water demand for other buildings classes we model the demand patterns based on total water demand including both drinking and non drinking due to the lack of data 2 4 sizing rainwater storage tanks we model each rwh system under two design criteria 1 maximum rainwater yield s1 and 2 maximum benefit cost ratio bcr s2 for s1 each rainwater tank is sized to 90 of its theoretical maximum rainwater yield potential since any additional capacity is achieved at extremely high marginal costs s2 is based on earlier research belmeziti et al 2013 fewkes 2000 for each building we identify the tank sizes that meet the two criteria respectively based on 30 possible sizes that are linearly distributed from the lower to the upper limits to do so we first determine potential ranges of tank sizes by building class minimum 1 m3 to maximum 40 400 m3 based on the literature and our own judgements especially when the existing literature is scarce e g rwh in residential care facilities factories and warehouses for each building we then narrow the range of possible tank sizes based on the building class building occupancy and roof area with the 30 tank sizes identified for each building we then quantify the 20 year average water yield and bcr of the corresponding rwh system designs moreover if the maximum bcr is reached at the lower upper limits of the 30 tank sizes we extend the tank size within the broader tank size ranges by building class until decreasing increasing the tank sizes do not improve bcr anymore the procedures are explained in detailed in the appendix 2 5 assessing rwh performance 2 5 1 performance metrics to assess rwh s ability in providing urban water infrastructure services and the economic feasibility of rwh implementation the following metrics are used water saving efficiency e t also known as volumetric reliability is defined as water supplied by the rwh system divided by the sum of the water demand requested from the rwh system for the period under consideration in this research e t is calculated as the percentage of rainwater yield in relation to the non drinking water demand for each building or the city as a whole over a time period t 6 e t i 100 y i t d i t runoff reduction rr t measures the amount of rainwater captured by the tank i e rainwater yield in relation to the rainwater falling on the contributing roof surface over a time period t 7 r r t i 100 y i t h i t a i benefit cost ratio for each building bcr i the bcr quantifies the expected balance of in monetary terms benefits and costs over the 20 year life span of a rwh system from a building owner s perspective expressed in 2017 u s dollars equation 8 note we did not consider inflation and assumed a 0 discount rate to reflect the social time value of money implications of the assumptions are illustrated and discussed in the appendix t1 to t2 spans 19 years and 5 months the period when the hourly precipitation records in nyc are obtained we then linearly extrapolate the results calculated from equation 8 to the service life of the rwh systems 20 years 8 b c r i t 1 t 2 c w i t c i i

related to the size of the tank as the size of a tank increases different materials are required each material has a specific cost function obtained from retailers of rwh systems creating a cascading effect as certain size thresholds are crossed c i m a i n t t consists of the cost of regular and intermittent maintenance activities including inspection cleaning repairing and replacements of the rwh system and its components c i n r g t is the operational electricity cost of pumping the rainwater to users electricity use per volume of rainwater pumped is estimated as a function of building height occupancy rate and water use types more details including information on the empirical cost functions water and energy related utility fees and the maintenance cost factors are available in the appendix it is crucial to note that the bcr analyses are formulated from the perspective of individual building owners thus there are public benefits that are not accounted for in the bcr analyses for example by reducing drinking water supply demand rwh mitigates a city s need for constructing operating and maintaining additional facilities for drinking water treatment and delivery besides prior studies attributed rwh s poor financial performance to the fact that water is supplied at a subsidized rate in most places farreny et al 2011 hence not reflecting the real public expenditures required for water provision as such we conduct a cost effectiveness analysis where the effectiveness i e water infrastructure service does not have to be monetized the cost effectiveness ratio cer is thus defined as the cost per volume of water supplied for each building i 9 c e r i t 1 t 2 c i i n v t 1 t 2 c i m a i n t t t 1 t 2 c i n r g t t 1 t 2 y i t 2 5 2 strategic implementation scenarios we assess strategic implementation of rwh systems in a subset of buildings under various public private financing schemes s3 s7 table 3 to match the rwh systems with the funding schemes the two tank sizes estimated in section 2 4 are used we first check the applicability of private funds based on the maximum bcr of rwh in each building if the private funding criteria e g bcr 1 or 1 5 is not met we then check the public funds applicability given that public funds prioritize the provision of public benefits each publicly funded rwh system under public private partnership ppp is sized for its maximum rainwater yield furthermore the thresholds of cer 4 and cer 3 are chosen based on the distribution of the simulated cost effectiveness results of 1 06 billion buildings and the authors own judgements for each scenario n presented in table 3 we assess the overall cost effectiveness of the rwh implementation in selected buildings represented by b n equation 10 and compare it against that of a centralized alternative represented by the croton water filtration plant in nyc croton was recently developed to buffer the city s water provision system from problems in the other treatment facilities and to meet the new water treatment needs as the city s source water were increasingly contaminated by stormwater runoff and other pollution incidents grolleau and mccann 2012 it currently

presentation based on the buildings selected under strategic scenarios we then visualize the magnitudes and the spatial variations of water saving efficiency and runoff reduction rates achieved by the large scale rwh we also distinguish the type of funds i e public or private that are matched to the rwh system at building scale the building specific estimates of e t and rr t are spatially presented using arcgis 10 7 esri 2019 buildings are color coded to distinguish low 0 30 medium 30 60 and high performance 60 100 runoff reduction can only reach a maximum of 90 as 10 of the rainfall is assumed lost yield coefficient equation 2 2 6 data sources we obtain building properties from two datasets the building footprint dataset bfd doitt 2019 height and roof area of each building and the primary land use tax lot output pluto dataset dcp 2019 building type building floor area and the number of floors detailed information on the data we obtained from both pluto and bfd and how the data were combined are available in the appendix the two datasets are joined using the building identification numbers bin we divide the buildings into 12 building classes based on the 270 building classes specified in pluto the hourly rainfall data used is measured at a weather station in new york city s central park from the northeast regional climate centre nrcc 2019 water and wastewater utility fees and electricity rates are obtained from annual nyc reports and financial government reports electricity local 2019 nyc water board 2016 u s eia 2019 the installation and maintenance costs of rwh systems are estimated based on a combination of earlier research estimates farreny et al 2011 hajani and rahman 2014 roebuck et al 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 large urban water supply and runoff reduction potentials of all building rwh our results show that rwh implementation on all 1 06 million buildings roofs enables considerable substitution of central drinking water supplies and reduction of stormwater runoff fig 2a with each rwh system sized to achieve maximum rainwater yield s1 an average of 130 million m3 of central drinking water supply can be substituted each year equivalent to 33 of nyc s total annual non drinking water demand in recent years 2016 2018 the same amount of runoff is prevented from entering the sewage treatment systems the rivers or waterways over a service life of 20 years the rwh systems offer 2 5 billion m3 of non drinking water supply and urban runoff reduction in comparison sizing each rwh system for the highest benefit cost ratio bcr s2 results in 14 less rainwater yield overall still the rwh implementation meets over 29 of nyc s non drinking water demand for both s1 and s2 nearly 90 of the rainwater harvested is utilized at residential settlements multifamily single family and mixed residential the most common building classes 1 000 573 or 90 of the 1 06 million buildings the non drinking water substitution rates i e the percentage of non drinking water demand substituted by rainwater supply are highest in non residential buildings within the industry and retail classes about 90 of the non drinking water demands are met by rainwater on average the substitutions are also high for office and recreational facilities at 70 80 on average results for all building classes are presented in the appendix the substantial non drinking water supply and runoff reduction provided by the all building rwh implementations appear robust during the 20 year simulation period fig 2 b and c the annual non drinking water substitution rate in nyc as a whole ranges between 26 and 41 under s1 and 23 36 under s2 with the lower percentages in each range occurring in relatively dry years and the higher percentages occurring in wet years similar variations are found on a monthly basis 27 39 and 24 33 respectively when measured against the runoff reduction rate the performances appear more positive annual and monthly rooftop runoff reduction rates in nyc as a whole range from 46 to 73 runoff that would otherwise enter the sewage system or the water environments contributing to urban flooding and non point source pollution given that building roofs constitute a large fraction of the urban land area 11 12 in nyc ddc 2007 and an even greater fraction of the impervious land area the rooftop runoff reductions indicate great stormwater management potential at the city scale at a finer temporal scale hourly and daily the rates of non drinking water substitution become more variable the variations are a result of the fluctuating water demand throughout a day or week fig a1 in the appendix but are also predominantly due to the variable daily and weekly precipitation patterns in general rainwater yield spikes during and after rain events and zeros out when the tanks are emptied following a few rainless days the temporal results thus emphasize rwh as a sizable dual functional addition to rather than a replacement of the existing central urban water infrastructures the water services achieved by non discriminative rwh implementation in all buildings entail considerable financial costs fig 2a especially when each rwh system is sized for the maximum rainwater yield s1 in this case the financial costs are estimated to be roughly 9 2 billion u s dollars usd in 2017 value over the rwh systems service life of 20 years the life time costs are mainly attributable to upfront capital costs 51 rainwater tank pump and installation and recurring spending on maintenance 38 cleaning repairs and pump replacement operations only account for a small fraction 11 electricity costs for pumping when the rwh systems are sized for maximum bcr s2 total costs are reduced by nearly a third to 6 3 billion usd while the rainwater yield is reduced by only 14 such disproportionate changes highlight a trade off between achieving the maximum rainwater utilization and having to pay for a much higher marginal cost e g in the case of s1 3 2 heterogeneous financial performances of rwh within and across building classes s2 achieves better financial performance than s1 sized to maximum rainwater yield because each rwh is sized to its maximum bcr under s2 yet even with each rwh system sized to its maximum bcr under s2 the financial performances vary significantly both within and across the building classes fig 3 for ease of interpretation we refer to rwh systems with bcr 1 as profitable and those with bcr 1 5 as highly profitable under s2 about 64 of the systems are profitable bcr 1 and 38 are highly profitable bcr 1 5 in contrast s1 leads to 45 profitable and only 6 highly profitable rwh systems in both scenarios single family and education buildings are two of the best performing classes 79 57 and 75 52 of them are profitable under s2 s1 and over half turn out highly profitable under s2 moreover the rwh bcrs in these two building classes are more sensitive to tank sizing than in the case of the other building classes i e showing larger bcr discrepancies between s1 and s2 rwh system designs in these types of buildings thus play a crucial role in the financial prospects of rwh at both building and city scale fig 3 also reveals that profitable and highly profitable rwh may be achieved at almost all building classes featuring diverse rainwater supply and water demand patterns and can be found in different parts of a city 3 3 strategic rwh implementation under public private funding schemes the varying bcr estimates justify strategic rather than all building rwh implementations profitable or highly profitable rwh systems may appeal to private funding and public funds can be applied to the rest of the more optimal cases s3 s7 fig 4 the discrete nature of rwh and other decentralized infrastructures makes such public private funding feasible the strategic rwh scenarios result in a wide variation of total public expenditure on rwh as well as the public expenditure per unit of rainwater supply fig 4 in comparison to a non selective all building rwh implementation financed completely by public funds s1 total public spending is reduced by 49 97 under s3 s6 when public private partnerships fund rwh in 38 96 of the buildings or by 100 when only applying private funding on the 38 highly profitable rwh systems s7 the corresponding rainwater yields vary less and remain considerable accounting for 15 s7 to 30 s4 of the city s non drinking water demand given that the valuation of the trade off between rainwater yield and financial cost is difficult and context dependent we do not attempt to present a simple best scenario e g based on optimization algorithms further we map the 20 year average non drinking water substitution rate assessed for each of the 650 534 buildings 61 of the 1 1 buildings under s5 fig 5 a consistent with the distributive nature of rwh a high non drinking water substitution rate 75 100 is achieved in different parts of the city such building level estimates highlight the importance of conducting site specific analysis to incorporate the decentralized feature of rwh and for informing capital investment across large heterogeneous urban landscapes results of the strategic scenarios suggest that rwh is a competitive alternative for large scale urban water infrastructure development albeit the comparison with the croton water filtration plant i e the centralized option is not straightforward croton currently supplies 10 of the water demand in nyc equivalent to 37 of the non drinking water demand at an estimated cost of 1 55 usd m3 the croton system provides high quality drinking water supply with high reliability in comparison the strategic rwh implementations under s3 and s6 provides 78 and 45 of croton s current water supply at 77 and 15 the unit cost respectively yet we did not factor in the economies of scale in accounting for the costs of large scale rwh implementation we also neglect the value of rwh for serving stormwater management the city of new york has set aside 2 9 billion to reduce combined sewer overflows csos by 2030 nyc 2010 and another 20 billion in increasing the cities resiliency against inundations russ 2013 the real ecological and human health values of reduced freshwater extractions and runoff reductions are difficult to quantify in monetary terms for a close look at how large scale rwh implementation could alleviate the flows of urban runoff citywide we mapped the rooftop runoff reduction rates of rwh achieved in 650 534 61 buildings over one big rain event 1 39 inches or 3 53 cm in a 3 hr period on june 17 2018 under s5 fig 5b it is highlighted that the rwh implementation leads to high rooftop runoff reductions across the city high runoff reductions overlap with the main cso events that occurred in nyc in the past suggesting rwh s potential for mitigating the ecological and health consequences of csos we also found that the runoff reduction rates of rwh are especially high in the city s poor neighborhoods which are densely occupied by small residential houses this is because of a better match between the amount of non drinking water demand and the amount of rainwater harvestable from the roof area the results indicate rwh as a profitable climate change adaptation strategy in urban areas that are densely populated with low rise buildings which are known to be more vulnerable to climate change impacts usgcrp 2018 3 4 improved consideration of rwh s critical advantages the novel results on the performance of large scale rwh implementation are enabled by improved incorporation of rwh s multi functionality and high adaptability in our analysis the multi functionality feature is represented by rwh s ability to provide non drinking water supply and reduce stormwater runoff from roofs for building owners the avoided drinking water demand is modelled as reduced water and wastewater utility fees from the city s perspective the water supply and stormwater management services provided by rwh relieve the needs for expanding and or building new centralized infrastructures we incorporate rwh s adaptability in three ways first we size the rainwater storage tanks for each building considering its roof catchment area height and occupation rates maintenance requirements and the type of non drinking water demand and temporal distribution of the water demand function second for each building we examine two different tank sizes that enable maximum non drinking water supply and maximum benefit cost ratios respectively while the former design criteria matches individual owners and private funds top interests in return on investment roi the latter better fits the city s and public funds priority in providing urban water services we hence illustrate that in comparison to the design of a centralized infrastructure project rwh systems implemented in each building can be adapted to different financing priorities lastly through scenario analysis we show that rwh can flexibly meet infrastructure expansion needs at a variety of scales by implementing rwh at all or a subset of buildings across the city in comparison to the centralized water infrastructures the capacity of rwh can be more flexibly scaled up or down by adding it to an individual building or a selection of buildings it can be easily maintained upgraded or removed less dependent on the spatial layout of other infrastructure systems 3 5 model limitations and possible future wok rainwater utilization potentials depend on the trends of water demand rainfall and aging of existing infrastructure the potential of rainwater utilization may decrease as water demand or rainfall decreases and vice versa however when water demand decreases increases rwh will enable a higher lower water substitution rate and reliability of water provision the cost effectiveness from a private perspective will decrease when more water saving appliances are adopted yet from a public perspective water safety will increase as an example to prepare for the delaware aqueduct shutdown for leakage repairs in 2022 nyc needs to reduce water consumption by 5 this gap can be met by implementing a subset of the best performing rwh systems nyc 2018 hence we expect a gradual shift from private to public funding the costs of rwh systems presented here should be considered a high estimate and thus the cost effectiveness presented is conservative additional work is needed to explore the effect of bulk production and economies of scale on the upfront capital and maintenance costs of rwh systems moreover the costs may be further reduced when rwh systems are shared among multiple adjacent buildings rather than equipping buildings with their own rwh systems further the materials energy and environmental implications of implementing large scale rwh should also be investigated and compared with an equivalent centralized water provision project future research is required for simulating and assessing the effects of large scale rwh implementation on urban runoff drainage this analysis demonstrates that a variety of large scale rwh deployments can prevent large amounts of rain becoming urban runoff reaching the rivers and waterways yet the impacts on the urban drainage networks are not explored directly the detailed spatial results from our analysis offer crucial inputs for such future research 4 conclusion in this research we include the crucial yet often neglected advantages of rwh in a big data analysis of 1 06 million buildings in new york city nyc that examines building specific configurations of rwh systems 20 years hourly rainfall time series and distinct water demand patterns to the best of our knowledge this research presents the first realistic estimate of rooftop rwh s maximum potential for reducing water abstraction and runoff for a major city more crucially based on our analysis it becomes clear that rwh can be a cost effective and thus feasible option to improve the urban water system we show that strategically designed financed and implemented rooftop rwh systems meet multiple infrastructure development needs of a major city with reduced public expenditure as compared to centralized systems rwh can be a profitable climate change adaptation strategy especially in densely populated urban areas with low rise buildings areas that are known to be more vulnerable to climate change impacts the findings highlight a potential solution to the urgent issue of sustainable urban water system transformations given global urbanization and climate change our methodological improvement in assessing the sustainability aspect of large scale rwh implementation will be of interest to scientists and policy makers working on

17691,many cities are confronted with both water scarcity and urban flooding as centralized water infrastructures becoming increasingly inadequate in a changing climate decentralized infrastructures like rainwater harvesting rwh can ease both issues yet most studies find rwh offers limited infrastructure capacity at high cost previous assessments however fail to consider two critical advantages multi functionality and high adaptability by improving the incorporation of these advantages in our analysis of 1 06 million buildings with distinct design and water demand characteristics and 20 year hourly precipitation records in new york city nyc we demonstrate contrary to existing studies that strategically designed financed and implemented rooftop rwh systems in all or a subset of the buildings can meet large scale infrastructure development needs for water supply and stormwater management rwh implementation featuring public private partnerships ppp in 43 96 of the buildings can serve 17 29 of the city s non drinking water demands while reducing the public expenditure per unit of water supply by 13 85 the distributed citywide rwh implementations prevent 35 56 of rooftop runoff from entering the sewage system rivers and or waterways per month with observed rooftop runoff reductions as high as 90 for a single rain event graphical abstract image 1 keywords rainwater harvesting infrastructure decentralization data driven analysis public private partnership ppp 1 introduction global urbanization and climate change present an urgent need to develop more efficient and sustainable urban water systems worldwide nations 2019 by 2050 due to increases in urban population and wealth global urban water demand is expected to grow by 80 florke et al 2018 additionally climate change will lead to more extreme events such as floods and droughts across the world thereby further stressing current water and non water infrastructure stott 2016 sustainable urban water system research concentrates on low and middle income countries yet cities in high income countries also face analogous albeit different challenges in most high income countries drinking water treatment and delivery systems are aging and decaying while critical maintenance and repairs are backlogged or neglected posing great health risks comparable to the 2004 surprise lead contamination in washington d c s water supply renner 2004 and more recently problems of dilapidated water infrastructure exacerbated by climate change and population growth in london cooper 2019 moreover drinking water systems are under pressure to comply with more stringent water quality standards and newly identified contaminants of concern to safeguard human health cañedo argüelles et al 2016 rosario ortiz et al 2016 as an example the european parliament regularly reviews and updates the eu water directives like the enforced eu water quality standards applicable to surface water that recently added pharmaceuticals to a new watch list european union 2018 rainwater harvesting rwh is a viable but contested strategy for simultaneously addressing various water related challenges unlike existing urban water infrastructures that are centralized and single purpose a rwh system is a decentralized multifunctional infrastructure that augments water supplies substitutes high quality drinking water used for non drinking purposes and reduces stormwater runoff a major source of flooding and water pollution in cities worldwide campisano et al 2017 rwh s positive performance measured against various water supply and runoff reduction indicators is well supported basinger et al 2010 ennenbach et al 2018 jones and hunt 2010 rostad et al 2016 ward et al 2012 zhang et al 2009 some studies also highlight rwh s ability to abate water quality impairments in cities serviced by a combined sewer system css where untreated runoff sewage mixtures overflow into rivers or waterways during periods of high precipitation basinger et al 2010 gwenzi and nyamadzawo 2014 wang and zimmerman 2015 still most existing studies find that rwh promises low water supply potential with unit costs higher than centralized water supply basinger et al 2010 farreny et al 2011 roebuck et al 2011 as a result rwh s ability to improve urban water systems has been challenged the unfavorable assessments of rwh however are derived without fairly incorporating the critical advantages of decentralized infrastructure multi functionality and adaptability most economic assessments of water related infrastructures implicitly assume a single utility such as water provision boers and benasher 1982 farreny et al 2011 roebuck et al 2011 vieira et al 2014 this single utility approach works well for conventional one purpose infrastructure but underestimates the benefits realized by alternatives serving more than one infrastructure need such as rwh the neglect of rwh s high adaptability is more nuanced first existing large scale rwh studies are based on a one size rwh configuration and assume non discriminative all building implementation in a city rostad et al 2016 or country ennenbach et al 2018 however rwh system performance is contingent on the sizing of rainwater tanks imteaz et al 2011 jones and hunt 2010 wang and zimmerman 2015 and water demand patterns in buildings basinger et al 2010 environment agency 2010 retamal et al 2009 that is the performance of citywide rwh implementation can be improved by strategically sizing the rainwater tanks by building class and by targeting the buildings with good rwh performances rwh s customizability of size cost and design for individual buildings is not possible for centralized infrastructure systems further the high customizability and its decentralized nature allow rwh systems with different design and cost characteristics to be flexibly bundled to meet impending infrastructure expansion needs at a range of scales the advantages also enable rwh implementations to be highly adaptable to the different priorities of public funds e g societal benefits and private funds e g return on investment maximizing the socio economic value of capital investment against this background we examine the performance of large scale rwh implementation by more fairly incorporating its critical advantages of multi functionality and high adaptability to do so our research improves existing literature in a few respects we model citywide rwh with unprecedented spatial detail considering 1 06 million buildings with distinct design and water demand characteristics in new york city nyc based on the large and diverse building stock we present to the best of our knowledge the most consistent assessment of rwh s water saving efficiency and financial aspects by building class more crucially with the building level results we are able to identify precise implementation and funding strategies that lift the financial performance of large scale rwh implementations potentially beyond that of the centralized alternative for the first time we reveal the potential and the importance of public private partnerships ppp in improving the cost effectiveness of large scale rwh implementations the paper proceeds as follows first we introduce the method and data sources in detail next we present the assessments based on rwh implementation in all 1 06 million buildings under two primary design criteria each rwh system is sized to achieve maximum rainwater yield scenario 1 s1 or maximum benefit cost ratio scenario 2 s2 then we present a range of strategic implementation scenarios in which rwh in a subset of buildings is implemented under different ppp funding schemes 2 material and methods 2 1 research context 2 1 1 study area this rwh research was conducted in new york city nyc because of the complexity of the area the dedication of nyc to urban sustainability specifically in stormwater management practices nyc 2010 and the availability of data especially a rich building dataset nyc s intense economic activity dense population and high imperviousness show the necessity and difficulty of water management nyc comprises 1 06 million buildings fig 1 left and a population of over 8 million people within a 780 km2 area as such nyc has the highest population and population density of all cities in the united states with the population only expected to grow a vast water infrastructure system thus exists to manage the city s high water demand while a total of 3 8 mm3 million cubic meter of drinking water is supplied every day to meet both drinking and non drinking purposes nyc 2019 a large portion likely goes to non drinking purposes since an estimated 46 of the residential water use in the united states goes to toilet flushing and laundry deoreo et al even though about 60 of the city has csss the csss struggles to cope with the urban runoff load as over 70 of the city s land is paved as a result combined sewer overflows csos occur frequently with untreated runoff sewage mixtures discharged into rivers and waterways and causing inundations every other rain event fig 1 right 2 1 2 simulation and assessment period the rwh simulation and assessment period spans 20 years january 4 2000 to may 21 2019 our simulation is based on an hourly time step given previous proof that this is sufficient resolution for rwh calculations ward et al 2010 2012 results are reported as 20 year annual averages annual time series monthly averages or for one single rain event depending on the purpose of the

modelling water demand by building class 2 3 1 building classes we divide the 1 06 million buildings into 12 building classes based on the main usage and water use types of the building table 1 distinct water use types and diurnal patterns are then modelled by building class the spatial distribution of the building classes in nyc are presented in fig 1 left 2 3 2 non drinking water demand non drinking water demand is modelled as either toilet flushing tf or laundry table 2 for every building both the non drinking water demand type and the temporal distribution of non drinking water demand are determined by the building class it belongs to e g residents use non drinking water for toilet flushing and laundry office employees use non drinking water for toilets only to quantify the magnitude of non drinking water demand we estimate occupancy rates for each building the number of residents employees and visitors in a building per day the number of residents per building are estimated as the product of the number of residential units in a building and the average household size of each borough in nyc we estimate the number of employees and visitors based on building floor area and occupancy density more detailed explanations are available in the appendix further nine different diurnal patterns are developed based on bahl et al 2006 deoreo et al gurung et al 2014 each linking to one or more building classes see appendix the diurnal non drinking water demand patterns are used to distribute daily water demand by hour e g restaurants have a high water demand at dinner time for the three residential classes we apply detailed diurnal patterns of non drinking water demand for other buildings classes we model the demand patterns based on total water demand including both drinking and non drinking due to the lack of data 2 4 sizing rainwater storage tanks we model each rwh system under two design criteria 1 maximum rainwater yield s1 and 2 maximum benefit cost ratio bcr s2 for s1 each rainwater tank is sized to 90 of its theoretical maximum rainwater yield potential since any additional capacity is achieved at extremely high marginal costs s2 is based on earlier research belmeziti et al 2013 fewkes 2000 for each building we identify the tank sizes that meet the two criteria respectively based on 30 possible sizes that are linearly distributed from the lower to the upper limits to do so we first determine potential ranges of tank sizes by building class minimum 1 m3 to maximum 40 400 m3 based on the literature and our own judgements especially when the existing literature is scarce e g rwh in residential care facilities factories and warehouses for each building we then narrow the range of possible tank sizes based on the building class building occupancy and roof area with the 30 tank sizes identified for each building we then quantify the 20 year average water yield and bcr of the corresponding rwh system designs moreover if the maximum bcr is reached at the lower upper limits of the 30 tank sizes we extend the tank size within the broader tank size ranges by building class until decreasing increasing the tank sizes do not improve bcr anymore the procedures are explained in detailed in the appendix 2 5 assessing rwh performance 2 5 1 performance metrics to assess rwh s ability in providing urban water infrastructure services and the economic feasibility of rwh implementation the following metrics are used water saving efficiency e t also known as volumetric reliability is defined as water supplied by the rwh system divided by the sum of the water demand requested from the rwh system for the period under consideration in this research e t is calculated as the percentage of rainwater yield in relation to the non drinking water demand for each building or the city as a whole over a time period t 6 e t i 100 y i t d i t runoff reduction rr t measures the amount of rainwater captured by the tank i e rainwater yield in relation to the rainwater falling on the contributing roof surface over a time period t 7 r r t i 100 y i t h i t a i benefit cost ratio for each building bcr i the bcr quantifies the expected balance

assumed a 0 discount rate to reflect the social time value of money implications of the assumptions are illustrated and discussed in the appendix t1 to t2 spans 19 years and 5 months the period when the hourly precipitation records in nyc are obtained we then linearly extrapolate the results calculated from equation 8 to the service life of the rwh systems 20 years 8 b c r i t 1 t 2 c w i t c i i

related to the size of the tank as the size of a tank increases different materials are required each material has a specific cost function obtained from retailers of rwh systems creating a cascading effect as certain size thresholds are crossed c i m a i n t t consists of the cost of regular and intermittent maintenance activities including inspection cleaning repairing and replacements of the rwh system and its components c i n r g t is the operational electricity cost of pumping the rainwater to users electricity use per volume of rainwater pumped is estimated as a function of building height occupancy rate and water use types more details including information on the empirical cost functions water and energy related utility fees and the maintenance cost factors are available in the appendix it is crucial to note that the bcr analyses are formulated from the perspective of individual building owners thus there are public benefits that are not accounted for in the bcr analyses for example by reducing drinking water supply demand rwh mitigates a city s need for constructing operating and maintaining additional facilities for drinking water treatment and delivery besides prior studies attributed rwh s poor financial performance to the fact that water is supplied at a subsidized rate in most places farreny et al 2011 hence not reflecting the real public expenditures required for water provision as such we conduct a cost effectiveness analysis where the effectiveness i e water infrastructure service does not have to be monetized the cost effectiveness ratio cer is thus

assess strategic implementation of rwh systems in a subset of buildings under various public private financing schemes s3 s7 table 3 to match the rwh systems with the funding schemes the two tank sizes estimated in section 2 4 are used we first check the applicability of private funds based on the maximum bcr of rwh in each building if the private funding criteria e g bcr 1 or 1 5 is not met we then check the public funds applicability given that public funds prioritize the provision of public benefits each publicly funded rwh system under public private partnership ppp is sized for its maximum rainwater yield furthermore the thresholds of cer 4 and cer 3 are chosen based on the distribution of the simulated cost effectiveness results of 1 06 billion buildings and the authors own judgements for each scenario n presented in table 3 we assess the overall cost effectiveness of the rwh implementation in selected buildings represented by b n equation 10 and compare it against that of a centralized alternative represented by the croton water filtration plant in nyc croton was recently developed to buffer the city s water provision system from problems in the other treatment facilities and to meet the new water treatment needs as the city s source water were increasingly contaminated by stormwater runoff and other pollution incidents grolleau and mccann 2012 it currently

presentation based on the buildings selected under strategic scenarios we then visualize the magnitudes and the spatial variations of water saving efficiency and runoff reduction rates achieved by the large scale rwh we also distinguish the type of funds i e public or private that are matched to the rwh system at building scale the building specific estimates of e t and rr t are spatially presented using arcgis 10 7 esri 2019 buildings are color coded to distinguish low 0 30 medium 30 60 and high performance 60 100 runoff reduction can only reach a maximum of 90 as 10 of the rainfall is assumed lost yield coefficient equation 2 2 6 data sources we obtain building properties from two datasets the building footprint dataset bfd doitt 2019 height and roof area of each building and the primary land use tax lot output pluto dataset dcp 2019 building type building floor area and the number of floors detailed information on the data we obtained from both pluto and bfd and how the data were combined are available in the appendix the two datasets are joined using the building identification numbers bin we divide the buildings into 12 building classes based on the 270 building classes specified in pluto the hourly rainfall data used is measured at a weather station in new york city s central park from the northeast regional climate centre nrcc 2019 water and wastewater utility fees and electricity rates are obtained from annual nyc reports and financial government reports electricity local 2019 nyc water board 2016 u s eia 2019 the installation and maintenance costs of rwh systems are estimated based on a combination of earlier research estimates farreny et al 2011 hajani and rahman 2014 roebuck et al 2011 3 results and discussion 3 1 large urban water supply and runoff reduction potentials of all building rwh our results show that rwh implementation on all 1 06 million buildings roofs enables considerable substitution of central drinking water supplies and reduction of stormwater runoff fig 2a with each rwh system sized to achieve maximum rainwater yield s1 an average of 130 million m3 of central drinking water supply can be substituted each year equivalent to 33 of nyc s total annual non drinking water demand in recent years 2016 2018 the same amount of runoff is prevented from entering the sewage treatment systems the rivers or waterways over a service life of 20 years the rwh systems offer 2 5 billion m3 of non drinking water supply and urban runoff reduction in comparison sizing each rwh system for the highest benefit cost ratio bcr s2 results in 14 less rainwater yield overall still the rwh implementation meets over 29 of nyc s non drinking water demand for both s1 and s2 nearly 90 of the rainwater harvested is utilized at residential settlements multifamily single family and mixed residential the most common building classes 1 000 573 or 90 of the 1 06 million buildings the non drinking water substitution rates i e the percentage of non drinking water demand substituted by rainwater supply are highest in non residential buildings within the industry and retail classes about 90 of the non drinking water demands are met by rainwater on average the substitutions are also high for office and recreational facilities at 70 80 on average results for all building classes are presented in the appendix the substantial non drinking water supply and runoff reduction provided by the all building rwh implementations appear robust during the 20 year simulation period fig 2 b and c the annual non drinking water substitution rate in nyc as a whole ranges between 26 and 41 under s1 and 23 36 under s2 with the lower percentages in each range occurring in relatively dry years and the higher percentages occurring in wet years similar variations are found on a monthly basis 27 39 and 24 33 respectively when measured against the runoff reduction rate the performances appear more positive annual and monthly rooftop runoff reduction rates in nyc as a whole range from 46 to 73 runoff that would otherwise enter the sewage system or the water environments contributing to urban flooding and non point source pollution given that building roofs constitute a large fraction of the urban land area 11 12 in nyc ddc 2007 and an even greater fraction of the impervious land area the rooftop runoff reductions indicate great stormwater management potential at the city scale at a finer temporal scale hourly and daily the rates of non drinking water substitution become more variable the variations are a result of the fluctuating water demand throughout a day or week fig a1 in the appendix but are also predominantly due to the variable daily and weekly precipitation patterns in general rainwater yield spikes during and after rain events and zeros out when the tanks are emptied following a few rainless days the temporal results thus emphasize rwh as a sizable dual functional addition to rather than a replacement of the existing central urban water infrastructures the water services achieved by non discriminative rwh implementation in all buildings entail considerable financial costs fig 2a especially when each rwh system is sized for the maximum rainwater yield s1 in this case the financial costs are estimated to be roughly 9 2 billion u s dollars usd in 2017 value over the rwh systems service life of 20 years the life time costs are mainly attributable to upfront capital costs 51 rainwater tank pump and installation and recurring spending on maintenance 38 cleaning repairs and pump replacement operations only account for a small fraction 11 electricity costs for pumping when the rwh systems are sized for maximum bcr s2 total costs are reduced by nearly a third to 6 3 billion usd while the rainwater yield is reduced by only 14 such disproportionate changes highlight a trade off between achieving the maximum rainwater utilization and having to pay for a much higher marginal cost e g in the case of s1 3 2 heterogeneous financial performances of rwh within and across building classes s2 achieves better financial performance than s1 sized to maximum rainwater yield because each rwh is sized to its maximum bcr under s2 yet even with each rwh system sized to its maximum bcr under s2 the financial performances vary significantly both within and across the building classes fig 3 for ease of interpretation we refer to rwh systems with bcr 1 as profitable and those with bcr 1 5 as highly profitable under s2 about 64 of the systems are profitable bcr 1 and 38 are highly profitable bcr 1 5 in contrast s1 leads to 45 profitable and only 6 highly profitable rwh systems in both scenarios single family and education buildings are two of the best performing classes 79 57 and 75 52 of them are profitable under s2 s1 and over half turn out highly profitable under s2 moreover the rwh bcrs in these two building classes are more sensitive to tank sizing than in the case of the other building classes i e showing larger bcr discrepancies between s1 and s2 rwh system designs in these types of buildings thus play a crucial role in the financial prospects of rwh at both building and city scale fig 3 also reveals that profitable and highly profitable rwh may be achieved at almost all building classes featuring diverse rainwater supply and water demand patterns and can be found in different parts of a city 3 3 strategic rwh implementation under public private funding schemes the varying bcr estimates justify strategic rather than all building rwh implementations profitable or highly profitable rwh systems may appeal to private funding and public funds can be applied to the rest of the more optimal cases s3 s7 fig 4 the discrete nature of rwh and other decentralized infrastructures makes such public private funding feasible the strategic rwh scenarios result in a wide variation of total public expenditure on rwh as well as the public expenditure per unit of rainwater supply fig 4 in comparison to a non selective all building rwh implementation financed completely by public funds s1 total public spending is reduced by 49 97 under s3 s6 when public private partnerships fund rwh in 38 96 of the buildings or by 100 when only applying private funding on the 38 highly profitable rwh systems s7 the corresponding rainwater yields vary less and remain considerable accounting for 15 s7 to 30 s4 of the city s non drinking water demand given that the valuation of the trade off between rainwater yield and financial cost is difficult and context dependent we do not attempt to present a simple best scenario e g based on optimization algorithms further we map the 20 year average non drinking water substitution rate assessed for each of the 650 534 buildings 61 of the 1 1 buildings under s5 fig 5 a consistent with the distributive nature of rwh a high non drinking water substitution rate 75 100 is achieved in different parts of the city such building level estimates highlight the importance of conducting site specific analysis to incorporate the decentralized feature of rwh and for informing capital investment across large heterogeneous urban landscapes results of the strategic scenarios suggest that rwh is a competitive alternative for large scale urban water infrastructure development albeit the comparison with the croton water filtration plant i e the centralized option is not straightforward croton currently supplies 10 of the water demand in nyc equivalent to 37 of the non drinking water demand at an estimated cost of 1 55 usd m3 the croton system provides high quality drinking water supply with high reliability in comparison the strategic rwh implementations under s3 and s6 provides 78 and 45 of croton s current water supply at 77 and 15 the unit cost respectively yet we did not factor in the economies of scale in accounting for the costs of large scale rwh implementation we also neglect the value of rwh for serving stormwater management the city of new york has set aside 2 9 billion to reduce combined sewer overflows csos by 2030 nyc 2010 and another 20 billion in increasing the cities resiliency against inundations russ 2013 the real ecological and human health values of reduced freshwater extractions and runoff reductions are difficult to quantify in monetary terms for a close look at how large scale rwh implementation could alleviate the flows of urban runoff citywide we mapped the rooftop runoff reduction rates of rwh achieved in 650 534 61 buildings over one big rain event 1 39 inches or 3 53 cm in a 3 hr period on june 17 2018 under s5 fig 5b it is highlighted that the rwh implementation leads to high rooftop runoff reductions across the city high runoff reductions overlap with the main cso events that occurred in nyc in the past suggesting rwh s potential for mitigating the ecological and health consequences of csos we also found that the runoff reduction rates of rwh are especially high in the city s poor neighborhoods which are densely occupied by small residential houses this is because of a better match between the amount of non drinking water demand and the amount of rainwater harvestable from the roof area the results indicate rwh as a profitable climate change adaptation strategy in urban areas that are densely populated with low rise buildings which are known to be more vulnerable to climate change impacts usgcrp 2018 3 4 improved consideration of rwh s critical advantages the novel results on the performance of large scale rwh implementation are enabled by improved incorporation of rwh s multi functionality and high adaptability in our analysis the multi functionality feature is represented by rwh s ability to provide non drinking water supply and reduce stormwater runoff from roofs for building owners the avoided drinking water demand is modelled as reduced water and wastewater utility fees from the city s perspective the water supply and stormwater management services provided by rwh relieve the needs for expanding and or building new centralized infrastructures we incorporate rwh s adaptability in three ways first we size the rainwater storage tanks for each building considering its roof catchment area height and occupation rates maintenance requirements and the type of non drinking water demand and temporal distribution of the water demand function second for each building we examine two different tank sizes that enable maximum non drinking water supply and maximum benefit cost ratios respectively while the former design criteria matches individual owners and private funds top interests in return on investment roi the latter better fits the city s and public funds priority in providing urban water services we hence illustrate that in comparison to the design of a centralized infrastructure project rwh systems implemented in each building can be adapted to different financing priorities lastly through scenario analysis we show that rwh can flexibly meet infrastructure expansion needs at a variety of scales by implementing rwh at all or a subset of buildings across the city in comparison to the centralized water infrastructures the capacity of rwh can be more flexibly scaled up or down by adding it to an individual building or a selection of buildings it can be easily maintained upgraded or removed less dependent on the spatial layout of other infrastructure systems 3 5 model limitations and possible future wok rainwater utilization potentials depend on the trends of water demand rainfall and aging of existing infrastructure the potential of rainwater utilization may decrease as water demand or rainfall decreases and vice versa however when water demand decreases increases rwh will enable a higher lower water substitution rate and reliability of water provision the cost effectiveness from a private perspective will decrease when more water saving appliances are adopted yet from a public perspective water safety will increase as an example to prepare for the delaware aqueduct shutdown for leakage repairs in 2022 nyc needs to reduce water consumption by 5 this gap can be met by implementing a subset of the best performing rwh systems nyc 2018 hence we expect a gradual shift from private to public funding the costs of rwh systems presented here should be considered a high estimate and thus the cost effectiveness presented is conservative additional work is needed to explore the effect of bulk production and economies of scale on the upfront capital and maintenance costs of rwh systems moreover the costs may be further reduced when rwh systems are shared among multiple adjacent buildings rather than equipping buildings with their own rwh systems further the materials energy and environmental implications of implementing large scale rwh should also be investigated and compared with an equivalent centralized water provision project future research is required for simulating and assessing the effects of large scale rwh implementation on urban runoff drainage this analysis demonstrates that a variety of large scale rwh deployments can prevent large amounts of rain becoming urban runoff reaching the rivers and waterways yet the impacts on the urban drainage networks are not explored directly the detailed spatial results from our analysis offer crucial inputs for such future research 4 conclusion in this research we include the crucial yet often neglected advantages of rwh in a big data analysis of 1 06 million buildings in new york city nyc that examines building specific configurations of rwh systems 20 years hourly rainfall time series and distinct water demand patterns to the best of our knowledge this research presents the first realistic estimate of rooftop rwh s maximum potential for reducing water abstraction and runoff for a major city more crucially based on our analysis it becomes clear that rwh can be a cost effective and thus feasible option to improve the urban water system we show that strategically designed financed and implemented rooftop rwh systems meet multiple infrastructure development needs of a major city with reduced public expenditure as compared to centralized systems rwh can be a profitable climate change adaptation strategy especially in densely populated urban areas with low rise buildings areas that are known to be more vulnerable to climate change impacts the findings highlight a potential solution to the urgent issue of sustainable urban water system transformations given global urbanization and climate change our methodological improvement in assessing the sustainability aspect of large scale rwh implementation will be of interest to scientists and policy makers working on

17692,in this study a novel peroxymonosulfate pms activation method which combines a solid waste i e red mud rm and a reducing agent i e hydroxylamine ha for the oxidative degradation of fluoroquinolones fqs i e flumequine flu and ciprofloxacin cip in hospital wastewater hw was developed the addition of ha into the pms rm suspension significantly enhanced flu removal owing to its ability to enhance the fe iii fe ii cycle on the rm surface the results of the quenching experiments suggested the predominance of so4 over oh in the pms rm ha system moreover owing to the greater reactivity between cip and so4 cip removal was more effective than flu removal additionally the liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy lc ms analysis revealed that the oxidation of cip and flu by pms rm ha occurred via sequential and separate processes involving ring cleavage hydroxylation decarbonylation and defluorination surprisingly the wastewater components exhibited contrasting effects on flu removal in hw natural organic matter nitrate and sulfate showed a slight impact on the removal performance of flu whereas chloride improved the oxidation extent however phosphate significantly inhibited the flu removal because of its competitive binding at the rm surface and its scavenging effect towards so4 this inhibitory effect was overcome by increasing the pms concentration and its sequential addition thus guaranteeing successful mineralization of flu in hw these results show that the rm ha system can be utilized to activate pms for the removal of antibiotics in wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords flumequine ciprofloxacin hospital wastewater red mud hydroxylamine peroxymonosulfate 1 introduction according to a report published by the world health organization in 2017 world health organization 2017 resistance to antibiotics is presently considered as one of the greatest threats to health food security and development globally antibiotics which are commonly used to prevent and treat bacterial infections are the most prescribed drugs worldwide and frequently encountered in hospital and urban wastewater okeke et al 1999 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 indeed the presence of penicillins macrolides sulfonamides fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines in hospital wastewater hw has been reported with concentrations up to 15 µg l reemtsma and

fluoroquinolones fqs are the most potent antimicrobial agents used in human and veterinary medicine because their removal during wastewater treatment is incomplete and they are continually being released into the environment they are frequently detected in aquatic systems rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 watkinson et al 2009 particularly the presence of flumequine flu and ciprofloxacin cip in surface water groundwater and sediments at concentrations ranging from nanograms to micrograms per liter have been reported zhang et al 2015 to remove such antibiotics from wastewater advanced oxidation processes aops have attracted considerable attention recently owing to their ability to generate reactive oxygen species ros that can efficiently remove refractory and non biodegradable organic contaminants boczkaj and fernandes 2017 deng et al 2017 recently sulfate radical so4 based aops have become a new focus for wastewater treatment owing to the better selectivity and longer half life of so4 in comparison with the hydroxyl radical oh reportedly peroxymonosulfate pms can be activated by uv qi et al 2019 heat xu et al 2016 or a transition metal sang et al 2020 however its activation in uv and heat systems is associated with disadvantages such as high cost and high energy consumption zou et al 2013 additionally co2 pms systems demonstrate the best performance with respect to so4 generation anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 however the toxicity of cobalt as well as the resulting secondary pollution associated with its use stand as a major setback to the application of co2 pms systems deng et al 2017 ji et al 2013 more recently it has been reported that replacing cobalt with a nontoxic metal such as mn2 or fe2 opens up new avenues for research into the

remediation technologies bhatnagar et al 2011 reportedly it has been used as an adsorbent for dyes phenols and heavy metals bhatnagar et al 2011 sushil and batra 2008 however its ability to enhance the advanced oxidation of antibiotics while eliminating the emerging contaminants from wastewater has not yet been clarified therefore the primary objective of this study was to investigate the ability of rm to enhance the advanced oxidation of antibiotics while removing antibiotic contamination from wastewater additionally for the first time its catalytic activity with respect to the

anions onto metal oxides flu adsorption was high under low ph conditions and decreased as the ph increased this observed sorption behavior can be attributed to the combined effect of ph dependent flu speciation pka 6 5 and rm surface charge characteristics pzc 7 3 under ph conditions higher than both pka and pzc the flu and rm surfaces were negatively charged leading to less favorable electrostatic interactions to determine the most efficient flu removal system the kinetics of flu removal with and without pms rm and ha were investigated fig 2 assuming that rm promotes the generation of ros leading to the degradation of the target compound and that the concentration of these generated species are constant over the reaction time the flu removal kinetics can be described using eq 1 which is a pseudo first order equation 1 fqs t fqs 0 ex p k a p p t where kapp which represents the rate constant h 1 of the pseudo first order reaction is obtained by considering the linear regression of ln fqs fqs 0 vs time t the control experiment using ha alone demonstrated that the addition of 0 05 mm ha did not have any significant effect on the flu removal kinetics furthermore using 1 mm of pms alone or in combination with 0 05 mm ha resulted in an flu removal of up to 40 the fast removal occurred within 1 h of reaction could be attributed to direct pms action yin et al 2018 and or alkaline activation by naoh used for ph adjustment at the initial stage of reaction wang and wang 2018 when 0 05 g l 1 of rm and 0 05 mm ha were used the flu removal efficiency was 30 showing the initial adsorption capacity of rm for the flu removal contrarily after 6 h of reaction in the rm pms system the flu removal efficiency observed was 75 kapp 0 248 h 1 table s2 which might be caused by sum of flu adsorption by rm alone and flu removal by pms alone the flu adsorption desorption equilibrium was attained after 1 h see dotted line in fig 2 and finally complete flu removal was observed after 6 h of reaction using a system obtained by adding 0 05 mm ha to the pms rm system this new system exhibited a kapp value 0 577 h 1 that was 2 3 times higher than that of the pms rm only system suggesting that ha plays a crucial role in enhancing flu removal the enhanced flu removal in the pms rm ha system possibly resulted from the reduction of fe iii to fe ii by ha on the surface of α fe2o3 present in rm eq 2 and 3 which activated pms generating reactive radicals i e so4 and oh eq 4 and 5 zou et al 2013 2 n h 2 oh f e iii f e ii n h 2 o h 3 f e iii n h 2 o f e ii nho h 4 hso 5 f e ii so 4 f e iii o h 5 hso 5 f e ii so 4 2 f e iii oh to investigate the fe iii reduction capacity of ha the production of dissolved fe ii before and after ha addition under anaerobic conditions was investigated figure s3 illustrates that in the presence of ha virtually no fe ii dissolution occurs however xps analysis demonstrated that peaks corresponding to si and ti on rm surface were not significantly changed before and after ha addition fig 3 a and c whereas main peak corresponding to al 2p3 2 shifted from 73 9 to 74 5 ev fig 3 d indicating the formation of al hydroxides after the reaction epa et al 2004 these observations possibly resulted from the formation of fe ii al iii layered double hydroxides during the reaction between the reduced fe ii and al2o3 on the rm surface elzinga 2012 the portion of deconvoluted peak of o1s at 532 1 ev hydroxide species certainly increased to 35 8 when it compares with rm alone 25 5 fig 3 b in addition h2o peak vacancy peak ovac and o2 peak were observed at 533 8 531 4 and 530 ev respectively liu et al 2017 to confirm the surface reduction of fe iii to fe ii by ha the fe region of the xps spectra was also analyzed the fe 2p3 2 narrow scan spectra of raw rm consisted of three main peaks at 709 5 fe ii species 710 7 and 712 8 ev fe iii species fig 3 e sihn et al 2019 these results indicate that the proportions of the fe ii and fe iii surfaces were 10 4 and 89 6 respectively when ha was added to the rm suspension an increase in the fe ii surface content 26 8 was observed indicating that the fe iii surface had been reduced to fe ii these results imply that ha can reduce fe iii to fe ii on the rm surface thus enhancing pms activation however a significant decrease of the fe ii content from 26 8 to 1 3 was observed when we added pms to ha rm system suggesting that the reduced fe ii surface can be oxidized to fe iii after pms activation esr analysis was conducted to provide more direct evidence of radical generation in the pms rm ha system fig 4 we have prepared two different systems using pms rm ha and h2o2 rm ha at ph 7 no signal was detected in rm h2o2 ha system indicating that h2o2 could not be activated in rm ha suspension at ph 7 in comparison apparent signals of dmpooh adduct with the intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 and dmpo so4 adduct were observed in rm pms ha system the predominant reactive species was further investigated using t buoh and i proh because of their different selectivity i e second order rate constants with oh and so4 i proh reacts with both oh and so4 with the second order reaction constant k ho i pr 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 and k so 4 i pr 4 7 42 107 m 1 s 1 while t buoh can be considered to be more selective toward oh k ho t but 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 than so4 k so 4 t but 4 8 4 105 m 1 s 1 anbar and neta 1967 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 the percentages of oh and so4 that reacted with flu and the scavenger could be estimated using the bimolecular rate constants and concentrations of each species kamagate et al 2020 according to our calculations table s3 t buoh 5 mm is selective for oh since it will react with more than 98 of oh i proh was used at very high concentration 20 mm to ensure effective and total scavenging of both radical species addition of 5 mm of t buoh resulted in a slight decrease in flu removal fig s4 suggesting that hydroxyl radical is not the main reactive species for flu removal the slight inhibition observed could be attributed to the reactivity of t buoh with so4 under our experimental conditions table s3 the addition of i proh 20 mm almost completely inhibited flu degradation confirming the predominance of the sulfate radical fig s4 in this study the impact of light on the pms rm ha system was also investigated by performing additional experiments under uv a λmax 365 nm intensity 3 4 mw cm 2 and visible light λ 400 nm intensity 0 5 mw cm 2 irradiations fig s5 a in comparison with the results obtained under dark conditions kapp 0 577 h 1 table s2 uv a irradiation resulted in a faster flu removal rate kapp 1 396 h 1 whereas visible light irradiation had no effect on the removal rate kapp 0 495 h 1 this can be explained taking into consideration the inability of visible light to reduce fe iii to fe ii or activate pms qu et al 2019 wang et al 2017 despite the enhanced flu degradation efficiency under uv a irradiation due probably to uv a assist pms activation khan et al 2014 yang et al 2010 further experiments using the pms rm ha system were conducted in the dark 3 3 effects of experimental factors on flu removal the effects of the concentrations of pms ha and rm on flu removal using the pms rm ha system were investigated under a range of pms 0 5 1 5 mm ha 0 05 2 mm and rm 0 05 0 2 g l 1 concentrations the results depicted in fig s6 a and fig 5 a indicate that an increase in pms concentration results in a higher and faster flu removal rate kapp 0 192 and 1 923 h 1 at 0 5 and 1 5 mm respectively table s2 this can be attributed to the increased production of so4 and oh as shown in eq 4 and 5 however higher ha concentrations 0 05 mm exhibit a negative effect on the flu removal rate kapp 0 577 and 0 041 h 1 at 0 05 mm and 2 mm respectively fig s6 b fig 5 b and table s2 these observations support the scavenging role of ha according to eq 6 and 7 zou et al 2013 6 n h 2 oh so 4 so 4 2 nitrogenous products k 1 5 10 7 m s 1 1 7 n h 2 oh oh o h nitrogenous products k 5 0 10 8 m s 1 1 indeed nitrogenous products 0 5 mg l 1 of no3 and no2 which possibly resulted from ha degradation as shown in eq 6 and 7 were observed at the end of the 6 h reaction additionally increasing the rm dosage particularly during the early stage of the reaction fig s6 c and fig 5 c enhanced the flu removal kapp 0 577 and 0 993 h 1 at 0 05 mg l 1 and 0 2 mg l 1 respectively table s2 the effect of ha on the fe iii fe ii cycle on the rm surface was also evaluated using two other reductants i e dithionite and sulfite fig s6 d and fig 5 d in the presence of dithionite the flu removal efficiency was 40 including initial removal of 23 via adsorption while almost no further removal was observed in the presence of sulfite these demonstrated the superior flu removal performance of the pms rm ha system owing to the stronger scavenging properties of dithionite and sulfite toward the radicals k sulfite oh 5 5 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 and k s u l f i t e s o 4 5 0 108 m 1 s 1 neta and huie 1985 not available for dithionite than those toward the ha eq 6 and 7 figure s5 b indicates that ph has a considerable effect on flu sorption and oxidation in the pms rm ha system a significant decrease in flu removal is observed when the initial ph was increased from 6 to 9 at ph phpzc rm i e 7 3 there may be a decrease in the electrostatic repulsion between rm and hso5 resulting in a decrease in the flu removal efficiency conversely at a ph of 6 the electrostatic attractions of both the negatively charged flu and hso5 with the positively charged rm surface are favored these can enhance the initial adsorption of flu and pms activation on rm surface and consequently the increase in the flu removal efficiency 3 4 effect of mixture on removal process and oxidation pathways the effect of the co existence of fqs i e flu and cip on their respective removal was investigated fig 6 depicts that in both single fig 6 a and binary mixture systems fig 6 b 5 μm of cip was completely removed using pms rm ha additionally k app values approximately 11 7 and 11 0 times higher than those for flu removal in both single fig s7 a and binary mixture systems fig s7 b respectively were obtained for cip owing to the faster reaction between cip and so4 k c i p s o 4 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 mahdi ahmed and chiron 2014 cip which contains cyclopropane and piperazine rings exhibits high reactivity with ros via i the cleavage of the cyclopropane moiety owing to the loss of ch2 units and ii the strong interactions between so4 and the piperazine ring guo et al 2017 jiang et al 2016 furthermore a slight decrease in flu adsorption was observed in the binary system fig 6 b possibly owing to the competition with cip to identify cip and flu intermediates in single systems hplc esi ms technology was employed the mass spectra obtained are presented in table s4 figure s8 depicts the variation in the total ion current tic chromatogram of the detected intermediates during cip oxidation seven major intermediates with molecular ion masses of m z 332 348 334 316 1 316 2 245 and 202 were identified fig s9 using the esi positive mode that enable to suggest a plausible degradation pathway scheme 1 after 30 min of reaction the peak of cip molecule m z 332 at rt 10 61 decreased with appearance of peaks at rt 6 39 and 2 32 corresponding to m z 334 and 348 respectively this indicates that 1 the cleavage of the piperazine ring m z 332 334 owing to attack by so4 and oh li et al 2020 shah et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 and 2 the hydroxylation reaction m z 332 348 owing to the attack of the quinolone ring by oh deng et al 2017 li et al 2020 occurred simultaneously at the initial oxidation of cip in the pms rm ha system then we observed the decrease in peaks for m z 334 and m z 348 after 1 h of reaction with appearance of two peaks at rt 4 02 and 5 53 corresponding to m z 316 1 or 316 2 table s4 these can be attributed to 1 the defluorination that resulted in the formation of m z 316 1 from m z 334 zhao et al 2017 and 2 piperazine ring opening decarboxylation that resulted in the formation of m z 316 2 from m z 348 additionally a peak at 1 06 rt corresponding to m z 202 was first detected after 1 h of reaction fig s8 after 3 h of reaction most of the peaks had disappeared and two distinct peaks at rt 6 57 and rt 1 06 corresponding to m z 245 and m z 202 respectively were observed after 5 h when the reaction reached completion the only peak that remained corresponded to m z 202 this study is the first to report the intermediate m z 202 as a byproduct of cip oxidation owing to pms activation these results indicate that the loss of a secondary amine nitrogen by m z 316 1 owing to so4 attack could lead to the formation of m z 245 ao et al 2018 from which m z 202 could be obtained via cn bond cleavage decarboxylation and hydroxylation similarly m z 202 could also be formed from m z 316 2 via the further oxidation of the piperazine ring coupled with cn bond cleavage figure s10 depicts the variation in the tic chromatogram of the detected intermediates during flu oxidation during flu removal three intermediates with molecular ion masses of m z 262 296 and 252 and two others with molecular ion masses of m z 242 and 244 were detected fig s11 from the positive fig s10 a and negative fig s10 b esi modes respectively based on the identified products a plausible degradation pathway was proposed scheme 2 the strong signal of m z 262 rt 17 51 which could be attributed to the flu molecule decreased after 1 h of reaction as a new peak at rt 16 5 corresponding to m z 296 positive mode appeared additionally a relatively small signal appeared at rt 16 4 m z 242 in the negative mode these findings indicate that both i the hydroxylation of the quinolone ring the ring opening on the c c double bond m z 262 296 feng et al 2017a 2017b 2016 qi et al 2019 and ii the defluorination of flu m z 262 242 feng et al 2015 rodrigues silva et al 2013 occurred simultaneously during the initial oxidation of flu by the pms rm ha system after 2 h of reaction a new peak at rt 15 76 corresponding to m z 252 positive mode was observed this possibly resulted from hydroxylation ring cleavage and flu decarboxylation m z 262 252 however as the reaction progressed 2 h 5 h the intensity of the peak corresponding to m z 296 decreased while the intensity of those corresponding to m z 252 rt 15 76 positive mode and m z 244 rt 16 55 negative mode increased these results indicate that pathway 2 may be the main degradation pathway through which the formation of m z 252 from m z 296 via decarboxylation can be induced additionally via hydroxylation defluorination and hydrogen abstraction m z 252 could be further converted to m z 244 this study is the first to report the identification of the intermediate m z 244 as a byproduct of flu oxidation owing to pms activation 3 5 impact of hw components on the removal performance the kinetics of flu and cip removal from hw is illustrated in fig 7 no significant flu removal was observed in hw kapp 0 014 h 1 table s2 fig 7 a the inhibitory effect in hw can be attributed to the major dissolved components in hw including chlorides phosphates nitrates sulfates and dissolved organic matter it should be noted that these wastewater components exist at very high loading with respect to the concentration of target compounds e g molar ratio phosphate flu 126 chloride flu 3540 which may lead to strong competitive and or radical scavenging effects to evaluate the effect of each of these ligands on flu removal efficiency the flu removal by the pms rm ha system in upw was examined in the presence of inorganic ions and organic matter similar to those present in hw fig 8 the results obtained revealed that chlorides significantly improved the flu removal as evidenced by an approximately 25 fold higher k app value kapp 14 401 h 1 table s2 relative to that obtained in the absence of chlorides kapp 0 577 h 1 reportedly cl in water can react with pms generating hocl eq 8 yang et al 2019 moreover chlorine radicals cl can be formed in water when chlorides in water react with so4 eq 9 lei et al 2019 furthermore cl in moderate concentration as in this study and at neutral ph could react with so4 resulting in the production of oh lutze et al 2015 this indicates that there was an additional possibility for converting so4 into oh therefore the enhancement of the flu removal in presence of cl can be attributed to the formation of reactive cl species and or oh 8 c l hso 5 so 4 2 hocl k 2 06 10 3 m 1 s 1 9 c l so 4 so 4 2 cl k 3 1 10 8 m 1 s 1 on the contrary the presence of phosphates resulted in a strong inhibition of the flu removal whereas nitrate kapp 0 267 h 1 and sulfate kapp 0 245 h 1 exhibited lower flu removal inhibitory effects fig 8 this strong inhibitory effect of phosphates can be explained by considering its strong adsorption onto metal oxides thereby reducing the interaction between the oxidant and solid surface indeed we confirmed this strong binding of phosphate by conducting an independent adsorption set which showed great affinity of phosphate to rm surfaces up to 5 mgp g at ph 7 at molecular level phosphate binds strongly to fe iii oxides through monodentate and or multidentate mononuclear surface complexes and a variety of surface complexation models has been proposed to describe the phosphate removal by mineral surfaces khare et al 2005 furthermore phosphate can also exhibit strong scavenging effect toward so4 and oh eq 10 and 11 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 10 s o 4 hp o 4 2 hp o 4 s o 4 2 k 1 2 10 6 m 1 s 1 11 oh hp o 4 2 hp o 4 o h k 1 5 10 5 m 1 s 1 reportedly humic substances generally act as ros scavengers given that some of their electron rich moieties e g phenolics can react with radical species deng et al 2017 jiang et al 2016 additionally other quinone moieties can possibly activate pms to generate ros thereby accelerating the degradation of organic pollutants deng et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 to investigate the effect of humic acids on flu removal lha was added to the pms rm ha system fig 8 the results obtained demonstrated that lha caused a slight decrease in flu removal efficiency indicating that humic acids have lesser effect on flu removal using the pms rm ha system the strong inhibitory effect of phosphates was also observed in hw containing a binary fq system i e flu cip fig s12 therefore it can be concluded that the presence of phosphates in hw is primarily responsible for the degradation of flu removal efficiency in the pms rm ha system nevertheless cip degradation was not affected by the presence of these compounds fig 7 b because of its fast reaction with so4 to overcome the inhibitory effect of phosphates in hw the concentration of pms was increased from 1 to 5 mm fig 9 a thus there was a gradual increase in flu removal efficiency as pms concentration increased up to 5 mm at which complete flu removal was observed a significant increase in the k app value was observed at a pms concentration of 3 mm kapp 0 177 h 1 table s2 and 5 mm kapp 0 388 h 1 in comparison with that at 1 mm kapp 0 014 h 1 this can be attributed to a higher production of so4 as pms concentration increases regarding toc removal a removal efficiency of only 30 was obtained using 3 mm pms for 24 h fig 9 b however the sequential addition of 3 mm pms over seven times enhanced toc removal up to approximately 95 after the seventh addition fig 9 b suggesting that controlling the pms concentration as well as its addition mode could guarantee the successful mineralization of fqs using the pms rm ha system during the sequential experiments the amount of metals leached i e al fe si and ti was insignificant significantly low concentrations during the first reaction as presented in table s5 additionally no remarkable increase in metal leaching was observed over seven reaction cycles fig s13 indicating that rm was fairly stable in the pms rm ha system 4 conclusion in this study the effective activation of pms by the rm ha system for the oxidative degradation of flu and cip in hw was demonstrated and the associated oxidation pathways were proposed on the rm surface ha acted as a reducing agent in the feiii feii cycle and its addition to the pms rm suspension significantly enhanced fq removal the results also demonstrated that so4 possibly played a more crucial role in fq removal in pms rm ha systems than oh additionally the high reactivity between so4 and cip which resulted in the rapid removal of cip was observed under all the experimental conditions employed in this study furthermore the effect of competition on flu removal depended on the nature of the organic and inorganic compounds present in hw particularly phosphates could significantly inhibit flu removal owing to their strong adsorption onto the rm surface as well as their scavenging effect toward so4 however this inhibitory effect could be successfully overcome by controlling both the pms concentration and its addition mode globally approximately 95 of alumina is produced via the bayer process which yields 1 2 tons of rm for each ton of alumina that is produced bray et al 2018 particularly in 2019 132 million tonnes of alumina were produced globally according to the data from world aluminum thus 132 264 million tonnes of rm were generated considering this massive quantity of rm generated annually as well as the environmental problems associated with its high alkalinity developing a novel method by which it can be properly utilized as a high value added material is considerably desired in this light the results obtained in this study i highlight the potential application of the rm ha combination as an efficient pms activator for the mineralization of fqs in hw under dark conditions and ii

17692,in this study a novel peroxymonosulfate pms activation method which combines a solid waste i e red mud rm and a reducing agent i e hydroxylamine ha for the oxidative degradation of fluoroquinolones fqs i e flumequine flu and ciprofloxacin cip in hospital wastewater hw was developed the addition of ha into the pms rm suspension significantly enhanced flu removal owing to its ability to enhance the fe iii fe ii cycle on the rm surface the results of the quenching experiments suggested the predominance of so4 over oh in the pms rm ha system moreover owing to the greater reactivity between cip and so4 cip removal was more effective than flu removal additionally the liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy lc ms analysis revealed that the oxidation of cip and flu by pms rm ha occurred via sequential and separate processes involving ring cleavage hydroxylation decarbonylation and defluorination surprisingly the wastewater components exhibited contrasting effects on flu removal in hw natural organic matter nitrate and sulfate showed a slight impact on the removal performance of flu whereas chloride improved the oxidation extent however phosphate significantly inhibited the flu removal because of its competitive binding at the rm surface and its scavenging effect towards so4 this inhibitory effect was overcome by increasing the pms concentration and its sequential addition thus guaranteeing successful mineralization of flu in hw these results show that the rm ha system can be utilized to activate pms for the removal of antibiotics in wastewater

et al 2015 indeed the presence of penicillins macrolides sulfonamides fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines in hospital wastewater hw has been reported with concentrations up to 15 µg l reemtsma and jekel 2006 the amoxicillin concentration measured in hw of a large german hospital was between 28 and 82 7 µg l and the ciprofloxacin in concentrations between 3 and 89 µg l reemtsma and jekel 2006 fluoroquinolones fqs are the most potent antimicrobial agents used in human and veterinary medicine because their removal during wastewater treatment is incomplete and they are continually being released into the environment they are frequently detected in aquatic systems rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 watkinson et al 2009 particularly the presence of flumequine flu and ciprofloxacin cip in surface water groundwater and sediments at concentrations ranging from nanograms to micrograms per liter have been reported zhang et al 2015 to remove such antibiotics from wastewater advanced oxidation processes aops have attracted considerable attention recently owing to their ability to generate reactive oxygen species ros that can efficiently remove refractory and non biodegradable organic contaminants boczkaj and fernandes 2017 deng et al 2017 recently sulfate radical so4 based aops have become a new focus for wastewater treatment owing to the better selectivity and longer half life of so4 in comparison with the hydroxyl radical oh reportedly peroxymonosulfate pms can be activated by uv qi et al 2019 heat xu et al 2016 or a transition metal sang et al 2020 however its activation in uv and heat systems is associated with disadvantages such as high cost and high energy consumption zou et al 2013 additionally co2 pms systems demonstrate the best performance with respect to so4 generation anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 however the toxicity of cobalt as well as the resulting secondary pollution associated with its use stand as a major setback to the application of co2 pms systems deng et al 2017 ji et al 2013 more recently it has been reported that replacing cobalt with a nontoxic metal such as mn2 or fe2 opens up new avenues for research into the development of more economical and efficient pms activation techniques cao et al 2019 furthermore to activate pms for the oxidative degradation of organic contaminants fe containing minerals including

remediation technologies bhatnagar et al 2011 reportedly it has been used as an adsorbent for dyes phenols and heavy metals bhatnagar et al 2011 sushil and batra 2008 however its ability to enhance the advanced oxidation of antibiotics while eliminating the emerging contaminants from wastewater has not yet been clarified therefore the primary objective of this study was to investigate the ability of rm to enhance the advanced oxidation of antibiotics while removing antibiotic contamination from wastewater additionally for the first time its catalytic activity with respect to the removal of antibiotics from hospital wastewater hw under mild conditions was examined and the ability of hydroxylamine nh2oh ha which is a reducing agent to accelerate ros generation in the presence

adjustment was done within 5 min after adding rm and pms by 0 1 m solutions of hcl and naoh respectively for the experiment with hw the suspended solid was filtered and 5 µm of fq was spiked into the hw to identify cip and flu intermediates resulting from the oxidation by the pms rm ha system a thermo ultimate 3000 hplc with an ltq ion trap mass spectrometer thermo electron corp usa equipped with an esi source that can be operated in both the positive and negative ion modes was used more details for lc ms analysis are provided in supplementary data to perform quenching experiments using t buoh and i proh the desired quenchers were added into the reaction solutions prior to the addition of ha and pms at each sampling time 1 5 ml of the treated solution was collected for the determination of the concentrations of fqs using hplc to provide the direct evidence of radical generation in the pms rm ha system we prepared two different systems using pms rm ha and h2o2 rm ha at ph 7 and analyzed the radical generation by electron spin resonance spectrometer esr jes fa200 jeol the suspension containing 100 mm 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was injected to esr tube and analyzed at a resonance frequency of 9 45 ghz microwave power of 0 998 mw modulation frequency of 100 khz field center of 340 mt modulation amplitude of 1 0 g sweep width of 1 0 g time constant of 30 ms and sweep time of 30 s the effects of the co presence of inorganic phosphate sulfate chloride and nitrate anions and organic lha species on flu degradation were investigated in upw under the same conditions an ion chromatography instrument ic dionex dx 120 equipped with a conductivity detector and an ionpac as19 analytical column 4 250 mm with koh solution as the mobile phase was used to determine the concentration of the inorganic species the amount of fe leached during the reaction was measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer genesys 10s thermo at 510 nm following the 1 10 phenanthroline method tamura et al 1974 the concentration of residual pms was measured by the iodometric titration method liang et al 2008 after 6 h of reaction 0 1 ml of aliquot was filtered and transferred to a quartz cuvette containing 2 9 ml of ki and nahco3 solution 600 mm and 70 mm respectively for pms concentration measurement by uv vis spectrophotometer at 352 nm liang et al 2008 the leaching of other metals after pms sequential addition was also monitored using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms 7800 agilent usa the degradation products of ha i e no2 and no3 were quantified using ic mineralization i e the removal of total organic carbon toc was investigated using a toc meter shimadzu toc vcsh all experiments were performed in triplicates and demonstrated good reproducibility within an average standard deviation of less than 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of rm xrf analysis demonstrated that rm predominantly consisted of iron oxide 37 alumina 24 and silica 10 in combination with other mineral phases including tio2 na2o mgo cao k2o mno and p2o5 table s1 fig 1 a which illustrates the xrd diffractogram of raw rm indicates the presence of peaks corresponding to hematite boehmite γ alo oh anatase tio2 calcite caco3 and quartz sio2 based on the zeta potential measurements under different ph conditions 2 4 6 and 8 the point of zero charge pzc of rm fig s1 was 7 3 and its bet surface area determined from the multipoint n2 adsorption isotherm was 23 m2 g 1 additionally the characterization of the morphology and structural features of rm using tem analysis at different optical magnifications revealed that it consisted of nanosized particles 100 nm with different morphologies fig 1 b that were aggregated to form bigger particles fig 1 c 3 2 enhanced removal of flu using the pms rm ha system the effect of ph variation on flu adsorption onto the rm surface is illustrated in fig s2 as typically encountered in the adsorption of organic anions onto metal oxides flu adsorption was high under low ph conditions and decreased as the ph increased this observed sorption behavior can be attributed to the combined effect of ph dependent flu speciation pka 6 5 and rm surface charge characteristics pzc 7 3 under ph conditions higher than both pka and pzc the flu and rm surfaces were negatively charged leading to less favorable electrostatic interactions to determine the most efficient flu removal system the kinetics of flu removal with and without pms rm and ha were investigated fig 2 assuming that rm promotes the generation of ros leading to the degradation of the target compound and that the concentration of these generated species are constant over the reaction time the flu removal kinetics can be described using eq 1 which is a pseudo first order equation 1 fqs t fqs 0 ex p k a p p t where kapp which represents the rate constant h 1 of the pseudo first order reaction is obtained by considering the linear regression of ln fqs fqs 0 vs time t the control experiment using ha alone demonstrated that the addition of 0 05 mm ha did not have any significant effect on the flu removal kinetics furthermore using 1 mm of pms alone or in combination with 0 05 mm ha resulted in an flu removal of up to 40 the fast removal occurred within 1 h of reaction could be attributed to direct pms action yin et al 2018 and or alkaline activation by naoh used for ph adjustment at the initial stage of reaction wang and wang 2018 when 0 05 g l 1 of rm and 0 05 mm ha were used the flu removal efficiency was 30 showing the initial adsorption capacity of rm for the flu removal contrarily after 6 h of reaction in the rm pms system the flu removal efficiency observed was 75 kapp 0 248 h 1 table s2 which might be caused by sum of flu adsorption by rm alone and flu removal by pms alone the flu adsorption desorption equilibrium was attained after 1 h see dotted line in fig 2 and finally complete flu removal was observed after 6 h of reaction using a system obtained by adding 0 05 mm ha to the pms rm system this new system exhibited a kapp value 0 577 h 1 that was 2 3 times higher than that of the pms rm only system suggesting that ha plays a crucial role in enhancing flu removal the enhanced flu removal in the pms rm ha system possibly resulted from the reduction of fe iii to fe ii by ha on the surface of α fe2o3 present in rm eq 2 and 3 which activated pms generating reactive radicals i e so4 and oh eq 4 and 5 zou et al 2013 2 n h 2 oh f e iii f e ii n h 2 o h 3 f e iii n h 2 o f e ii nho h 4 hso 5 f e ii so 4 f e iii o h 5 hso 5 f e ii so 4 2 f e iii oh to investigate the fe iii reduction capacity of ha the production of dissolved fe ii before and after ha addition under anaerobic conditions was investigated figure s3 illustrates that in the presence of ha virtually no fe ii dissolution occurs however xps analysis demonstrated that peaks corresponding to si and ti on rm surface were not significantly changed before and after ha addition fig 3 a and c whereas main peak corresponding to al 2p3 2 shifted from 73 9 to 74 5 ev fig 3 d indicating the formation of al hydroxides after the reaction epa et al 2004 these observations possibly resulted from the formation of fe ii al iii layered double hydroxides during the reaction between the reduced fe ii and al2o3 on the rm surface elzinga 2012 the portion of deconvoluted peak of o1s at 532 1 ev hydroxide species certainly increased to 35 8 when it compares with rm alone 25 5 fig 3 b in addition h2o peak vacancy peak ovac and o2 peak were observed at 533 8 531 4 and 530 ev respectively liu et al 2017 to confirm the surface reduction of fe iii to fe ii by ha the fe region of the xps spectra was also analyzed the fe 2p3 2 narrow scan spectra of raw rm consisted of three main peaks at 709 5 fe ii species 710 7 and 712 8 ev fe iii species fig 3 e sihn et al 2019 these results indicate that the proportions of the fe ii and fe iii surfaces were 10 4 and 89 6 respectively when ha was added to the rm suspension an increase in the fe ii surface content 26 8 was observed indicating that the fe iii surface had been reduced to fe ii these results imply that ha can reduce fe iii to fe ii on the rm surface thus enhancing pms activation however a significant decrease of the fe ii content from 26 8 to 1 3 was observed when we added pms to ha rm system suggesting that the reduced fe ii surface can be oxidized to fe iii after pms activation esr analysis was conducted to provide more direct evidence of radical generation in the pms rm ha system fig 4 we have prepared two different systems using pms rm ha and h2o2 rm ha at ph 7 no signal was detected in rm h2o2 ha system indicating that h2o2 could not be activated in rm ha suspension at ph 7 in comparison apparent signals of dmpooh adduct with the intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 and dmpo so4 adduct were observed in rm pms ha system the predominant reactive species was further investigated using t buoh and i proh because of their different selectivity i e second order rate constants with oh and so4 i proh reacts with both oh and so4 with the second order reaction constant k ho i pr 1 9 109 m 1 s 1 and k so 4 i pr 4 7 42 107 m 1 s 1 while t buoh can be considered to be more selective toward oh k ho t but 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 than so4 k so 4 t but 4 8 4 105 m 1 s 1 anbar and neta 1967 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 the percentages of oh and so4 that reacted with flu and the scavenger could be estimated using the bimolecular rate constants and concentrations of each species kamagate et al 2020 according to our calculations table s3 t buoh 5 mm is selective for oh since it will react with more than 98 of oh i proh was used at very high concentration 20 mm to ensure effective and total scavenging of both radical species addition of 5 mm of t buoh resulted in a slight decrease in flu removal fig s4 suggesting that hydroxyl radical is not the main reactive species for flu removal the slight inhibition observed could be attributed to the reactivity of t buoh with so4 under our experimental conditions table s3 the addition of i proh 20 mm almost completely inhibited flu degradation confirming the predominance of the sulfate radical fig s4 in this study the impact of light on the pms rm ha system was also investigated by performing additional experiments under uv a λmax 365 nm intensity 3 4 mw cm 2 and visible light λ 400 nm intensity 0 5 mw cm 2 irradiations fig s5 a in comparison with the results obtained under dark conditions kapp 0 577 h 1 table s2 uv a irradiation resulted in a faster flu removal rate kapp 1 396 h 1 whereas visible light irradiation had no effect on the removal rate kapp 0 495 h 1 this can be explained taking into consideration the inability of visible light to reduce fe iii to fe ii or activate pms qu et al 2019 wang et al 2017 despite the enhanced flu degradation efficiency under uv a irradiation due probably to uv a assist pms activation khan et al 2014 yang et al 2010 further experiments using the pms rm ha system were conducted in the dark 3 3 effects of experimental factors on flu removal the effects of the concentrations of pms ha and rm on flu removal using the pms rm ha system were investigated under a range of pms 0 5 1 5 mm ha 0 05 2 mm and rm 0 05 0 2 g l 1 concentrations the results depicted in fig s6 a and fig 5 a indicate that an increase in pms concentration results in a higher and faster flu removal rate kapp 0 192 and 1 923 h 1 at 0 5 and 1 5 mm respectively table s2 this can be attributed to the increased production of so4 and oh as shown in eq 4 and 5 however higher ha concentrations 0 05 mm exhibit a negative effect on the flu removal rate kapp 0 577 and 0 041 h 1 at 0 05 mm and 2 mm respectively fig s6 b fig 5 b and table s2 these observations support the scavenging role of ha according to eq 6 and 7 zou et al 2013 6 n h 2 oh so 4 so 4 2 nitrogenous products k 1 5 10 7 m s 1 1 7 n h 2 oh oh o h nitrogenous products k 5 0 10 8 m s 1 1 indeed nitrogenous products 0 5 mg l 1 of no3 and no2 which possibly resulted from ha degradation as shown in eq 6 and 7 were observed at the end of the 6 h reaction additionally increasing the rm dosage particularly during the early stage of the reaction fig s6 c and fig 5 c enhanced the flu removal kapp 0 577 and 0 993 h 1 at 0 05 mg l 1 and 0 2 mg l 1 respectively table s2 the effect of ha on the fe iii fe ii cycle on the rm surface was also evaluated using two other reductants i e dithionite and sulfite fig s6 d and fig 5 d in the presence of dithionite the flu removal efficiency was 40 including initial removal of 23 via adsorption while almost no further removal was observed in the presence of sulfite these demonstrated the superior flu removal performance of the pms rm ha system owing to the stronger scavenging properties of dithionite and sulfite toward the radicals k sulfite oh 5 5 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 and k s u l f i t e s o 4 5 0 108 m 1 s 1 neta and huie 1985 not available for dithionite than those toward the ha eq 6 and 7 figure s5 b indicates that ph has a considerable effect on flu sorption and oxidation in the pms rm ha system a significant decrease in flu removal is observed when the initial ph was increased from 6 to 9 at ph phpzc rm i e 7 3 there may be a decrease in the electrostatic repulsion between rm and hso5 resulting in a decrease in the flu removal efficiency conversely at a ph of 6 the electrostatic attractions of both the negatively charged flu and hso5 with the positively charged rm surface are favored these can enhance the initial adsorption of flu and pms activation on rm surface and consequently the increase in the flu removal efficiency 3 4 effect of mixture on removal process and oxidation pathways the effect of the co existence of fqs i e flu and cip on their respective removal was investigated fig 6 depicts that in both single fig 6 a and binary mixture systems fig 6 b 5 μm of cip was completely removed using pms rm ha additionally k app values approximately 11 7 and 11 0 times higher than those for flu removal in both single fig s7 a and binary mixture systems fig s7 b respectively were obtained for cip owing to the faster reaction between cip and so4 k c i p s o 4 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 mahdi ahmed and chiron 2014 cip which contains cyclopropane and piperazine rings exhibits high reactivity with ros via i the cleavage of the cyclopropane moiety owing to the loss of ch2 units and ii the strong interactions between so4 and the piperazine ring guo et al 2017 jiang et al 2016 furthermore a slight decrease in flu adsorption was observed in the binary system fig 6 b possibly owing to the competition with cip to identify cip and flu intermediates in single systems hplc esi ms technology was employed the mass spectra obtained are presented in table s4 figure s8 depicts the variation in the total ion current tic chromatogram of the detected intermediates during cip oxidation seven major intermediates with molecular ion masses of m z 332 348 334 316 1 316 2 245 and 202 were identified fig s9 using the esi positive mode that enable to suggest a plausible degradation pathway scheme 1 after 30 min of reaction the peak of cip molecule m z 332 at rt 10 61 decreased with appearance of peaks at rt 6 39 and 2 32 corresponding to m z 334 and 348 respectively this indicates that 1 the cleavage of the piperazine ring m z 332 334 owing to attack by so4 and oh li et al 2020 shah et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 and 2 the hydroxylation reaction m z 332 348 owing to the attack of the quinolone ring by oh deng et al 2017 li et al 2020 occurred simultaneously at the initial oxidation of cip in the pms rm ha system then we observed the decrease in peaks for m z 334 and m z 348 after 1 h of reaction with appearance of two peaks at rt 4 02 and 5 53 corresponding to m z 316 1 or 316 2 table s4 these can be attributed to 1 the defluorination that resulted in the formation of m z 316 1 from m z 334 zhao et al 2017 and 2 piperazine ring opening decarboxylation that resulted in the formation of m z 316 2 from m z 348 additionally a peak at 1 06 rt corresponding to m z 202 was first detected after 1 h of reaction fig s8 after 3 h of reaction most of the peaks had disappeared and two distinct peaks at rt 6 57 and rt 1 06 corresponding to m z 245 and m z 202 respectively were observed after 5 h when the reaction reached completion the only peak that remained corresponded to m z 202 this study is the first to report the intermediate m z 202 as a byproduct of cip oxidation owing to pms activation these results indicate that the loss of a secondary amine nitrogen by m z 316 1 owing to so4 attack could lead to the formation of m z 245 ao et al 2018 from which m z 202 could be obtained via cn bond cleavage decarboxylation and hydroxylation similarly m z 202 could also be formed from m z 316 2 via the further oxidation of the piperazine ring coupled with cn bond cleavage figure s10 depicts the variation in the tic chromatogram of the detected intermediates during flu oxidation during flu removal three intermediates with molecular ion masses of m z 262 296 and 252 and two others with molecular ion masses of m z 242 and 244 were detected fig s11 from the positive fig s10 a and negative fig s10 b esi modes respectively based on the identified products a plausible degradation pathway was proposed scheme 2 the strong signal of m z 262 rt 17 51 which could be attributed to the flu molecule decreased after 1 h of reaction as a new peak at rt 16 5 corresponding to m z 296 positive mode appeared additionally a relatively small signal appeared at rt 16 4 m z 242 in the negative mode these findings indicate that both i the hydroxylation of the quinolone ring the ring opening on the c c double bond m z 262 296 feng et al 2017a 2017b 2016 qi et al 2019 and ii the defluorination of flu m z 262 242 feng et al 2015 rodrigues silva et al 2013 occurred simultaneously during the initial oxidation of flu by the pms rm ha system after 2 h of reaction a new peak at rt 15 76 corresponding to m z 252 positive mode was observed this possibly resulted from hydroxylation ring cleavage and flu decarboxylation m z 262 252 however as the reaction progressed 2 h 5 h the intensity of the peak corresponding to m z 296 decreased while the intensity of those corresponding to m z 252 rt 15 76 positive mode and m z 244 rt 16 55 negative mode increased these results indicate that pathway 2 may be the main degradation pathway through which the formation of m z 252 from m z 296 via decarboxylation can be induced additionally via hydroxylation defluorination and hydrogen abstraction m z 252 could be further converted to m z 244 this study is the first to report the identification of the intermediate m z 244 as a byproduct of flu oxidation owing to pms activation 3 5 impact of hw components on the removal performance the kinetics of flu and cip removal from hw is illustrated in fig 7 no significant flu removal was observed in hw kapp 0 014 h 1 table s2 fig 7 a the inhibitory effect in hw can be attributed to the major dissolved components in hw including chlorides phosphates nitrates sulfates and dissolved organic matter it should be noted that these wastewater components exist at very high loading with respect to the concentration of target compounds e g molar ratio phosphate flu 126 chloride flu 3540 which may lead to strong competitive and or radical scavenging effects to evaluate the effect of each of these ligands on flu removal efficiency the flu removal by the pms rm ha system in upw was examined in the presence of inorganic ions and organic matter similar to those present in hw fig 8 the results obtained revealed that chlorides significantly improved the flu removal as evidenced by an approximately 25 fold higher k app value kapp 14 401 h 1 table s2 relative to that obtained in the absence of chlorides kapp 0 577 h 1 reportedly cl in water can react with pms generating hocl eq 8 yang et al 2019 moreover chlorine radicals cl can be formed in water when chlorides in water react with so4 eq 9 lei et al 2019 furthermore cl in moderate concentration as in this study and at neutral ph could react with so4 resulting in the production of oh lutze et al 2015 this indicates that there was an additional possibility for converting so4 into oh therefore the enhancement of the flu removal in presence of cl can be attributed to the formation of reactive cl species and or oh 8 c l hso 5 so 4 2 hocl k 2 06 10 3 m 1 s 1 9 c l so 4 so 4 2 cl k 3 1 10 8 m 1 s 1 on the contrary the presence of phosphates resulted in a strong inhibition of the flu removal whereas nitrate kapp 0 267 h 1 and sulfate kapp 0 245 h 1 exhibited lower flu removal inhibitory effects fig 8 this strong inhibitory effect of phosphates can be explained by considering its strong adsorption onto metal oxides thereby reducing the interaction between the oxidant and solid surface indeed we confirmed this strong binding of phosphate by conducting an independent adsorption set which showed great affinity of phosphate to rm surfaces up to 5 mgp g at ph 7 at molecular level phosphate binds strongly to fe iii oxides through monodentate and or multidentate mononuclear surface complexes and a variety of surface complexation models has been proposed to describe the phosphate removal by mineral surfaces khare et al 2005 furthermore phosphate can also exhibit strong scavenging effect toward so4 and oh eq 10 and 11 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 10 s o 4 hp o 4 2 hp o 4 s o 4 2 k 1 2 10 6 m 1 s 1 11 oh hp o 4 2 hp o 4 o h k 1 5 10 5 m 1 s 1 reportedly humic substances generally act as ros scavengers given that some of their electron rich moieties e g phenolics can react with radical species deng et al 2017 jiang et al 2016 additionally other quinone moieties can possibly activate pms to generate ros thereby accelerating the degradation of organic pollutants deng et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 to investigate the effect of humic acids on flu removal lha was added to the pms rm ha system fig 8 the results obtained demonstrated that lha caused a slight decrease in flu removal efficiency indicating that humic acids have lesser effect on flu removal using the pms rm ha system the strong inhibitory effect of phosphates was also observed in hw containing a binary fq system i e flu cip fig s12 therefore it can be concluded that the presence of phosphates in hw is primarily responsible for the degradation of flu removal efficiency in the pms rm ha system nevertheless cip degradation was not affected by the presence of these compounds fig 7 b because of its fast reaction with so4 to overcome the inhibitory effect of phosphates in hw the concentration of pms was increased from 1 to 5 mm fig 9 a thus there was a gradual increase in flu removal efficiency as pms concentration increased up to 5 mm at which complete flu removal was observed a significant increase in the k app value was observed at a pms concentration of 3 mm kapp 0 177 h 1 table s2 and 5 mm kapp 0 388 h 1 in comparison with that at 1 mm kapp 0 014 h 1 this can be attributed to a higher production of so4 as pms concentration increases regarding toc removal a removal efficiency of only 30 was obtained using 3 mm pms for 24 h fig 9 b however the sequential addition of 3 mm pms over seven times enhanced toc removal up to approximately 95 after the seventh addition fig 9 b suggesting that controlling the pms concentration as well as its addition mode could guarantee the successful mineralization of fqs using the pms rm ha system during the sequential experiments the amount of metals leached i e al fe si and ti was insignificant significantly low concentrations during the first reaction as presented in table s5 additionally no remarkable increase in metal leaching was observed over seven reaction cycles fig s13 indicating that rm was fairly stable in the pms rm ha system 4 conclusion in this study the effective activation of pms by the rm ha system for the oxidative degradation of flu and cip in hw was demonstrated and the associated oxidation pathways were proposed on the rm surface ha acted as a reducing agent in the feiii feii cycle and its addition to the pms rm suspension significantly enhanced fq removal the results also demonstrated that so4 possibly played a more crucial role in fq removal in pms rm ha systems than oh additionally the high reactivity between so4 and cip which resulted in the rapid removal of cip was observed under all the experimental conditions employed in this study furthermore the effect of competition on flu removal depended on the nature of the organic and inorganic compounds present in hw particularly phosphates could significantly inhibit flu removal owing to their strong adsorption onto the rm surface as well as their scavenging effect toward so4 however this inhibitory effect could be successfully overcome by controlling both the pms concentration and its addition mode globally approximately 95 of alumina is produced via the bayer process which yields 1 2 tons of rm for each ton of alumina that is produced bray et al 2018 particularly in 2019 132 million tonnes of alumina were produced globally according to the data from world aluminum thus 132 264 million tonnes of rm were generated considering this massive quantity of rm generated annually as well as the environmental problems associated with its high alkalinity developing a novel method by which it can be properly utilized as a high value added material is considerably desired in this light the results obtained in this study i highlight the potential application of the rm ha combination as an efficient pms activator for the mineralization of fqs in hw under dark conditions and ii

17693,waterborne fungi have been recognized as an emerging environmental contaminant in recent years this work was to investigate the inactivation efficiency and mechanisms of ultraviolet light emitting diodes uv leds chlorine cl2 265 280 and 265 280 nm combination and lpuv cl2 254 nm treatments for three fungal species compared with individual disinfection processes control of photoreactivation for fungal species inactivated by uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 was also evaluated the results revealed that the combined uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 processes especially uv leds cl2 exhibited better inactivation performance compared to uv alone and cl2 alone based on the inactivation rate constants and an evident synergistic effect was observed for example the inactivation rates for penicillium polonicum in the processes of uv265 cl2 uv280 cl2 uv265 280 cl2 and lpuv cl2 was 0 142 0 168 0 174 and 0 106 cm2 mj respectively which were all approximately 1 5 fold higher than that of uv alone the synergistic effect of fungal spores inactivation by uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 was due to the high level production of intracellular reactive oxygen species and the reaction of potential extracellular free radicals resistance of the tested fungal spores was as follows trichoderma harzianum penicillium polonicum aspergillus niger in addition the joint effect of dna and other cellular damage resulted in the inhibition of photoreactivation of fungal spores inactivated by uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 compared with that of fungal spore inactivated by uv alone this study may provide reference for controlling the dissemination of waterborne fungi utilizing combined uv leds and free chlorine processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords fungal spores disinfection combined uv leds cl2 process synergistic effect photoreactivation 1 introduction nowadays waterborne fungi have been considered as an emerging environmental contaminants because their spread causes some environmental problems such as turbidity odor or mycotoxin emissions hageskal et al 2006 pereira et al 2009 oliveira et al 2013 typical representatives of pathogenic fungal species in drinking water including aspergillus spp and penicillium spp ma et al 2015 many waterborne diseases such as skin asthma allergy and hypersensitivity pneumonitis are associated with fungal contamination of water systems curtis et al 2004 therefore waterborne fungi have been recognized as a potential health risk to human beings especially to human beings at a higher risk of invasive infections furthermore the presence of waterborne fungi should be considered in the assessment of the quality and microbiological safety of drinking water sonigo et al 2011 pereira et al 2013 chemical disinfectants including chlorine chlorine dioxide chloramine and ozone were applied to control fungi in water supply systems waterborne fungi such as aspergillus versicolor and penicillium purpurogenum exhibited higher resistance to chlorine and monochloramine disinfection compared to bacteria and viruses the ct values of chlorine and monochloramine for 3 log inactivation of the fungi were 48 99 194 70 mg min l 1 and 90 33 531 30 mg min l 1 respectively ma and bibby 2017 however chloramine has to be prepared in situ and strictly controlled during the process to ensure the formation of monochloramine holder et al 2014 savi and scussel 2014 have demonstrated that the germination of fungal conidia can be inhibited using 60 μmol mol 1 o3 however o3 is also toxic and corrosive ahn et al 2013 wen et al 2017a found that chlorine dioxide was more efficient than chlorine in the inactivation of fungal spores and an inactivation efficiency of 99 could be achieved with a ct value of 1 845 mg min l 1 although chlorine dioxide is effective the preparation and preservation processes are challenging huber et al 2005 uv disinfection which is the most commonly used physical disinfection method and which does not produce toxic byproducts has attracted increasing research interest liu et al 2006 nevertheless the traditional low pressure lp and medium pressure mp mercury lamp have certain shortcomings for example they contain toxic mercury and have a relatively short lifetime aoyagi et al 2011 as an emerging semiconductor technology uv light emitting diodes uv leds have been proposed as an alternative uv source for water disinfection these diodes have superior characteristics such as no mercury requirement diverse wavelengths compactness and potential for less energy consumption wurtele et al 2011 song et al 2016 many studies have demonstrated the inactivation efficiency of waterborne pathogens e g e coli bacteriophage qβ b subtilis spores fungal spores by uv leds emitting at various wavelengths oguma et al 2013 rattanakul and oguma 2018 wan et al 2020 however uv cannot maintain a durative disinfection effect because uv induced lesions could be repaired via photoreactivation and dark repair hijnen et al 2006 pescheck 2019 furthermore uv irradiated waterborne fungi still have a high risk of reactivation wen et al 2019b 2019c thus increasing the biological risk in water supply systems shang et al 2009 showed that uvc irradiation with the addition of titanium dioxide tio2 1 0 mg l could significantly repress the photoreactivation and dark repair of fecal coliform bacteria while studies on the photoreactivation inhibition of fungal spores by uv based techniques were limited therefore effective methods for controlling the photoreactivation of fungi in water need to be investigated recently a combined process of uv leds and chlorine cl2 treatment was explored as an attractive alternative in the advanced oxidation process aop field the process was found to be efficient in removing different contaminants and microorganisms rattanakul et al 2015 gao et al 2019 li et al 2020 in addition the photolysis of free chlorine hocl ocl during uv leds cl2 treatment is an important source of reactive chlorine species rcs and oh previous studies have shown that the efficiency of the uv leds cl2 process strongly depends on the uv wavelength and solution ph compared to lpuv uv leds at longer wavelength can enhance the photolysis of ocl thus accelerating the yields of free radicals at alkaline ph values watts and linden 2007 yin et al 2018 zou et al 2019 kim et al 2020 therefore simultaneous application of uv leds with different wavelengths and cl2 is a promising disinfection method many researchers have investigated the combined and sequential disinfection of water using uv and cl2 and the synergistic effect on the removal of e coli antibiotic resistance genes and total coliforms murphy et al 2008 wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 li et al 2018 reported that the inactivation rate constants for bacillus subtilis spores by uv265 cl2 and uv280 cl2 were 2 fold higher than those by uv265 and uv280 alone in addition the significant role of oh formed by uv cl2 treatment in the synergistic effect has been proved the synergistic effect with a synergistic factor of 2 1 found for bacteriophage ms2 inactivation by uv cl2 treatment was because of the viral genome damage caused by the common effect of active chlorine species and oh radicals but the influence of rcs was unclear which was believed to be related to the genome damage rattanakul and oguma 2017 chen et al 2020 found that the enhancement degradation of algae laden in the process of uvc irradiation 254 nm combined with chlorine was primarily due to the role of oh rather than that of rcs however the efficiency of uv cl2 based aops on the disinfection of waterborne fungi has been hardly investigated a comparison of performances of uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 on the inactivation of fungi in water has not been reported additional work is required to comprehensively compare the effects of uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 on the inactivation of waterborne fungi during the uv cl2 process flow cytometry fcm combined with various fluorescence stains has been considered as an efficient means to detect damage to the microbial cell membrane changes in nucleic acids and the physiological state of cells which was widely used in the detection of bacteria phe et al 2005 mesquita et al 2013 wen et al 2015 2016 the application of fcm has also been reported for the assessment of fungal viability in water the metabolic activity of trichoderma was evaluated by fcm using dihydroethidium dhe stain and a 9 fold increase in the fluorescence intensity for trichoderma after being incubated for 10 h was observed bradner and nevalainen 2003 oliveira et al 2020 measured the membrane permeability and enzymatic activity of three aspergillus species inactivated by uv leds 255 and 265 nm using fcm an accurate simple and rapid method to count waterborne fungal spores employing fcm was established and verified to assess the efficiency of common disinfectants used in water treatment by wen et al 2020 for different genera of fungal spores the correlation coefficients of the results measured by fcm with microscopic counts and heterotrophic plate counts were 0 988 and 0 996 respectively therefore the employment of fcm technology to discriminate the viability of fungal spores in the disinfection process of uv cl2 is promising the focus of this work was as follows 1 to investigate the inactivation efficiency of uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 treatments for three waterborne fungal species compared to those by individual disinfection processes 2 to analyze the mechanisms responsible for the synergetic effects of these combined processes 3 to determine the difference between uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 and 4 to evaluate the control efficiency of photoreactivation for fungal species inactivated by uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of fungal spore suspensions three dominant genera of fungal spores isolated from groundwater were selected in this work penicillium polonicum p polonicum aspergillus niger a niger and trichoderma harzianum t harzianum the detailed procedure for the preparation of the suspension of fungal spores has been described previously and the stock suspension was maintained at 2 4 108 cfu ml wan et al 2020 2 2 inactivation experiments two types of uv led chips 265 and 280 nm leds were used in this research irradiation by uv leds cl2 lpuv cl2 and uv alone was conducted in batch reactors wen et al 2017b wan et al 2020 the fungal spore suspension was diluted with phosphate buffer solution pbs and the concentration was maintained at 106 cfu ml before irradiation during the combined uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 processes sodium hypochlorite naocl stock solution was simultaneously added with uv irradiation to achieve an initial free chlorine concentration of 2 0 mg l the concentration of free chlorine was determined by n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd spectrophotometry rice et al 2012 samples were taken at intervals and the reaction was immediately quenched using sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 all reagents used in this study were at least of analytical grade for uv leds cl2 a 10 ml spore suspension was placed in a petri dish d 4 cm and irradiated at a distance of 2 cm from the light source for lpuv cl2 the fungal spore suspension 100 ml was placed in a petri dish d 12 cm and irradiated 50 cm from the light source samples were taken at intervals diluted serially and then plated on dichloran rose bengal chloramphenicol agar in triplicate the plates 20 300 colonies were chosen to count colonies after incubation for 2 4 days 27 c for uv alone uv leds and lpuv processes the reaction conditions were as described above but no chlorine was added into the dishes irradiance of uv leds and lpuv was detected by iodide iodate actinometry rahn et al 2003 2006 the irradiance for 265 280 265 280 nm combination uv leds and lpuv was 0 215 0 214 0 185 and 0 120 mw cm2 respectively the lpuv reactor was a quasi collimated apparatus whereas the uv leds reactor used in this work was not a completely parallel light source the petri factors were 0 86 and 0 91 for the 265 nm and 280 nm leds 0 90 for the combined 265 and 280 nm uv leds and 0 96 for the lpuv experiments bolton and linden 2003 before the experiment the uv leds 5 min and lpuv 30 min apparatus had to be switched on to warm up chlorination experiments cl2 alone in the absence of uv were performed at room temperature under dark conditions a mixed solution 100 ml of pbs and fungal spores was prepared the reaction was initiated with the same chlorine concentration as that used in the combined uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 processes procedures of sampling and viability analysis have been described above 2 3 photoreactivation experiments after 2 log10 inactivation by uv leds cl2 lpuv cl2 and uv alone the suspensions were subjected to photoreactivation the details have been described by wen et al 2019c 2 4 mechanisms analysis flow cytometric fcm measurements membrane integrity and intracellular reactive oxygen species ros level of spores were analyzed using fcm accuri c6 bd usa the threshold value for the green fluorescence channel fl1 was kept at 600 the flow rate was set as 33 μl min and the count rate remained below 500 particles s the detection range of the fcm used in this study was 103 105 cfu ml thus samples were diluted before analysis sybr green ι and propidium iodide sg pi dyes were applied to assess the membrane integrity of the inactivated spores dihydroethidium dhe dye was applied to assess the intracellular ros level of inactivated spores the detailed staining procedure has been introduced in a previous research wen et al 2020 sem analysis to examine the morphological changes of the fungal spores spores suspensions before and after inactivation were photographed using scanning electron microscope sem quanta 600f fei usa details corresponding to samples preparation have been provided in previous studies wen et al 2019a kang et al 2015 2 5 data analysis 2 5 1 inactivation kinetics inactivation efficiency of uv alone cl2 alone uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 can be described as follows 1 n l og n 0 n where n 0 and n are the concentrations of the viable fungal spores cfu ml before and after inactivation and n is the value of log inactivation uv fluence was the product of uv irradiance mw cm2 and irradiation time s the geeraerd and van impe model fitting tool ginafit was applied to depict the inactivation process of spores berney et al 2006 inactivation rate constants of fungal spores for uv alone uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 were calculated from the linear part of the fluence response curves the models of log linear regression plus tail and log linear regression plus shoulder plus tail were employed in this work the evaluation of synergistic effects of the uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 processes were assessed by inactivation rate constants and the synergistic factor sf was calculated as follows marjanovic et al 2018 2 s f uv leds cl 2 k uv leds cl 2 k uv leds k cl 2 3 s f lpuv cl 2 k lpuv cl 2 k lpuv k cl 2 2 6 photoreactivation kinetics the following equation was used to describe photoreactivation was 4 survival ratio n r n 0 100 where n 0 is the concentration of viable fungal spores before uv alone uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 irradiation cfu ml and n r is the concentration of viable spores after photoreactivation for a certain time cfu ml a saturation type first order reaction model kashimada et al 1996 was applied to depict the photoreactivation process the equation was as follows 5 s s m s 0 1 e k 1 t s 0 where k 1 is the first order rate constant of photoreactivation s 0 is the survival ratio after inactivation n d n 0 n d is the concentration of viable fungal spores after inactivation s is the survival ratio at time t n r n 0 and s m is the maximum survival ratio the control efficiency ce was calculated in this work to depict the ability of inhibiting photoreactivation by uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 treatments the equation was as follows 6 c e s uv s uv cl 2 s uv 100 where s uv is the maximum survival ratio during photoreactivation after inactivation by uv alone and s uv cl2 is the maximum survival ratio during the photoreactivation after inactivation by uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 all experiments were conducted in triplicate one way anova was applied to evaluate the statistical differences experimental data were defined to be statistical different at significance level of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 inactivation efficiency by uv cl2 and uv cl2 fungal spores inactivated by uv alone cl2 alone uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 were shown in fig 1 exposure to only cl2 for 100 min led to an inactivation of lower than 1 0 log for p polonicum and lower than 0 5 log for a niger and t harzianum which was negligible compared to that caused by uv alone irradiation uv leds of 265 280 265 280 nm combination and lpuv the uv leds could more efficiently inactivate fungal spores compared to lpuv and detailed discussion has been provided in a previous study wan et al 2020 the fungal spore inactivation efficiency of the combined processes of uv265 cl2 uv280 cl2 uv265 280 cl2 and lpuv cl2 were significantly greater than that by uv leds or lpuv alone p 0 05 for p polonicum at a uv fluence of 40 mj cm2 the uv265 cl2 uv280 cl2 uv265 280 cl2 and lpuv cl2 treatment led to an inactivation of 2 76 log10 3 38 log10 3 26 log10 and 1 90 log10 respectively compared to the 2 46 log 2 91 log10 3 03 log10 and 1 22 log10 achieved by uv265 alone uv280 alone uv265 280 alone and lpuv alone respectively noticeably among the combined processes uv leds cl2 especially uv280 cl2 and uv265 280 cl2 exhibited better inactivation performance than that of lpuv cl2 taking p polonicum for example a 2 log10 inactivation was achieved with a uv fluence of 30 2 20 2 and 27 2 mj cm2 for uv265 cl2 uv280 cl2 and uv265 280 cl2 respectively in contrast for the same log10 inactivation lpuv cl2 required a higher uv fluence of approximately 40 mj cm2 similar results were also obtained for the inactivation of a niger and t harzianum upon the introduction of cl2 treatment simultaneously with the uv irradiation the resistance of the tested fungal spores was as follows t harzianum p polonicum a niger this resistance mainly depends on the differences in the intracellular enzyme and pigment content of the spores sonigo et al 2011 braga et al 2015 3 2 kinetics and synergistic effect inactivation rate constants k for fungal spores treated by uv alone uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 were calculated from a linear part fig 2 which showed a good fitting with the pseudo first order model the inactivation rate constants by cl2 alone for p polonicum a niger and t harzianum were only 0 022 0 011 and 0 008 min 1 respectively however the inactivation rate constants of uv alone and cl2 alone were lower than those of uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 for example for p polonicum the inactivation rate constants of uv265 cl2 uv280 cl2 uv265 280 cl2 and lpuv cl2 were 0 142 0 168 0 174 and 0 106 cm2 mj respectively these values were approximately 1 5 fold higher than that of sole uv additionally k of a niger treated with uv alone cl2 alone uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 were relative lower than that of p polonicum and t harzianum which was consistent with the log10 reduction results that the higher resistance of a niger than the other two fungal species notably the rate constants of uv leds cl2 especially for uv280 cl2 and uv265 280 cl2 were higher than those of lpuv cl2 which agreed with the conclusion obtained from a previous study that the inactivation efficiencies of fungal spores reported higher under uv wavelengths of 280 and 265 280 nm combination wan et al 2020 to evaluate the synergistic effect of the uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 processes on fungal spores inactivation the synergistic factor sf was calculated according to the method depicted in section 2 5 and the specific values were shown in table s1 for the inactivation of t harzianum an obvious synergistic effect was observed for the uv265 cl2 uv280 cl2 and uv265 280 cl2 processes the sf values of which were 1 484 1 572 and 1 444 respectively however the sf for the inactivation of t harzianum by lpuv cl2 was 0 981 indicating there was no synergistic effect for p polonicum the sf values of the uv265 cl2 uv280 cl2 uv265 280 cl2 and lpuv cl2 processes were all above 1 100 suggesting an evident synergistic effect in contrast for a niger no obvious synergistic effect in the inactivation by uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 processes was observed although the sum of the rate constants for uv alone and cl2 alone was lower than that of uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 all the wavelengths differences in resistance intracellular structure and composition possibly lead to various sf values for the three genera of fungal spores which needs to be further investigated cl2 and uv inactivate fungal spores differently young and setlow 2003 reported that membrane damage was probably the primary inactivation pathway of cl2 uv irradiation mainly damages nucleic acids of fungal spores and the membrane or walls of the cells and pigments inside the cells are reported to contribute to the resistance of fungal spores toward environmental uv irradiation brage et al 2015 apart from being applied as disinfection method uv cl2 is also considered as an advanced oxidation process and it can promote the formation of reactive species such as oh or cl fang et al 2014 which have been verified to exhibit higher oxidative capacity to degrade various organic contaminants sichel et al 2011 fang et al 2014 kong et al 2016 xiao et al 2019 reported that oh would causes physiological dysfunction of the cells via three main pathways oxidizing the cell membrane or wall enzymes and genetic materials thus leading to the cell disintegration and thereby accelerating the penetration of uv irradiation therefore in this study the synergistic effect of fungal spore inactivation during uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 processes might be attributed to the damage of membrane or walls of the cells and to the uv absorbing pigments inside the cells li et al 2017 and rattanakul and oguma 2017 reported the synergistic effect for bacillus subtilis spores 2 fold higher than that of sole uv265 or uv280 and bacteriophage ms2 with a sf of 2 1 in uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 system however the degree of inactivation enhancement as described above was different from that observed in the present study because the structure of fungal spores is different from those of bacteria and viruses this work indicated that inactivation of fungal spores using uv leds cl2 especially uv280 cl2 and uv265 280 cl2 exhibited better performance compared to uv alone or cl2 alone based on the inactivation rate constants nitrogenous bases in dna can absorb uv at the peak of 260 nm uv leds at 265 nm and lpuv at 254 nm thus mainly causing damage to dna instead of oxidizing other components in fungal cells the lesions can be easily repaired by photolyase resulting in high level of photoreactivation in addition 280 nm uv irradiation has been proved to cause protein damage schmid et al 2001 oguma et al 2016 nyangaresi et al 2018 thus it can be speculated that the double effect of dna damage and protein damage leads to the better inactivation performance for fungal spores inactivated by uv280 cl2 and uv265 280 cl2 proteome analysis needs to be further investigated 3 3 mechanisms study 3 3 1 membrane permeability the variation in membrane permeability of p polonicum fig 3 a niger fig s1 and t harzianum fig s2 after inactivation by uv alone uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 was measured by fcm few membrane permeabilized spores were observed in the blank samples which was due to the sublethal damage of cells during storage thanh et al 2007 the proportion of membrane permeabilized spores in the process of uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 treatments increased faster than that in the process of treatment by uv alone at all wavelengths taking p polonicum as an example the percentages of membrane permeabilized spores were 15 50 83 20 54 10 and 8 95 after treatment by uv265 cl2 uv280 cl2 uv265 280 cl2 and lpuv cl2 respectively at the uv fluence of 30 mj cm2 however the percentages of membrane permeabilized spores at the same uv fluence were only 6 65 40 45 22 65 and 2 15 after treatment by uv265 uv280 uv265 280 and lpuv respectively fig 3 additionally for p polonicum inactivated by uv280 cl2 and uv265 280 cl2 the percentage of membrane permeabilized spores swiftly increased to 90 00 at a uv fluence of 60 mj cm2 whereas for uv265 cl2 and lpuv cl2 the percentage of membrane permeabilized spores was only 76 35 and 22 20 at the same uv fluence with respect to a niger and t harzianum a similar phenomenon was observed fig s1 and fig s2 however the specific percentage values were different because of the various resistances of the three fungal spores as discussed in section 3 1 the 2d dot plot of the three fungal spores stained with sg pi after inactivation by uv alone uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 at the fluence of 60 mj cm2 obviously revealed the variation tendency of the membrane permeabilized spores fig 4 fig s3 and s4 pi diffused into the membrane permeabilized cells to stain nucleic acids nescerecka et al 2016 thus the proportion of fungal spores with higher intensity of red fluorescence fl3 a increased as the reaction time was prolonged the results obtained in this study indicated that compared with inactivation by uv alone uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 inactivation especially uv280 cl2 and uv265 280 cl2 could accelerate the damage of cell membrane the potential reason for the phenomenon could be that reactive radicals such as oh formed in the combined processes can damage the cell membrane and then perturb its permeability which is important for normal metabolism and to maintain the balance of osmotic pressure xiao et al 2019 moreover protein damage caused by 280 nm uv irradiation may also account for the enhanced damage of the cell membrane caused by uv280 cl2 and uv265 280 cl2 as discussed in section 3 2 3 3 2 intracellular ros level the variation of intracellular ros level was measured by fcm for p polonicum fig 5 a niger fig s5 and t harzianum fig s6 after inactivation by uv alone uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 with the extension of reaction time the proportion of spores with high ros level hl ros after uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 treatments increased faster than that after treatment with uv alone at all wavelengths for example for p polonicum the percentages of spores with hl ros were 32 75 91 50 59 45 and 38 30 for uv265 cl2 uv280 cl2 uv265 280 cl2 and lpuv cl2 respectively at a uv fluence of 30 mj cm2 however the percentages of spores with hl ros at the same uv fluence were only 31 65 38 17 59 45 and 25 54 for uv265 uv280 uv265 280 and lpuv respectively fig 5 additionally for p polonicum inactivated by uv265 cl2 uv280 cl2 and uv265 280 cl2 the percentages of spores with hl ros rapidly increased up to 80 00 at a uv fluence of 60 mj cm2 whereas treatment with lpuv cl2 only resulted in 42 35 spores with hl ros at the same uv fluence with respect to a niger the similar phenomenon was observed fig s5 but the specific percentage values were different different from p polonicum and a niger the percentages of spores with hl ros for t harzianum could increased up to 90 after inactivation by uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 whereas there was no change in the intracellular ros level after treatment with uv alone fig s6 the histograms of the three fungal spores stained with dhe after inactivation with uv alone uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 at a fluence of 60 mj cm2 revealed the variation tendency of intracellular ros generation fig 6 s7 and s8 dhe would diffuse into cell membranes then it can be oxidized through intracellular ros to form ethidium which can intercalate with dna to generate red fluorescence fl3 a mesquita et al 2013 based on the difference in red fluorescence the intracellular ros level can be determined ros formed during the metabolic activity of cells were used as metabolic indicators of fungal spores mesquita et al 2013 intracellular ros production would be accelerated under environmental exposure to chemical oxidants uv radiation starvation temperature shifts etc a comparatively higher intracellular ros level would cause cell damage such as double stranded dna breaks and membrane instability gessler et al 2007 moreno et al 2019 in summary compared with uv alone the higher inactivation efficiency of uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 especially uv280 cl2 and uv265 280 cl2 can be ascribed to the mass production of intracellular ros thus enhancing the permeabilization of fungal spores as discussed in section 3 3 1 3 3 3 sem analysis sem patterns of p polonicum a niger and t harzianum before and after treatment with uv alone cl2 alone uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 treatment were photographed fig 7 s9 and s10 all the three fungal spores were full and smooth before inactivation however all spores demonstrated various degrees of folding and depression after inactivation p polonicum was the most severely damaged followed by a niger and t harzianum after inactivation by cl2 alone and uv alone the morphological damage of the fungal spores was relatively slight compared to that by uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 which damaged the fungal spores severely leading to the release of intracellular components many fragments were visible around the cells uv irradiation and low dosage of cl2 led to limited damage to cell membranes however the reactive radicals produced by uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 severely destroyed the cell membrane and wall causing leakage of intracellular contents rattanakul and oguma 2017 li et al 2018 xiao et al 2019 3 4 evaluation on photoreactivation of fungal spores 3 4 1 photoreactivation characteristics and kinetics as shown in table s2 upon the introduction of cl2 the uv fluence required to achieve the same level of inactivation effect 2 log10 of fungal spores decreased fig 8 showed the photoreactivation processes of the three fungal species exposed to uva light after treatment with uv alone uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 with 2 log10 inactivation the experimental data were well fitted to the model eq 5 the results table s3 indicated that the photoreactivation level of fungal spores inactivated by uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 especially by uv280 cl2 and uv265 280 cl2 was obviously lower than that by uv alone furthermore both the photoreactivation rate constant k and maximum survival ratio s m decreased significantly p 0 05 fig 9 for example k of t harzianum showed the most notable reduction among the three genera of fungal spores which decreased from 0 0100 to 0 0056 min 1 0 0098 to 0 0053 min 1 0 0102 to 0 0065 min 1 and 0 0103 to 0 0062 min 1 after inactivation by uv265 cl2 uv280 cl2 uv265 280 cl2 and lpuv cl2 when compared to treatment with uv alone s m of p polonicum decreased from 23 53 to 5 59 15 28 3 95 15 20 4 07 and 22 65 9 01 respectively after treatment by uv265 cl2 uv280 cl2 uv265 280 cl2 and lpuv cl2 with 2 log10 inactivation differences in the photoreactivation level among these three genera of fungal spores can be interpreted as their distinction in intracellular pigment contents cell structures or photolyase bohrerova and linden 2010 sinha and häder 2002 3 4 2 control efficiency the ce of photoreactivation by uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 compared to that by uv alone was also calculated using eq 6 fig 10 among the three genera of fungal spores photoreactivation of p polonicum and a niger was more efficiently controlled by uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 than that of t harzianum in addition the ce of photoreactivation of p polonicum by uv leds cl2 was higher compared to that by lpuv cl2 with a ce of 76 24 74 14 73 20 and 60 22 for uv265 cl2 uv280 cl2 uv265 280 cl2 and lpuv cl2 respectively however for the other two genera of fungal spores there was no statistically significant difference in the ce between uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 p 0 05 in summary uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 inhibited the photoreactivation of the three genera of fungal spores to various degrees the possible reasons for the lower photoreactivation level of fungal spores by treatment with uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 include some or all of the following uv irradiation mainly damaged dna and these lesions can be easily repaired under photoreactivation light thus resulting in a relatively high level of photoreactivation percentage of the fungal spores based on the results detected by fcm compared with uv alone uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 could lead to more membrane permeabilized cells and promote the intracellular ros level of fungal spores thus damaging intracellular components and function on the other hand the oh generated by uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 could also harm cell integrity by oxidizing cell membranes or walls maness et al 1999 sunada et al 2003 xiao et al 2019 thus allowing the disinfectant to diffuse into the cell easily further inactivating enzymes or pigments mamane et al 2007 except for dna damage caused by uv irradiation other cellular damage cannot be repaired by the photoreactivation light therefore the joint effect of dna and other cellular damage resulted in the higher inhibition efficiency of photoreactivation of fungal spores inactivated by uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 than uv alone 4 conclusions the conclusions drawn from this study can be summarized as follows 1 the combined uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 processes especially uv280 cl2 and uv265 280 cl2 exhibited better performance in terms of inactivation of fungal spores compared to uv alone and cl2 alone based on the inactivation rate constants and uv leds cl2 exhibited better inactivation efficiency than that of lpuv cl2 2 there was an obvious synergistic effect of the uv leds cl2 processes in the inactivation of t harzianum for p polonicum evident synergistic effects were observed both by the treatment with uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 3 compared with uv alone higher inactivation efficiency of uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 especially uv280 cl2 and uv265 280 cl2 can be attributed to the higher formation of intracellular ros and the reaction of potential extracellular free radicals which could cause physiological dysfunction of fungal spores 4 the joint effect of dna damage and other cellular damage resulted in the higher inhibition efficiency of photoreactivation of fungal spores inactivated by uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 than uv alone photoreactivation of p polonicum and a niger was more efficiently inhibited by uv leds

17693,waterborne fungi have been recognized as an emerging environmental contaminant in recent years this work was to investigate the inactivation efficiency and mechanisms of ultraviolet light emitting diodes uv leds chlorine cl2 265 280 and 265 280 nm combination and lpuv cl2 254 nm treatments for three fungal species compared with individual disinfection processes control of photoreactivation for fungal species inactivated by uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 was also evaluated the results revealed that the combined uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 processes especially uv leds cl2 exhibited better inactivation performance compared to uv alone and cl2 alone based on the inactivation rate constants and an evident synergistic effect was observed for example the inactivation rates for penicillium polonicum in the processes of uv265 cl2 uv280 cl2 uv265 280 cl2 and lpuv cl2 was 0 142 0 168 0 174 and 0 106 cm2 mj respectively which were all approximately 1 5 fold higher than that of uv alone the synergistic effect of fungal spores inactivation by uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 was due to the high level production of intracellular reactive oxygen species and the reaction of potential extracellular free radicals resistance of the tested fungal spores was as follows trichoderma harzianum penicillium polonicum aspergillus niger in addition the joint effect of dna and other cellular damage resulted in the inhibition of photoreactivation of fungal spores inactivated by uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 compared with that of fungal spore inactivated by uv alone this study may provide reference for controlling the dissemination of waterborne fungi utilizing combined uv leds and free chlorine processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords fungal spores disinfection combined uv leds cl2 process synergistic effect photoreactivation 1 introduction nowadays waterborne fungi have been considered as an emerging environmental contaminants because their spread causes some environmental problems such as turbidity odor or mycotoxin emissions hageskal et al 2006 pereira et al 2009 oliveira et al 2013 typical representatives of pathogenic fungal species in drinking water including aspergillus spp and penicillium spp ma et al 2015 many waterborne diseases such as skin asthma allergy and hypersensitivity pneumonitis are associated with fungal contamination of water systems curtis

waterborne fungi should be considered in the assessment of the quality and microbiological safety of drinking water sonigo et al 2011 pereira et al 2013 chemical disinfectants including chlorine chlorine dioxide chloramine and ozone were applied to control fungi in water supply systems waterborne fungi such as aspergillus versicolor and penicillium purpurogenum exhibited higher resistance to chlorine and monochloramine disinfection compared to bacteria and viruses the ct values of chlorine and monochloramine for 3 log inactivation of the fungi were 48 99 194 70 mg min l 1 and 90 33 531 30 mg min l 1 respectively ma and bibby 2017 however chloramine has to be prepared in situ and strictly controlled during the process to ensure the formation of monochloramine holder et al 2014 savi and scussel 2014 have demonstrated that the germination of fungal conidia can be inhibited using 60 μmol mol 1 o3 however o3 is also toxic and corrosive ahn et al 2013 wen et al 2017a found that chlorine dioxide was more efficient than chlorine in the inactivation of fungal spores and an inactivation efficiency of 99 could be achieved with a ct value of 1 845 mg min l 1 although chlorine dioxide is effective the preparation and preservation processes are challenging huber et al 2005 uv disinfection which is the most commonly used physical disinfection method and which does not produce toxic byproducts has attracted increasing research interest liu et al 2006 nevertheless the traditional low pressure lp and medium pressure mp mercury lamp have certain shortcomings for example they contain toxic mercury and have a relatively short lifetime aoyagi et al 2011 as an emerging semiconductor technology uv light emitting diodes uv leds have been proposed as an alternative uv source for water disinfection these diodes have superior characteristics such as no mercury requirement diverse wavelengths compactness and potential for less energy consumption wurtele et al 2011 song et al 2016 many studies have demonstrated the inactivation efficiency of waterborne pathogens e g e coli bacteriophage qβ b subtilis spores fungal spores by uv leds emitting at various wavelengths oguma et al 2013 rattanakul and oguma 2018 wan et al 2020 however uv cannot maintain a durative disinfection effect because uv induced lesions could be repaired via photoreactivation and dark repair hijnen et al 2006 pescheck 2019 furthermore uv irradiated waterborne fungi still have a high risk of reactivation wen et al 2019b 2019c thus increasing the biological risk in water supply systems shang et al 2009 showed that uvc irradiation with the addition of titanium dioxide tio2 1 0 mg l could significantly repress the photoreactivation and dark repair of fecal coliform bacteria while studies on the photoreactivation inhibition of fungal spores by uv based techniques were limited therefore effective methods for controlling the photoreactivation of fungi in water need to be investigated recently a combined process of uv leds and chlorine cl2 treatment was explored as an attractive alternative in the advanced oxidation process aop field the process was found to be efficient in removing different contaminants and microorganisms rattanakul et al 2015 gao et al 2019 li et al 2020 in addition the photolysis of free chlorine hocl ocl during uv leds cl2 treatment is an important source of reactive chlorine species rcs and oh previous studies have shown that the efficiency of the uv leds cl2 process strongly depends on the uv wavelength and solution ph compared to lpuv uv leds at longer wavelength can enhance the photolysis of ocl thus accelerating the yields of free radicals at alkaline ph values watts and linden 2007 yin et al 2018 zou et al 2019 kim et al 2020 therefore simultaneous application of uv leds with different wavelengths and cl2 is a promising disinfection method many researchers have investigated the combined and sequential disinfection of water using uv and cl2 and the synergistic effect on the removal of e coli antibiotic resistance genes and total coliforms murphy et al 2008 wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 li et al 2018 reported that the inactivation rate constants for bacillus subtilis spores by uv265 cl2 and uv280 cl2 were 2 fold higher than those by uv265 and uv280 alone in addition the significant role of oh formed by uv cl2 treatment in the synergistic effect has been proved the synergistic effect with a synergistic factor of 2 1 found for bacteriophage ms2 inactivation by uv cl2 treatment was because of the viral genome damage caused by the common effect of active chlorine species and oh radicals but the influence of rcs was unclear which was believed to be related to the genome damage rattanakul and oguma 2017 chen et al 2020 found that the enhancement degradation of algae laden in the process of uvc irradiation 254 nm combined with chlorine was primarily due to the role of oh rather than that of rcs however the efficiency of uv cl2 based aops on the disinfection of waterborne fungi has been hardly investigated a comparison of performances of uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 on the inactivation of fungi in water has not been reported additional work is required to comprehensively compare the effects of uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 on the inactivation of waterborne fungi during the uv cl2 process flow cytometry fcm combined with various fluorescence stains has been considered as an efficient means to detect damage to the microbial cell membrane changes in nucleic acids and the physiological state of cells which was widely used in the detection of bacteria phe et al 2005 mesquita et al 2013 wen et al 2015 2016 the application of fcm has also been reported for the assessment of fungal viability in water the metabolic activity of trichoderma was evaluated by fcm using dihydroethidium dhe stain and a 9 fold increase in the fluorescence intensity for trichoderma after being incubated for 10 h was observed bradner and nevalainen 2003 oliveira et al 2020 measured the membrane permeability and enzymatic activity of three aspergillus species inactivated by uv leds 255 and 265 nm using fcm an accurate simple and rapid method to count waterborne fungal spores employing fcm was established and verified to assess the efficiency of common disinfectants used in water treatment by wen et al 2020 for different genera of fungal spores the correlation coefficients of the results measured by fcm with microscopic counts and heterotrophic plate counts were 0 988 and 0 996 respectively therefore the employment of fcm technology to discriminate the viability of fungal spores in the disinfection process of uv cl2 is promising the focus of this work was as follows 1 to investigate the inactivation efficiency of uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 treatments for three waterborne fungal species compared to those by individual disinfection processes 2 to analyze the mechanisms responsible for the synergetic effects of these combined processes 3 to determine the difference between uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 and 4 to evaluate the control efficiency of photoreactivation for fungal species inactivated by uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of fungal spore suspensions three dominant genera of fungal spores isolated from groundwater were selected in this work penicillium polonicum p polonicum aspergillus niger a niger and trichoderma harzianum t harzianum the detailed procedure for the preparation of the suspension of fungal spores has been described previously and the stock suspension was maintained at 2 4 108 cfu ml wan et al 2020 2 2 inactivation experiments two types of uv led chips 265 and 280 nm leds were used in this research irradiation by uv leds cl2 lpuv cl2 and uv alone was conducted in batch reactors wen et al 2017b wan et al 2020 the fungal spore suspension was diluted with phosphate buffer solution pbs and the concentration was maintained at 106 cfu ml before irradiation during the combined uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 processes sodium hypochlorite naocl stock solution was simultaneously added with uv irradiation to achieve an initial free chlorine concentration of 2 0 mg l the concentration of free chlorine was determined by n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd spectrophotometry rice et al 2012 samples were taken at intervals and the reaction was immediately quenched using sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 all reagents used in this study were at least of analytical grade for uv leds cl2 a 10 ml spore suspension was placed in a petri dish d 4 cm and irradiated at a distance of 2 cm from the light source for lpuv cl2 the fungal spore suspension 100 ml was placed in a petri dish d 12 cm and irradiated 50 cm from the light source samples were taken at intervals diluted serially and then plated on dichloran rose bengal chloramphenicol agar in triplicate the plates 20 300 colonies were chosen to count colonies after incubation for 2 4 days 27 c for uv alone uv leds and lpuv processes the reaction conditions were as described above but no chlorine was added into the dishes irradiance of uv leds and lpuv was detected by iodide iodate actinometry rahn et al 2003 2006 the irradiance for 265 280 265 280 nm combination uv leds and lpuv was 0 215 0 214 0 185 and 0 120 mw cm2 respectively the lpuv reactor was a quasi collimated apparatus whereas the uv leds reactor used in this work was not a completely parallel light source the petri factors were 0 86 and 0 91 for the 265 nm and 280 nm leds 0 90 for the combined 265 and 280 nm uv leds and 0 96 for the lpuv experiments bolton and linden 2003 before the experiment the uv leds 5 min and lpuv 30 min apparatus had to be switched on to warm up chlorination experiments cl2 alone in the absence of uv were performed at room temperature under dark conditions a mixed solution 100 ml of pbs and fungal spores was prepared the reaction was initiated with the same chlorine concentration as that used in the combined uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 processes procedures of sampling and viability analysis have been described above 2 3 photoreactivation experiments after 2 log10 inactivation by uv leds cl2 lpuv cl2 and uv alone the suspensions were subjected to photoreactivation the details have been described by wen et al 2019c 2 4 mechanisms analysis flow cytometric fcm measurements membrane integrity and intracellular reactive oxygen species ros level of spores were analyzed using fcm accuri c6 bd usa the threshold value for the green fluorescence channel fl1 was kept at 600 the flow rate was set as 33 μl min and the count rate remained below 500 particles s the detection range of the fcm used in this study was 103 105 cfu ml thus samples were diluted before analysis sybr green ι and propidium iodide sg pi dyes were applied to assess the membrane integrity of the inactivated spores dihydroethidium dhe dye was applied to assess the intracellular ros level of inactivated spores the detailed staining procedure has been introduced in a previous research wen et al 2020 sem analysis to examine the morphological changes of the fungal spores spores suspensions before and after inactivation were photographed using scanning electron microscope sem quanta 600f fei usa details corresponding to samples preparation have been provided in previous studies wen et al 2019a kang et al 2015 2 5 data analysis 2 5 1 inactivation kinetics inactivation efficiency of uv alone cl2 alone uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 can be described as follows 1 n l og n 0 n where n 0 and n are the concentrations of the viable fungal spores cfu ml before and after inactivation and n is the value of log inactivation uv fluence was the product of uv irradiance mw cm2 and irradiation time s the geeraerd and van impe model fitting tool ginafit was applied to depict the inactivation process of spores berney et al 2006 inactivation rate constants of fungal spores for uv alone uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 were calculated from the linear part of the fluence response curves the models of log linear regression plus tail and log linear regression plus shoulder plus tail were employed in this work the evaluation of synergistic effects of the uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 processes were assessed by inactivation rate constants and the synergistic factor sf was calculated as follows marjanovic et al 2018 2 s f uv leds cl 2 k uv leds cl 2 k uv leds k cl 2 3 s f lpuv cl 2 k lpuv cl 2 k lpuv k cl 2 2 6 photoreactivation kinetics the following equation was used to describe photoreactivation was 4 survival ratio n r n 0 100 where n 0 is the concentration of viable fungal spores before uv alone uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 irradiation cfu ml and n r is the concentration of viable spores after photoreactivation for a certain time cfu ml a saturation type first order reaction model kashimada et al 1996 was applied to depict the photoreactivation process the equation was as follows 5 s s m s 0 1 e k 1 t s 0 where k 1 is the first order rate constant of photoreactivation s 0 is the survival ratio after inactivation n d n 0 n d is the concentration of viable fungal spores after inactivation s is the survival ratio at time t n r n 0 and s m is the maximum survival ratio the control efficiency ce was calculated in this work to depict the ability of inhibiting photoreactivation by uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 treatments the equation was as follows 6 c e s uv s uv cl 2 s uv 100 where s uv is the maximum survival ratio during photoreactivation after inactivation by uv alone and s uv cl2 is the maximum survival ratio during the photoreactivation after inactivation by uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 all experiments were conducted in triplicate one way anova was applied to evaluate the statistical differences experimental data were defined to be statistical different at significance level of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 inactivation efficiency by uv cl2 and uv cl2 fungal spores inactivated by uv alone cl2 alone uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 were shown in fig 1 exposure to only cl2 for 100 min led to an inactivation of lower than 1 0 log for p polonicum and lower than 0 5 log for a niger and t harzianum which was negligible compared to that caused by uv alone irradiation uv leds of 265 280 265 280 nm combination and lpuv the uv leds could more efficiently inactivate fungal spores compared to lpuv and detailed discussion has been provided in a previous study wan et al 2020 the fungal spore inactivation efficiency of the combined processes of uv265 cl2 uv280 cl2 uv265 280 cl2 and lpuv cl2 were significantly greater than that by uv leds or lpuv alone p 0 05 for p polonicum at a uv fluence of 40 mj cm2 the uv265 cl2 uv280 cl2 uv265 280 cl2 and lpuv cl2 treatment led to an inactivation of 2 76 log10 3 38 log10 3 26 log10 and 1 90 log10 respectively compared to the 2 46 log 2 91 log10 3 03 log10 and 1 22 log10 achieved by uv265 alone uv280 alone uv265 280 alone and lpuv alone respectively noticeably among the combined processes uv leds cl2 especially uv280 cl2 and uv265 280 cl2 exhibited better inactivation performance than that of lpuv cl2 taking p polonicum for example a 2 log10 inactivation was achieved with a uv fluence of 30 2 20 2 and 27 2 mj cm2 for uv265 cl2 uv280 cl2 and uv265 280 cl2 respectively in contrast for the same log10 inactivation lpuv cl2 required a higher uv fluence of approximately 40 mj cm2 similar results were also obtained for the inactivation of a niger and t harzianum upon the introduction of cl2 treatment simultaneously with the uv irradiation the resistance of the tested fungal spores was as follows t harzianum p polonicum a niger this resistance mainly depends on the differences in the intracellular enzyme and pigment content of the spores sonigo et al 2011 braga et al 2015 3 2 kinetics and synergistic effect inactivation rate constants k for fungal spores treated by uv alone uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 were calculated from a linear part fig 2 which showed a good fitting with the pseudo first order model the inactivation rate constants by cl2 alone for p polonicum a niger and t harzianum were only 0 022 0 011 and 0 008 min 1 respectively however the inactivation rate constants of uv alone and cl2 alone were lower than those of uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 for example for p polonicum the inactivation rate constants of uv265 cl2 uv280 cl2 uv265 280 cl2 and lpuv cl2 were 0 142 0 168 0 174 and 0 106 cm2 mj respectively these values were approximately 1 5 fold higher than that of sole uv additionally k of a niger treated with uv alone cl2 alone uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 were relative lower than that of p polonicum and t harzianum which was consistent with the log10 reduction results that the higher resistance of a niger than the other two fungal species notably the rate constants of uv leds cl2 especially for uv280 cl2 and uv265 280 cl2 were higher than those of lpuv cl2 which agreed with the conclusion obtained from a previous study that the inactivation efficiencies of fungal spores reported higher under uv wavelengths of 280 and 265 280 nm combination wan et al 2020 to evaluate the synergistic effect of the uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 processes on fungal spores inactivation the synergistic factor sf was calculated according to the method depicted in section 2 5 and the specific values were shown in table s1 for the inactivation of t harzianum an obvious synergistic effect was observed for the uv265 cl2 uv280 cl2 and uv265 280 cl2 processes the sf values of which were 1 484 1 572 and 1 444 respectively however the sf for the inactivation of t harzianum by lpuv cl2 was 0 981 indicating there was no synergistic effect for p polonicum the sf values of the uv265 cl2 uv280 cl2 uv265 280 cl2 and lpuv cl2 processes were all above 1 100 suggesting an evident synergistic effect in contrast for a niger no obvious synergistic effect in the inactivation by uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 processes was observed although the sum of the rate constants for uv alone and cl2 alone was lower than that of uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 all the wavelengths differences in resistance intracellular structure and composition possibly lead to various sf values for the three genera of fungal spores which needs to be further investigated cl2 and uv inactivate fungal spores differently young and setlow 2003 reported that membrane damage was probably the primary inactivation pathway of cl2 uv irradiation mainly damages nucleic acids of fungal spores and the membrane or walls of the cells and pigments inside the cells are reported to contribute to the resistance of fungal spores toward environmental uv irradiation brage et al 2015 apart from being applied as disinfection method uv cl2 is also considered as an advanced oxidation process and it can promote the formation of reactive species such as oh or cl fang et al 2014 which have been verified to exhibit higher oxidative capacity to degrade various organic contaminants sichel et al 2011 fang et al 2014 kong et al 2016 xiao et al 2019 reported that oh would causes physiological dysfunction of the cells via three main pathways oxidizing the cell membrane or wall enzymes and genetic materials thus leading to the cell disintegration and thereby accelerating the penetration of uv irradiation therefore in this study the synergistic effect of fungal spore inactivation during uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 processes might be attributed to the damage of membrane or walls of the cells and to the uv absorbing pigments inside the cells li et al 2017 and rattanakul and oguma 2017 reported the synergistic effect for bacillus subtilis spores 2 fold higher than that of sole uv265 or uv280 and bacteriophage ms2 with a sf of 2 1 in uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 system however the degree of inactivation enhancement as described above was different from that observed in the present study because the structure of fungal spores is different from those of bacteria and viruses this work indicated that inactivation of fungal spores using uv leds cl2 especially uv280 cl2 and uv265 280 cl2 exhibited better performance compared to uv alone or cl2 alone based on the inactivation rate constants nitrogenous bases in dna can absorb uv at the peak of 260 nm uv leds at 265 nm and lpuv at 254 nm thus mainly causing damage to dna instead of oxidizing other components in fungal cells the lesions can be easily repaired by photolyase resulting in high level of photoreactivation in addition 280 nm uv irradiation has been proved to cause protein damage schmid et al 2001 oguma et al 2016 nyangaresi et al 2018 thus it can be speculated that the double effect of dna damage and protein damage leads to the better inactivation performance for fungal spores inactivated by uv280 cl2 and uv265 280 cl2 proteome analysis needs to be further investigated 3 3 mechanisms study 3 3 1 membrane permeability the variation in membrane permeability of p polonicum fig 3 a niger fig s1 and t harzianum fig s2 after inactivation by uv alone uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 was measured by fcm few membrane permeabilized spores were observed in the blank samples which was due to the sublethal damage of cells during storage thanh et al 2007 the proportion of membrane permeabilized spores in the process of uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 treatments increased faster than that in the process of treatment by uv alone at all wavelengths taking p polonicum as an example the percentages of membrane permeabilized spores were 15 50 83 20 54 10 and 8 95 after treatment by uv265 cl2 uv280 cl2 uv265 280 cl2 and lpuv cl2 respectively at the uv fluence of 30 mj cm2 however the percentages of membrane permeabilized spores at the same uv fluence were only 6 65 40 45 22 65 and 2 15 after treatment by uv265 uv280 uv265 280 and lpuv respectively fig 3 additionally for p polonicum inactivated by uv280 cl2 and uv265 280 cl2 the percentage of membrane permeabilized spores swiftly increased to 90 00 at a uv fluence of 60 mj cm2 whereas for uv265 cl2 and lpuv cl2 the percentage of membrane permeabilized spores was only 76 35 and 22 20 at the same uv fluence with respect to a niger and t harzianum a similar phenomenon was observed fig s1 and fig s2 however the specific percentage values were different because of the various resistances of the three fungal spores as discussed in section 3 1 the 2d dot plot of the three fungal spores stained with sg pi after inactivation by uv alone uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 at the fluence of 60 mj cm2 obviously revealed the variation tendency of the membrane permeabilized spores fig 4 fig s3 and s4 pi diffused into the membrane permeabilized cells to stain nucleic acids nescerecka et al 2016 thus the proportion of fungal spores with higher intensity of red fluorescence fl3 a increased as the reaction time was prolonged the results obtained in this study indicated that compared with inactivation by uv alone uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 inactivation especially uv280 cl2 and uv265 280 cl2 could accelerate the damage of cell membrane the potential reason for the phenomenon could be that reactive radicals such as oh formed in the combined processes can damage the cell membrane and then perturb its permeability which is important for normal metabolism and to maintain the balance of osmotic pressure xiao et al 2019 moreover protein damage caused by 280 nm uv irradiation may also account for the enhanced damage of the cell membrane caused by uv280 cl2 and uv265 280 cl2 as discussed in section 3 2 3 3 2 intracellular ros level the variation of intracellular ros level was measured by fcm for p polonicum fig 5 a niger fig s5 and t harzianum fig s6 after inactivation by uv alone uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 with the extension of reaction time the proportion of spores with high ros level hl ros after uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 treatments increased faster than that after treatment with uv alone at all wavelengths for example for p polonicum the percentages of spores with hl ros were 32 75 91 50 59 45 and 38 30 for uv265 cl2 uv280 cl2 uv265 280 cl2 and lpuv cl2 respectively at a uv fluence of 30 mj cm2 however the percentages of spores with hl ros at the same uv fluence were only 31 65 38 17 59 45 and 25 54 for uv265 uv280 uv265 280 and lpuv respectively fig 5 additionally for p polonicum inactivated by uv265 cl2 uv280 cl2 and uv265 280 cl2 the percentages of spores with hl ros rapidly increased up to 80 00 at a uv fluence of 60 mj cm2 whereas treatment with lpuv cl2 only resulted in 42 35 spores with hl ros at the same uv fluence with respect to a niger the similar phenomenon was observed fig s5 but the specific percentage values were different different from p polonicum and a niger the percentages of spores with hl ros for t harzianum could increased up to 90 after inactivation by uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 whereas there was no change in the intracellular ros level after treatment with uv alone fig s6 the histograms of the three fungal spores stained with dhe after inactivation with uv alone uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 at a fluence of 60 mj cm2 revealed the variation tendency of intracellular ros generation fig 6 s7 and s8 dhe would diffuse into cell membranes then it can be oxidized through intracellular ros to form ethidium which can intercalate with dna to generate red fluorescence fl3 a mesquita et al 2013 based on the difference in red fluorescence the intracellular ros level can be determined ros formed during the metabolic activity of cells were used as metabolic indicators of fungal spores mesquita et al 2013 intracellular ros production would be accelerated under environmental exposure to chemical oxidants uv radiation starvation temperature shifts etc a comparatively higher intracellular ros level would cause cell damage such as double stranded dna breaks and membrane instability gessler et al 2007 moreno et al 2019 in summary compared with uv alone the higher inactivation efficiency of uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 especially uv280 cl2 and uv265 280 cl2 can be ascribed to the mass production of intracellular ros thus enhancing the permeabilization of fungal spores as discussed in section 3 3 1 3 3 3 sem analysis sem patterns of p polonicum a niger and t harzianum before and after treatment with uv alone cl2 alone uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 treatment were photographed fig 7 s9 and s10 all the three fungal spores were full and smooth before inactivation however all spores demonstrated various degrees of folding and depression after inactivation p polonicum was the most severely damaged followed by a niger and t harzianum after inactivation by cl2 alone and uv alone the morphological damage of the fungal spores was relatively slight compared to that by uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 which damaged the fungal spores severely leading to the release of intracellular components many fragments were visible around the cells uv irradiation and low dosage of cl2 led to limited damage to cell membranes however the reactive radicals produced by uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 severely destroyed the cell membrane and wall causing leakage of intracellular contents rattanakul and oguma 2017 li et al 2018 xiao et al 2019 3 4 evaluation on photoreactivation of fungal spores 3 4 1 photoreactivation characteristics and kinetics as shown in table s2 upon the introduction of cl2 the uv fluence required to achieve the same level of inactivation effect 2 log10 of fungal spores decreased fig 8 showed the photoreactivation processes of the three fungal species exposed to uva light after treatment with uv alone uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 with 2 log10 inactivation the experimental data were well fitted to the model eq 5 the results table s3 indicated that the photoreactivation level of fungal spores inactivated by uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 especially by uv280 cl2 and uv265 280 cl2 was obviously lower than that by uv alone furthermore both the photoreactivation rate constant k and maximum survival ratio s m decreased significantly p 0 05 fig 9 for example k of t harzianum showed the most notable reduction among the three genera of fungal spores which decreased from 0 0100 to 0 0056 min 1 0 0098 to 0 0053 min 1 0 0102 to 0 0065 min 1 and 0 0103 to 0 0062 min 1 after inactivation by uv265 cl2 uv280 cl2 uv265 280 cl2 and lpuv cl2 when compared to treatment with uv alone s m of p polonicum decreased from 23 53 to 5 59 15 28 3 95 15 20 4 07 and 22 65 9 01 respectively after treatment by uv265 cl2 uv280 cl2 uv265 280 cl2 and lpuv cl2 with 2 log10 inactivation differences in the photoreactivation level among these three genera of fungal spores can be interpreted as their distinction in intracellular pigment contents cell structures or photolyase bohrerova and linden 2010 sinha and häder 2002 3 4 2 control efficiency the ce of photoreactivation by uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 compared to that by uv alone was also calculated using eq 6 fig 10 among the three genera of fungal spores photoreactivation of p polonicum and a niger was more efficiently controlled by uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 than that of t harzianum in addition the ce of photoreactivation of p polonicum by uv leds cl2 was higher compared to that by lpuv cl2 with a ce of 76 24 74 14 73 20 and 60 22 for uv265 cl2 uv280 cl2 uv265 280 cl2 and lpuv cl2 respectively however for the other two genera of fungal spores there was no statistically significant difference in the ce between uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 p 0 05 in summary uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 inhibited the photoreactivation of the three genera of fungal spores to various degrees the possible reasons for the lower photoreactivation level of fungal spores by treatment with uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 include some or all of the following uv irradiation mainly damaged dna and these lesions can be easily repaired under photoreactivation light thus resulting in a relatively high level of photoreactivation percentage of the fungal spores based on the results detected by fcm compared with uv alone uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 could lead to more membrane permeabilized cells and promote the intracellular ros level of fungal spores thus damaging intracellular components and function on the other hand the oh generated by uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 could also harm cell integrity by oxidizing cell membranes or walls maness et al 1999 sunada et al 2003 xiao et al 2019 thus allowing the disinfectant to diffuse into the cell easily further inactivating enzymes or pigments mamane et al 2007 except for dna damage caused by uv irradiation other cellular damage cannot be repaired by the photoreactivation light therefore the joint effect of dna and other cellular damage resulted in the higher inhibition efficiency of photoreactivation of fungal spores inactivated by uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 than uv alone 4 conclusions the conclusions drawn from this study can be summarized as follows 1 the combined uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 processes especially uv280 cl2 and uv265 280 cl2 exhibited better performance in terms of inactivation of fungal spores compared to uv alone and cl2 alone based on the inactivation rate constants and uv leds cl2 exhibited better inactivation efficiency than that of lpuv cl2 2 there was an obvious synergistic effect of the uv leds cl2 processes in the inactivation of t harzianum for p polonicum evident synergistic effects were observed both by the treatment with uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 3 compared with uv alone higher inactivation efficiency of uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 especially uv280 cl2 and uv265 280 cl2 can be attributed to the higher formation of intracellular ros and the reaction of potential extracellular free radicals which could cause physiological dysfunction of fungal spores 4 the joint effect of dna damage and other cellular damage resulted in the higher inhibition efficiency of photoreactivation of fungal spores inactivated by uv leds cl2 and lpuv cl2 than uv alone photoreactivation of p polonicum and a niger was more efficiently inhibited by uv leds

17694,repeated application of aqueous film forming foams afff in designated firefighting training areas has caused severe groundwater contamination by per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass many research efforts are currently engaged for the effective removal of these chemicals from environmental waters in this study we demonstrate that modified clay produced by intercalating quaternary ammonium cations in the exchangeable interlayer sites of smectite clay can effectively remove pfas pollutants in real groundwater via strong adsorption the performance of the modified clay with removal efficiencies 95 99 is superior to those of granular activated carbon or hard wood biochar and comparable to an ion exchange resin removal efficiency is not impacted by potential organic co contaminants e g diesel btex tce and 1 4 dioxane or water chemistry ca2 and na at environmentally relevant concentrations furthermore piecewise isotherms are identified to represent the uptake of pfass by the modified clay based on molecular dynamics simulations the anionic pfass first occupy the highly polarized bare interlayer edge sites leading to a linear isotherm and then the interlayer surface sites resulting in a langmuir isotherm the ionic interactions between the cationic intercalant n and the terminal oxygen atoms of carboxylate or sulfonate groups of pfass play a dominant role in adsorption and the lateral interaction in particular fluorophilic attraction among pfass accelerate the adsorption the strength of these interactions is quantified using density functional theory calculations simulation results match reasonably well with the experimentally determined basal spacing and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of the modified clay loaded with pfass overall the combined experimental and molecular simulation studies elucidate the adsorption mechanism of pfass on the modified clay and provide critical information to guide the use of modified clays for pfas water treatment in the field graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pfass contaminated groundwater modified clay ionic interaction fluorophilic interaction molecular dynamics simulation 1 introduction aqueous film forming foams afffs containing per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass to lower the surface tension along the air foam interface have been widely used to extinguish hydrocarbon fuel fires fitch 1989 mejia avendaño et al 2017 moody and field 2000 munoz et al 2017 however massive spill discharge events or repeated discharges of afffs resulted in severe pfas contamination of soil sediment biota and groundwater demanding considerable attention due to the bioaccumulation potential and carcinogenicity of certain pfass dewitt 2015 lau et al 2007 us environmental protection agency epa has established a drinking water advisory level of 70 parts per trillion for perfluorooctane carboxylate pfoa and sulfonate pfos individually or combined hogue 2018 stringent regulations require the development of treatment technologies that can control the migration of pfass or clean up impacted sites cost effectively adsorption is one of the most effective methods for the removal of inorganic and organic contaminants from contaminated water activated carbon zhi and liu 2018 and ion exchange resins zaggia et al 2016 are the most often tested and employed adsorbents to treat pfass for instance for groundwater remediation using the pump and treatment scheme epa 2018 ross et al 2018 as dominant pfass found in contaminated waters are anionic and quite hydrophilic activated carbon or non ionic resins with low charge density do not exhibit adequate affinity leading to low treatment efficiency and high treatment cost ross et al 2018 therefore amine functionalized sorbents have been evaluated over the past years as a way to achieve specific interactions and enhance adsorption ateia et al 2019 ateia et al 2018 deng et al 2013 ji et al 2018 klemes et al 2019 kumarasamy et al 2020 aside from the conventional substrates such as activated carbon and ion exchange resins zaggia et al 2016 zhi and liu 2018 other types of organic and inorganic substrates e g carbohydrates non carbohydrate polymers nanostructured polymers and inorganic materials have been explored for amine functionalization as discussed in a recent critical review by ateia et al 2019a these next generation materials pivot around enhancing the ionic interactions that anionic pfass can engage with amine groups from primary amines to quaternary ammonium groups while still utilizing hydrophobic interactions modified smectite clays share many of the same properties illustrated by ateia et al 2019a as those next generation materials but have rarely been tested for pfas remediation low cost smectite clays can be modified by intercalating quaternary ammonium surfactants into the interlayer space via ion exchanging with cations e g k na and ca2 favre and lagaly 1991 such materials have long been shown to improve adsorption capacity towards metals and organic compounds e g cr2o7 2 methylene blue and phenolic compounds due to hydrophobic interactions ionic interactions as well as increased interlayer distance han et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 a modified palygoskite adsorbent was employed to remove pfos from an artificial water medium with promising results das et al 2013 yet much is unknown about the performance of such clay materials for other pfass in real waters and at environmentally relevant concentrations adsorption behaviours may drastically differ in a real groundwater matrix that can contain elevated levels of co contaminants such as fuel chemicals and chlorinated solvents mcguire et al 2014 mckenzie et al 2016 furthermore an incomplete understanding of adsorption mechanisms may also prevent achieving efficient pfas treatment to what extent pfass of different chain lengths can engage ionic interactions with quaternary ammonium groups present in clay interlayers is not known elucidation of adsorption mechanisms requires insights into the molecular processes responsible for adsorption of pfass by adsorbents such as smectite clays tools such as molecular dynamics md and quantum calculations based on the density functional theory dft are now available for studying molecular processes md which simulates the natural motion of a molecular system is a physics based modelling method and can be employed to investigate the conformational space and distribution of the target molecules in the interlayer region as well as conformational changes of atoms and molecules epa et al 2012 the radial distribution function g r derived from md atomic trajectories defines the probability of finding an atom at a distance r from the target atom which is critical to depict the distribution of the species in the interlayer region cygan et al 2012 quantum calculations based on dft can also provide a detailed picture of the molecular geometry of organic molecules on an adsorbent and perform vibrational frequency analysis molecular and quantum level data on adsorption behaviours of environmentally relevant pfass are still sparse in this work pfas impacted groundwater was collected from a former us air force base with a history of afff applications and used in batch adsorption experiments the treatment performance of a modified smectite clay was compared with those of granular activated carbon biochar and ion exchange resin the influence of water chemistry and relevant co contaminants on adsorbent performance was investigated the molecular interaction and the change in the basal spacing of the modified clay due to adsorption were recorded by the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray diffraction xrd patterns md simulation and dft quantum calculations were used to probe the layering behaviours and interlayer structure of the modified clay loaded with pfass the experiments and molecular simulation together clarify the real world adsorption mechanisms of pfass on modified smectite clays 2 materials and methods 2 1 adsorbents and groundwater the modified bentonite fluoro sorb

an orbital shaker at 150 rpm in the dark the supernatant 1500 μl was subsampled into a microcentrifuge tube and then centrifuged 20 000 g and 10 min and 40 μl of the centrifuged supernatant was diluted with 160 μl meoh in an hplc vial right before chemical analysis 20 μl of internal standards mixture was added the concentrations of pfass were determined by the uhplc hrms method provided in section 2 3 the respective blank samples afff impacted groundwater without adsorbents were executed under the same conditions and adsorption of pfass onto the hdpe bottles was found to be insignificant the kinetic data of pfass on the adsorbents were collected at 2 4 6 12 24 36 48 72 96 120 and 168 h and at the dosages of 5 20 and 40 mg sorbents per 400 ml water 168 h was chosen for isotherm studies the effect of co contaminants and water chemistry were conducted through the addition of diesel a mixture of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene btex trichloroethylene tce 1 4 dioxane cacl2 and nacl into the 400 ml groundwater samples respectively the amount of pfass taken up by the adsorbent was calculated by the pfas mass difference of the blank samples and equilibrated

patterns relevant reagents and adsorption of pfass by bottles can be found in the supplementary materials 3 molecular simulations 3 1 molecular models of fluoro200 sodium bentonite na bentonite belongs to the 2 1 type smectites and is negatively charged due to isomorphic substitutions within the layers e g al3 in the octahedral sheet replaced by mg2 the resulting negative charge in layers is balanced by the interlayer exchangeable na the model cell of na bentonite was built up according to a triclinic p1 orthogonalized unit with a 5 18 å b 8 98 å c 15 00 å and α β γ 90 viani et al 2002 one hydroxyl hydrogen atom was added to each octahedral oxygen that does not contact with tetrahedral silicon and the o h bond distance was assigned to be 0 96 å skipper et al 1991 one aluminum in the octahedral sheet was substituted by magnesium which resulted in a unit cell formula of nasi8al3mgo20 oh 4 the basal spacing of fluoro200 was determined to be 29 00 å via xrd in this study prior literature indicates that the chemical structure of the quaternary ammonium cation can influence the basal spacing for this study we selected the quaternary ammonium cation that has three methyl groups and one long hydrocarbon chain c24h49n ch3 3 c24 to be the intercalant which gives 29 00 å spacing heinz et al 2007 for simulation purposes a supercell consisting of 16 c24 bentonite unit cells 4 2 2 was constructed and applied in the periodic md simulation of fluoro200 illustrated in scheme 1 3 2 molecular dynamics simulations all atom md simulation based on classical mechanics of multiparticle systems was employed to estimate the basal spacing interlayer conformation and adsorption behaviour of pfoa anions on the modified clay represented by the 4 2 2 c24 bentonite supercell a combined force field of clayff cygan et al 2004 and the consistent valence force field cvff dauber osguthorpe et al 1988 was applied to define the interactions among the clay intercalant and adsorbates pfass in this work see the supplementary materials c24 bentonite supercell was first created and 1 or 4 pfoa anions were then intercalated using materials studio 6 0 the cluster of c24 bentonite supercell with pfoa s was relaxed via the canonical nvt constant number of molecules volume and temperature ensembles for 800 ps at 298 k with a time step of 1 fs followed by the isothermal isobaric npt constant number of molecules pressure and temperature simulation for 800 ps at 298 k and 1 atm in the dl poly 4 09 with the velocity verlet integration algorithms todorov et al 2006 periodic boundary conditions were applied in three dimensions the non bond electrostatic interaction was calculated by the smoothed particle mesh ewald summation method and temperature and pressure were maintained by the nose hoover langevin thermostat hoover 1985 nosé 1984 and berendsen barostat berendsen et al 1984 respectively during the simulation the smectite atoms were fixed while all atoms of interlayer c24 cations and pfoa anions could move 3 3 quantum calculations the first principle dft based geometry optimizations for c24 pfoa pfoa pfos and perfluorohexane sulfonamide fhxsa molecule were first conducted individually and the clusters of c24 pfoa c24 pfos and c24 fhxsa were then generated by combing the intercalant with pfoa pfos and fhxsa molecule respectively and geo optimized the vibrational analysis of the optimized structures was also processed all these calculations were carried out at the b3lyp 6 311 g 2d 2p level of theory using gaussian 16 liu et al 2018 the binding energy was determined using the following equation greathouse et al 2017 1 e b i n d i n g e c l u s t e r e a d s o r b a t e e i n t e r c a l a n t where ebinding is the binding energy ecluster is the free energy of the optimized cluster c24 pfoa c24 pfos and c24 fhxsa and eadsorbate and eintercalant denote the free energy of the optimized adsorbates and c24 respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 adsorption kinetics and removal efficiency among the 49 pfas that were targeted thirteen anionic and two neutral pfass were identified in the afff impacted groundwater fig s3 above the detection limits the total concentration of pfass was determined to be 64 9 1 0 μg l and pfoa 5 99 0 11 μg l perfluorohexane sulfonate pfhxs 15 4 0 5 μg l pfos 14 2 0 3 μg l fhxsa 12 4 0 1 μg l and 6 2 fluorotelomer sulfonate 6 2 ftsa 7 5 0 3 μg l were the dominant pfas species the pfas profile in the groundwater bears some similarity to the previously reported pfas characterization at afff impacted sites where pfos pfoa and 6 2 ftsa were major anionic species backe et al 2013 and fhxsa was the major neutral species mcguire et al 2014 the effect of contact time on the adsorption of pfass in groundwater by fluoro200 at different dosages is displayed in fig s4 the adsorption of pfass was rapid in the first 12 h and then slowed down until the equilibrium was achieved no later than 168 h thus 168 h was chosen to evaluate removal efficiencies and for isotherm studies previously 168 h was found sufficient to reach adsorption equilibrium for gac ion exchange resin and biochar yu et al 2009 zhi and liu 2018 the removal efficiency for thirteen individual compounds and the total pfass at a ratio of adsorbent groundwater 40 mg 400 ml is illustrated in fig 1 fluoro200 removed between 74 to 99 pfas except pfpea from the real groundwater the performance of fluoro200 is mostly superior to that of the granular activated carbon gac400 except for pfpea and fbsa the efficiency of which was around 51 66 under the same conditions the hardwood based biochar expressed the lowest removal efficiency for the individual or total pfass with efficiencies of no more than 16 the ion exchange resin ier was the best performing adsorbent overall in this study with efficiencies no less than 74 yet for nine out of thirteen pfass particularly long chain compounds fluorosorb200 achieved comparable removal efficiency activated carbons have been the most frequently used adsorbent materials for pfas removal from impacted drinking water or groundwater due to large specific area and the ability to engage strong hydrophobic interactions xiao et al 2017 compared to commercially available gac the performance of biochars are highly variable for a given pfas compound such as pfos probably due to their widely variable properties xiao et al 2017 ion exchange resins have been found in previous studies to perform better than gac in removing anionic pfass like pfos yu et al 2009 consistent with the current findings the results demonstrate for the first time that among the commercial adsorbents the modified clay represents a highly effective option for pfas removal fig 1 the discussion of adsorption isotherms and mechanisms supported by molecular simulation is thus concentrated on the modified clay fluoro200 4 2 adsorption behaviors of pfass in groundwater on the modified clay the experimentally obtained adsorption isotherms of pfass in groundwater on fluoro200 are illustrated in fig 2 it is noted that the isotherms were measured by varying the adsorbent groundwater ratio 5 40 mg dry fluoro200 400 ml groundwater pfechs fbsa and 8 2 ftsa were not presented since the concentrations were lower than the detection limit at the tested concentration ranges pfhpa and pfbs revealed linear isotherms in contrast the piecewise isotherms that contain a linear isotherm and a langmuir type isotherm were observed in the adsorption of anionic pfoa pfpes pfhxs pfhps pfos and 6 2 ftsa and neutral fhxsa and fosa pfass that have relatively higher concentrations in the groundwater and a broader range of concentration under the tested dosage such results demonstrated that the adsorption behaviours of anionic and neutral pfass on fluoro200 were significantly influenced by the small change of the system such as concentration particularly in the pfas contaminated groundwater in which the concentrations of pfass are generally at the ng l and μg l levels pfoa for example displayed a linear isotherm in the relatively low concentration range i e step i from 0 55 μg l to 1 59 μg l and a langmuir type isotherm at slightly higher concentration range i e step ⅱ and ⅲ from 1 59 μg l to 2 73 μg l site energy e and its distribution f e derived from the piecewise adsorption isotherms were estimated to further illustrate the adsorption behaviours of pfass on fluoro200 the site energy e has been related to the equilibrium adsorbate concentration ce cerofolini 1974 2 e r t l n c e c s where e refers to the difference of adsorption energies between the adsorbate and solvent to the adsorbent surface cs denotes the maximum water solubility of the adsorbate the cs values of pfass were pfhxa 1 09 104 mg l pfhpa 1 31 103 mg l pfoa 102 5 mg l pfhxs 2 04 103 mg l predicted by sparc web service pfbs 5 20 103 mg l safety data sheet of cas no 29420 49 3 provied by sigma aldrich and pfos 680 mg l epa 2017 incorporating the ce value into eq 2 the site energy was determined and then plotted as a function of qe in fig s5 the e values of all pfass significantly decreased as qe increased the results demonstrated that pfas anions pfhxa pfhpa pfoa pfbs pfhxs pfos and 6 2 ftsa or neutral molecules fhxsa and fosa first occupied the high energy adsorption sites of fluoro200 and then spread to the low energy sites furthermore the site energy as a function of the equilibrium adsorption capacity could be concluded as a piecewise function corresponding to the isotherm i e a dramatically linear decrease with the increase of qe value ⅰ then a slight decrease ⅱ and finally a slow decrease ⅲ the diversity in site energy e revealed that the adsorption driving force of pfass on the modified clay differed with the increasing occupation of adsorption sites which may be due to the heterogeneity of the adsorbent it has been reported that the adsorption site heterogeneity of an adsorbent mainly originates from defects crosslinking and disordered arrangement structures that could form the highly polarized edge sites cerofolini and cerofolini 1980 the modified clay was prepared via intercalating quaternary ammonium surfactants in the exchangeable interlayer sites of 2 1 type na bentonite as illustrated in scheme 1 anionic pfass pfoa pfpes pfhxs pfhps pfos and 6 2 ftsa may strongly interact with the interlayer quaternary ammonium cations via the ionic attraction between the negatively charged head group coo or so2o and positively charged center i e the nitrogen atom and its adjacent carbons rather than the single nitrogen atom zeng et al 2003 particularly those charge centers localized on the bare interlayer edge sites have higher site energy than the other interlayer surface sites due to the edge polarization i e the accumulation of charges at the edge corner of a rectangular interlayer zhou et al 2015 the interactions between the carbon hydrogen chains of quaternary ammonium cation and the perfluoroalkyl chain of pfass and the fluorophilic interaction among the perfluoroalkyl chains of pfass may play roles in the adsorption of pfass on the modified clay the diversity of site locations e g interlayer edge and surface sites and molecular interactions could contribute to the energetical heterogeneity of the adsorbent the strength of adsorption affinity between the modified clay and pfass can be quantified by the weighted mean μ e of site energy distribution to achieve the site energy distributions we fit the piecewise isotherms of pfass with the linear and langmuir freundlich equations and the fitting results were presented in table s4 and fig s6 then the site energy distribution f e was achieved by differentiating the isotherm carter et al 1995 yan and niu 2017 3 f e d q e e d e the site energy distribution f e l based on the linear isotherm model is 4 f e l k 1 c s e e r t r t the site energy distribution f e l f based on the langmuir freundlich model is 5 f e l f q m n k 2 c s n e n e r t r t 1 k 2 c s n e n e r t 2 the weighted mean of site energy distribution f e l and f e l f were determined to be 6 μ e l r t e 1 q e 1 e 2 q e 2 q e 1 q e 2 7 μ e l f r t n ln 1 b c s n e 1 and e 2 are the boundary values and e 1 e 2 the detailed derivation of the site energy distribution could be found elsewhere yan and niu 2017 yan et al 2017 the piecewise site energy distribution of pfass on the modified clay was illustrated in fig s7 according to eq 6 and 7 the weighted mean μ e values of each site energy distribution were determined it has been reported that the higher the value of the weighted mean the stronger the adsorption affinity carter et al 1995 the higher values of μ e l than those of μ e l f demonstrated that the interactions between pfass and the modified clay at the lower concentration range ⅰ linear type were stronger than those at the higher concentration range ⅱ ⅲ langmuir freundlich type 4 3 effect of co contaminants and water chemistry organic co contaminants can co exist with pfass in afff impacted subsurface environments mckenzie et al 2016 as the groundwater used in the current study contained few organic contaminants other than pfass the effects of co contaminants were assessed by amending the groundwater with four common types of groundwater contaminants including diesel tce btex and 1 4 dioxane fig s8 two environmentally relevant concentrations at low and high levels were evaluated anderson 2019 diesel c10 c28 at the low level 1 0 mg l either mildly reduced the removal of pfas or had no impact fig 1 and s8 however at a high level of 100 mg l diesel slightly improved the removal efficiency for several pfas including pfoa for btex tce and 1 4 dioxane present at 0 01 and 1 0 mg l the removal efficiency of pfas was almost identical at both concentrations suggesting no or minimal impact guelfo and higgins et al 2013 previously reported that several co contaminants such as tce and nonfluorinated surfactants at environmentally relevant concentrations impacted the sorption of perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas by surface soils with a multitude of factors at play both positive and negative impacts on sorption were observed the extent of the impact varied with the concentrations of both pfaas and co contaminants and there was significant soil to soil variability as the findings from soils cannot be readily extrapolated to the modified clay co contaminant effect and related mechanisms may be further investigated in the future nevertheless the present findings suggested that the performance of fluoro200 is unlikely to be significantly altered by other co occurring organic pollutants in addition the influence of water chemistry was also assessed by adding cacl2 or nacl to the groundwater to enhance the levels of divalent ca2 and monovalent na cations as well as solution ionic strength the natural background of the cations were ca2 50 mg l and na 2 6 mg l both low and high level enhancement barely made any difference to the removal efficiency of most pfas for fluoro200 as shown in fig s9 the changes in solution ph were not investigated as adding an acid or base to the natural groundwater can cause significant changes of other parameters to resulting in other confounding effects the effects of anions e g cl no3 and so4 2 present in natural waters as well as other organic co contaminants can be further examined 4 4 molecular interactions of pfass with the modified clay the ftir spectra of diwater f200 pfoa acid powder and f200 pfoa were measured to investigate the molecular interactions fig 3 wavenumbers of 1000 1115 1468 2855 and 2922 cm 1 of the spectrum of diwater f200 were attributed to the asymmetric c n stretching c n stretching methyl c h bending asymmetric and symmetric of c h in ch2 respectively and these peaks remained on that of f200 pfoa moreover the hydroxyl group 3630 cm 1 of fluoro200 kept the free state rather than the state of a hydrogen bonded hydroxyl group which indicated that hydrogen bonding might not be formed between the carboxyl group of pfoa and the hydroxyl groups on fluoro200 the peaks at 1140 1200 and 1230 cm 1 of the pfoa spectrum were assigned to the c f stretching such peaks appeared on the spectrum of f200 pfoa as well which demonstrated that fluoro200 successfully adsorbed pfoa importantly the carboxylic c o of stretching appeared at 1753 cm 1 on pfoa al omari et al 2014 red shifted to 1690 cm 1 of the f200 pfoa spectrum which was carboxylate c o the redshift of c o indicated that the interlayer quaternary ammonium cations might form a strong ionic association with pfoa anions via the positively charged center i e the nitrogen atom and its adjacent carbons and the negatively charged head group coo therefore the ionic attraction was proposed as one of the dominant driving forces for the adsorption of anionic pfass on the modified clay xrd measurements were carried out to further investigate the adsorption mechanism from the viewpoint of the crystal structure the xrd patterns of na bentonite diwater f200 f200 5mg f200 20mg and f200 40mg are displayed in fig 4 based on bragg s law the values of basal spacing which is the sum of the clay sheet s thickness and interlayer distance were determined the basal spacing significantly increased from 12 4 å of the na bentonite to 29 0 å of the diwater f200 which indicated the intercalation caused the na bentonite to expand notably however with the decrease in the dosage of the adsorbent corresponding to the increase in the loading of pfass on fluoro200 the values of basal spacing slightly increased to 29 6 å the almost non swelling results demonstrated that the anionic and neutral pfass in groundwater were mainly adsorbed on the bare outer interlayer surface sites rather than the inner interlayer sites of the modified clay this has shown that the interlayer sites have not been utilized for taking up pfas because of the relatively low pfas concentrations future studies are necessary to examine changes in crystal structure when a large amount of pfass enter the interlayer space of the modified clay moreover the full capacity of the modified clay needs to be determined either at much higher aqueous concentrations or through flow through column studies wherethe expansion of interlayer spacing can be more discernible because the concentrations of the pfass in the particular groundwater are far less than 1 10 5 mol l that was suggested as the minimum concentration to form the hemimicelles krafft and riess 2015 sharma et al 1996 the formation of hemimicelles in aqueous solution was not considered in this work combining the analyses of experimental isotherms site energy and its distribution ftir spectra and xrd patterns the adsorption mechanism of pfass in groundwater on the modified clay are proposed and illustrated in scheme 2 step ⅰ the primary driving force is the ionic attraction between the negatively charged head group coo or so2o of the anionic pfass pfoa pfpes pfhxs pfhps pfos and 6 2 ftsa and positively charged center of the intercalated quaternary ammonium cations importantly for neutral pfas fhxsa and fosa and long chain anionic compounds the hydrophobic interactions between the c f chain and the hydrocarbon chain of the quaternary ammonium intercalant of the modified clay are also significant the adsorption occurred on the discrete bare edge sites that are highly polarized at equilibrium 8 e d g e s i t e p f a s m o n o m e r a d s o r b e d m o n o m e r the equilibrium constant k 1 of which is given by 9 k 1 a 1 a s i a where a is the activity of pfass for groundwater a c the concentration of pfas μg l and a 1 and a s i are the activities of adsorbed pfass and edge sites respectively because the ce values of pfass in step ⅰ are even less than 1 10 8 mol l a linear isotherm could be obtained 10 q e k 1 c e qe denotes the equilibrium adsorption capacity μg g steps ⅱ ⅲ the adsorption rapidly increases as free pfass spread and capture the interlayer surface sites that close to the bare edge sites occupied in step ⅰ the lateral interactions e g fluorophilic interaction among the free and adsorbed pfass play the key role and dramatically enhance the adsorption while the adsorption may still be primarily driven by the ionic attraction and or the hydrophobic interaction which is supported by the ftir spectra redshift from 1753 cm 1 carboxylic c o stretching to 1690 cm 1 carboxylate c o stretching for pfoa in fig 3 considering the langmuir shape isotherms of steps ⅱ ⅲ fig 2 and the heterogeneity of interlayer surface sites of the modified clay the modified langmuir freundlich model was applied in step ⅱ ⅲ 11 q e q m k 2 c e n 1 k 2 c e n a where qm and k2 refer to the maximum adsorption capacity of the modified clay μg g and equilibrium constant of steps ⅱ ⅲ respectively n is indicative of the interlayer surface site heterogeneity of the adsorbent the lower the value of n the stronger the heterogeneity cerofolini and rudziński 1997 a denotes the amount of pfass adsorbed in step ⅰ which could be neglected if the value of qm is far more than that of a the experimentally obtained isotherms of pfass on the modified clay were well fitted by the proposed piecewise isotherm model as presented in table s4 it is worth noting that as the isotherm and isotherm models are highly dependent on the window of observation or the concentration range of the target adsorbates the current isotherms are only applicable to the overall low concentration scenario that was observed with the groundwater sample future studies are necessary to explore the effects of chain length the maximum adsorption capacity of the modified clay as well as the isotherms above the concentration range discussed in the present study 4 5 radial distribution function and interlayer conformation isothermal isobaric md simulation was processed to elucidate the adsorption mechanisms of pfoa on fluoro200 the concentration of pfoa anion was increased from 1 step ⅰ to 4 step ⅱ ⅲ for each supercell which included the transition from the linear isotherm to langmuir shape isotherm the radial distribution functions g r of the edge n carboxylate o atom pair was determined to gain further insight into the distribution of pfass in the interlayer region fig 5 a illustrates that 1 pfoa anion attached to the cationic intercalant n via the terminal oxygen atoms of carboxylate and the distance was determined to be 4 52 å i e the distance of the edge n and first carboxylate o atom according to fig 5a and b the second pfoa anion was adsorbed close to the first pfoa anion adsorbed by the edge site and so on the distances of the first and second and the third and fourth pfoa anions i e the mean distance of carboxylate group were 2 03 and 2 05 å respectively which implies the occurrence of lateral interactions such as fluorophilic interactions among the perfluoroalkyl chain of pfoa anions it is worth noting that the carboxylate oxygen atoms of second pfoa anion also was accompanied by the n atom next to the edge n atom which indicated that the ionic attraction played an important role in the binding of pfoa anions with fluoro200 furthermore with the adsorption of pfoa anions the simulation predicted that basal spacing would only slightly increase from 28 35 to 28 40 1 pfoa anion or 28 45 å 4 pfoa anions which is consistent with xrd results fig 4 the molecular dynamics simulation results revealed that the bare edge site of the interlayer surface was first occupied via the ionic attraction then adsorbates spreaded to the interlayer surface sites near the bare edge sites which strongly support the proposed piecewise adsorption mechanism 4 6 quantum calculations high level electron density based calculations were performed to probe how selected pfas compounds interact with the intercalant of the modified clay fluoro200 derive the most stable adsorption configurations of the isolated clusters and determine the corresponding binding energies based on the free energies of the adsorbates intercalant and the clusters b3lyp 6 311 g 2d 2p optimized structures the binding energies of fluoro200 with three dominant pfass in the groundwater i e pfoa anion pfos anion and fhxsa were predicted and presented in table 1 the clusters of c24 pfoa 68 62 kcal mol and c24 pfos 64 79 kcal mol demonstrated higher binding energies than that of c24 fhxsa 1 18 kcal mol the optimized geometrical structures of the clusters c24 pfoa and c24 pfos revealed that the ionic interactions controlled the strong interaction of c24 with either of the terminal oxygen atoms of the carboxylate group of pfoa anion or the sulfonate group of pfos anion fig 6 a and b as a result the adsorbed pfoa remained to be in the anionic state and a phase transition redshift of the carboxylic cooh of pfoa molecule to carboxylate coo of the c24 pfoa cluster was recorded in the simulated vibrational analysis fig 6d which is consistent with experimental ftir spectra fig 3 by contrast a linear configuration of the fhxsa molecule with c24 was observed which indicated the hydrophobic interaction between the carbon hydrogen chain of fluoro200 and the perfluoroalkyl chain of neutral pfas compounds in conclusion the results of molecular dynamics simulation and quantum calculation provided molecule level support for the proposed piecewise adsorption mechanism though the study has provided critical knowledge to strongly support the use of modified clays for pfas water treatment or groundwater site remediation follow up studies are necessary to explore the issues that have not been addressed in this single study the impact of natural organic matter known to reduce the performance of activated carbon and ion exchange resins is yet to be evaluated on modified clays the potential for adsorbent regeneration and reuse or efficient ways to dispose of spent clay materials should be examined in the context of reducing treatment cost and minimizing any secondary environmental issues 5 conclusions laboratory sorption experiments confirmed that modified bentonite clays e g fluoro sorb 200 are highly effective in removing diverse types of anionic and neutral pfass from afff impacted groundwater organic co contaminants such as diesel btex tce and 1 4 dioxane at the levels typically observed in groundwater as well as varying levels of common cations do not affect the sorptive removal pfos and pfoa detected in a real groundwater exceeded the us epa drinking water advisory levels 70 ng l however other polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl acids e g 6 2 ftsa pfhxa and neutral perfluoroalkyl sulfonamides e g fhxsa and fosa were also present at significant concentrations additional research should be devoted to treating a broad suite of pfas water pollutants given the ever evolving regulations molecular simulations demonstrated that in a real afff impacted groundwater pfas anions first occupy the highly polarized bare interlayer edge sites of the modified clay and then the interlayer surface sites which is driven by the ionic interaction and also lateral interaction such as fluorophilic attraction for neutral pfass such as fhxsa and fosa and long chain anionic compounds the hydrophobic interactions between the c f chain and the hydrocarbon chain of the quaternary ammonium intercalant are also significant these results suggest that the diverse chemistry of pfass dictates that multiple interactions can be responsible for the sorption of pfas by sorbent materials and the type of interactions varies from compound to compound within the pfas chemical family

17694,repeated application of aqueous film forming foams afff in designated firefighting training areas has caused severe groundwater contamination by per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass many research efforts are currently engaged for the effective removal of these chemicals from environmental waters in this study we demonstrate that modified clay produced by intercalating quaternary ammonium cations in the exchangeable interlayer sites of smectite clay can effectively remove pfas pollutants in real groundwater via strong adsorption the performance of the modified clay with removal efficiencies 95 99 is superior to those of granular activated carbon or hard wood biochar and comparable to an ion exchange resin removal efficiency is not impacted by potential organic co contaminants e g diesel btex tce and 1 4 dioxane or water chemistry ca2 and na at environmentally relevant concentrations furthermore piecewise isotherms are identified to represent the uptake of pfass by the modified clay based on molecular dynamics simulations the anionic pfass first occupy the highly polarized bare interlayer edge sites leading to a linear isotherm and then the interlayer surface sites resulting in a langmuir isotherm the ionic interactions between the cationic intercalant n and the terminal oxygen atoms of carboxylate or sulfonate groups of pfass play a dominant role in adsorption and the lateral interaction in particular fluorophilic attraction among pfass accelerate the adsorption the strength of these interactions is quantified using density functional theory calculations simulation results match reasonably well with the experimentally determined basal spacing and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of the modified clay loaded with pfass overall the combined experimental and molecular simulation studies elucidate the adsorption mechanism of pfass on the modified clay and provide critical information to guide the use of modified clays for pfas

contamination of soil sediment biota and groundwater demanding considerable attention due to the bioaccumulation potential and carcinogenicity of certain pfass dewitt 2015 lau et al 2007 us environmental protection agency epa has established a drinking water advisory level of 70 parts per trillion for perfluorooctane carboxylate pfoa and sulfonate pfos individually or combined hogue 2018 stringent regulations require the development of treatment technologies that can control the migration of pfass or clean up impacted sites cost effectively adsorption is one of the most effective methods for the removal of inorganic and organic contaminants from contaminated water activated carbon zhi and liu 2018 and ion exchange resins zaggia et al 2016 are the most often tested and employed adsorbents to treat pfass for instance for groundwater remediation using the pump and treatment scheme epa 2018 ross et al 2018 as dominant pfass found in contaminated waters are anionic and quite hydrophilic activated carbon or non ionic resins with low charge density do not exhibit adequate affinity leading to low treatment efficiency and high treatment cost ross et al 2018 therefore amine functionalized sorbents have been evaluated over the past years as a way to achieve specific interactions and enhance adsorption ateia et al 2019 ateia et al 2018 deng et al 2013 ji et al 2018 klemes

substrates e g carbohydrates non carbohydrate polymers nanostructured polymers and inorganic materials have been explored for amine functionalization as discussed in a recent critical review by ateia et al 2019a these next generation materials pivot around enhancing the ionic interactions that anionic pfass can engage with amine groups from primary amines to quaternary ammonium groups while still utilizing hydrophobic interactions modified smectite clays share many of the same properties illustrated by ateia et al 2019a as those next generation materials but have rarely been tested for pfas remediation low cost smectite clays can be modified by intercalating quaternary ammonium surfactants into the interlayer space via ion exchanging with cations e g k na and ca2 favre and lagaly 1991 such materials have long been shown to improve adsorption capacity towards metals and organic compounds e g cr2o7 2 methylene blue and phenolic compounds due to hydrophobic interactions ionic interactions as well as increased interlayer distance han et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 a modified palygoskite adsorbent was employed to remove pfos from an artificial water medium with promising results das et al 2013 yet much is unknown about the performance of such clay materials for other pfass in real waters and at environmentally relevant concentrations adsorption behaviours may drastically differ in a real groundwater matrix that can contain elevated levels of co contaminants such as fuel chemicals and chlorinated solvents mcguire et al 2014 mckenzie et al 2016 furthermore an incomplete understanding of adsorption mechanisms may also prevent achieving efficient pfas treatment to what extent pfass of different chain lengths can engage ionic interactions with quaternary ammonium groups present in clay interlayers is not known elucidation of adsorption mechanisms requires insights into the molecular processes responsible for adsorption of pfass by adsorbents such as smectite clays tools such as molecular dynamics md and quantum calculations based on the density functional theory dft are now available for studying molecular processes md which simulates the natural motion of a molecular system is a physics based modelling method and can be employed to investigate the conformational space and distribution of the target molecules in the interlayer region as well as conformational changes of atoms and molecules epa et al 2012 the radial distribution function g r derived from md atomic trajectories defines the probability of finding an atom at a distance r from the target atom which is critical to depict the distribution of the species in the interlayer region cygan et al 2012 quantum calculations based on dft can also provide a detailed picture of the molecular geometry of organic molecules on an adsorbent and perform vibrational frequency analysis molecular and quantum level data on adsorption behaviours of environmentally relevant pfass are still sparse in this work pfas impacted groundwater was collected from a former us air force base with a history of afff applications and used in batch adsorption experiments the treatment performance of a modified smectite clay was compared with those of granular activated carbon biochar and ion exchange resin the influence of water chemistry and relevant co contaminants on adsorbent performance was investigated the molecular interaction and the change in the basal spacing of the modified clay due to adsorption were recorded by the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray diffraction xrd patterns md simulation and dft quantum calculations were used to probe the layering behaviours and interlayer structure of the modified clay loaded with pfass the experiments and molecular simulation together clarify the real world adsorption mechanisms of pfass on modified smectite clays 2 materials and methods 2 1 adsorbents and groundwater the modified bentonite fluoro sorb

an orbital shaker at 150 rpm in the dark the supernatant 1500 μl was subsampled into a microcentrifuge tube and then centrifuged 20 000 g and 10 min and 40 μl of the centrifuged supernatant was diluted with 160 μl meoh in an hplc vial right before chemical analysis 20 μl of internal standards mixture was added the concentrations of pfass were determined by the uhplc hrms method provided in section 2 3 the respective blank samples afff impacted groundwater without adsorbents were executed under the same conditions and adsorption of pfass onto the hdpe bottles was found to be

belongs to the 2 1 type smectites and is negatively charged due to isomorphic substitutions within the layers e g al3 in the octahedral sheet replaced by mg2 the resulting negative charge in layers is balanced by the interlayer exchangeable na the model cell of na bentonite was built up according to a triclinic p1 orthogonalized unit with a 5 18 å b 8 98 å c 15 00 å and α β γ 90 viani et al 2002 one hydroxyl hydrogen atom was added to each octahedral oxygen that does not contact with tetrahedral silicon and the o h bond distance was assigned to be 0 96 å skipper et al 1991 one aluminum in the octahedral sheet was substituted by magnesium which resulted in a unit cell formula of nasi8al3mgo20 oh 4 the basal spacing of fluoro200 was determined to be 29 00 å via xrd in this study prior literature indicates that the chemical structure of the quaternary ammonium cation can influence the basal spacing for this study we selected the quaternary ammonium cation that has three methyl groups and one long hydrocarbon chain c24h49n ch3 3 c24 to be the intercalant which gives 29 00 å spacing heinz et al 2007 for simulation purposes a supercell consisting of 16 c24 bentonite unit cells 4 2 2 was constructed and applied in the periodic md simulation of fluoro200 illustrated in scheme 1 3 2 molecular dynamics simulations all atom md simulation based on classical mechanics of multiparticle systems was employed to estimate the basal spacing interlayer conformation and adsorption behaviour of pfoa anions on the modified clay represented by the 4 2 2 c24 bentonite supercell a combined force field of clayff cygan et al 2004 and the consistent valence force field cvff dauber osguthorpe et al 1988 was applied to define the interactions among the clay intercalant and adsorbates pfass in this work see the supplementary materials c24 bentonite supercell was first created and 1 or 4 pfoa anions were then intercalated using materials studio 6 0 the cluster of c24 bentonite supercell with pfoa s was relaxed via the canonical nvt constant number of molecules volume and temperature ensembles for 800 ps at 298 k with a time step of 1 fs followed by the isothermal isobaric npt constant number of molecules pressure and temperature simulation for 800 ps at 298 k and 1 atm in the dl poly 4 09 with the velocity verlet integration algorithms todorov et al 2006 periodic boundary conditions were applied in three dimensions the non bond electrostatic interaction was calculated by the smoothed particle mesh ewald summation method and temperature and pressure were maintained by the nose hoover langevin thermostat hoover 1985 nosé 1984 and berendsen barostat berendsen et al 1984 respectively during the simulation the smectite atoms were fixed while all atoms of interlayer c24 cations and pfoa anions could move 3 3 quantum calculations the first principle dft based geometry optimizations for c24 pfoa pfoa pfos and perfluorohexane sulfonamide fhxsa molecule were first conducted individually and the clusters of c24 pfoa c24 pfos and c24 fhxsa were then generated by combing the intercalant with pfoa pfos and fhxsa molecule respectively and geo optimized the vibrational analysis of the optimized structures was also processed all these calculations were carried out at the b3lyp 6 311 g 2d 2p level of theory using gaussian 16 liu et al 2018 the binding energy was determined using the following equation greathouse et al 2017 1 e b i n d i n g e c l u s t e r e a d s o r b a t e e i n t e r c a l a n t where ebinding is the binding energy ecluster is the free energy of the optimized cluster c24 pfoa c24 pfos and c24 fhxsa and eadsorbate and eintercalant denote the free energy of the optimized adsorbates and c24 respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 adsorption kinetics and removal efficiency among the 49 pfas that were targeted thirteen anionic and two neutral pfass were identified in the afff impacted groundwater fig s3 above the detection limits the total concentration of pfass was determined to be 64 9 1 0 μg l and pfoa 5 99 0 11 μg l perfluorohexane sulfonate pfhxs 15 4 0 5 μg l pfos 14 2 0 3 μg l fhxsa 12 4 0 1 μg l and 6 2 fluorotelomer sulfonate 6 2 ftsa 7 5 0 3 μg l were the dominant pfas species the pfas profile in the groundwater bears some similarity to the previously reported pfas characterization at afff impacted sites where pfos pfoa and 6 2 ftsa were major anionic species backe et al 2013 and fhxsa was the major neutral species mcguire et al 2014 the effect of contact time on the adsorption of pfass in groundwater by fluoro200 at different dosages is displayed in fig s4 the adsorption of pfass was rapid in the first 12 h and then slowed down until the equilibrium was achieved no later than 168 h thus 168 h was chosen to evaluate removal efficiencies and for isotherm studies previously 168 h was found sufficient to reach adsorption equilibrium for gac ion exchange resin and biochar yu et al 2009 zhi and liu 2018 the removal efficiency for thirteen individual compounds and the total pfass at a ratio of adsorbent groundwater 40 mg 400 ml is illustrated in fig 1 fluoro200 removed between 74 to 99 pfas except pfpea from the real groundwater the performance of fluoro200 is mostly superior to that of the granular activated carbon gac400 except for pfpea and fbsa the efficiency of which was around 51 66 under the same conditions the hardwood based biochar expressed the lowest removal efficiency for the individual or total pfass with efficiencies of no more than 16 the ion exchange resin ier was the best performing adsorbent overall in this study with efficiencies no less than 74 yet for nine out of thirteen pfass particularly long chain compounds fluorosorb200 achieved comparable removal efficiency activated carbons have been the most frequently used adsorbent materials for pfas removal from impacted drinking water or groundwater due to large specific area and the ability to engage strong hydrophobic interactions xiao et al 2017 compared to commercially available gac the performance of biochars are highly variable for a given pfas compound such as pfos probably due to their widely variable properties xiao et al 2017 ion exchange resins have been found in previous studies to perform better than gac in removing anionic pfass like pfos yu et al 2009 consistent with the current findings the results demonstrate for the first time that among the commercial adsorbents the modified clay represents a highly effective option for pfas removal fig 1 the discussion of adsorption isotherms and mechanisms supported by molecular simulation is thus concentrated on the modified clay fluoro200 4 2 adsorption behaviors of pfass in groundwater on the modified clay the experimentally obtained adsorption isotherms of pfass in groundwater on fluoro200 are illustrated in fig 2 it is noted that the isotherms were measured by varying the adsorbent groundwater ratio 5 40 mg dry fluoro200 400 ml groundwater pfechs fbsa and 8 2 ftsa were not presented since the concentrations were lower than the detection limit at the tested concentration ranges pfhpa and pfbs revealed linear isotherms in contrast the piecewise isotherms that contain a linear isotherm and a langmuir type isotherm were observed in the adsorption of anionic pfoa pfpes pfhxs pfhps pfos and 6 2 ftsa and neutral fhxsa and fosa pfass that have relatively higher concentrations in the groundwater and a broader range of concentration under the tested dosage such results demonstrated that the adsorption behaviours of anionic and neutral pfass on fluoro200 were significantly influenced by the small change of the system such as concentration particularly in the pfas contaminated groundwater in which the concentrations of pfass are generally at the ng l and μg l levels pfoa for example displayed a linear isotherm in the relatively low concentration range i e step i from 0 55 μg l to 1 59 μg l and a langmuir type isotherm at slightly higher concentration range i e step ⅱ and ⅲ from 1 59 μg l to 2 73 μg l site energy e and its distribution f e derived from the piecewise adsorption isotherms were estimated to further illustrate the adsorption behaviours of pfass on fluoro200 the site energy e has been related to the equilibrium adsorbate concentration ce cerofolini 1974 2 e r t l n c e c s where e refers to the difference of adsorption energies between the adsorbate and solvent to the adsorbent surface cs denotes the maximum water solubility of the adsorbate the cs values of pfass were pfhxa 1 09 104 mg l pfhpa 1 31 103 mg l pfoa 102 5 mg l pfhxs 2 04 103 mg l predicted by sparc web service pfbs 5 20 103 mg l safety data sheet of cas no 29420 49 3 provied by sigma aldrich and pfos 680 mg l epa 2017 incorporating the ce value into eq 2 the site energy was determined and then plotted as a function of qe in fig s5 the e values of all pfass significantly decreased as qe increased the results demonstrated that pfas anions pfhxa pfhpa pfoa pfbs pfhxs pfos and 6 2 ftsa or neutral molecules fhxsa and fosa first occupied the high energy adsorption sites of fluoro200 and then spread to the low energy sites furthermore the site energy as a function of the equilibrium adsorption capacity could be concluded as a piecewise function corresponding to the isotherm i e a dramatically linear decrease with the increase of qe value ⅰ then a slight decrease ⅱ and finally a slow decrease ⅲ the diversity in site energy e revealed that the adsorption driving force of pfass on the modified clay differed with the increasing occupation of adsorption sites which may be due to the heterogeneity of the adsorbent it has been reported that the adsorption site heterogeneity of an adsorbent mainly originates from defects crosslinking and disordered arrangement structures that could form the highly polarized edge sites cerofolini and cerofolini 1980 the modified clay was prepared via intercalating quaternary ammonium surfactants in the exchangeable interlayer sites of 2 1 type na bentonite as illustrated in scheme 1 anionic pfass pfoa pfpes pfhxs pfhps pfos and 6 2 ftsa may strongly interact with the interlayer quaternary ammonium cations via the ionic attraction between the negatively charged head group coo or so2o and positively charged center i e the nitrogen atom and its adjacent carbons rather than the single nitrogen atom zeng et al 2003 particularly those charge centers localized on the bare interlayer edge sites have higher site energy than the other interlayer surface sites due to the edge polarization i e the accumulation of charges at the edge corner of a rectangular interlayer zhou et al 2015 the interactions between the carbon hydrogen chains of quaternary ammonium cation and the perfluoroalkyl chain of pfass and the fluorophilic interaction among the perfluoroalkyl chains of pfass may play roles in the adsorption of pfass on the modified clay the diversity of site locations e g interlayer edge and surface sites and molecular interactions could contribute to the energetical heterogeneity of the adsorbent the strength of adsorption affinity between the modified clay and pfass can be quantified by the weighted mean μ e of site energy distribution to achieve the site energy distributions we fit the piecewise isotherms of pfass with the linear and langmuir freundlich equations and the fitting results were presented in table s4 and fig s6 then the site energy distribution f e was achieved by differentiating the isotherm carter et al 1995 yan and niu 2017 3 f e d q e e d e the site energy distribution f e l based on the linear isotherm model is 4 f e l k 1 c s e e r t r t the site energy distribution f e l f based on the langmuir freundlich model is 5 f e l f q m n k 2 c s n e n e r t r t 1 k 2 c s n e n e r t 2 the weighted mean of site energy distribution f e l and f e l f were determined to be 6 μ e l r t e 1 q e 1 e 2 q e 2 q e 1 q e 2 7 μ e l f r t n ln 1 b c s n e 1 and e 2 are the boundary values and e 1 e 2 the detailed derivation of the site energy distribution could be found elsewhere yan and niu 2017 yan et al 2017 the piecewise site energy distribution of pfass on the modified clay was illustrated in fig s7 according to eq 6 and 7 the weighted mean μ e values of each site energy distribution were determined it has been reported that the higher the value of the weighted mean the stronger the adsorption affinity carter et al 1995 the higher values of μ e l than those of μ e l f demonstrated that the interactions between pfass and the modified clay at the lower concentration range ⅰ linear type were stronger than those at the higher concentration range ⅱ ⅲ langmuir freundlich type 4 3 effect of co contaminants and water chemistry organic co contaminants can co exist with pfass in afff impacted subsurface environments mckenzie et al 2016 as the groundwater used in the current study contained few organic contaminants other than pfass the effects of co contaminants were assessed by amending the groundwater with four common types of groundwater contaminants including diesel tce btex and 1 4 dioxane fig s8 two environmentally relevant concentrations at low and high levels were evaluated anderson 2019 diesel c10 c28 at the low level 1 0 mg l either mildly reduced the removal of pfas or had no impact fig 1 and s8 however at a high level of 100 mg l diesel slightly improved the removal efficiency for several pfas including pfoa for btex tce and 1 4 dioxane present at 0 01 and 1 0 mg l the removal efficiency of pfas was almost identical at both concentrations suggesting no or minimal impact guelfo and higgins et al 2013 previously reported that several co contaminants such as tce and nonfluorinated surfactants at environmentally relevant concentrations impacted the sorption of perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas by surface soils with a multitude of factors at play both positive and negative impacts on sorption were observed the extent of the impact varied with the concentrations of both pfaas and co contaminants and there was significant soil to soil variability as the findings from soils cannot be readily extrapolated to the modified clay co contaminant effect and related mechanisms may be further investigated in the future nevertheless the present findings suggested that the performance of fluoro200 is unlikely to be significantly altered by other co occurring organic pollutants in addition the influence of water chemistry was also assessed by adding cacl2 or nacl to the groundwater to enhance the levels of divalent ca2 and monovalent na cations as well as solution ionic strength the natural background of the cations were ca2 50 mg l and na 2 6 mg l both low and high level enhancement barely made any difference to the removal efficiency of most pfas for fluoro200 as shown in fig s9 the changes in solution ph were not investigated as adding an acid or base to the natural groundwater can cause significant changes of other parameters to resulting in other confounding effects the effects of anions e g cl no3 and so4 2 present in natural waters as well as other organic co contaminants can be further examined 4 4 molecular interactions of pfass with the modified clay the ftir spectra of diwater f200 pfoa acid powder and f200 pfoa were measured to investigate the molecular interactions fig 3 wavenumbers of 1000 1115 1468 2855 and 2922 cm 1 of the spectrum of diwater f200 were attributed to the asymmetric c n stretching c n stretching methyl c h bending asymmetric and symmetric of c h in ch2 respectively and these peaks remained on that of f200 pfoa moreover the hydroxyl group 3630 cm 1 of fluoro200 kept the free state rather than the state of a hydrogen bonded hydroxyl group which indicated that hydrogen bonding might not be formed between the carboxyl group of pfoa and the hydroxyl groups on fluoro200 the peaks at 1140 1200 and 1230 cm 1 of the pfoa spectrum were assigned to the c f stretching such peaks appeared on the spectrum of f200 pfoa as well which demonstrated that fluoro200 successfully adsorbed pfoa importantly the carboxylic c o of stretching appeared at 1753 cm 1 on pfoa al omari et al 2014 red shifted to 1690 cm 1 of the f200 pfoa spectrum which was carboxylate c o the redshift of c o indicated that the interlayer quaternary ammonium cations might form a strong ionic association with pfoa anions via the positively charged center i e the nitrogen atom and its adjacent carbons and the negatively charged head group coo therefore the ionic attraction was proposed as one of the dominant driving forces for the adsorption of anionic pfass on the modified clay xrd measurements were carried out to further investigate the adsorption mechanism from the viewpoint of the crystal structure the xrd patterns of na bentonite diwater f200 f200 5mg f200 20mg and f200 40mg are displayed in fig 4 based on bragg s law the values of basal spacing which is the sum of the clay sheet s thickness and interlayer distance were determined the basal spacing significantly increased from 12 4 å of the na bentonite to 29 0 å of the diwater f200 which indicated the intercalation caused the na bentonite to expand notably however with the decrease in the dosage of the adsorbent corresponding to the increase in the loading of pfass on fluoro200 the values of basal spacing slightly increased to 29 6 å the almost non swelling results demonstrated that the anionic and neutral pfass in groundwater were mainly adsorbed on the bare outer interlayer surface sites rather than the inner interlayer sites of the modified clay this has shown that the interlayer sites have not been utilized for taking up pfas because of the relatively low pfas concentrations future studies are necessary to examine changes in crystal structure when a large amount of pfass enter the interlayer space of the modified clay moreover the full capacity of the modified clay needs to be determined either at much higher aqueous concentrations or through flow through column studies wherethe expansion of interlayer spacing can be more discernible because the concentrations of the pfass in the particular groundwater are far less than 1 10 5 mol l that was suggested as the minimum concentration to form the hemimicelles krafft and riess 2015 sharma et al 1996 the formation of hemimicelles in aqueous solution was not considered in this work combining the analyses of experimental isotherms site energy and its distribution ftir spectra and xrd patterns the adsorption mechanism of pfass in groundwater on the modified clay are proposed and illustrated in scheme 2 step ⅰ the primary driving force is the ionic attraction between the negatively charged head group coo or so2o of the anionic pfass pfoa pfpes pfhxs pfhps pfos and 6 2 ftsa and positively charged center of the intercalated quaternary ammonium cations importantly for neutral pfas fhxsa and fosa and long chain anionic compounds the hydrophobic interactions between the c f chain and the hydrocarbon chain of the quaternary ammonium intercalant of the modified clay are also significant the adsorption occurred on the discrete bare edge sites that are highly polarized at equilibrium 8 e d g e s i t e p f a s m o n o m e r a d s o r b e d m o n o m e r the equilibrium constant k 1 of which is given by 9 k 1 a 1 a s i a where a is the activity of pfass for groundwater a c the concentration of pfas μg l and a 1 and a s i are the activities of adsorbed pfass and edge sites respectively because the ce values of pfass in step ⅰ are even less than 1 10 8 mol l a linear isotherm could be obtained 10 q e k 1 c e qe denotes the equilibrium adsorption capacity μg g steps ⅱ ⅲ the adsorption rapidly increases as free pfass spread and capture the interlayer surface sites that close to the bare edge sites occupied in step ⅰ the lateral interactions e g fluorophilic interaction among the free and adsorbed pfass play the key role and dramatically enhance the adsorption while the adsorption may still be primarily driven by the ionic attraction and or the hydrophobic interaction which is supported by the ftir spectra redshift from 1753 cm 1 carboxylic c o stretching to 1690 cm 1 carboxylate c o stretching for pfoa in fig 3 considering the langmuir shape isotherms of steps ⅱ ⅲ fig 2 and the heterogeneity of interlayer surface sites of the modified clay the modified langmuir freundlich model was applied in step ⅱ ⅲ 11 q e q m k 2 c e n 1 k 2 c e n a where qm and k2 refer to the maximum adsorption capacity of the modified clay μg g and equilibrium constant of steps ⅱ ⅲ respectively n is indicative of the interlayer surface site heterogeneity of the adsorbent the lower the value of n the stronger the heterogeneity cerofolini and rudziński 1997 a denotes the amount of pfass adsorbed in step ⅰ which could be neglected if the value of qm is far more than that of a the experimentally obtained isotherms of pfass on the modified clay were well fitted by the proposed piecewise isotherm model as presented in table s4 it is worth noting that as the isotherm and isotherm models are highly dependent on the window of observation or the concentration range of the target adsorbates the current isotherms are only applicable to the overall low concentration scenario that was observed with the groundwater sample future studies are necessary to explore the effects of chain length the maximum adsorption capacity of the modified clay as well as the isotherms above the concentration range discussed in the present study 4 5 radial distribution function and interlayer conformation isothermal isobaric md simulation was processed to elucidate the adsorption mechanisms of pfoa on fluoro200 the concentration of pfoa anion was increased from 1 step ⅰ to 4 step ⅱ ⅲ for each supercell which included the transition from the linear isotherm to langmuir shape isotherm the radial distribution functions g r of the edge n carboxylate o atom pair was determined to gain further insight into the distribution of pfass in the interlayer region fig 5 a illustrates that 1 pfoa anion attached to the cationic intercalant n via the terminal oxygen atoms of carboxylate and the distance was determined to be 4 52 å i e the distance of the edge n and first carboxylate o atom according to fig 5a and b the second pfoa anion was adsorbed close to the first pfoa anion adsorbed by the edge site and so on the distances of the first and second and the third and fourth pfoa anions i e the mean distance of carboxylate group were 2 03 and 2 05 å respectively which implies the occurrence of lateral interactions such as fluorophilic interactions among the perfluoroalkyl chain of pfoa anions it is worth noting that the carboxylate oxygen atoms of second pfoa anion also was accompanied by the n atom next to the edge n atom which indicated that the ionic attraction played an important role in the binding of pfoa anions with fluoro200 furthermore with the adsorption of pfoa anions the simulation predicted that basal spacing would only slightly increase from 28 35 to 28 40 1 pfoa anion or 28 45 å 4 pfoa anions which is consistent with xrd results fig 4 the molecular dynamics simulation results revealed that the bare edge site of the interlayer surface was first occupied via the ionic attraction then adsorbates spreaded to the interlayer surface sites near the bare edge sites which strongly support the proposed piecewise adsorption mechanism 4 6 quantum calculations high level electron density based calculations were performed to probe how selected pfas compounds interact with the intercalant of the modified clay fluoro200 derive the most stable adsorption configurations of the isolated clusters and determine the corresponding binding energies based on the free energies of the adsorbates intercalant and the clusters b3lyp 6 311 g 2d 2p optimized structures the binding energies of fluoro200 with three dominant pfass in the groundwater i e pfoa anion pfos anion and fhxsa were predicted and presented in table 1 the clusters of c24 pfoa 68 62 kcal mol and c24 pfos 64 79 kcal mol demonstrated higher binding energies than that of c24 fhxsa 1 18 kcal mol the optimized geometrical structures of the clusters c24 pfoa and c24 pfos revealed that the ionic interactions controlled the strong interaction of c24 with either of the terminal oxygen atoms of the carboxylate group of pfoa anion or the sulfonate group of pfos anion fig 6 a and b as a result the adsorbed pfoa remained to be in the anionic state and a phase transition redshift of the carboxylic cooh of pfoa molecule to carboxylate coo of the c24 pfoa cluster was recorded in the simulated vibrational analysis fig 6d which is consistent with experimental ftir spectra fig 3 by contrast a linear configuration of the fhxsa molecule with c24 was observed which indicated the hydrophobic interaction between the carbon hydrogen chain of fluoro200 and the perfluoroalkyl chain of neutral pfas compounds in conclusion the results of molecular dynamics simulation and quantum calculation provided molecule level support for the proposed piecewise adsorption mechanism though the study has provided critical knowledge to strongly support the use of modified clays for pfas water treatment or groundwater site remediation follow up studies are necessary to explore the issues that have not been addressed in this single study the impact of natural organic matter known to reduce the performance of activated carbon and ion exchange resins is yet to be evaluated on modified clays the potential for adsorbent regeneration and reuse or efficient ways to dispose of spent clay materials should be examined in the context of reducing treatment cost and minimizing any secondary environmental issues 5 conclusions laboratory sorption experiments confirmed that modified bentonite clays e g fluoro sorb 200 are highly effective in removing diverse types of anionic and neutral pfass from afff impacted groundwater organic co contaminants such as diesel btex tce and 1 4 dioxane at the levels typically observed in groundwater as well as varying levels of common cations do not affect the sorptive removal pfos and pfoa detected in a real groundwater exceeded the us epa drinking water advisory levels 70 ng l however other polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl acids e g 6 2 ftsa pfhxa and neutral perfluoroalkyl sulfonamides e g fhxsa and fosa were also present at significant concentrations additional research should be devoted to treating a broad suite of pfas water pollutants given the ever evolving regulations molecular simulations demonstrated that in a real afff impacted groundwater pfas anions first occupy the highly polarized bare interlayer edge sites of the modified clay and then the interlayer surface sites which is driven by the ionic interaction and also lateral interaction such as fluorophilic attraction for neutral pfass such as fhxsa and fosa and long chain anionic compounds the hydrophobic interactions between the c f chain and the hydrocarbon chain of the quaternary ammonium intercalant are also significant these results suggest that the diverse chemistry of pfass dictates that multiple interactions can be responsible for the sorption of pfas by sorbent materials and the type of interactions varies from compound to compound within the pfas chemical family
