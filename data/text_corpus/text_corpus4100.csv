20500,breakwaters are constructed for dissipating the wave energy and safeguarding the coastline from destructive wave forces conventional pile breakwater built using prismatic circular piles has been proven to provide partial protection efficiently in the present study the conventional pile breakwater is modified by widening the pile s cross sectional area at the surface level in a conical shape the concept of introducing the conical shape is to attenuate the concentrated wave energy mainly focusing at the surface the influence of the structural parameters such as diameter height and clear spacing of the conical pile head is investigated experimentally for various monochromatic wave climatic conditions the investigation is also focused on determining the influence of the second row on performance characteristics the analysis shows that the least transmission coefficient kt of 0 662 for the configuration of d hmax 0 4 y hmax 1 5 and b d 0 1 for a single row of piles further the second row of piles inclusion resulted in improved attenuation characteristics of conical pile head breakwater cphb with the least kt of 0 582 at an optimal b d of 0 4 the performance of the cphb is compared with the theoretical solutions of conventional pile breakwater the results indicate that the introduction of pile head on conventional pile breakwater is beneficial in improving wave attenuation a set of empirical equations is developed based on the experimental values for quick prediction of kt and kr the estimated values of kt and kr are in line with the experimental data with a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 91 and 0 90 respectively the overall performance of the cphb is found to be promising as a potential coastal protection structure keywords conical pile head

safeguarding the coastline infrastructures amenities and communities from such destructive forces extensive studies on conventional gravity type breakwaters such as rubble mounds and caissons showed that they are effective in performance and stability against the design wave forces for the coastal sites where maintaining tranquillity is essential for manoeuvring and mooring ships conventional breakwaters are ideal whereas the gravity type breakwater is gigantic and alters the natural sediment movement and also responsible for environmental degradation due to quarrying and transportation of armour stones even though the breakwaters are primarily deployed to maintain tranquillity in few specific coastal areas it can be used as an energy absorbent for addressing the problems associated with coasts such as coastal erosion beach profile restoration and realignment reducing the intensity and the energy of the waves to alleviate the aforementioned problems in an environmental innocuous way has always been challenging for coastal and offshore engineers at feasible sites under favourable conditions gravity type structures can be replaced by other innovative types of breakwaters floating breakwater koutandos et al 2005 free surface breakwater and pile breakwater to reduce the wave action pile breakwaters are well suited especially for marinas safe recreational zones and fishery harbours that do not require a high level of protection conventional pile breakwater is a non gravity type breakwater consisting of closely placed single or multiple rows of prismatic circular piles the pile breakwater is generally constructed as an emergent structure and it attenuates a significant part of the wave energy by turbulence dissipation and a smaller amount of reflection the major advantage of pile breakwater over conventional gravity type structure is that the pile breakwater does not interfere with the sediment movement and maintains the water quality inside the basin therefore it can be built in the coastal sites which have large littoral drift or onshore offshore sediment movement as it does not pose accretion and erosion problems in the adjacent sites the pile breakwater will be economical in the coastal areas especially with naturally deep draft harbours as it requires minimal construction material compared to gravity type of structures the conventional pile type of breakwater has been proved effective as an alternative solution for gravity type structures at hanstholm in denmark marsa el brega in libya port of osaka in japan pass christian in mississippi bay marina in new zealand sundar and subbarao 2003 auckland harbour in new zealand hayashi et al 1966 langkawi port in malaysia and north western coast of egypt suvarna et al 2020 the wave attenuation characteristics of conventional pile breakwater have been investigated by several researchers costello 1952 hayashi et al 1966 nagai 1966 elsharnouby et al 2012 hagiwara 1984 hayashi and masataro 1968 herbich 1990 herbich et al 1988 huang et al 2011 hutchinson and raudkivi 1984 kakuno et al 1996 kakuno and liu 1993 mani 1989 park et al 2000 suh et al 2006 truitt and herbich 1986 van weele et al 1972 zhu 2011 2013 2013 zhu et al 2015 to evaluate the influence of pile diameter the spacing between the piles number of pile rows and arrangement of piles under varying climatic conditions the results indicated that the piles spacing is in inverse proportion with the wave attenuation whereas the pile diameter the number of rows and wave steepness has got direct proportion with multiple rows of piles the staggered arrangement of piles has produced better wave attenuation with less reflection than the regular configuration van weele et al 1972 with the idea of tapping down the significant part of wave energy which is concentrated at the surface many innovative types of pile type breakwaters ahmed and schlenkhoff 2014 duclos et al 2001 hagiwara 1984 isaacson et al 1998 ji and suh 2010 koraim et al 2014 laju et al 2005 2011 2005 liu and li 2011 mani 2009 mani and jayakumar 1995 murali and mani 1997 suh et al 2006 2011 2011 sundar and subbarao 2003 zhu et al 2015 ning et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 zhao and ning 2018 were invented and investigated to make the solution economical with the better performance introducing the perforation was found to be an advantage in improving the performance as the perforations contribute in distorting the wave orbital motion and creating turbulence resulting in additional loss of energy kondo and toma 1972 rao and rao 1999 2001 rao et al 2002 from the available literature it is evident that no study has been conducted by enlarging the cross sectional area of the individual pile in the present study to capture the dominant wave energy flux at the surface level the pile s cross sectional area is increased in a conical shape at the surface level termed as a conical pile head denoted as cph the conical pile head is hollow and supported on the conventional circular piles refer fig 1 and the whole structure is termed as the conical pile head breakwater denoted as cphb similar to pile breakwater cphb is also a permeable type of breakwater hence the proposed system does not interfere with the sediment movement and allows the free passage of water and sediments through the cphb structure and thus helps to maintain the water quality the cphb overcomes the construction difficulties of the conventional pile breakwater due to increased clear spacing between the supporting piles the cphb breakwaters can be an alternative at naturally deep draft harbours and steep slope bathymetry sites where the conventional massive type of breakwater construction would be challenging the present study aims to evaluate the performance characteristics namely wave transmission kt reflection kr and dissipation kd coefficients of the newly developed concept of cphb the investigation is carried out by placing the cphb in single and two rows with different configurations of cph through a series of systematic physical model tests using monochromatic waves to evaluate the influence of cphb the performance of cphb is compared with the theoretically calculated results of conventional pile breakwater and also with the similar pile type of breakwaters an attempt is also made to develop the empirical formulae based on the experimental data to predict the kt and kr of the cphb applicable within the test limits 2 experimental investigation 2 1 experimental details 2 1 1 test facility flume details the experimental investigations are conducted in a 0 71 m wide 1 1 m deep and 50 m long wave flume available at the department of water resources and ocean engineering national institute of technology karnataka surathkal india the study on the proposed cphb is carried out in a two dimensional fixed bed wave flume with a short wave hydrodynamic model a bottom hinged flap type wavemaker is installed to generate the monochromatic waves and a beach placed at the other end to absorb the wave energy the generation zone has a dimension of 7 1 m 1 5 m x 1 4 m with a flap hinged at the bottom the flap movement is regulated by an asynchronous motor of 11 kw capacity with a maximum of 1420 rpm the flap and the asynchronous motor are connected through an inverter drive which can be operated with a maximum frequency of 50 hz a smooth concrete bed is provided at the bottom of the flume for a length of 42 m smooth concrete lateral walls enclose the flume and a facility is made for photography and observations by providing a glass panel of length 25 m on a single side the details of the flume along with the test setup are showcased in fig 2 the wave flume is calibrated before conducting the model tests to find out the generator stroke and frequency of the inverter for generating the waves with the required combination of wave height and time period the waves are generated in a short burst of five waves and the wave generator is switched off to avoid the reflection and re reflection from the generator and the wave paddle a sufficient interval is provided before generating the next wave burst to achieve tranquillity by dampening out all the reflected wave energy 2 1 2 test setup scale model details for reproducing the real physical phenomena of gravitational and inertial forces froude s scaling is adopted in the present investigation a 1 30 scale is chosen for modelling the cphb structure and wave parameters the cphb basically consists of two parts the top portion with conical pile head cph and the circular pile at the bottom the cph is fabricated using solid wood with 0 01 m thick sidewall and 0 015 m thick base a perforation of 0 015 m diameter is provided at the cph base and the cph is connected to the circular pile by means of bolted connections the circular pile for supporting the conical pile head is made of 0 002 m thick galvanised iron gi with 0 04 m outer diameter a 0 005 m thick iron plate with centre threading is fitted inside the top portion of the gi pipe for attaching the cph to the pile using the bolted connection the gi pipe is fixed to the iron plate of 0 01 m thickness with the help of iron collar having 0 0015 m thickness and 0 04 m internal diameter the collar is welded to the iron plate firmly and the horizontal connection between the collar and plate is confirmed with the help of spirit level threading is provided inside the collar and the bottom of the gi pipe to strengthen the connection the iron plate offers firm support to the cphb structure at the base during the experimentation the typical arrangement of different configurations of cphb considered in the present investigation is depicted in fig 3 2 1 3 assumptions the present experimental investigations are conducted with the following assumptions 1 the sea bed is rigid and the sediment movement does not interfere with the performance of the cphb 2 the density difference between freshwater and seawater is neglected 3 frictional effects from the bottom and sidewalls are not considered 4 the cphb structure is rigid and hence the structural deformations are not considered 2 2 data acquisition system and analysis the wave flume is calibrated to determine the eccentricity and frequency for generating the combination of required wave heights and time periods at a particular water depth the wave heights are recorded using emcon capacitance sensor type elevation probes with 0 10 mm accuracy a thin layer of silica gel is applied on the probes in order to eliminate the error due to surface tension the wave elevation measurements are recorded at a sampling rate of 20 hz three probes are positioned in front of the structure to record the incident and the reflected wave heights the placement of these probes is as per the recommendation by isaacson 1991 for separating the incident and reflected wave heights the distance between the three wave probes is changed according to the time period of the generated waves for calculating the kr as per isaacson 1991 the fourth probe is installed at the lee side of the structure to record the transmitted wave height the arrangement of the four probes is illustrated in fig 2 the wave probes are calibrated every day at the start and end of the experimentation the calibration readings voltage found to be consistent with a standard deviation of less than 1 9 which is in line with the observation of neelamani and vedagiri 2001 2 3 performance characteristics the transmission kt reflection kr and dissipation kd coefficients are known as performance characteristics of a breakwater as they play a major role in determining the efficiency of any breakwater the breakwater is optimal when the wave transmission and reflection are minimum and dissipation is maximum in this paper the efficacy of cphb is investigated in terms of performance characteristics the wave transmission coefficient kt is determined using 1 k t h t h i the wave reflection coefficient kr is obtained by 2 k r h r h i where hi is the incident wave height ht is the transmitted wave height and hr is the reflected wave height the kr is calculated using the three probes method proposed by isaacson 1991 the wave energy dissipation coefficient kd is obtained using the law of energy conservation and is given by 3 k t 2 k r 2 k d 2 1 4 k d 1 k t 2 k r 2 2 4 dimensional analysis dimensional analysis is carried out using buckingham s π theorem to arrive at the dimensionless quantities which influence the performance characteristics of cphb the dimensionless quantities which effect the kt ht hi kr hr hi and kd hd hi are k t k r k d f d h max y h max b d b d h i gt 2 where d h max is the relative pile head diameter y h max is the relative pile head height b d is the relative clear spacing between the cph in a row b d is the relative clear spacing between the rows of cph and h i gt 2 is the incident wave steepness parameter the similitude criteria are achieved using the non dimensional parameters between the prototype and the model of cphb investigating the influence of d h max y h max b d and b d on kt kr and kd essential to determine the appropriate structural configuration of cphb in addition to understand the performance characteristics of the proposed structure at different wave climatic conditions investigating the influence of h i gt 2 is essential 2 5 experimental procedure the experimental investigation is conducted initially on a single row of cphb the tests are conducted on different combinations of b d d hmax and y hmax the total number of test cases are narrowed down for two rows by omitting low performing configurations of a single row it is already reported in the literature van weele et al 1972 that the performance of the pile type of breakwater is better with the staggered arrangement than the regular one when conducted in multiple rows therefore for two rows the study is carried out only with the staggered arrangement of piles for different b d ratio the climatic conditions selected is based on the wave conditions prevailing along the west coast of india the list of governing variables considered in the present study is listed in table 1 the accuracy and reliability of the results are ensured by repeating all the cases three times which is in accordance with the studies by zhao and ning 2018 2 6 mechanism of cphb the wave attenuation of conventional pile breakwater is mainly due to turbulence developed around the pile structure induced by wave structure interaction and partially due to the wave reflection rao et al 1999 sundar and subbarao 2003 rao et al 1999 concluded that the energy dissipation of the pile breakwater could be improved by increasing the turbulence to increase the turbulence of pile breakwater many researchers koraim 2014 koraim et al 2014 laju et al 2011 liu and li 2011 mani 2009 investigated the influence of blocking the waves at free surface where the energy flux is maximum the idea behind the cphb is dissipating the wave energy by interrupting the maximal orbital motion of the waves at the surface level the energy dissipation mechanism of cphb is due to the combination of overtopping of waves above cph eddy shedding because of the intense flow through cph gaps turbulence produced in the hollow cph triggered during the flushing out of the water and wave reflection the wave structure interaction for different configuration of cphb is illustrated in fig 4 3 results and discussions the influence of non dimensional governing parameters such as relative pile head height relative pile head diameter the clear spacing between the cph and water depth on the performance characteristics kt kr and kd are analysed by placing the cphb in a single row for two rows of cphb only the best performing configuration in a single row is considered for investigation by omitting all the other cases the variation of kt kr and kd is plotted with respect to wave steepness by keeping the analysing parameter as a third variable the best fit lines are plotted for a better understanding of the performance of the cphb 3 1 single row of cphb 3 1 1 wave transmission 3 1 1 1 relative pile head diameter d hmax to bring out the effect of relative pile head diameter d hmax on wave transmission graphs of hi gt2 versus kt with d hmax as the third variable are illustrated in fig 5 in general irrespective of all the considered dimensionless parameters h b d and y hmax the d hmax is found to be in direct proportionate with the kt a maximum reduction of 10 in kt is observed at lower wave steepness hi gt2 0 00152 when the d hmax is reduced from 0 6 to 0 4 for the case of b d 0 1 y hmax 1 and h 0 4 m a least reduction of 2 3 in kt is recorded at higher wave steepness hi gt2 0 0062 for the configuration of b d 0 1 y hmax 1 and h 0 45 m the least kt of 0 662 is obtained at higher wave steepness for the structural configuration of d hmax 0 4 y hmax 1 5 with b d 0 1 at 0 45 m water depth the results suggest that the d hmax 0 4 as the best performing cph configuration compared to the other considered cases d hmax 0 6 and 0 5 as the d hmax decreases the number of conical pile head increases along with the total obstruction area this results in higher wave structure interaction caused due to the waves unique interaction with the central hollow portion of the cph the same can be visualised in fig 4 3 1 1 2 relative clear spacing between the cph b d while analysing the influence of b d only the best performing configuration of relative pile head diameter d hmax 0 4 is considered based on the results referring to fig 5 a reduction of 3 55 and 1 48 in kt is observed at lower and higher wave steepness respectively when the b d is reduced from 0 2 to 0 1 for y hmax 1 and h 0 35 m whereas for the same case with y hmax 1 5 2 28 and 1 8 reduction in kt is noticed at lower and higher wave steepness respectively at 0 4 m water depth for y hmax 1 2 09 reduction is found at lower steepness and a maximum reduction of 7 84 is observed at higher steepness for all the other considered cases with d hmax 0 4 the decrease in kt is found be less than 3 from the analysis it can be stated that b d is directly proportional to the kt at both higher and lower wave steepness decreasing the b d results in reducing the clear spacing between the pile heads the less spacing effects in higher energy dissipation due to vortex shedding because of the intense flow through cph gaps as shown in fig 4 a and b 3 1 1 3 relative pile head height y hmax the study on the influence of y hmax and wave steepness is beneficial in understanding the attenuation behaviour of cphb and plays a key role in deciding the height of the cph for the required performance the impact of y hmax on the attenuation capability of the cphb is investigated by modifying y hmax from 1 0 to 1 5 refer fig 6 by fixing the b d to 0 1 at 0 35 m water depth changing the y hmax in the considered range does not have a considerable influence on kt as the maximum reduction in kt is within 3 5 but at 0 40 m water depth y hmax 1 is found to be better performing than y hmax 1 5 with a maximum reduction of kt by 6 24 for d hmax 0 6 increasing the y hmax has shown a noticeable improvement in kt at 0 45 m water depth with a maximum reduction of 13 01 at higher wave steepness for d hmax 0 4 on the whole when the y hmax is increased from 1 to 1 5 the attenuation is noticed to be improved at 0 35 m and 0 45 m water depth whereas a reverse behaviour is observed at 0 40 m water depth the same can be visualised from fig 6 when h 0 4 m and y hmax 1 the water surface is closer to the crest of the cph this may result in plunging of wave crest into the hollow portion of cph resulting in higher dissipation than the other cases considering the overall performance y hmax 1 5 is concluded as the better performing cph than the other verified cases 3 1 1 4 water depth h in the prototype conditions the water depth may vary due to one or a combination of tide base erosion and storm surge therefore the cphb is experimentally investigated at different water depths in order to analyse the performance at prototype conditions for the analysis only the best performing relative clear spacing b d 0 1 case is considered for better understanding fig 7 illustrates the variation of kt with wave steepness for different configurations of cphb keeping water depth as the third variable from fig 7 it is identified that irrespective of all the considered diameters of cph the performance of the structure improves when the water depth increases from 0 35 m to 0 40 m for y hmax 1 simultaneously for y hmax 1 when the water depth is increased from 0 40 m to 0 45 m the transmission capability reduces however results indicate negligible variation less than 3 75 in kt when the water depth is changed from 0 35 m to 0 40 m in contrast the improvement in kt appears significant up to 11 58 when the water depth is raised to 0 45 m from 0 40 m based on these observations it can be postulated that the y hmax 1 performs better at 0 40 m water depth and y hmax 1 5 at 0 45 m due to the auxiliary energy losses due to the phenomenon of wave overtopping considering the prototype conditions the cph with y hmax 1 5 is proposed as the efficient one over y hmax 1 0 since the wave damping performance is steady in all the examined water depths 3 1 1 5 wave steepness hi gt2 the wave structure interaction is higher for steeper waves than the gentle waves the aforementioned figures figs 5 figs 6 and 7 confirm that the kt is negatively correlated with the wave steepness for all the tested configurations of cphb regardless of the studied water depths this trend is because of the higher energy dissipation due to the breaking of steeper waves the steeper waves tend to break easily during the wave structure interaction due to the energy concentration and instability of waves the similar behaviour has been reported by weele and herbich 1972 mani and jayakumar 1995 rao et al 2002 koraim et al 2014 for pile type of breakwater from the above discussion it can be inferred that the cphb with the configuration of y hmax 1 5 d hmax 0 4 and b d 0 1 is the best performing model among the considered cases in the present study with the least kt of 0 662 3 1 2 wave reflection and wave dissipation the variation of kr and kd with respect to wave steepness for different structural combinations of cphb is exhibited in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively 3 1 2 1 structural configuration of cphb y hmax d hmax and b d among the verified cases it is evident from figs 8 and 9 that the configuration of y hmax 1 5 d hmax 0 4 and b d 0 1 produced a maximum kr of 0 22 with kd 0 71 at 0 45 m water depth for the steeper waves at the same time a minimum kr of 0 035 is obtained at lower steepness for the configuration of y hmax 1 0 d hmax 0 6 and b d 0 2 in 0 45 m water depth with kd 0 30 the ratio of d hmax and b d are negatively associated with the total projection area of the structure on the other hand the y hmax is positively associated the overall behaviour can be summarised as when the projection area increases to counteract the wave energy kr and kd also increase 3 1 2 2 wave steepness hi gt2 on the whole it appears from figs 8 and 9 that for all the examined trials kr and kd are positively correlated with the wave steepness the wave structure interaction will be more in the case of steeper waves than the gentle waves which contributes to higher reflection and considerable energy dissipation 3 1 2 3 water depth h while analysing the influence of water depth on reflection and dissipation features only the best performing model configuration y hmax 1 5 d hmax 0 4 and b d 0 1 of cphb is considered referring to fig 8 for the specified configuration changing the water depth from 0 35 m to 0 40 m leads to increase in kr by 9 62 0 104 to 0 114 at gentle steepness and 9 18 0 196 to 0 214 at higher steepness the identical trend is observed when the depth of water is again increased by from 0 40 m to 0 45 m with 33 33 0 114 to 0 152 at gentle waves and 5 14 0 214 to 0 225 at steeper waves 3 2 two rows of cphb the improvement in the performance of cphb is investigated by introducing the second row of cphb with a staggered arrangement as shown in fig 10 for the study the best performing configuration of cph in single row y hmax 1 5 d hmax 0 4 and b d 0 1 is considered the laboratory investigations are conducted at 0 35 m 0 40 m and 0 45 m water depths for different relative clear spacing between the rows of piles b d as specified in table 1 the comparison of the performance of two rows of cphb with different cases of b d and the single row is demonstrated in fig 11 as predicted the inclusion of the second row of cphb in staggered order is proved to increase the wave attenuation than the single row this may be due to the increased obstruction area resulting in higher wave structure interaction as shown in fig 10b the wave transmission is observed to be reduced with the increasing b d up to 0 4 thereafter the transmission starts rising a maximum reduction of 7 5 6 29 and 6 79 in kt is witnessed at lower steepness than the single row of cphb at a water depth of 0 35 m 0 40 m and 0 45 m respectively in a similar way 9 68 8 84 and 12 34 reduction in kt are observed at higher steepness the b d ratio of 0 4 is noticed to be the optimal spacing for the tested range of cphb in two rows with the least kt of 0 582 the addition of the second row of cphb has increased both kr and kd for the optimal spacing b d 0 4 the kr increased by 28 15 28 57 and 7 18 at 0 35 m 0 40 m and 0 45 m water depth respectively at lower steepness whereas 33 84 37 04 and 27 03 surge in kr are observed at higher steepness correspondingly 19 41 14 12 and 15 61 surge in kd are observed at gentle wave steepness identically 7 94 7 63 and 6 77 increment in kd are noted in the case of steeper waves a maximal kr of 0 296 is obtained for b d 0 and a maximal kd of 0 791 is obtained for the case of b d 0 4 from the above discussion it can be concluded that b d has a significant influence on the performance characteristics of two rows of cphb a possible reason for this behaviour can be due to the variation of eddy losses with b d at b d 0 the overall structure behaves as a single unit due to the closer pile head spacing resulting in higher transmission and higher reflection with less eddy formation in other words less energy loss the spacing between the two rows may not be sufficient for the formation and overlapping of eddies at closer spacing b d 0 as the b d increases the eddies start shedding increasingly which bringing down the kt and kr and raising kd this same trend continues up to b d 0 4 where minimal kt and kr and a maximum kd is attained a further increase in b d from 0 4 to 0 8 reverses the trend may be due to less overlapping of eddies the findings are similar to the research results reported by weele and herbich 1972 and rao et al 1999 for the conventional pile breakwater therefore it can be concluded from the above analysis that b d 0 4 is the optimum spacing for two rows of cphb it is observed that there is some scatter in the experimental results but overall the trend lines are almost well defined the scatter in kt is much less compared to that of kr and kd note that the kd is affected by the kt and kr values as kd is calculated directly using the energy conservation equation this scattered data may be due to the drastic changes in energy loss caused by wave structure interaction the scattering may be additionally influenced by the effect of re reflection and second order effects produced by diffraction similar scattering in the experimental results are reported by kondo and toma 1972 rao et al 1999 bilici 2014 ning et al 2016 sundar and subbarao 2003 for pile type of breakwaters 3 3 comparison of hydraulic performance 3 3 1 conventional pile breakwater based on the theoretical approach to evaluate the efficiency of the cphb the hydraulic performance of the single row of cphb is compared with the conventional circular pile breakwater since there are no experimental data found in the literature with the present experimental conditions d h and b0 d theoretical equations are used for calculating the kt kr and kd of conventional pile breakwater the theoretical equations developed by kriebel 1992 mei 1989 suh et al 2011 and suvarna et al 2020 are used to predict the kt kr and kd of a single row of conventional pile breakwater the development of the equations are discussed below in brief and for the detailed derivation respective papers can be referred mei 1989 derived the solutions for kt and kr based on continuity equations for shallow water depth the kt and kr for the monochromatic waves propagating at a water

proposed by suh et al 2011 as 12 γ 1 569 h i h f 0 433 the influence of introducing the cph over the conventional pile breakwater is investigated by comparing the performance of cphb and conventional pile breakwater by keeping an equal number of units the best performing configuration of cphb y hmax 1 5 d hmax 0 4 and b d 0 1 in single row is considered for the comparative study the performance of uniformly spaced conventional pile breakwater with 0 04 m diameter d circular piles placed at a b0 d of 0 76 is compared with cphb with b d of 0 1 i e b0 d 0 76 where the number of pile units is the same in both the cases fig 12 showcases the comparison of kt kr and kd between the cphb and conventional pile breakwater with a constant b0 d of 0 76 the kt predicted using kriebel 1992 and mei 1989 are overlapping with each other the calculated kt from suvarna et al 2020 are slightly lower than kriebel 1992 and mei 1989 whereas suh et al 2011 results are higher side referring to fig 12a b and c it can be clearly stated that introducing the cph on the conventional pile breakwater reduces the kt by a significant amount the reduction in kt is found to be about 12 at lower wave steepness in comparison with the theoretical predictions whereas at higher wave steepness a maximum reduction of 27 8 mei 1989 27 8 kriebel 1992 30 84 suh et al 2011 and 25 42 suvarna et al 2020 is noted the predicted values of kr by mei 1989 is identical with that of cphb values and the variation is insignificant refer fig 12d e and f the kr values of cphb is about double the calculated values by suvarna et al 2020 and kriebel 1992 from fig 12g h and i it can be postulated that there is a huge increase in kd of cphb when compared to the conventional pile breakwater the maximum increment observed in kd is 108 6 mei 1989 72 8 kriebel 1992 140 6 suh et al 2011 and 61 1 suvarna et al 2020 than the conventional pile breakwater to achive the equivalent performance of cphb the conventional pile breakwater needs to be constructed at a significantly closer spacing which poses construction difficulties and makes the solution uneconomical the wave attenuation of the conventional pile breakwater is mainly due to the eddie shedding and partial wave reflection introducing the pile head at the surface level distorts the maximum orbital motion at the surface and creates turbulence the improvement in the performance of cphb over the conventional pile breakwater is majorly due to the increased kd as depicted in fig 12 g h and i the cphb obstructs the dominating surface wave energy because of the enlarged area at the surface and the unique wave interaction with the hollow pile head the comparative analysis shows that introducing the cph on the conventional pile breakwater is beneficial in attenuating the waves with lower wave reflection and higher energy dissipation 3 3 2 pile type of breakwaters based on experimental studies in order to examine the relative performance of the cphb the hydrodynamic efficiency of the proposed structure is compared with the similar types of pile pile supported breakwaters and floating breakwater in fig 13 the best performing configuration of single row cphb y hmax 1 5 d hmax 0 4 b d 0 1 and h 0 45 m is compared with pipe breakwater mani and jayakumar 1995 rao and rao 2001 closely spaced rectangular piles huang 2007 zigzag porous screen breakwater mani 2009 and single fixed floating breakwater koutandos et al 2005 from fig 13 it can be inferred that the kt kr and kd are following a similar trend to that of other compared types of breakwaters the comparative study indicates that the kt of cphb is lower than that of pile type of breakwaters huang 2007 mani 2009 rao and rao 2001 the proposed cphb structure found to be competent in wave attenuation with minimal reflection and higher energy dissipation than that of other compared types of breakwaters 3 4 empirical equations based on the present experimental data a set of empirical equations refer eq 13 and eq 14 are proposed for kt and kr for quick estimation of the performance characteristics of cphb using the method of data fitting the empirical equations 13 and 14 are developed the different governing parameters are determined from the dimensional analysis refer section 2 4 and the analysis of results proved that these parameters are essential in influencing the performance characteristics of cphb the empirical equations 13 and 14 can predict the transmission and reflection coefficients of cphb for different governing parameters such as wave steepness relative clear spacing relative pile head height relative pile head diameter and water depth the comparison of the estimated values of kt and kr with the present experimental results are illustrated in fig 14 13 k t e x 3 x 2 3 x 6 3 0 08 x 1 x 5 x 6 x 2 42 x 4 14 k r 7 x 4 x 1 29 7 x 1 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 2 x 3 2 where x 1 y h max x 2 d h max x 3 b d x 4 h i gt 2 x 5 h and x 6 n b d n is the number of cphb rows b is the clear spacing between the rows of cphb and it is assumed to be zero for the single row of cphb the developed empirical equations have reproduced the experimental results with a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 91 and 0 90 for kt and kr respectively therefore the proposed empirical equations can be used for the quick estimation of the performance characteristics of cphb within the test limit along with an appropriate engineering judgement 4 conclusions a series of extensive experiments are conducted on cphb placed in single and two rows with different configurations of d hmax y hmax b d and b d against various wave climatic conditions the overall performance of the cphb is found to be promising for using it as a wave attenuator in coastal sites based on the analysis of the results the following conclusions are drawn the experimental parameters such as d hmax and b d are in direct proportion with the kt and inverse proportion with the kr and kd at the same time y hmax and hi gt2 follow the opposite trend the structural configuration of d hmax 0 4 y hmax 1 5 and b d 0 1 is the best performing model in case of a single row of cphb with the least kt of 0 662 along with kr 0 22 and kd 0 71 in the case of two rows of cphb the b d 0 4 is the optimum spacing which provided a minimal kt of 0 582 with kr 0 26 and kd 0 76 addition of the second row of cphb with d hmax 0 4 y hmax 1 5 b d 0 1 and b d 0 4 configuration in staggered arrangement reduces the kt by a maximum of 12 34 compared to a single row however from the practical point of view providing whether single or double row structure to achieve an extra 12 34 reduction in kt is a matter of judgement considering site conditions the proposed cphb is a better wave attenuator than the conventional pile breakwater introducing the best performing configuration of conical hollow pile head over the conventional pile breakwater improves the wave transmission characteristics of the structure by about 25 along with more than 60 higher wave dissipation the cphb structure found to be competent in wave attenuation with minimal reflection and higher energy dissipation than that of other pile types of breakwaters compared therefore the cphb may be considered while designing breakwaters for sites requiring partial wave attenuation and also can be used in the protection of the coast against erosion depending on the site conditions an empirical formula is developed to predict the kt and kr of cphb based on the parametric analysis of the experimental data the empirical formula reproduced the results with a good correlation for both kt and kr proposed empirical equations provide the engineers with an approximate idea about the configuration needed to design the cphb

20500,breakwaters are constructed for dissipating the wave energy and safeguarding the coastline from destructive wave forces conventional pile breakwater built using prismatic circular piles has been proven to provide partial protection efficiently in the present study the conventional pile breakwater is modified by widening the pile s cross sectional area at the surface level in a conical shape the concept of introducing the conical shape is to attenuate the concentrated wave energy mainly focusing at the surface the influence of the structural parameters such as diameter height and clear spacing of the conical pile head is investigated experimentally for various monochromatic wave climatic conditions the investigation is also focused on determining the influence of the second row on performance characteristics the analysis shows that the least transmission coefficient kt of 0 662 for the configuration of d hmax 0 4 y hmax 1 5 and b d 0 1 for a single row of piles further the second row of piles inclusion resulted in improved attenuation characteristics of conical pile head breakwater cphb with the least kt of 0 582 at an optimal b d of 0 4 the performance of the cphb is compared with the theoretical solutions of conventional pile breakwater the results indicate that the introduction of pile head on conventional pile breakwater is beneficial in improving wave attenuation a set of empirical equations is developed based on the experimental values for quick prediction of kt and kr the estimated values of kt and kr are in line with the experimental data with a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 91 and 0 90 respectively the overall performance of the cphb is found to be promising as a potential coastal protection structure keywords conical pile head

safeguarding the coastline infrastructures amenities and communities from such destructive forces extensive studies on conventional gravity type breakwaters such as rubble mounds and caissons showed that they are effective in performance and stability against the design wave forces for the coastal sites where maintaining tranquillity is essential for manoeuvring and mooring ships conventional breakwaters are ideal whereas the gravity type breakwater is gigantic and alters the natural sediment movement and also responsible for environmental degradation due to quarrying and transportation of armour stones even though the breakwaters are primarily deployed to maintain tranquillity in few specific coastal areas it can be used as an energy absorbent for addressing the problems associated with coasts such as coastal erosion beach profile restoration and realignment reducing the intensity and the energy of the waves to alleviate the aforementioned problems in an environmental innocuous way has always been challenging for coastal and offshore engineers at feasible sites under favourable conditions gravity type structures can be replaced by other innovative types of breakwaters floating breakwater koutandos et al 2005 free surface breakwater and pile breakwater to reduce the wave action pile breakwaters are well suited especially for marinas safe recreational zones and fishery harbours that do not require a high level of protection conventional pile breakwater is a non gravity type breakwater consisting of closely placed single or multiple rows of prismatic circular piles the pile breakwater is generally constructed as an emergent structure and it attenuates a significant part of the wave energy by turbulence dissipation and a smaller amount of reflection the major advantage of pile breakwater over conventional gravity type structure is that the pile breakwater does not interfere with the sediment movement and maintains the water quality inside the basin therefore it can be built in the coastal sites which have large littoral drift or onshore offshore sediment movement as it does not pose accretion and erosion problems in the adjacent sites the pile breakwater will be economical in the coastal areas especially with naturally deep draft harbours as it requires minimal construction material compared to gravity type of structures the conventional pile type of breakwater has been proved effective as an alternative solution for gravity type structures at hanstholm in denmark marsa el brega in libya port of osaka in japan pass christian in mississippi bay marina in new zealand sundar and subbarao 2003 auckland harbour in new zealand hayashi et al 1966 langkawi port in malaysia and north western coast of egypt suvarna et al 2020 the wave attenuation characteristics of conventional pile breakwater have been investigated by several researchers costello 1952 hayashi et al 1966 nagai 1966 elsharnouby et al 2012 hagiwara 1984 hayashi and masataro 1968 herbich 1990 herbich et al 1988 huang et al 2011 hutchinson and raudkivi 1984 kakuno et al 1996 kakuno and liu 1993 mani 1989 park et al 2000 suh et al 2006 truitt and herbich 1986 van weele et al 1972 zhu 2011 2013 2013 zhu et al 2015 to evaluate the influence of pile diameter the spacing between the piles number of pile rows and arrangement of piles under varying climatic conditions the results indicated that the piles spacing is in inverse proportion with the wave attenuation whereas the pile diameter the number of rows and wave steepness has got direct proportion with multiple rows of piles the staggered arrangement of piles has produced better wave attenuation with less reflection than the regular configuration van weele et al 1972 with the idea of tapping down the significant part of wave energy which is concentrated at the surface many innovative types of pile type breakwaters ahmed and schlenkhoff 2014 duclos et al 2001 hagiwara 1984 isaacson et al 1998 ji and suh 2010 koraim et al 2014 laju et al 2005 2011 2005 liu and li 2011 mani 2009 mani and jayakumar 1995 murali and mani 1997 suh et al 2006 2011 2011 sundar and subbarao 2003 zhu et al 2015 ning et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 zhao and ning 2018 were invented and investigated to make the solution economical with the better performance introducing the perforation was found to be an advantage in improving the performance as the perforations contribute in distorting the wave orbital motion and creating turbulence resulting in additional loss of energy kondo and toma 1972 rao and rao 1999 2001 rao et al 2002 from the available literature it is evident that no study has been conducted by enlarging the cross sectional area of the individual pile in the present study to capture the dominant wave energy flux at the surface level the pile s cross sectional area is increased in a conical shape at the surface level termed as a conical pile head denoted as cph the conical pile head is hollow and supported on the conventional circular piles refer fig 1 and the whole structure is termed as the conical pile head breakwater denoted as cphb similar to pile breakwater cphb is also a permeable type of breakwater hence the proposed system does not interfere with the sediment movement and allows the free passage of water and sediments through the cphb structure and thus helps to maintain the water quality the cphb overcomes the construction difficulties of the conventional pile breakwater due to increased clear spacing between the supporting piles the cphb breakwaters can be an alternative at naturally deep draft harbours and steep slope bathymetry sites where the conventional massive type of breakwater construction would be challenging the present study aims to evaluate the performance characteristics namely wave transmission kt reflection kr and dissipation kd coefficients of the newly developed concept of cphb the investigation is carried out by placing the cphb in single and two rows with different configurations of cph through a series of systematic physical model tests using monochromatic waves to evaluate the influence of cphb the performance of cphb is compared with the theoretically calculated results of conventional pile breakwater and also with the similar pile type of breakwaters an attempt is also made to develop the empirical formulae based on the experimental data to predict the kt and kr of the cphb applicable within the test limits 2 experimental investigation 2 1 experimental details 2 1 1 test facility flume details the experimental investigations are conducted in a 0 71 m wide 1 1 m deep and 50 m long wave flume available at the department of water resources and ocean engineering national institute of technology karnataka surathkal india the study on the proposed cphb is carried out in a two dimensional fixed bed wave flume with a short wave hydrodynamic model a bottom hinged flap type wavemaker is installed to generate the monochromatic waves and a beach placed at the other end to absorb the wave energy the generation zone has a dimension of 7 1 m 1 5 m x 1 4 m with a flap hinged at the bottom the flap movement is regulated by an asynchronous motor of 11 kw capacity with a maximum of 1420 rpm the flap and the asynchronous motor are connected through an inverter drive which can be operated with a maximum frequency of 50 hz a smooth concrete bed is provided at the bottom of the flume for a length of 42 m smooth concrete lateral walls enclose the flume and a facility is made for photography and observations by providing a glass panel of length 25 m on a single side the details of the flume along with the test setup are showcased in fig 2 the wave flume is calibrated before conducting the model tests to find out the generator stroke and frequency of the inverter for generating the waves with the required combination of wave height and time period the waves are generated in a short burst of five waves and the wave generator is switched off to avoid the reflection and re reflection from the generator and the wave paddle a sufficient interval is provided before generating the next wave burst to achieve tranquillity by dampening out all the reflected wave energy 2 1 2 test setup scale model details for reproducing the real physical phenomena of gravitational and inertial forces froude s scaling is adopted in the present investigation a 1 30 scale is chosen for modelling the cphb structure and wave parameters the cphb basically consists of two parts the top portion with conical pile head cph and the circular pile at the bottom the cph is fabricated using solid wood with 0 01 m thick sidewall and 0 015 m thick base a perforation of 0 015 m diameter is provided at the cph base and the cph is connected to the circular pile by means of bolted connections the circular pile for supporting the conical pile head is made of 0 002 m thick galvanised iron gi with 0 04 m outer diameter a 0 005 m thick iron plate with centre threading is fitted inside the top portion of the gi pipe for attaching the cph to the pile using the bolted connection the gi pipe is fixed to the iron plate of 0 01 m thickness with the help of iron collar having 0 0015 m thickness and 0 04 m internal diameter the collar is welded to the iron plate firmly and the horizontal connection between the collar and plate is confirmed with the help of spirit level threading is provided inside the collar and the bottom of the gi pipe to strengthen the connection the iron plate offers firm support to the cphb structure at the base during the experimentation the typical arrangement of different configurations of cphb considered in the present investigation is depicted in fig 3 2 1 3 assumptions the present experimental investigations are conducted with the following assumptions 1 the sea bed is rigid and the sediment movement does not interfere with the performance of the cphb 2 the density difference between freshwater and seawater is neglected 3 frictional effects from the bottom and sidewalls are not considered 4 the cphb structure is rigid and hence the structural deformations are not considered 2 2 data acquisition system and analysis the wave flume is calibrated to determine the eccentricity and frequency for generating the combination of required wave heights and time periods at a particular water depth the wave heights are recorded using emcon capacitance sensor type elevation probes with 0 10 mm accuracy a thin layer of silica gel is applied on the probes in order to eliminate the error due to surface tension the wave elevation measurements are recorded at a sampling rate of 20 hz three probes are positioned in front of the structure to record the incident and the reflected wave heights the placement of these probes is as per the recommendation by isaacson 1991 for separating the incident and reflected wave heights the distance between the three wave probes is changed according to the time period of the generated waves for calculating the kr as per isaacson 1991 the fourth probe is installed at the lee side of the structure to record the transmitted wave height the arrangement of the four probes is illustrated in fig 2 the wave probes are calibrated every day at the start and end of the experimentation the calibration readings voltage found to be consistent with a standard deviation of less than 1 9 which is in line with the observation of neelamani and vedagiri 2001 2 3 performance characteristics the transmission kt reflection kr and dissipation kd coefficients are known as performance characteristics of a breakwater as they play a major role in determining the efficiency of any breakwater the breakwater is optimal when the wave transmission and reflection are minimum and dissipation is maximum in this paper the efficacy of cphb is investigated in terms of performance characteristics the wave transmission coefficient kt is determined using 1 k t h t h i the wave reflection coefficient kr is obtained by 2 k r h r h i where hi is the incident wave height ht is the transmitted wave height and hr is the reflected wave height the kr is calculated using the three probes method proposed by isaacson 1991 the wave energy dissipation coefficient kd is obtained using the law of energy conservation and is given by 3 k t 2 k r 2 k d 2 1 4 k d 1 k t 2 k r 2 2 4 dimensional analysis dimensional analysis is carried out using buckingham s π theorem to arrive at the dimensionless quantities which influence the performance characteristics of cphb the dimensionless quantities which effect the kt ht hi kr hr hi and kd hd hi are k t k r k d f d h max y h max b d b d h i gt 2 where d h max is the relative pile head diameter y h max is the relative pile head height b d is the relative clear spacing between the cph in a row b d is the relative clear spacing between the rows of cph and h i gt 2 is the incident wave steepness parameter the similitude criteria are achieved using the non dimensional parameters between the prototype and the model of cphb investigating the influence of d h max y h max b d and b d on kt kr and kd essential to determine the appropriate structural configuration of cphb in addition to understand the performance characteristics of the proposed structure at different wave climatic conditions investigating the influence of h i gt 2 is essential 2 5 experimental procedure the experimental investigation is conducted initially on a single row of cphb the tests are conducted on different combinations of b d d hmax and y hmax the total number of test cases are narrowed down for two rows by omitting low performing configurations of a single row it is already reported in the literature van weele et al 1972 that the performance of the pile type of breakwater is better with the staggered arrangement than the regular one when conducted in multiple rows therefore for two rows the study is carried out only with the staggered arrangement of piles for different b d ratio the climatic conditions selected is based on the wave conditions prevailing along the west coast of india the list of governing variables considered in the present study is listed in table 1 the accuracy and reliability of the results are ensured by repeating all the cases three times which is in accordance with the studies by zhao and ning 2018 2 6 mechanism of cphb the wave attenuation of conventional pile breakwater is mainly due to turbulence developed around the pile structure induced by wave structure interaction and partially due to the wave reflection rao et al 1999 sundar and subbarao 2003 rao et al 1999 concluded that the energy dissipation of the pile breakwater could be improved by increasing the turbulence to increase the turbulence of pile breakwater many researchers koraim 2014 koraim et al 2014 laju et al 2011 liu and li 2011 mani 2009 investigated the influence of blocking the waves at free surface where the energy flux is maximum the idea behind the cphb is dissipating the wave energy by interrupting the maximal orbital motion of the waves at the surface level the energy dissipation mechanism of cphb is due to the combination of overtopping of waves above cph eddy shedding because of the intense flow through cph gaps turbulence produced in the hollow cph triggered during the flushing out of the water and wave reflection the wave structure interaction for different configuration of cphb is illustrated in fig 4 3 results and discussions the influence of non dimensional governing parameters such as relative pile head height relative pile head diameter the clear spacing between the cph and water depth on the performance characteristics kt kr and kd are analysed by placing the cphb in a single row for two rows of cphb only the best performing configuration in a single row is considered for investigation by omitting all the other cases the variation of kt kr and kd is plotted with respect to wave steepness by keeping the analysing parameter as a third variable the best fit lines are plotted for a better understanding of the performance of the cphb 3 1 single row of cphb 3 1 1 wave transmission 3 1 1 1 relative pile head diameter d hmax to bring out the effect of relative pile head diameter d hmax on wave transmission graphs of hi gt2 versus kt with d hmax as the third variable are illustrated in fig 5 in general irrespective of all the considered dimensionless parameters h b d and y hmax the d hmax is found to be in direct proportionate with the kt a maximum reduction of 10 in kt is observed at lower wave steepness hi gt2 0 00152 when the d hmax is reduced from 0 6 to 0 4 for the case of b d 0 1 y hmax 1 and h 0 4 m a least reduction of 2 3 in kt is recorded at higher wave steepness hi gt2 0 0062 for the configuration of b d 0 1 y hmax 1 and h 0 45 m the least kt of 0 662 is obtained at higher wave steepness for the structural configuration of d hmax 0 4 y hmax 1 5 with b d 0 1 at 0 45 m water depth the results suggest that the d hmax 0 4 as the best performing cph configuration compared to the other considered cases d hmax 0 6 and 0 5 as the d hmax decreases the number of conical pile head increases along with the total obstruction area this results in higher wave structure interaction caused due to the waves unique interaction with the central hollow portion of the cph the same can be visualised in fig 4 3 1 1 2 relative clear spacing between the cph b d while analysing the influence of b d only the best performing configuration of relative pile head diameter d hmax 0 4 is considered based on the results referring to fig 5 a reduction of 3 55 and 1 48 in kt is observed at lower and higher wave steepness respectively when the b d is reduced from 0 2 to 0 1 for y hmax 1 and h 0 35 m whereas for the same case with y hmax 1 5 2 28 and 1 8 reduction in kt is noticed at lower and higher wave steepness respectively at 0 4 m water depth for y hmax 1 2 09 reduction is found at lower steepness and a maximum reduction of 7 84 is observed at higher steepness for all the other considered cases with d hmax 0 4 the decrease in kt is found be less than 3 from the analysis it can be stated that b d is directly proportional to the kt at both higher and lower wave steepness decreasing the b d results in reducing the clear spacing between the pile heads the less spacing effects in higher energy dissipation due to vortex shedding because of the intense flow through cph gaps as shown in fig 4 a and b 3 1 1 3 relative pile head height y hmax the study on the influence of y hmax and wave steepness is beneficial in understanding the attenuation behaviour of cphb and plays a key role in deciding the height of the cph for the required performance the impact of y hmax on the attenuation capability of the cphb is investigated by modifying y hmax from 1 0 to 1 5 refer fig 6 by fixing the b d to 0 1 at 0 35 m water depth changing the y hmax in the considered range does not have a considerable influence on kt as the maximum reduction in kt is within 3 5 but at 0 40 m water depth y hmax 1 is found to be better performing than y hmax 1 5 with a maximum reduction of kt by 6 24 for d hmax 0 6 increasing the y hmax has shown a noticeable improvement in kt at 0 45 m water depth with a maximum reduction of 13 01 at higher wave steepness for d hmax 0 4 on the whole when the y hmax is increased from 1 to 1 5 the attenuation is noticed to be improved at 0 35 m and 0 45 m water depth whereas a reverse behaviour is observed at 0 40 m water depth the same can be visualised from fig 6 when h 0 4 m and y hmax 1 the water surface is closer to the crest of the cph this may result in plunging of wave crest into the hollow portion of cph resulting in higher dissipation than the other cases considering the overall performance y hmax 1 5 is concluded as the better performing cph than the other verified cases 3 1 1 4 water depth h in the prototype conditions the water depth may vary due to one or a combination of tide base erosion and storm surge therefore the cphb is experimentally investigated at different water depths in order to analyse the performance at prototype conditions for the analysis only the best performing relative clear spacing b d 0 1 case is considered for better understanding fig 7 illustrates the variation of kt with wave steepness for different configurations of cphb keeping water depth as the third variable from fig 7 it is identified that irrespective of all the considered diameters of cph the performance of the structure improves when the water depth increases from 0 35 m to 0 40 m for y hmax 1 simultaneously for y hmax 1 when the water depth is increased from 0 40 m to 0 45 m the transmission capability reduces however results indicate negligible variation less than 3 75 in kt when the water depth is changed from 0 35 m to 0 40 m in contrast the improvement in kt appears significant up to 11 58 when the water depth is raised to 0 45 m from 0 40 m based on these observations it can be postulated that the y hmax 1 performs better at 0 40 m water depth and y hmax 1 5 at 0 45 m due to the auxiliary energy losses due to the phenomenon of wave overtopping considering the prototype conditions the cph with y hmax 1 5 is proposed as the efficient one over y hmax 1 0 since the wave damping performance is steady in all the examined water depths 3 1 1 5 wave steepness hi gt2 the wave structure interaction is higher for steeper waves than the gentle waves the aforementioned figures figs 5 figs 6 and 7 confirm that the kt is negatively correlated with the wave steepness for all the tested configurations of cphb regardless of the studied water depths this trend is because of the higher energy dissipation due to the breaking of steeper waves the steeper waves tend to break easily during the wave structure interaction due to the energy concentration and instability of waves the similar behaviour has been reported by weele and herbich 1972 mani and jayakumar 1995 rao et al 2002 koraim et al 2014 for pile type of breakwater from the above discussion it can be inferred that the cphb with the configuration of y hmax 1 5 d hmax 0 4 and b d 0 1 is the best performing model among the considered cases in the present study with the least kt of 0 662 3 1 2 wave reflection and wave dissipation the variation of kr and kd with respect to wave steepness for different structural combinations of cphb is exhibited in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively 3 1 2 1 structural configuration of cphb y hmax d hmax and b d among the verified cases it is evident from figs 8 and 9 that the configuration of y hmax 1 5 d hmax 0 4 and b d 0 1 produced a maximum kr of 0 22 with kd 0 71 at 0 45 m water depth for the steeper waves at the same time a minimum kr of 0 035 is obtained at lower steepness for the configuration of y hmax 1 0 d hmax 0 6 and b d 0 2 in 0 45 m water depth with kd 0 30 the ratio of d hmax and b d are negatively associated with the total projection area of the structure on the other hand the y hmax is positively associated the overall behaviour can be summarised as when the projection area increases to counteract the wave energy kr and kd also increase 3 1 2 2 wave steepness hi gt2 on the whole it appears from figs 8 and 9 that for all the examined trials kr and kd are positively correlated with the wave steepness the wave structure interaction will be more in the case of steeper waves than the gentle waves which contributes to higher reflection and considerable energy dissipation 3 1 2 3 water depth h while analysing the influence of water depth on reflection and dissipation features only the best performing model configuration y hmax 1 5 d hmax 0 4 and b d 0 1 of cphb is considered referring to fig 8 for the specified configuration changing the water depth from 0 35 m to 0 40 m leads to increase in kr by 9 62 0 104 to 0 114 at gentle steepness and 9 18 0 196 to 0 214 at higher steepness the identical trend is observed when the depth of water is again increased by from 0 40 m to 0 45 m with 33 33 0 114 to 0 152 at gentle waves and 5 14 0 214 to 0 225 at steeper waves 3 2 two rows of cphb the improvement in the performance of cphb is investigated by introducing the second row of cphb with a staggered arrangement as shown in fig 10 for the study the best performing configuration of cph in single row y hmax 1 5 d hmax 0 4 and b d 0 1 is considered the laboratory investigations are conducted at 0 35 m 0 40 m and 0 45 m water depths for different relative clear spacing between the rows of piles b d as specified in table 1 the comparison of the performance of two rows of cphb with different cases of b d and the single row is demonstrated in fig 11 as predicted the inclusion of the second row of cphb in staggered order is proved to increase the wave attenuation than the single row this may be due to the increased obstruction area resulting in higher wave structure interaction as shown in fig 10b the wave transmission is observed to be reduced with the increasing b d up to 0 4 thereafter the transmission starts rising a maximum reduction of 7 5 6 29 and 6 79 in kt is witnessed at lower steepness than the single row of cphb at a water depth of 0 35 m 0 40 m and 0 45 m respectively in a similar way 9 68 8 84 and 12 34 reduction in kt are observed at higher steepness the b d ratio of 0 4 is noticed to be the optimal spacing for the tested range of cphb in two rows with the least kt of 0 582 the addition of the second row of cphb has increased both kr and kd for the optimal spacing b d 0 4 the kr increased by 28 15 28 57 and 7 18 at 0 35 m 0 40 m and 0 45 m water depth respectively at lower steepness whereas 33 84 37 04 and 27 03 surge in kr are observed at higher steepness correspondingly 19 41 14 12 and 15 61 surge in kd are observed at gentle wave steepness identically 7 94 7 63 and 6 77 increment in kd are noted in the case of steeper waves a maximal kr of 0 296 is obtained for b d 0 and a maximal kd of 0 791 is obtained for the case of b d 0 4 from the above discussion it can be concluded that b d has a significant influence on the performance characteristics of two rows of cphb a possible reason for this behaviour can be due to the variation of eddy losses with b d at b d 0 the overall structure behaves as a single unit due to the closer pile head spacing resulting in higher transmission and higher reflection with less eddy formation in other words less energy loss the spacing between the two rows may not be sufficient for the formation and overlapping of eddies at closer spacing b d 0 as the b d increases the eddies start shedding increasingly which bringing down the kt and kr and raising kd this same trend continues up to b d 0 4 where minimal kt and kr and a maximum kd is attained a further increase in b d from 0 4 to 0 8 reverses the trend may be due to less overlapping of eddies the findings are similar to the research results reported by weele and herbich 1972 and rao et al 1999 for the conventional pile breakwater therefore it can be concluded from the above analysis that b d 0 4 is the optimum spacing for two rows of cphb it is observed that there is some scatter in the experimental results but overall the trend lines are almost well defined the scatter in kt is much less compared to that of kr and kd note that the kd is affected by the kt and kr values as kd is calculated directly using the energy conservation equation this scattered data may be due to the drastic changes in energy loss caused by wave structure interaction the scattering may be additionally influenced by the effect of re reflection and second order effects produced by diffraction similar scattering in the experimental results are reported by kondo and toma 1972 rao et al 1999 bilici 2014 ning et al 2016 sundar and subbarao 2003 for pile type of breakwaters 3 3 comparison of hydraulic performance 3 3 1 conventional pile breakwater based on the theoretical approach to evaluate the efficiency of the cphb the hydraulic performance of the single row of cphb is compared with the conventional circular pile breakwater since there are no experimental data found in the literature with the present experimental conditions d h and b0 d theoretical equations are used for calculating the kt kr and kd of conventional pile breakwater the theoretical equations developed by kriebel 1992 mei 1989 suh et al 2011 and suvarna et al 2020 are used to predict the kt kr and kd of a single row of conventional pile breakwater the development of the equations are discussed below in brief and for the detailed derivation respective papers can be referred mei 1989 derived the solutions for kt and kr based on continuity equations for shallow water depth the kt and kr for the monochromatic waves propagating at a water depth h with the angular frequency ω is given by 5 k t u 0 gh h i 2 h 6 k r 1 ω u 0 gkh i 2 where u 0 h i 2 h g k 1 2 α 1 α α 4 3 π f h i 2 h f 1 c 0 1 2 1 d r x 1 d 2 2 x 2 d 2 a a n d a a cc is the contraction coefficient given by 7 c c 0 6 0 4 ε 2 kriebel 1992 proposed similar equations based on the conditions of subjective water depths as follows 8 k t 1 4 t t 1 2 t t 9 k r 1 1 4 t t 1 2 t t where transmission function tt is equal to t t f 6 h i 2 π k sinh 2 kh 2 kh sinh 2 kh suh et al 2011 proposed a hybrid equation based on the empirical coefficients as 10 k t 2 r 2 r 2 2 p 2 i 2 p r 2 2 p 2 11 k r r r 2 p 2 r 2 2 p 2 i 2 p r 2 2 p 2 where p l k and r βk ω β is the linearized friction coefficient obtained using β ωdγ γ is the friction coefficient which is obtained empirically as γ 0 0584 b h 0 7 l is the jet length flowing through the spacing between the piles calculated using l 2 c where c π 4 a 1 2 1 1 ξ and ξ π 2 12 1 2 suvarna et al 2020 modified the friction coefficient γ proposed by suh et al 2011 as 12 γ 1 569 h i h f 0 433 the influence of introducing the cph over the conventional pile breakwater is investigated by comparing the performance of cphb and conventional pile breakwater by keeping an equal number of units the best performing configuration of cphb y hmax 1 5 d hmax 0 4 and b d 0 1 in single row is considered for the comparative study the performance of uniformly spaced conventional pile breakwater with 0 04 m diameter d circular piles placed at a b0 d of 0 76 is compared with cphb with b d of 0 1 i e b0 d 0 76 where the number of pile units is the same in both the cases fig 12 showcases the comparison of kt kr and kd between the cphb and conventional pile breakwater with a constant b0 d of 0 76 the kt predicted using kriebel 1992 and mei 1989 are overlapping with each other the calculated kt from suvarna et al 2020 are slightly lower than kriebel 1992 and mei 1989 whereas suh et al 2011 results are higher side referring to fig 12a b and c it can be clearly stated that introducing the cph on the conventional pile breakwater reduces the kt by a significant amount the reduction in kt is found to be about 12 at lower wave steepness in comparison with the theoretical predictions whereas at higher wave steepness a maximum reduction of 27 8 mei 1989 27 8 kriebel 1992 30 84 suh et al 2011 and 25 42 suvarna et al 2020 is noted the predicted values of kr by mei 1989 is identical with that of cphb values and the variation is insignificant refer fig 12d e and f the kr values of cphb is about double the calculated values by suvarna et al 2020 and kriebel 1992 from fig 12g h and i it can be postulated that there is a huge increase in kd of cphb when compared to the conventional pile breakwater the maximum increment observed in kd is 108 6 mei 1989 72 8 kriebel 1992 140 6 suh et al 2011 and 61 1 suvarna et al 2020 than the conventional pile breakwater to achive the equivalent performance of cphb the conventional pile breakwater needs to be constructed at a significantly closer spacing which poses construction difficulties and makes the solution uneconomical the wave attenuation of the conventional pile breakwater is mainly due to the eddie shedding and partial wave reflection introducing the pile head at the surface level distorts the maximum orbital motion at the surface and creates turbulence the improvement in the performance of cphb over the conventional pile breakwater is majorly due to the increased kd as depicted in fig 12 g h and i the cphb obstructs the dominating surface wave energy because of the enlarged area at the surface and the unique wave interaction with the hollow pile head the comparative analysis shows that introducing the cph on the conventional pile breakwater is beneficial in attenuating the waves with lower wave reflection and higher energy dissipation 3 3 2 pile type of breakwaters based on experimental studies in order to examine the relative performance of the cphb the hydrodynamic efficiency of the proposed structure is compared with the similar types of pile pile supported breakwaters and floating breakwater in fig 13 the best performing configuration of single row cphb y hmax 1 5 d hmax 0 4 b d 0 1 and h 0 45 m is compared with pipe breakwater mani and jayakumar 1995 rao and rao 2001 closely spaced rectangular piles huang 2007 zigzag porous screen breakwater mani 2009 and single fixed floating breakwater koutandos et al 2005 from fig 13 it can be inferred that the kt kr and kd are following a similar trend to that of other compared types of breakwaters the comparative study indicates that the kt of cphb is lower than that of pile type of breakwaters huang 2007 mani 2009 rao and rao 2001 the proposed cphb structure found to be competent in wave attenuation with minimal reflection and higher energy dissipation than that of other compared types of breakwaters 3 4 empirical equations based on the present experimental data a set of empirical equations refer eq 13 and eq 14 are proposed for kt and kr for quick estimation of the performance characteristics of cphb using the method of data fitting the empirical equations 13 and 14 are developed the different governing parameters are determined from the dimensional analysis refer section 2 4 and the analysis of results proved that these parameters are essential in influencing the performance characteristics of cphb the empirical equations 13 and 14 can predict the transmission and reflection coefficients of cphb for different governing parameters such as wave steepness relative clear spacing relative pile head height relative pile head diameter and water depth the comparison of the estimated values of kt and kr with the present experimental results are illustrated in fig 14 13 k t e x 3 x 2 3 x 6 3 0 08 x 1 x 5 x 6 x 2 42 x 4 14 k r 7 x 4 x 1 29 7 x 1 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 2 x 3 2 where x 1 y h max x 2 d h max x 3 b d x 4 h i gt 2 x 5 h and x 6 n b d n is the number of cphb rows b is the clear spacing between the rows of cphb and it is assumed to be zero for the single row of cphb the developed empirical equations have reproduced the experimental results with a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 91 and 0 90 for kt and kr respectively therefore the proposed empirical equations can be used for the quick estimation of the performance characteristics of cphb within the test limit along with an appropriate engineering judgement 4 conclusions a series of extensive experiments are conducted on cphb placed in single and two rows with different configurations of d hmax y hmax b d and b d against various wave climatic conditions the overall performance of the cphb is found to be promising for using it as a wave attenuator in coastal sites based on the analysis of the results the following conclusions are drawn the experimental parameters such as d hmax and b d are in direct proportion with the kt and inverse proportion with the kr and kd at the same time y hmax and hi gt2 follow the opposite trend the structural configuration of d hmax 0 4 y hmax 1 5 and b d 0 1 is the best performing model in case of a single row of cphb with the least kt of 0 662 along with kr 0 22 and kd 0 71 in the case of two rows of cphb the b d 0 4 is the optimum spacing which provided a minimal kt of 0 582 with kr 0 26 and kd 0 76 addition of the second row of cphb with d hmax 0 4 y hmax 1 5 b d 0 1 and b d 0 4 configuration in staggered arrangement reduces the kt by a maximum of 12 34 compared to a single row however from the practical point of view providing whether single or double row structure to achieve an extra 12 34 reduction in kt is a matter of judgement considering site conditions the proposed cphb is a better wave attenuator than the conventional pile breakwater introducing the best performing configuration of conical hollow pile head over the conventional pile breakwater improves the wave transmission characteristics of the structure by about 25 along with more than 60 higher wave dissipation the cphb structure found to be competent in wave attenuation with minimal reflection and higher energy dissipation than that of other pile types of breakwaters compared therefore the cphb may be considered while designing breakwaters for sites requiring partial wave attenuation and also can be used in the protection of the coast against erosion depending on the site conditions an empirical formula is developed to predict the kt and kr of cphb based on the parametric analysis of the experimental data the empirical formula reproduced the results with a good correlation for both kt and kr proposed empirical equations provide the engineers with an approximate idea about the configuration needed to design the cphb

20501,the study presents a methodology that uses ais data and a ship manoeuvring simulator to simulate and analyse marine traffic schemes with regard to risks for accidents an event identification method is presented which is needed for the accident scenario part of the methodology this is based on ais data where the great belt vts area was used to verify the methodology three events that could result in ship bridge allisions were modelled and simulated in the simulator drifting ship sharp turning ship and miss of turning point the monte carlo method was used to perform large number of simulator runs including a parameter sensitivity analysis the probability of a ship allision against the great belt bridge was calculated to be 0 007 analysis of the ship bridge allision cases was shown to be dominated by the event drifting ship this event has a relatively low kinetic energy at the impact and the expected allision energy for a 1 000 year allision corresponds to a 178 m tanker with 57 870 dwt and ship speed 14 6 knots finally this study presents a mitigation analysis which shows how the probability of allisions can be reduced by reducing the ship speed or altering the traffic separation scheme keywords ais analysis allision energy event identification ship bridge allision ship grounding ship manoeuvring simulator 1 introduction the advancement in bridge building engineering during the 20th century created an opportunity to build large bridges that span over wide waterways with intensive ship traffic risk analysis was used as the method to ensure that the bridge design and waterway traffic fulfilled expected safety standards despite this 34 major bridge collapses occurred in the period from 1960 to 2007 that were caused by ship bridge allisions def ship collision with a bridge which resulted in the loss of more than 340 lives aashto 2009 in addition to environmental and service loads that form the basis of the strength design of a bridge spanning over a waterway the accidental probability of various hazardous events and accidental loads must also be considered in europe the norms and standards for all building codes are described in the eurocode in eurocode 1 general equations are proposed for the calculation of accidental loads to be used in the design of bridges cen 2006 for ship bridge allisions these equations are based on eq 1 with reference to the research presented by fujii 1983 and macduff 1974 1 n a l n p c where n al is the number of allisions n is the number of ships and p c is the causation factor there is limited guidance in eurocode 1 on how the causation factor should be determined pedersen 1995 2000 proposed that it can be estimated using the number of accidents or allisions for ship bridge contacts divided by the number of ship passages since this approach relies on the number of reported accidents and traffic statistics in the area of interest the accuracy of the value of the calculated causation factor depends on these data hassel et al 2011 and psarros et al 2010 found that only approximately 50 percent of all accidents are reported in accident statistics databases hence the causation factor is underestimated and thereby the probability of accidents this study presents a new methodology that handles the shortcomings in the determination of the causation factor in the risk analysis it uses the approach proposed by hollnagel et al 2006 to identify scenarios that lead to accidents together with ais data to calculate the probability of ship collisions with fixed infrastructure this approach is applied in the study as ship bridge allision hollnagel et al 2006 proposed that there are different layers leading to an accident that should be assessed root cause event and the accident itself for example an officer on watch falls asleep root cause the ship continues past a turning point event and ultimately grounds accident the availability of ais data in combination with the layer approach is the key issue in the methodology presented in this study fujii 1983 and macduff 1974 pioneered and established the basic theory for the current research field at that time ais data were not available the introduction and availability of ais recordings have according to svanberg et al 2019 resulted in new possibilities to enhance the accuracy in maritime risk assessments ais data are therefore used in this study for two purposes to represent the real traffic statistics of ships passing a waterway and to benefit from reverse engineering where advanced numerical simulations are carried out to represent failure event statistics that are more valid compared to what has been reported i e non reported events and accidents can be captured and replicated computer based simulation models have been used in the maritime field for decades one example is källström and ramzan 1985 who used a combination of simulation models and model tests to install the world s first commercial tension leg platform nowadays there are various types of maritime simulation models and software for different purposes one simulation model that includes the event failure is the maritime transportation system mts model this model handles the ships temporospatial positions in a time domain simulation but the hydrodynamic forces are not calculated making it relatively fast and straightforward to use this type of simulator was used by ulusçu et al 2009 who studied the risk of accident in the strait of istanbul van dorp and merrick 2011 proposed using the mts model for risk assessments in coastal areas in this model the traffic was simulated on routes obtained from ais data and the ship failures and errors in the model were simulated based on expert opinions goerlandt and kujala 2011 continued this research and implemented the dmts model this simulator is also based on ais data but it addresses the meeting situations differently goerlandt and kujala 2011 used a monte carlo method to estimate the risk of collision and grounding in the gulf of finland rasmussen et al 2012 used the shiprisk software to quantify the risk to ship traffic in the fehmarnbelt fixed link project this software is a mixture of the models by pedersen 1995 and an mts simulator in rasmussen et al 2012 the probability of human error loss of propulsion and steering machine failure were analysed the purpose of the study is to present new methodology using ais data and a ship manoeuvring simulator to calculate the accident probabilities in marine traffic near bridges spanning over wide waterways the methodology is verified in a case study on grounding accidents its wider applicability is presented in a demonstration study where the probability of ship bridge allisions is calculated with the proposed methodology it can be numerically shown which ships and traffic situations that are over represented in failure event analyses hence mitigation actions can be proposed that reduce the risk of accidents it can also be used to identify candidate ships that should be used as target ships in bridge concept designs to ensure sufficient bridge structural strength that can withstand the kinetic energy impacting the bridge see sha and amdahl 2019 in the proposed methodology there is no equation that estimates the number of allisions this is the major difference compared to methods based on eq 1 the number of simulations is calculated by equations but the simulations give the number of allisions another difference compared to previous research is that the methodology includes methods to obtain location specific failure events regarding both duration and frequency the proposed methodology can thus be applied to study risk mitigation options in location specific areas note however that a limitation is that only single ships can be studied in each simulation this is because the event statistics are gathered from single ship situations and it is challenging to model all human decisions that could be made in an autopilot logic apart from the probability of allision the methodology also enables estimations of the design energy the structure needs to withstand this is possible since the kinetic energy just before the allision is captured for all simulated allisions the remainder of the paper is structured as follows chapter 2 presents the overall methodology including a brief description of the ship manoeuvre simulator chapter 3 introduces the simulation scenarios in the study which have been defined for verification and demonstration purposes of the methodology the event statistics used in these scenarios are presented in chapter 4 a presentation of the simulation setup in the ship manoeuvre simulator are presented in chapter 5 together with the case study area followed by results and discussions of the analyses in chapter 6 the conclusions are presented in chapter 7 2 methodology the methodology in the study integrates modern simulation and analysis tools to ensure safe and robust designs when new bridges that span over waterways are built it should be noted that it can also be used to assess existing bridges if they fulfil today s design and safety criteria or if mitigation actions need to be activated this is justified since the majority of the bridges that exist were built several decades ago they were designed based on the marine traffic that was present at that time considering an extrapolation of its increase and the ideas of which ships that would be built in the future it is likely that the assumptions that formed the basis for safety factors in the bridge design are not aligned with today s marine traffic situation and sizes of ships one similar example where the design criteria had become obsolete is the design of the twin towers of the world trade centre in new york usa and the attack they were subjected to on september 11 2001 the two towers were designed and constructed in the 1960s to withstand an airplane crash however 40 years later both the size of the aircrafts and the amount of fuel they carry had increased significantly more than expected in the scenarios they were designed to withstand el naby et al 2014 the methodology in this study has three major parts collection of ais data analysis of ais data for event definition and modelling and modelling and simulation of events in a ship manoeuvre simulator the ais data are used to collect both event and general traffic statistics based on the event statistics different event models are proposed to be used as input to the simulator where the evolvement of events is simulated and analysed it should be noted that one advantage of using a ship manoeuvre simulator is that not all of the events that are introduced or triggered actually lead to an accident the simulator can thus help us to understand why some events did not result in an accident it can be used in investigations as forensic analysis of accidents that actually happened or it can be used to simulate and analyse the consequence of mitigation actions a schematic of the methodology is shown in fig 1 see chapter 3 for more details how the ais data are investigated and chapter 5 for more details and a presentation of the simulation setup in fig 7 2 1 ship manoeuvre simulator the seaman ship manoeuvre simulator which was developed by sspa http www sspa se was used in this study the simulator is a software code where the ship s motions are modelled in all six degrees of freedom it is a module based software where the definition of the ship model s characteristics is divided into subsystems e g the hull engine propeller and rudder the simulator includes spatial temporal subsystems and numerical codes that calculate the forces acting on the ship that are induced by the wind waves and currents shallow water and bank effects are also considered andreasson et al 2005 ottosson and bystrom 1991 total force equilibrium of the ship model is solved in a nonlinear mathematical model in every time step according to a procedure presented in ottosson 1994 a seaman ship model requires several hundreds of parameters to accurately represent a ship and its characteristics in the simulator a ship s hydrodynamics and resistance properties can be fine tuned if test data are available from model testing when new models are defined in the simulator a procedure for parameter sensitivity study of the ship model s parameters is always carried out for example to ensure that the manoeuvrability of the ships used in this study was correctly modelled in seaman each ship model was simulated and verified against the zig zag and turning circle tests from the imo s standards for ship manoeuvrability imo 2002 running these tests in a simulation context have also been applied by others like budak and beji 2020 who used the tests to ensure the ship s manoeuvrability while implementing a course keeping autopilot fig 2 presents a screen shot from a simulation when the simulator is run in desktop mode in real time it can also be run in batch mode with an autopilot navigating the ship according to a pre defined route failure event or simulation scenario determined by the user the batch mode was used in this study since it significantly reduced the simulation time and there was no need to survey the simulations in real time on a screen it was also a necessity because of the large number of simulations carried out using the monte carlo method see chapters 5 and 6 3 definition and identification of failure events using ais simulation and analysis of ship accidents and their causes can be carried out in multiple ways pedersen 1995 2020 proposed a method based on the work of fujii 1983 and macduff 1974 in this method situations are defined that can result in an accident an approach that has been applied by among others montewka et al 2012 and goerlandt and kujala 2011 pedersen s situation based approach can be efficiently used in mathematical models that do not involve or need a ship manoeuvring simulator or detailed modelling of the ship s motions and dynamics however one shortcoming is that it relies on historical events accidents and data for known traffic situations and ships which often are related to very low probabilities and hence the method is sensitive to the access to and quality of data chen et al 2019 the advantage of the approach is that analyses can be made with low modelling and computation efforts which often are suitable in risk analyses that involve the monte carlo method the ship manoeuvre simulator presented in chapter 2 was used in this study instead of pedersen s approach the advantage of the simulator approach is that it opens up new possibilities to simulate assess and execute risk analysis of existing and future marine traffic situations that may involve infrastructure offshore the gain of this approach is that specific details of the trace from event to accident can be obtained and analysed this includes data of ship types weather situations ship operation profiles fairway layouts and infrastructure objects which can be modelled and systematically varied in parametric studies it does not need an explicit value or expression of the causation factor which is required in pedersen s approach the drawback is that it requires some more modelling and computation efforts but the simulator software used in this study offers batch mode simulations to overcome the challenge in addition instead of defining and analysing accidents three types of events are identified in the study as relevant and critical for ship bridge allisions in relatively narrow waterways drifting of the ship sharp turning of a ship and miss of a turning point they are similar to the categorisation presented in ulusçu et al 2009 van dorp and merrick 2011 and rassmusen et al 2012 see a discussion in chapter 6 4 for other types of events the ais data of the marine traffic in the area are needed to model simulate and analyse the events since 2002 ships larger than 300 gross tonnes must have an ais transponder which means that this information has been available after 2002 ais messages are separated in two message types position report and metadata message raymond 2019 at sea every ship issues a position report every 2 10 s depending on the ship s speed and turning rate in this study this information is handled both as single points and after post processing as trajectories defined by multiple points and represented by lines connecting similar points the trajectories then contain data from both the position reports and the metadata messages data and are stored in a postgresql database with the spatial extension postgis for more details about how the trajectories were constructed with a douglas peucker compression see hörteborn et al 2019 or a similar method presented in zhao and shi 2019 and wei et al 2020 the following subchapters present how ais data were used to quantify frequencies and durations for the three events of drifting ship sharp turning ship and miss of turning point each subchapter ends with a summary of how the simulation of the event was implemented in the simulator s autopilot in short the event identification using ais data was carried out in two steps first an automatic filter with specified conditions that helped define an event was applied to the ais trajectories followed by a second manual step applied to the remaining tracks that could not be identified as a clear event among the three categories events identified by the ais data were also used in the process of calibrating the autopilot s behaviour for example related to the time to turn off the steering system and lock the rudder s position 3 1 event drifting ship the drifting ship event is defined as a ship that appears to drift with the waves the wind and the current with no possibility to turn on its engine it is assumed that the probability that the drifting ship event will occur is the same along the fairway see furnes and amdahl 1980 rasmussen et al 2012 and kaneko 2012 the ais data were used to identify drifting ships by following the ais trajectories and applying the following criteria as filters speed over ground sog should be less than 2 knots course over ground cog should differ more than 20 from the heading duration longer than 5 min each candidate ship that fulfilled these criteria was manually checked to ensure that there were no obvious reasons for their drifting behaviour which would then result in the candidate being removed from the sample examples of such candidates that should be excluded as drifting ships are slow steaming ships and ships that intervene with other ships e g ships that pickup pilots or change crew the duration of the event for a drifting ship was defined by the position report where the ship started to lose speed or its last known position to the position report where the ship recovered control and started to either pick up speed again or anchored in the simulator a drifting ship is modelled as fully operational for the first 60 s in a simulation case whereafter the propulsion system is turned off at this instant the ship begins to lose speed and the autopilot tries to keep the ship s course on track for as long as possible this setup correlates with the most common ship behaviours from ais data observations from the ship traffic studied in chapter 4 complete blackout including the steering engine was not observed the simulation in the simulator continues for the duration of the event which can either be the duration as measured from ais data see above from a pre defined time by the user when the propulsion system is turned on again or when the ship is anchored in this study the first option was used fig 3 shows an example from a comparison of results from a simulator simulation green ship contours and the real ais track grey ship contours for the same case of a drifting ship this example shows that the simulator almost replicates the ais track 3 2 event sharp turning ship the sharp turning ship event is defined as a ship that may suffer from a malfunction in the rudder giving rise to a locked rudder that turns the ship distinctly to starboard or port see pedersen et al 2020 for the category iii type of accident for a similar situation or event in the current study it is assumed that when this event occurs the ship decreases its speed to gain time to repair fix the rudder problem when the ship s speed decreases and there is no rudder effect that can be controlled by the crew it looks as if the ship is drifting in the ais data thus the principles and filters used to identify drifting ships can initially be applied to identify candidates for the current event to distinguish this event from the event drifting ship the following complementary criteria are used a ship that continuously loses its speed without an instant sharp turn is categorised as a candidate for the event drifting ship a ship that starts its drifting with an instant turn and has a rudder malfunction is categorised as a candidate for the event sharp turning ship the duration of the sharp turning ship event for a ship was defined by the position reported where the ship started to turn sharply to the position reported where the ship recovered control and started to either pick up speed again or anchored modelling this event in the simulator is challenging since in reality the crew of a ship will react and act differently in each scenario to a malfunction of the rudder nevertheless the simulator setup to simulate this event is in the study is defined as a fully operational ship the first 60 s of the simulation case whereafter the rudder is set to either full starboard or full port after another 60 s in the simulation the engine is turned off and after another 5 min the rudder is assumed functional again and set to mid ship position this sequence times and behaviours were determined from the authors experiences from analyses of ais data parametric studies in the simulator and attempts to mimic real events in the simulator s environment fig 4 shows an example from a comparison of results from a simulator simulation green ship contours and the real ais track red ship contours for the same case of a sharp turning ship the turn is initiated with constant speed indicating that it is a sharp turning point event and not a case of loss of propulsion i e drifting event this example shows that the simulator almost replicates the ais track for this event 3 3 event miss of turning point the miss of turning point event is defined as a ship that continues straight ahead passing a marked or expected turning point but manages to correct its course later to the main navigation lane see pedersen et al 2020 for the category ii type of accident for a similar situation or event the event is exemplified in fig 5 where the blue line shows a ship traveling from south west to north east failing to follow the expected normal traffic behaviour the ship passes through the border line 3 of the traffic separation scheme tss after some time the mistake is observed and the ship turns back to the main navigation lane of the fairway the reason for the occurrence of this event can have various root causes such as fatigued crew falling asleep rudder stuck mid ship human errors during navigation etc the ais data were used to identify miss of turning point ships by following the ais trajectories and applying the following criteria as filters here presented related to the example in fig 5 the ship should cross the pre defined tss border lines i e the border lines 1 3 and 4 in fig 5 the cog should differ less than 5 between the crossing of lines 1 and 3 the sog should differ less than 1 knot between the crossing of lines 1 and 3 similar to the other event categories every ship that fulfilled these criteria was manually checked to ensure that there were no obvious or other reasons for its behaviour and choice of path for example a ship with a distance smaller than its own ship domain to another ship was excluded since its path could have been affected by the other ship i e intentional and voluntary miss of turning point to avoid an incident the definition of the size of the ship domain followed the method presented in hörteborn et al 2019 the duration of the miss of turning point event for a ship was defined by the position of the expected turning point and the position reported where the ship actually turned the expected turning point here is the point where the majority of all ships turn to follow the tss see line 2 in fig 5 which marks when ships are supposed to make the turn in the example modelling this event in the simulator was done in the case study as follows the ship is run as expected during the initial 2 min of the simulation in order to ensure that it is on the correct navigation path after that the autopilot is turned off and the rudder is locked in mid ship position and remains so for the remaining time duration of the event 4 event statistics this chapter present event statistics and durations for the events defined in chapter 3 the case study presented in chapters 5 and 6 emphasises the great belt vts area however in this chapter the statistics and analyses of the tss bornholmsgat area and the results reported in rasmussen et al 2012 are included for comparison purposes the ais data were based on the marine traffic in the great belt vts and tss bornholmsgat areas during the period 2014 to 2019 obtained from dma 2020 the data were analysed with the methodology presented in chapter 3 rasmussen et al 2012 presented their results for human failure in the kadetrenden area using ais data from 2007 to 2010 and their statistics for loss of propulsion and steering machine failure were based on four years of incident reports from the great belt vts 4 1 event frequencies it assumed that the probability of occurrence and the duration of the events defined in chapter 3 are independent of ship type and size in total 153 events were identified in the great belt vts and tss bornholmsgat areas using the event identification methods described in chapter 3 table 1 presents a summary of the number of events for each event category together with the number of sailing hours that were used to identify the drifting ship and sharp turning ship two waypoints in these areas were used to define the event miss of turning point and the number of turns at these waypoints are also presented in the table the frequency for drifting ship and sharp turning ship was calculated by dividing the number of events with the number of sailing hours the miss of turning point frequency was calculated by dividing the number of events with the number of ships making the turn these frequencies together with the data from rasmussen et al 2012 are shown in table 2 the event frequency for drifting ship is in same order of magnitude in the three studies the values for the great belt vts and rasmussen et al 2012 show very good agreement thus the method described in chapter 3 1 for this event was considered verified the lower value for the great belt vts area compared to the tss bornholmsgat area is due to the ships in the former area being able to manoeuvre more easily and safely and anchor outside the fairway if they experience minor trouble such as a partial blackout it should be noted that with the event identification method presented in chapter 3 1 it is not possible to differentiate these events from planned anchoring in the case study in chapter 5 simulations and analyses of the great belt vts area this event s frequency was set to 0 65 10 4 hour the event frequency for sharp turning ship differs some between the different studies however only two cases were identified for the two studies in the great belt vts area which are too few to rely on when generating statistics it was assumed that the value of this event s frequency should be somewhat lower than the average value from the three studies it was set to 0 070 10 4 hour a sensitivity analysis in which this event s frequency is increased 50 percent is presented in chapter 6 4 the event frequency for miss of turning point shows relatively good conformity between the three studies the value from rasmussen et al 2012 is instead of calculating the event frequency in terms of occurrences per turn based on human failure and event frequency per hour as the unit based on the same reasons as for the drifting ship event an event frequency of 1 55 10 4 turn was used in the simulations and analyses in chapter 5 however it should be noted the duration time of the event was found to be notably different between these three studies see the following chapter for the analysis 4 2 event durations the definition of the duration of each event was defined in chapter 3 fig 6 presents a summary of the durations for the drifting ship and sharp turning ship event categories the symbols in the figure represent results from the ais data processing while the lines represent fitted curves according to the distributions presented in table 3 for the former category the results are presented separately for the great belt vts the tss bornholmsgat and rasmussen et al 2012 for the sharp turning ship event there were too few cases in the great belt vts and the tss bornholmsgat areas to make a distribution to overcome this was six event durations from a third area the kiel canal included to make this distribution this area is discussed in chapter 6 5 however the event had similar durations in all areas so they were fitted to one common distribution representing the event the results in the figure show that the duration of the drifting ship event is the shortest in the great belt vts area it can be explained by the fact that this area offers the best opportunity to anchor the event category miss of turning point is not included in the figure but its statistical distributions are presented in table 3 4 3 accident statistics in the areas collection of accident statistics in the great belt vts area was emphasised since this area was used in the simulator case study in chapter 5 three sources were used to ensure that the majority of accidents reported between 2010 and 2019 in the area were collected in the accident records of ihs fairplay 2020 five strandings two collisions one contact and one fire accident were reported in addition to these accidents the norwegian maritime authority sjofartsdirektoratet 2020 reported one fire accident and no additional accidents were found reported in the emcip database emcip 2020 5 description of simulator simulations and case study the chapter presents a case study where the seaman simulator was used to simulate and analyse the marine traffic situation in the great belt vts area chapter 5 1 presents how the simulator simulations were planned and setup followed by specific details and descriptions of the case study in chapter 5 2 5 1 simulator simulations and setup the simulations in the seaman simulator were run in sets where each set contained 90 batches of simulations the 90 batches were based on three event categories 15 types of ships and two directions of ship routes see chapter 3 for event categorisation and chapter 5 2 for ship types and route directions specific for the case study marine traffic situation the number of simulations in each batch for the drifting ship and sharp turning ship events was calculated using eq 2 2 n s i m i j 1 15 k 1 2 p f t i n c a t j k t n j k y r where n sim i is the number of simulations for event i 1 drifting ship 2 sharp turning ship p ft i is the event probability per hour for the event under study see event frequency in chapter 4 1 n cat j k is the estimated number of ships per year for ship type j on a route k in the area t n j k is the average time ship type j sails on the route k and y r is the number of repetitions of one year s traffic the simulation should represent the starting position of a ship in a simulation for an event varied between the simulations it was assumed that the starting position of a ship i e its position in the fairway when the simulation starts follows the traffic separation scheme and spatially follows an even distribution along the route the distance between starting positions d sp ijk was calculated according to eq 3 where n sim i was calculated according to eq 2 where l r k is the length of the simulated route 3 d s p i j k l r k n s i m i the number of simulations in each batch for the miss of turning point event i 3 was calculated using eq 4 4 n s i m i j 1 15 k 1 2 p c s a i n c a t j k n t j k y r where p csa i is the probability that a ship misses a turn and n t jk is the number of turns the ship j makes on its route k according to chapter 3 3 these simulations started 2 min prior to the point where the turn was missed a turning point was laterally distributed in accordance with their unique route the majority of the simulator simulations ended without ship grounding or ship bridge allision however for the simulations that ended with an allision the allision energy was calculated according to eq 5 where m is the ship s displacement v the ship speed and e is the allision energy note that this is the largest theoretical energy that may cause damage to the ship and the bridge structures since the formula is simplistic it does not include detailed energy distribution which could be studied by external dynamics simulations see yu et al 2016 and lu et al 2016 5 e m v 2 2 a central part of the presented methodology is the bridge design criteria according to johansen and askeland 2019 there are different ways to interpret these criteria where the authors proposed to use of an fn curve to better represent both the probability and the consequence in this study a risk criterion with a threshold of 1 10 3 was selected which means that a bridge struck by a ship should withstand and survive allisions with a probability level of 1 10 3 the procedure to identify ships that follow this criterion was as follows the allision energies from a complete simulation set in the simulator were sorted from the highest to lowest the probability for the worst allision in the same set of simulations is then 1 y r and the second worst or worse has a probability of occurring 2 y r for this analogy with simulator simulations of y r 10 000 times the 10th worst allision corresponds to the worst allision that has the highest probability to occur in 1 000 years if y r is increased to 100 000 the 100th worst allision corresponds to the allision energy with a probability to occur corresponding to 1 10 3 the seaman simulator has two major parts in the simulator model a model of the ship and a model of the environment called world fig 7 presents a schematic of the parameters of these models that have either been deterministic d or randomly generated mc in monte carlo simulations the deterministic parameters were the three batch parameters i e event categories ship types and direction on route and the seven randomly generated parameters were described by statistical distributions 5 2 case study the great belt vts area the chapter presents the case study area in detail it is presented from which the values and settings of the parameters lateral offset route ship ship speeds and environmental variables were collected the properties of the events were presented in chapter 3 and their durations in chapter 4 2 the great belt vts was chosen as the case study area since it has been studied by other researchers from a ship bridge allision perspective for an example see gluver and olsen 1998 according to statistics in accident databases numerous groundings in the area have been reported during the past few years emsa 2019 and historic ais data are available for the area dma 2020 fig 8 presents a map of the marine traffic passing the area and fig 9 presents histograms of the distribution in ship length ship speed and lateral distribution for the marine traffic that passed the great belt bridge during 2019 the marine traffic is spread laterally over the fairway which according to iala 2014 can be represented by the normal distribution in this study this distribution is checked updated at every waypoint for all traffic in 2019 since the properties of the distribution may vary in the fairway here called offset by means of the offset normal distributions indicated as lateral offsetmc in fig 7 a unique route could be generated for each simulator simulation most of the traffic that passes the area follows the south north t route it is divided into a deep water route and a normal route see fig 8 statistics of the marine traffic in the area during 2019 shows that 19 507 ships passed under the great belt bridge divided into 7 225 general cargo ships 5 242 tanker ships 2 094 ropax roro ships 1 488 container ships 1 484 bulk carriers and 1 974 unknown ship types the length distribution of each ship type is presented in fig 10 the results in the figure were used to define 15 representative ships in the simulator that together reflected the marine traffic in the area during 2019 table 4 presents some of the ships specifics ship speed normally distributed speedsmc in fig 7 and the number of ships going north and south n cat in eqs 2 and 4 the three largest ships with regards to draught bulk 226 m tanker 241 m tanker 260 m used the deep water route in fig 8 all other ships use the normal route 5 3 metocean statistics for the great belt vts area the metocean statistics for the area were downloaded from the copernicus marine service 2020 the wind statistics for the period 2015 to 2020 are presented in fig 11 as a wind rose plot for the location latitude 55 25 and longitude 11 0 the current statistics for the period 2016 to 2020 are presented in fig 12 as a current rose plot for the location latitude 55 2 and longitude 11 0 the data in the rose plots are used to define the wind and current loads in the simulator model see fig 7 the length of a colour bar in fig 11 indicates the probability of a specific wind speed and wind direction for example the wind directions around 11 percent of the time are from the south west where the wind speed is 2 5 percent of the time less than 3 m s 6 percent of the time between 3 and 6 m s 3 percent of the time between 6 and 9 m s and less than 0 5 percent of the time it is faster than 9 m s the wind rose plot in fig 11 shows that the dominant wind directions are from the west and the south west and that the wind speed is often below 9 m s wind speeds larger than 9 m s come from the west and sometimes from the east but rarely from other directions the current rose plot in fig 12 shows that there are currents in the area that are dominated by the directions north north west and south south east forces from secondary waves induce drift forces on ships and waves up to 2 m have some effects on a ship s manoeuvrability chillcce and el moctar 2018 the probability to encounter different wave heights in the range 0 2 5 m in the area is presented in fig 13 this figure show that the probability to encounter waves larger than 1 5 m is very low i e waves have a minor effect on a ship s manoeuvrability in the area hence it was assumed that waves could be disregarded in the simulator model which also reduce the computational efforts less simulation time to conclude the influence from wind and current have a great effect on the drift force and hence they were included in the simulator model which in this study was defined as a four degrees of freedom ship model heave and pitch were not considered 6 results the simulator runs were defined in three categories divided into ten simulation sets for i investigation of the influence from random seeds in the generation of random variables ii a sensitivity study of the parameters and iii demonstration of examples of risk mitigation see table 5 for an overview of all simulation sets the simulation of a single ship s voyage took approximately 2 s on an intel core i7 2600 3 4 ghz processor with 16 gb ram memory and 64bit architecture one set of simulations consist of some four million ship voyages which needed approximately 80 h to complete using eight processors the three sets 1a 1b and 1c relate to the random seed study they have the same input but the random seed for the generation of random variables mc in fig 7 is varied which resulted in different values of the random variables hence by defining the random seed a simulation could be reproduced ensuring that new combinations of random variables were generated harris et al 2020 the number of simulations needed in the set was determined by a criterion defined in this study stating that the difference in allision energy between the simulation sets should not differ more than five percent the five sets in 2 4 in table 5 were defined for sensitivity study analysis purposes in which the probabilities and duration time of the events were studied the input data were based on the tss bornholmsgat area one set investigated the increased probability and duration time of the event drifting ship and another set investigated a fifty percent increase in probability of the event sharp turning ship the miss of turning point event was separated into three sets increase of both probability and duration time increase of only the probability and increase of only the duration time sets 5 and 6 were defined and used in examples of risk mitigation to demonstrate how the methodology presented in the study can be utilised in set 5 a speed limitation of 12 knots was enforced and in set 6 the navigation path was altered to force the traffic to navigate 2 6 nautical miles straight prior to the great belt bridge instead of 1 6 nautical miles which is the normal navigation path 6 1 analysis of the number of simulated traffic years yr sets 1a 1b and 1c were used to investigate how many traffic years y r need to be simulated according to the discussion in chapter 5 1 table 6 presents the results from the simulator simulations with y r 10 000 traffic years or repetitions of one year there is a difference in the number of groundings and allisions because of the different random seeds which also affects the maximum allision energy and the 1 000 year allision energy for each simulation set as described in chapter 5 1 the 1 000 year allision energy represents the worst allision that has a probability of 1 10 3 to occur because the 1 000 year allision energy differs more than 30 percent between the sets y r was too low and was increased to 100 000 the results from these simulations are presented in table 7 they show that the number of groundings is on average 50 887 this gives a probability of 0 51 groundings per year which compared to the accident statistics for the area demonstrates a good agreement since five groundings were reported during a ten year period see chapter 4 3 the average number of allisions is 721 which gives a probability of 0 007 allisions per year or one allision every 139 years the 1 000 year allision energy shows some difference between the sets but the deviation is less than five percent which is acceptable the average allision energy was calculated to 1 624 mj which represents a 178 m tanker with 57 870 dwt at ship speed 14 6 knots 6 2 analysis of the duration time parameter fig 14 presents the results from an analysis of all simulations in simulation set 1a in table 7 emphasising the influence from the parameter duration time in the three event categories the green line represents the distribution of all simulations while the blue dotted and the red dashed lines represent the distributions for the events that ended in grounding or allision accidents respectively the results show that the duration time in the drifting ship event had a small influence compared to the overall distribution and probability that lead to an allision the duration time had a minor influence on the sharp turning ship event results but there was a large effect with regard to the miss of turning point event simulations with a longer duration time show a larger probability for grounding and allision accidents the miss of turning point thus shows the highest probability for a grounding or allision accident fig 15 presents the results from simulation set 1a to illustrate the paths of ships that collided with the bridge using the methodology presented in this study and these results it is possible to propose and analyse mitigation actions that can help reduce or possibly avoid ship bridge allisions 6 3 analysis of two mitigation methods two mitigations were analysed by simulation sets 5 and 6 reduction of maximum allowed ship speed and change of point where ships should make an earlier turn change navigation path to pass under the bridge respectively these two mitigation options were included to showcase possibilities with the methodology they were designed based on similar ship fairway bridge crossings the results presented in table 8 show that both these actions have a positive effect on reducing the number of accidents the reason why the allision energy is significantly reduced is simply because many of the allision cases in set 1a did not occur for the miss of turning point event which formerly gave the largest collision energies it should be noted that the suggested mitigation actions have not been confirmed as realistic measures to be enforced in the area however with the methodology presented in this study it is shown that they are worth investigating further especially if marine traffic density and ship sizes continue to increase in the area this is also supported by pedersen et al 2020 who recommended doing scenario based simulations as a preparation for future changes and estimations of ship traffic situations and risk assessments 6 4 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity study analysis was carried out to investigate how the probabilities and duration time parameters from the simulation sets affect the results except for 1b 1c 5 and 6 those sets were excluded because there was no need to include all the random seed simulation sets or the simulation sets that were defined for the mitigation study the results are presented in table 9 simulation sets 2 and 4 were based on the event statistics from the tss bornholmsgat area set 2 has a higher probability for drifting ship compared to simulation set 1a this increased the number of groundings and allisions by about 25 percent it did not however affect the 1 000 year allision energy set 3 has a 50 percent higher probability for sharp turning ship compared to simulation set 1a which also showed a minor increase in the number of groundings and allisions but no influence on the 1 000 year allision energy for the miss of turning point in set 4a the case study simulations show that this event has the largest influence and is thereby the most sensitive to the results the increase of probability and duration were separated into 4b and 4c to further investigate this event type and its effect on the result an increase of only the event probability from 1 55 10 4 to 2 1 10 4 raised the number of allisions caused by miss of turning point from 0 25 percent per year to 0 32 percent per year and the expected 1 000 year allision energy by approximate 13 percent however an increase of the average duration from 0 064 h to 0 19 h affected the number of allisions by 2 900 percent and the expected 1 000 year allision energy by 251 percent a comparison between the allision energy from sets 4c and 1a is illustrated in fig 16 an allision energy of approximately 4 268 mj represents a 260 m tanker with 164 820 dwt at ship speed 14 knots or a larger tanker with 237 100 dwt at ship speed 12 knots the results in fig 16 show that some of the results are sensitive to the value of the parameter duration time especially for the event miss of turning point this has not been studied in detail in similar investigations and models within the same research area e g goerlandt and kujala 2011 hansen et al 2013 van dorp and merrick 2011 it is recommended that a stronger emphasis should be placed on this parameter in future work as the manner which the duration time varies for different ship traffic areas ship types and sizes should be studied in more depth 6 5 applicability of proposed methodology in chapter 4 the methods described in chapter 3 were used to obtain event statistics in two areas these areas have their differences when it comes to geography however they are both considered to be open sea and have well defined sailing paths partly regulated by tss another area with well defined sailing paths is the kiel canal the methods to identify events were applied in this area as well but it was concluded that the methods were not applicable here with the assumption that all the events led to accidents and that all the accidents here were reported the accidents from 2017 reported to ihs fairplay and emcip were studied the records give a higher frequency here for the loss of propulsion and rudder failure but they are in the same magnitude as in the areas included in this paper although it should also be noted that rudder failures in the accident records include more types of events than described in chapter 3 2 there are other events that were not investigated in the study that could result in an allision one example of such an event is cowboy ships which was introduced by pyman et al 1983 the event defines ships that do not follow the intended navigation path and make turns at wrong locations in the fairway and traffic scheme the cause behind the event could be crew captains influenced by alcohol malfunction of navigation aids acts of terrorism etc this type of event was excluded from the study since no method was found to model identify and quantify the event another example of event that was not considered in the study is the category iv scenario proposed in pedersen et al 1995 2020 which refers to a ship that makes an evasive manoeuvre because of another ship near a bridge this event was not considered in the study for the same reasons as the cowboy ship event compared to previous research and methods in e g ulusçu et al 2009 van dorp and merrick 2011 and goerlandt and kujala 2011 the proposed methodology includes calculation of the hydrodynamic forces it also contains methods for obtaining local event failure frequencies and durations the study has demonstrated that the proposed methodology can be applied to allision case studies while other models in the literature often emphasize open sea and coastal areas finally a difference between the proposed methodology and equation based models e g pedersen 1995 2020 is that the probability and consequence of an event are analysed together instead of separately the proposed methodology can be used both to analyse the risk of existing bridges and in the planning phase of new bridges the risk defined in eq 1 has the terms accumulated probability and consequence which were also analysed for each simulation case in the methodology this definition of risk and the way to present accumulated probability in fig 16 is similar to johansen and askeland 2019 who used an fn curve as the design criterion for bridge design note that the fn curve has the number of fatalities on the x axis and fig 16 has the allision energy in future research the allision energy could be translated to damages to the bridge and thereafter converted to number of fatalities 7 conclusions the study presented a methodology using ais data a ship manoeuvring simulator and the monte carlo method to calculate the accident probabilities in marine traffic near bridges spanning over wide waterways the methodology was verified in a case study on grounding accidents and its wider applicability was presented in a case study where the probability of ship bridge allisions was calculated with the proposed methodology ships and traffic situations that were over represented in the failure event analyses in the case study s marine traffic area were numerically shown and mitigation actions were proposed that can reduce the probability of ship bridge allisions ships that represent the 1 000 year allision energy were identified which can be used as target ships in bridge structural strength assessments and whose kinetic energy impact a bridge must withstand an event based approach was proposed for the identification of events that should be simulated and analysed if they can lead to a maritime accident this is based on an analysis of ais data of the traffic separation scheme of the area of interest event detection criteria for three events drifting ship sharp turning ship and miss of turning point were proposed the marine traffic areas great belt vts and tss bornholmsgat were analysed to estimate the event frequency the results were compared with results in rasmussen et al 2012 and there was good agreement for the drifting ship and miss of turning point events for the sharp turning ship event too few events in the ais data were found to form representative statistical conclusions the great belt vts area was used in a verification study that confirmed that the methodology could predict the probability of ship groundings corresponding to the accident statistics from the past ten years in the same area it was concluded that the presented methodology can be used to simulate and analyse traffic situation schemes in costal waterways to calculate the probability that a ship accident will occur the ship bridge allision case study of the great belt bridge showed in a sensitivity study that the parameter duration time of an event has a large influence on the results it is thus recommended to carry out a parametric sensitivity study of this parameter in the current case study it was shown to have a relatively large influence especially on the miss of turning point event and the subsequent way the ship s situation in the simulator runs evolved a sensitivity study of the number of simulated traffic years showed that 100 000 traffic years were required to satisfy the convergence criterion defined in the study the probability for a ship allision against the great belt bridge was calculated to be 0 007 an analysis of all ship bridge allision cases showed that it was dominated by the drifting ship event the expected allision energy for the 1 000 year allision was calculated to be 1 624 mj which can be represented by a 178 m tanker with 57 870 dwt and ship speed 14 6 knots however if the duration of the event miss of turning point was increased to the same duration as in the tss bornholmsgat the expected allision energy for a 1 000 year allision was increased to 4 268 mj which can be represented by a 260 m tanker with 164 820 dwt at ship speed 14 knots or a larger tanker with 237 100 dwt at ship speed 12 knots two mitigation actions were studied change of the traffic separation scheme and limitation of the ship speed both of these actions will give the crew more time to act and react in case they lose the manoeuvrability of the ship hence the probability of an allision was reduced the methodology presented in the study and its results show that it can be applied either in the planning phase of a new bridge over a waterway if the ais data in the area are known or in the assessment of marine traffic situations near existing bridges where the marine traffic may have changed since they were designed and built the methodology is not limited to ship bridge allisions it can also be used to assess the probability of collisions with other infrastructures offshore or other marine accidents such as ship groundings the event failure probability can be included directly in other navigational risk assessment methods to assess the risk of collision when vessels are close to each other in future research the methodology should be developed to include multiple ships in the simulation models and implement active decision support how other ships can meet and interact more safely in fairways which high traffic density this extension of the simulation methodology would offer a possibility to simulate and analyse the probabilities and

20501,the study presents a methodology that uses ais data and a ship manoeuvring simulator to simulate and analyse marine traffic schemes with regard to risks for accidents an event identification method is presented which is needed for the accident scenario part of the methodology this is based on ais data where the great belt vts area was used to verify the methodology three events that could result in ship bridge allisions were modelled and simulated in the simulator drifting ship sharp turning ship and miss of turning point the monte carlo method was used to perform large number of simulator runs including a parameter sensitivity analysis the probability of a ship allision against the great belt bridge was calculated to be 0 007 analysis of the ship bridge allision cases was shown to be dominated by the event drifting ship this event has a relatively low kinetic energy at the impact and the expected allision energy for a 1 000 year allision corresponds to a 178 m tanker with 57 870 dwt and ship speed 14 6 knots finally this study presents a mitigation analysis which shows how the probability of allisions can be reduced by reducing the ship speed or altering the traffic separation scheme keywords ais analysis allision energy event identification ship bridge allision ship grounding ship manoeuvring simulator 1 introduction the advancement in bridge building engineering during the 20th century created an opportunity to build large bridges that span over wide waterways with intensive ship traffic risk analysis was used as the method to ensure that the bridge design and waterway traffic fulfilled expected safety standards despite this 34 major bridge collapses occurred in the period from 1960 to 2007 that were caused by ship bridge allisions def ship collision with a bridge which resulted in the loss of more than 340 lives aashto 2009 in addition to environmental and service loads that form the basis of the strength design of a bridge spanning over a waterway the accidental probability of various hazardous events and accidental loads must also be considered in europe the norms and standards for all building codes are described in the eurocode in eurocode 1 general equations are proposed for the calculation of accidental loads to be used in the design of bridges cen 2006 for ship bridge allisions these equations are based on eq 1 with reference to the research presented by fujii 1983 and macduff 1974 1 n a l n p c where n al is the number of allisions n is the number of ships and p c is the causation factor there is limited guidance in eurocode 1 on how the causation factor should be determined pedersen 1995 2000 proposed that it can be estimated using the number of accidents or allisions for ship bridge contacts divided by the number of ship passages since this approach relies on the number of reported accidents and traffic statistics in the area of interest the accuracy of the value of the calculated causation factor depends on these data hassel et al 2011 and psarros et al 2010 found that only approximately 50 percent of all accidents are reported in accident statistics databases hence the causation factor is underestimated and thereby the probability of accidents this study presents a new methodology that handles the shortcomings in the determination of the causation factor in the risk analysis it uses the approach proposed by hollnagel et al 2006 to identify scenarios that lead to accidents together with ais data to calculate the probability of ship collisions with fixed infrastructure this approach is applied in the study as ship bridge allision hollnagel et al 2006 proposed that there are different layers leading to an accident that should be assessed root cause event and the accident itself for example an officer on watch falls asleep root cause the ship continues past a turning point event and ultimately grounds accident the availability of ais data in combination with the layer approach is the key issue in the methodology presented in this study fujii 1983 and macduff 1974 pioneered and established the basic theory for the current research field at that time ais data were not available the introduction and availability of ais recordings have according to svanberg et al 2019 resulted in new possibilities to enhance the accuracy in maritime risk assessments ais data are therefore used in this study for two purposes to represent the real traffic statistics of ships passing a waterway and to benefit from reverse engineering where advanced numerical simulations are carried out to represent failure event statistics that are more valid compared to what has been reported i e non reported events and accidents can be captured and replicated computer based simulation models have been used in the maritime field for decades one example is källström and ramzan 1985 who used a combination of simulation models and model tests to install the world s first commercial tension leg platform nowadays there are various types of maritime simulation models and software for different purposes one simulation model that includes the event failure is the maritime transportation system mts model this model handles the ships temporospatial positions in a time domain simulation but the hydrodynamic forces are not calculated making it relatively fast and straightforward to use this type of simulator was used by ulusçu et al 2009 who studied the risk of accident in the strait of istanbul van dorp and merrick 2011 proposed using the mts model for risk assessments in coastal areas in this model the traffic was simulated on routes obtained from ais data and the ship failures and errors in the model were simulated based on expert opinions goerlandt and kujala 2011 continued this research and implemented the dmts model this simulator is also based on ais data but it addresses the meeting situations differently goerlandt and kujala 2011 used a monte carlo method to estimate the risk of collision and grounding in the gulf of finland rasmussen et al 2012 used the shiprisk software to quantify the risk to ship traffic in the fehmarnbelt fixed link project this software is a mixture of the models by pedersen 1995 and an mts simulator in rasmussen et al 2012 the probability of human error loss of propulsion and steering machine failure were analysed the purpose of the study is to present new methodology using ais data and a ship manoeuvring simulator to calculate the accident probabilities in marine traffic near bridges spanning over wide waterways the methodology is verified in a case study on grounding accidents its wider applicability is presented in a demonstration study where the probability of ship bridge allisions is calculated with the proposed methodology it can be numerically shown which ships and traffic situations that are over represented in failure event analyses hence mitigation actions can be proposed that reduce the risk of accidents it can also be used to identify candidate ships that should be used as target ships in bridge concept designs to ensure sufficient bridge structural strength that can withstand the kinetic energy impacting the bridge see sha and amdahl 2019 in the proposed methodology there is no equation that estimates the number of allisions this is the major difference compared to methods based on eq 1 the number of simulations is calculated by equations but the simulations give the number of allisions another difference compared to previous research is that the methodology includes methods to obtain location specific failure events regarding both duration and frequency the proposed methodology can thus be applied to study risk mitigation options in location specific areas note however that a limitation is that only single ships can be studied in each simulation this is because the event statistics are gathered from single ship situations and it is challenging to model all human decisions that could be made in an autopilot logic apart from the probability of allision the methodology also enables estimations of the design energy the structure needs to withstand this is possible since the kinetic energy just before the allision is captured for all simulated allisions the remainder of the paper is structured as follows chapter 2 presents the overall methodology including a brief description of the ship manoeuvre simulator chapter 3 introduces the simulation scenarios in the study which have been defined for verification and demonstration purposes of the methodology the event statistics used in these scenarios are presented in chapter 4 a presentation of the simulation setup in the ship manoeuvre simulator are presented in chapter 5 together with the case study area followed by results and discussions of the analyses in chapter 6 the conclusions are presented in chapter 7 2 methodology the methodology in the study integrates modern simulation and analysis tools to ensure safe and robust designs when new bridges that span over waterways are built it should be noted that it can also be used to assess existing bridges if they fulfil today s design and safety criteria or if mitigation actions need to be activated this is justified since the majority of the bridges that exist were built several decades ago they were designed based on the marine traffic that was present at that time considering an extrapolation of its increase and the ideas of which ships that would be built in the future it is likely that the assumptions that formed the basis for safety factors in the bridge design are not aligned with today s marine traffic situation and sizes of ships one similar example where the design criteria had become obsolete is the design of the twin towers of the world trade centre in new york usa and the attack they were subjected to on september 11 2001 the two towers were designed and constructed in the 1960s to withstand an airplane crash however 40 years later both the size of the aircrafts and the amount of fuel they carry had increased significantly more than expected in the scenarios they were designed to withstand el naby et al 2014 the methodology in this study has three major parts collection of ais data analysis of ais data for event definition and modelling and modelling and simulation of events in a ship manoeuvre simulator the ais data are used to collect both event and general traffic statistics based on the event statistics different event models are proposed to be used as input to the simulator where the evolvement of events is simulated and analysed it should be noted that one advantage of using a ship manoeuvre simulator is that not all of the events that are introduced or triggered actually lead to an accident the simulator can thus help us to understand why some events did not result in an accident it can be used in investigations as forensic analysis of accidents that actually happened or it can be used to simulate and analyse the consequence of mitigation actions a schematic of the methodology is shown in fig 1 see chapter 3 for more details how the ais data are investigated and chapter 5 for more details and a presentation of the simulation setup in fig 7 2 1 ship manoeuvre simulator the seaman ship manoeuvre simulator which was developed by sspa http www sspa se was used in this study the simulator is a software code where the ship s motions are modelled in all six degrees of freedom it is a module based software where the definition of the ship model s characteristics is divided into subsystems e g the hull engine propeller and rudder the simulator includes spatial temporal subsystems and numerical codes that calculate the forces acting on the ship that are induced by the wind waves and currents shallow water and bank effects are also considered andreasson et al 2005 ottosson and bystrom 1991 total force equilibrium of the ship model is solved in a nonlinear mathematical model in every time step according to a procedure presented in ottosson 1994 a seaman ship model requires several hundreds of parameters to accurately represent a ship and its characteristics in the simulator a ship s hydrodynamics and resistance properties can be fine tuned if test data are available from model testing when new models are defined in the simulator a procedure for parameter sensitivity study of the ship model s parameters is always carried out for example to ensure that the manoeuvrability of the ships used in this study was correctly modelled in seaman each ship model was simulated and verified against the zig zag and turning circle tests from the imo s standards for ship manoeuvrability imo 2002 running these tests in a simulation context have also been applied by others like budak and beji 2020 who used the tests to ensure the ship s manoeuvrability while implementing a course keeping autopilot fig 2 presents a screen shot from a simulation when the simulator is run in desktop mode in real time it can also be run in batch mode with an autopilot navigating the ship according to a pre defined route failure event or simulation scenario determined by the user the batch mode was used in this study since it significantly reduced the simulation time and there was no need to survey the simulations in real time on a screen it was also a necessity because of the large number of simulations carried out using the monte carlo method see chapters 5 and 6 3 definition and identification of failure events using ais simulation and analysis of ship accidents and their causes can be carried out in multiple ways pedersen 1995 2020 proposed a method based on the work of fujii 1983 and macduff 1974 in this method situations are defined that can result in an accident an approach that has been applied by among others montewka et al 2012 and goerlandt and kujala 2011 pedersen s situation based approach can be efficiently used in mathematical models that do not involve or need a ship manoeuvring simulator or detailed modelling of the ship s motions and dynamics however one shortcoming is that it relies on historical events accidents and data for known traffic situations and ships which often are related to very low probabilities and hence the method is sensitive to the access to and quality of data chen et al 2019 the advantage of the approach is that analyses can be made with low modelling and computation efforts which often are suitable in risk analyses that involve the monte carlo method the ship manoeuvre simulator presented in chapter 2 was used in this study instead of pedersen s approach the advantage of the simulator approach is that it opens up new possibilities to simulate assess and execute risk analysis of existing and future marine traffic situations that may involve infrastructure offshore the gain of this approach is that specific details of the trace from event to accident can be obtained and analysed this includes data of ship types weather situations ship operation profiles fairway layouts and infrastructure objects which can be modelled and systematically varied in parametric studies it does not need an explicit value or expression of the causation factor which is required in pedersen s approach the drawback is that it requires some more modelling and computation efforts but the simulator software used in this study offers batch mode simulations to overcome the challenge in addition instead of defining and analysing accidents three types of events are identified in the study as relevant and critical for ship bridge allisions in relatively narrow waterways drifting of the ship sharp turning of a ship and miss of a turning point they are similar to the categorisation presented in ulusçu et al 2009 van dorp and merrick 2011 and rassmusen et al 2012 see a discussion in chapter 6 4 for other types of events the ais data of the marine traffic in the area are needed to model simulate and analyse the events since 2002 ships larger than 300 gross tonnes must have an ais transponder which means that this information has been available after 2002 ais messages are separated in two message types position report and metadata message raymond 2019 at sea every ship issues a position report every 2 10 s depending on the ship s speed and turning rate in this study this information is handled both as single points and after post processing as trajectories defined by multiple points and represented by lines connecting similar points the trajectories then contain data from both the position reports and the metadata messages data and are stored in a postgresql database with the spatial extension postgis for more details about how the trajectories were constructed with a douglas peucker compression see hörteborn et al 2019 or a similar method presented in zhao and shi 2019 and wei et al 2020 the following subchapters present how ais data were used to quantify frequencies and durations for the three events of drifting ship sharp turning ship and miss of turning point each subchapter ends with a summary of how the simulation of the event was implemented in the simulator s autopilot in short the event identification using ais data was carried out in two steps first an automatic filter with specified conditions that helped define an event was applied to the ais trajectories followed by a second manual step applied to the remaining tracks that could not be identified as a clear event among the three categories events identified by the ais data were also used in the process of calibrating the autopilot s behaviour for example related to the time to turn off the steering system and lock the rudder s position 3 1 event drifting ship the drifting ship event is defined as a ship that appears to drift with the waves the wind and the current with no possibility to turn on its engine it is assumed that the probability that the drifting ship event will occur is the same along the fairway see furnes and amdahl 1980 rasmussen et al 2012 and kaneko 2012 the ais data were used to identify drifting ships by following the ais trajectories and applying the following criteria as filters speed over ground sog should be less than 2 knots course over ground cog should differ more than 20 from the heading duration longer than 5 min each candidate ship that fulfilled these criteria was manually checked to ensure that there were no obvious reasons for their drifting behaviour which would then result in the candidate being removed from the sample examples of such candidates that should be excluded as drifting ships are slow steaming ships and ships that intervene with other ships e g ships that pickup pilots or change crew the duration of the event for a drifting ship was defined by the position report where the ship started to lose speed or its last known position to the position report where the ship recovered control and started to either pick up speed again or anchored in the simulator a drifting ship is modelled as fully operational for the first 60 s in a simulation case whereafter the propulsion system is turned off at this instant the ship begins to lose speed and the autopilot tries to keep the ship s course on track for as long as possible this setup correlates with the most common ship behaviours from ais data observations from the ship traffic studied in chapter 4 complete blackout including the steering engine was not observed the simulation in the simulator continues for the duration of the event which can either be the duration as measured from ais data see above from a pre defined time by the user when the propulsion system is turned on again or when the ship is anchored in this study the first option was used fig 3 shows an example from a comparison of results from a simulator simulation green ship contours and the real ais track grey ship contours for the same case of a drifting ship this example shows that the simulator almost replicates the ais track 3 2 event sharp turning ship the sharp turning ship event is defined as a ship that may suffer from a malfunction in the rudder giving rise to a locked rudder that turns the ship distinctly to starboard or port see pedersen et al 2020 for the category iii type of accident for a similar situation or event in the current study it is assumed that when this event occurs the ship decreases its speed to gain time to repair fix the rudder problem when the ship s speed decreases and there is no rudder effect that can be controlled by the crew it looks as if the ship is drifting in the ais data thus the principles and filters used to identify drifting ships can initially be applied to identify candidates for the current event to distinguish this event from the event drifting ship the following complementary criteria are used a ship that continuously loses its speed without an instant sharp turn is categorised as a candidate for the event drifting ship a ship that starts its drifting with an instant turn and has a rudder malfunction is categorised as a candidate for the event sharp turning ship the duration of the sharp turning ship event for a ship was defined by the position reported where the ship started to turn sharply to the position reported where the ship recovered control and started to either pick up speed again or anchored modelling this event in the simulator is challenging since in reality the crew of a ship will react and act differently in each scenario to a malfunction of the rudder nevertheless the simulator setup to simulate this event is in the study is defined as a fully operational ship the first 60 s of the simulation case whereafter the rudder is set to either full starboard or full port after another 60 s in the simulation the engine is turned off and after another 5 min the rudder is assumed functional again and set to mid ship position this sequence times and behaviours were determined from the authors experiences from analyses of ais data parametric studies in the simulator and attempts to mimic real events in the simulator s environment fig 4 shows an example from a comparison of results from a simulator simulation green ship contours and the real ais track red ship contours for the same case of a sharp turning ship the turn is initiated with constant speed indicating that it is a sharp turning point event and not a case of loss of propulsion i e drifting event this example shows that the simulator almost replicates the ais track for this event 3 3 event miss of turning point the miss of turning point event is defined as a ship that continues straight ahead passing a marked or expected turning point but manages to correct its course later to the main navigation lane see pedersen et al 2020 for the category ii type of accident for a similar situation or event the event is exemplified in fig 5 where the blue line shows a ship traveling from south west to north east failing to follow the expected normal traffic behaviour the ship passes through the border line 3 of the traffic separation scheme tss after some time the mistake is observed and the ship turns back to the main navigation lane of the fairway the reason for the occurrence of this event can have various root causes such as fatigued crew falling asleep rudder stuck mid ship human errors during navigation etc the ais data were used to identify miss of turning point ships by following the ais trajectories and applying the following criteria as filters here presented related to the example in fig 5 the ship should cross the pre defined tss border lines i e the border lines 1 3 and 4 in fig 5 the cog should differ less than 5 between the crossing of lines 1 and 3 the sog should differ less than 1 knot between the crossing of lines 1 and 3 similar to the other event categories every ship that fulfilled these criteria was manually checked to ensure that there were no obvious or other reasons for its behaviour and choice of path for example a ship with a distance smaller than its own ship domain to another ship was excluded since its path could have been affected by the other ship i e intentional and voluntary miss of turning point to avoid an incident the definition of the size of the ship domain followed the method presented in hörteborn et al 2019 the duration of the miss of turning point event for a ship was defined by the position of the expected turning point and the position reported where the ship actually turned the expected turning point here is the point where the majority of all ships turn to follow the tss see line 2 in fig 5 which marks when ships are supposed to make the turn in the example modelling this event in the simulator was done in the case study as follows the ship is run as expected during the initial 2 min of the simulation in order to ensure that it is on the correct navigation path after that the autopilot is turned off and the rudder is locked in mid ship position and remains so for the remaining time duration of the event 4 event statistics this chapter present event statistics and durations for the events defined in chapter 3 the case study presented in chapters 5 and 6 emphasises the great belt vts area however in this chapter the statistics and analyses of the tss bornholmsgat area and the results reported in rasmussen et al 2012 are included for comparison purposes the ais data were based on the marine traffic in the great belt vts and tss bornholmsgat areas during the period 2014 to 2019 obtained from dma 2020 the data were analysed with the methodology presented in chapter 3 rasmussen et al 2012 presented their results for human failure in the kadetrenden area using ais data from 2007 to 2010 and their statistics for loss of propulsion and steering machine failure were based on four years of incident reports from the great belt vts 4 1 event frequencies it assumed that the probability of occurrence and the duration of the events defined in chapter 3 are independent of ship type and size in total 153 events were identified in the great belt vts and tss bornholmsgat areas using the event identification methods described in chapter 3 table 1 presents a summary of the number of events for each event category together with the number of sailing hours that were used to identify the drifting ship and sharp turning ship two waypoints in these areas were used to define the event miss of turning point and the number of turns at these waypoints are also presented in the table the frequency for drifting ship and sharp turning ship was calculated by dividing the number of events with the number of sailing hours the miss of turning point frequency was calculated by dividing the number of events with the number of ships making the turn these frequencies together with the data from rasmussen et al 2012 are shown in table 2 the event frequency for drifting ship is in same order of magnitude in the three studies the values for the great belt vts and rasmussen et al 2012 show very good agreement thus the method described in chapter 3 1 for this event was considered verified the lower value for the great belt vts area compared to the tss bornholmsgat area is due to the ships in the former area being able to manoeuvre more easily and safely and anchor outside the fairway if they experience minor trouble such as a partial blackout it should be noted that with the event identification method presented in chapter 3 1 it is not possible to differentiate these events from planned anchoring in the case study in chapter 5 simulations and analyses of the great belt vts area this event s frequency was set to 0 65 10 4 hour the event frequency for sharp turning ship differs some between the different studies however only two cases were identified for the two studies in the great belt vts area which are too few to rely on when generating statistics it was assumed that the value of this event s frequency should be somewhat lower than the average value from the three studies it was set to 0 070 10 4 hour a sensitivity analysis in which this event s frequency is increased 50 percent is presented in chapter 6 4 the event frequency for miss of turning point shows relatively good conformity between the three studies the value from rasmussen et al 2012 is instead of calculating the event frequency in terms of occurrences per turn based on human failure and event frequency per hour as the unit based on the same reasons as for the drifting ship event an event frequency of 1 55 10 4 turn was used in the simulations and analyses in chapter 5 however it should be noted the duration time of the event was found to be notably different between these three studies see the following chapter for the analysis 4 2 event durations the definition of the duration of each event was defined in chapter 3 fig 6 presents a summary of the durations for the drifting ship and sharp turning ship event categories the symbols in the figure represent results from the ais data processing while the lines represent fitted curves according to the distributions presented in table 3 for the former category the results are presented separately for the great belt vts the tss bornholmsgat and rasmussen et al 2012 for the sharp turning ship event there were too few cases in the great belt vts and the tss bornholmsgat areas to make a distribution to overcome this was six event durations from a third area the kiel canal included to make this distribution this area is discussed in chapter 6 5 however the event had similar durations in all areas so they were fitted to one common distribution representing the event the results in the figure show that the duration of the drifting ship event is the shortest in the great belt vts area it can be explained by the fact that this area offers the best opportunity to anchor the event category miss of turning point is not included in the figure but its statistical distributions are presented in table 3 4 3 accident statistics in the areas collection of accident statistics in the great belt vts area was emphasised since this area was used in the simulator case study in chapter 5 three sources were used to ensure that the majority of accidents reported between 2010 and 2019 in the area were collected in the accident records of ihs fairplay 2020 five strandings two collisions one contact and one fire accident were reported in addition to these accidents the norwegian maritime authority sjofartsdirektoratet 2020 reported one fire accident and no additional accidents were found reported in the emcip database emcip 2020 5 description of simulator simulations and case study the chapter presents a case study where the seaman simulator was used to simulate and analyse the marine traffic situation in the great belt vts area chapter 5 1 presents how the simulator simulations were planned and setup followed by specific details and descriptions of the case study in chapter 5 2 5 1 simulator simulations and setup the simulations in the seaman simulator were run in sets where each set contained 90 batches of simulations the 90 batches were based on three event categories 15 types of ships and two directions of ship routes see chapter 3 for event categorisation and chapter 5 2 for ship types and route directions specific for the case study marine traffic situation the number of simulations in each batch for the drifting ship and sharp turning ship events was calculated using eq 2 2 n s i m i j 1 15 k 1 2 p f t i n c a t j k t n j k y r where n sim i is the number of simulations for event i 1 drifting ship 2 sharp turning ship p ft i is the event probability per hour for the event under study see event frequency in chapter 4 1 n cat j k is the estimated number of ships per year for ship type j on a route k in the area t n j k is the average time ship type j sails on the route k and y r is the number of repetitions of one year s traffic the simulation should represent the starting position of a ship in a simulation for an event varied between the simulations it was assumed that the starting position of a ship i e its position in the fairway when the simulation starts follows the traffic separation scheme and spatially follows an even distribution along the route the distance between starting positions d sp ijk was calculated according to eq 3 where n sim i was calculated according to eq 2 where l r k is the length of the simulated route 3 d s p i j k l r k n s i m i the number of simulations in each batch for the miss of turning point event i 3 was calculated using eq 4 4 n s i m i j 1 15 k 1 2 p c s a i n c a t j k n t j k y r where p csa i is the probability that a ship misses a turn and n t jk is the number of turns the ship j makes on its route k according to chapter 3 3 these simulations started 2 min prior to the point where the turn was missed a turning point was laterally distributed in accordance with their unique route the majority of the simulator simulations ended without ship grounding or ship bridge allision however for the simulations that ended with an allision the allision energy was calculated according to eq 5 where m is the ship s displacement v the ship speed and e is the allision energy note that this is the largest theoretical energy that may cause damage to the ship and the bridge structures since the formula is simplistic it does not include detailed energy distribution which could be studied by external dynamics simulations see yu et al 2016 and lu et al 2016 5 e m v 2 2 a central part of the presented methodology is the bridge design criteria according to johansen and askeland 2019 there are different ways to interpret these criteria where the authors proposed to use of an fn curve to better represent both the probability and the consequence in this study a risk criterion with a threshold of 1 10 3 was selected which means that a bridge struck by a ship should withstand and survive allisions with a probability level of 1 10 3 the procedure to identify ships that follow this criterion was as follows the allision energies from a complete simulation set in the simulator were sorted from the highest to lowest the probability for the worst allision in the same set of simulations is then 1 y r and the second worst or worse has a probability of occurring 2 y r for this analogy with simulator simulations of y r 10 000 times the 10th worst allision corresponds to the worst allision that has the highest probability to occur in 1 000 years if y r is increased to 100 000 the 100th worst allision corresponds to the allision energy with a probability to occur corresponding to 1 10 3 the seaman simulator has two major parts in the simulator model a model of the ship and a model of the environment called world fig 7 presents a schematic of the parameters of these models that have either been deterministic d or randomly generated mc in monte carlo simulations the deterministic parameters were the three batch parameters i e event categories ship types and direction on route and the seven randomly generated parameters were described by statistical distributions 5 2 case study the great belt vts area the chapter presents the case study area in detail it is presented from which the values and settings of the parameters lateral offset route ship ship speeds and environmental variables were collected the properties of the events were presented in chapter 3 and their durations in chapter 4 2 the great belt vts was chosen as the case study area since it has been studied by other researchers from a ship bridge allision perspective for an example see gluver and olsen 1998 according to statistics in accident databases numerous groundings in the area have been reported during the past few years emsa 2019 and historic ais data are available for the area dma 2020 fig 8 presents a map of the marine traffic passing the area and fig 9 presents histograms of the distribution in ship length ship speed and lateral distribution for the marine traffic that passed the great belt bridge during 2019 the marine traffic is spread laterally over the fairway which according to iala 2014 can be represented by the normal distribution in this study this distribution is checked updated at every waypoint for all traffic in 2019 since the properties of the distribution may vary in the fairway here called offset by means of the offset normal distributions indicated as lateral offsetmc in fig 7 a unique route could be generated for each simulator simulation most of the traffic that passes the area follows the south north t route it is divided into a deep water route and a normal route see fig 8 statistics of the marine traffic in the area during 2019 shows that 19 507 ships passed under the great belt bridge divided into 7 225 general cargo ships 5 242 tanker ships 2 094 ropax roro ships 1 488 container ships 1 484 bulk carriers and 1 974 unknown ship types the length distribution of each ship type is presented in fig 10 the results in the figure were used to define 15 representative ships in the simulator that together reflected the marine traffic in the area during 2019 table 4 presents some of the ships specifics ship speed normally distributed speedsmc in fig 7 and the number of ships going north and south n cat in eqs 2 and 4 the three largest ships with regards to draught bulk 226 m tanker 241 m tanker 260 m used the deep water route in fig 8 all other ships use the normal route 5 3 metocean statistics for the great belt vts area the metocean statistics for the area were downloaded from the copernicus marine service 2020 the wind statistics for the period 2015 to 2020 are presented in fig 11 as a wind rose plot for the location latitude 55 25 and longitude 11 0 the current statistics for the period 2016 to 2020 are presented in fig 12 as a current rose plot for the location latitude 55 2 and longitude 11 0 the data in the rose plots are used to define the wind and current loads in the simulator model see fig 7 the length of a colour bar in fig 11 indicates the probability of a specific wind speed and wind direction for example the wind directions around 11 percent of the time are from the south west where the wind speed is 2 5 percent of the time less than 3 m s 6 percent of the time between 3 and 6 m s 3 percent of the time between 6 and 9 m s and less than 0 5 percent of the time it is faster than 9 m s the wind rose plot in fig 11 shows that the dominant wind directions are from the west and the south west and that the wind speed is often below 9 m s wind speeds larger than 9 m s come from the west and sometimes from the east but rarely from other directions the current rose plot in fig 12 shows that there are currents in the area that are dominated by the directions north north west and south south east forces from secondary waves induce drift forces on ships and waves up to 2 m have some effects on a ship s manoeuvrability chillcce and el moctar 2018 the probability to encounter different wave heights in the range 0 2 5 m in the area is presented in fig 13 this figure show that the probability to encounter waves larger than 1 5 m is very low i e waves have a minor effect on a ship s manoeuvrability in the area hence it was assumed that waves could be disregarded in the simulator model which also reduce the computational efforts less simulation time to conclude the influence from wind and current have a great effect on the drift force and hence they were included in the simulator model which in this study was defined as a four degrees of freedom ship model heave and pitch were not considered 6 results the simulator runs were defined in three categories divided into ten simulation sets for i investigation of the influence from random seeds in the generation of random variables ii a sensitivity study of the parameters and iii demonstration of examples of risk mitigation see table 5 for an overview of all simulation sets the simulation of a single ship s voyage took approximately 2 s on an intel core i7 2600 3 4 ghz processor with 16 gb ram memory and 64bit architecture one set of simulations consist of some four million ship voyages which needed approximately 80 h to complete using eight processors the three sets 1a 1b and 1c relate to the random seed study they have the same input but the random seed for the generation of random variables mc in fig 7 is varied which resulted in different values of the random variables hence by defining the random seed a simulation could be reproduced ensuring that new combinations of random variables were generated harris et al 2020 the number of simulations needed in the set was determined by a criterion defined in this study stating that the difference in allision energy between the simulation sets should not differ more than five percent the five sets in 2 4 in table 5 were defined for sensitivity study analysis purposes in which the probabilities and duration time of the events were studied the input data were based on the tss bornholmsgat area one set investigated the increased probability and duration time of the event drifting ship and another set investigated a fifty percent increase in probability of the event sharp turning ship the miss of turning point event was separated into three sets increase of both probability and duration time increase of only the probability and increase of only the duration time sets 5 and 6 were defined and used in examples of risk mitigation to demonstrate how the methodology presented in the study can be utilised in set 5 a speed limitation of 12 knots was enforced and in set 6 the navigation path was altered to force the traffic to navigate 2 6 nautical miles straight prior to the great belt bridge instead of 1 6 nautical miles which is the normal navigation path 6 1 analysis of the number of simulated traffic years yr sets 1a 1b and 1c were used to investigate how many traffic years y r need to be simulated according to the discussion in chapter 5 1 table 6 presents the results from the simulator simulations with y r 10 000 traffic years or repetitions of one year there is a difference in the number of groundings and allisions because of the different random seeds which also affects the maximum allision energy and the 1 000 year allision energy for each simulation set as described in chapter 5 1 the 1 000 year allision energy represents the worst allision that has a probability of 1 10 3 to occur because the 1 000 year allision energy differs more than 30 percent between the sets y r was too low and was increased to 100 000 the results from these simulations are presented in table 7 they show that the number of groundings is on average 50 887 this gives a probability of 0 51 groundings per year which compared to the accident statistics for the area demonstrates a good agreement since five groundings were reported during a ten year period see chapter 4 3 the average number of allisions is 721 which gives a probability of 0 007 allisions per year or one allision every 139 years the 1 000 year allision energy shows some difference between the sets but the deviation is less than five percent which is acceptable the average allision energy was calculated to 1 624 mj which represents a 178 m tanker with 57 870 dwt at ship speed 14 6 knots 6 2 analysis of the duration time parameter fig 14 presents the results from an analysis of all simulations in simulation set 1a in table 7 emphasising the influence from the parameter duration time in the three event categories the green line represents the distribution of all simulations while the blue dotted and the red dashed lines represent the distributions for the events that ended in grounding or allision accidents respectively the results show that the duration time in the drifting ship event had a small influence compared to the overall distribution and probability that lead to an allision the duration time had a minor influence on the sharp turning ship event results but there was a large effect with regard to the miss of turning point event simulations with a longer duration time show a larger probability for grounding and allision accidents the miss of turning point thus shows the highest probability for a grounding or allision accident fig 15 presents the results from simulation set 1a to illustrate the paths of ships that collided with the bridge using the methodology presented in this study and these results it is possible to propose and analyse mitigation actions that can help reduce or possibly avoid ship bridge allisions 6 3 analysis of two mitigation methods two mitigations were analysed by simulation sets 5 and 6 reduction of maximum allowed ship speed and change of point where ships should make an earlier turn change navigation path to pass under the bridge respectively these two mitigation options were included to showcase possibilities with the methodology they were designed based on similar ship fairway bridge crossings the results presented in table 8 show that both these actions have a positive effect on reducing the number of accidents the reason why the allision energy is significantly reduced is simply because many of the allision cases in set 1a did not occur for the miss of turning point event which formerly gave the largest collision energies it should be noted that the suggested mitigation actions have not been confirmed as realistic measures to be enforced in the area however with the methodology presented in this study it is shown that they are worth investigating further especially if marine traffic density and ship sizes continue to increase in the area this is also supported by pedersen et al 2020 who recommended doing scenario based simulations as a preparation for future changes and estimations of ship traffic situations and risk assessments 6 4 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity study analysis was carried out to investigate how the probabilities and duration time parameters from the simulation sets affect the results except for 1b 1c 5 and 6 those sets were excluded because there was no need to include all the random seed simulation sets or the simulation sets that were defined for the mitigation study the results are presented in table 9 simulation sets 2 and 4 were based on the event statistics from the tss bornholmsgat area set 2 has a higher probability for drifting ship compared to simulation set 1a this increased the number of groundings and allisions by about 25 percent it did not however affect the 1 000 year allision energy set 3 has a 50 percent higher probability for sharp turning ship compared to simulation set 1a which also showed a minor increase in the number of groundings and allisions but no influence on the 1 000 year allision energy for the miss of turning point in set 4a the case study simulations show that this event has the largest influence and is thereby the most sensitive to the results the increase of probability and duration were separated into 4b and 4c to further investigate this event type and its effect on the result an increase of only the event probability from 1 55 10 4 to 2 1 10 4 raised the number of allisions caused by miss of turning point from 0 25 percent per year to 0 32 percent per year and the expected 1 000 year allision energy by approximate 13 percent however an increase of the average duration from 0 064 h to 0 19 h affected the number of allisions by 2 900 percent and the expected 1 000 year allision energy by 251 percent a comparison between the allision energy from sets 4c and 1a is illustrated in fig 16 an allision energy of approximately 4 268 mj represents a 260 m tanker with 164 820 dwt at ship speed 14 knots or a larger tanker with 237 100 dwt at ship speed 12 knots the results in fig 16 show that some of the results are sensitive to the value of the parameter duration time especially for the event miss of turning point this has not been studied in detail in similar investigations and models within the same research area e g goerlandt and kujala 2011 hansen et al 2013 van dorp and merrick 2011 it is recommended that a stronger emphasis should be placed on this parameter in future work as the manner which the duration time varies for different ship traffic areas ship types and sizes should be studied in more depth 6 5 applicability of proposed methodology in chapter 4 the methods described in chapter 3 were used to obtain event statistics in two areas these areas have their differences when it comes to geography however they are both considered to be open sea and have well defined sailing paths partly regulated by tss another area with well defined sailing paths is the kiel canal the methods to identify events were applied in this area as well but it was concluded that the methods were not applicable here with the assumption that all the events led to accidents and that all the accidents here were reported the accidents from 2017 reported to ihs fairplay and emcip were studied the records give a higher frequency here for the loss of propulsion and rudder failure but they are in the same magnitude as in the areas included in this paper although it should also be noted that rudder failures in the accident records include more types of events than described in chapter 3 2 there are other events that were not investigated in the study that could result in an allision one example of such an event is cowboy ships which was introduced by pyman et al 1983 the event defines ships that do not follow the intended navigation path and make turns at wrong locations in the fairway and traffic scheme the cause behind the event could be crew captains influenced by alcohol malfunction of navigation aids acts of terrorism etc this type of event was excluded from the study since no method was found to model identify and quantify the event another example of event that was not considered in the study is the category iv scenario proposed in pedersen et al 1995 2020 which refers to a ship that makes an evasive manoeuvre because of another ship near a bridge this event was not considered in the study for the same reasons as the cowboy ship event compared to previous research and methods in e g ulusçu et al 2009 van dorp and merrick 2011 and goerlandt and kujala 2011 the proposed methodology includes calculation of the hydrodynamic forces it also contains methods for obtaining local event failure frequencies and durations the study has demonstrated that the proposed methodology can be applied to allision case studies while other models in the literature often emphasize open sea and coastal areas finally a difference between the proposed methodology and equation based models e g pedersen 1995 2020 is that the probability and consequence of an event are analysed together instead of separately the proposed methodology can be used both to analyse the risk of existing bridges and in the planning phase of new bridges the risk defined in eq 1 has the terms accumulated probability and consequence which were also analysed for each simulation case in the methodology this definition of risk and the way to present accumulated probability in fig 16 is similar to johansen and askeland 2019 who used an fn curve as the design criterion for bridge design note that the fn curve has the number of fatalities on the x axis and fig 16 has the allision energy in future research the allision energy could be translated to damages to the bridge and thereafter converted to number of fatalities 7 conclusions the study presented a methodology using ais data a ship manoeuvring simulator and the monte carlo method to calculate the accident probabilities in marine traffic near bridges spanning over wide waterways the methodology was verified in a case study on grounding accidents and its wider applicability was presented in a case study where the probability of ship bridge allisions was calculated with the proposed methodology ships and traffic situations that were over represented in the failure event analyses in the case study s marine traffic area were numerically shown and mitigation actions were proposed that can reduce the probability of ship bridge allisions ships that represent the 1 000 year allision energy were identified which can be used as target ships in bridge structural strength assessments and whose kinetic energy impact a bridge must withstand an event based approach was proposed for the identification of events that should be simulated and analysed if they can lead to a maritime accident this is based on an analysis of ais data of the traffic separation scheme of the area of interest event detection criteria for three events drifting ship sharp turning ship and miss of turning point were proposed the marine traffic areas great belt vts and tss bornholmsgat were analysed to estimate the event frequency the results were compared with results in rasmussen et al 2012 and there was good agreement for the drifting ship and miss of turning point events for the sharp turning ship event too few events in the ais data were found to form representative statistical conclusions the great belt vts area was used in a verification study that confirmed that the methodology could predict the probability of ship groundings corresponding to the accident statistics from the past ten years in the same area it was concluded that the presented methodology can be used to simulate and analyse traffic situation schemes in costal waterways to calculate the probability that a ship accident will occur the ship bridge allision case study of the great belt bridge showed in a sensitivity study that the parameter duration time of an event has a large influence on the results it is thus recommended to carry out a parametric sensitivity study of this parameter in the current case study it was shown to have a relatively large influence especially on the miss of turning point event and the subsequent way the ship s situation in the simulator runs evolved a sensitivity study of the number of simulated traffic years showed that 100 000 traffic years were required to satisfy the convergence criterion defined in the study the probability for a ship allision against the great belt bridge was calculated to be 0 007 an analysis of all ship bridge allision cases showed that it was dominated by the drifting ship event the expected allision energy for the 1 000 year allision was calculated to be 1 624 mj which can be represented by a 178 m tanker with 57 870 dwt and ship speed 14 6 knots however if the duration of the event miss of turning point was increased to the same duration as in the tss bornholmsgat the expected allision energy for a 1 000 year allision was increased to 4 268 mj which can be represented by a 260 m tanker with 164 820 dwt at ship speed 14 knots or a larger tanker with 237 100 dwt at ship speed 12 knots two mitigation actions were studied change of the traffic separation scheme and limitation of the ship speed both of these actions will give the crew more time to act and react in case they lose the manoeuvrability of the ship hence the probability of an allision was reduced the methodology presented in the study and its results show that it can be applied either in the planning phase of a new bridge over a waterway if the ais data in the area are known or in the assessment of marine traffic situations near existing bridges where the marine traffic may have changed since they were designed and built the methodology is not limited to ship bridge allisions it can also be used to assess the probability of collisions with other infrastructures offshore or other marine accidents such as ship groundings the event failure probability can be included directly in other navigational risk assessment methods to assess the risk of collision when vessels are close to each other in future research the methodology should be developed to include multiple ships in the simulation models and implement active decision support how other ships can meet and interact more safely in fairways which high traffic density this extension of the simulation methodology would offer a possibility to simulate and analyse the probabilities and consequences of ship ship collisions credit authorship contribution statement axel hörteborn conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis data curation investigation writing

20502,as a new type of bridge foundation in deep water the composite caisson piles foundation ccpf is inevitability suffered from multiple hazards such as earthquake scouring and erosion especially for sea crossing bridges in ocean environment in this study a simplified method in time domain is proposed for predicting the nonlinear kinematic seismic response of ccpf and the effect of scouring on the seismic response is investigated the proposed method is verified by the results of centrifuge shaking table tests it is found that compared with frequency domain method the proposed time domain method can give good estimations of the acceleration and the displacement of the ccpf especially at high frequencies moreover the kinematic seismic response of ccpf designed for the qiongzhou strait bridge is analyzed the results indicate that the proposed model can effectively simulate the soil nonlinearity and the soil nonlinearity significantly affects the kinematic seismic response of ccpf especially the acceleration and displacement time histories finally the scouring effect is considered by an analytical model and the performance of the ccpf under combined earthquake and scouring is

there are two potential foundation types proposed in the pre design of qs bridge including single caisson foundation and composite caisson piles foundation ccpf as shown in fig 1 tu et al 2020a zhang et al 2019 zhong and huang 2013 the main reason choosing caisson foundation as a candidate is its convenience of underwater construction and rich experience in sea crossing or river crossing bridges such as akashi kaikyo bridge in japan san francisco oakland bay bridge in usa and taizhou yangtze river bridge in china however considering the complicated deep water environment at the construction site ccpf is also considered as an innovative solution to overcome the lack of ultra deep sinking methods ccpf comprises of a caisson in the upper part and grouped piles in the lower part with the benefit of the piles the height or the embedded depth of the caisson can be effectively reduced which can significantly reduce the construction difficulty as shown in fig 1 for ccpf used in a sea crossing bridge two natural hazards earthquake and scouring should be fully considered in engineering design and analysis the seismic response of ccpf is an important issue when the bridge locates in a seismic zone e g the qs bridge locates in the seismic zone along the southeast coast of china many works have been done on the seismic response of caisson foundation using laboratory tests finite element modeling and theoretical analyses gerolymos and gazetas 2006 zafeirakos and gerolymos 2013 chang et al 2014 qin et al 2019 kaynia et al 2019 gaudio and rampello 2019 2021 conducted a series of 3d finite element analyses in the time domain to evaluate the nonlinear seismic performance of bridge piers on caisson foundations conti et al 2020 also performed 3d finite element modeling to analyze the seismic performance of bridge piers on caisson and pile foundations theoretical analyses have been widely used due to its simplicity and high computation efficiency tsigginos et al 2008 and varun et al 2009 developed an elastic model to analyze the seismic response of caisson foundation in frequency domain gerolymos and gazetas 2006 proposed a phenomenological winkler model to analyze the dynamic response of the caisson under horizontal excitation and this model can consider the nonlinearity of soil surrounding the caisson however it has not been further used to analyze the kinematic seismic response of caisson on the other hand a number of studies have been conducted to investigate the kinematic response of pile foundations fan et al 1991 mylonakis et al 1997 ahmad et al 2007 dezi et al 2009 anoyatis et al 2013 kaynia 2021 fan et al 1991 presented a set of kinematic interaction factors of pile foundations as a function of dimensionless frequency which can be readily applied to the frequency domain analysis anoyatis et al 2013 discussed the kinematic response of pile foundations in a homogeneous soil under different boundary conditions at the pile head and tip compared with traditional caisson foundation and pile foundation ccpf is a new type of deep water foundation and relevant studies are relatively few zhong and huang 2014a proposed a simplified method to study the seismic response of ccpf structure system based on the dynamic winkler model in frequency domain the frequency domain method is an efficient method and simple in computing it should be noted that the soil surrounding the foundation in zhong and huang 2014a was assumed to be elastic due to the limitation of the frequency domain method however it is well agreed that the actual soil always exhibits nonlinear characteristics under earthquakes therefore time domain method is needed to consider the nonlinear behavior of the soil around the foundation in earthquakes it is well known that the seismic response of foundation structure is intrinsically related to the kinematic interaction between soils and foundations zhang et al 2018 mylonakis and gazetas 2002 therefore it is essential to investigate the kinematic seismic response of the bridge foundation for better understanding the dynamic characteristics of the whole bridge huang et al 2018 proposed a time domain method to analyze the lateral dynamic response of ccpf which provides a helpful guidance for the earthquake design however the soil nonlinearity was considered by p y curves actually a more reasonable method for describing the soil nonlinear characteristics should be proposed from the perspective of the nonlinear soil stress strain curves moreover the scouring effect on the dynamic response of foundation has not been analyzed in huang et al 2018 generally bridge foundations are exposed to water waves and flows in deep water environment and it has been widely recognized that scouring around the foundation develops with times the field monitoring data shows that the maximum local scour depth of caisson foundation i e length width height 58 2 m 44 1 m 76 m embedded depth 55 m of taizhou yangtze river bridge is 17 4 m after one year chen 2010 it can be inferred that the ccpf located in qiongzhou strait is inevitably affected by the scouring due to the complex ocean environment statistics show that more than half of the bridge damages are related to the scour around the foundation peng et al 2019 lagasse and richardson 2001 this is an important challenge for the design and construction of the bridge foundation generally the scour effect can be considered as the loss of overburden stress resulted from the scour hole around the foundation the shape of scour hole around the bridge foundation is usually simplified as a plane distribution in theoretical analyses zhang et al 2017 which means that the soil is simply removed layer by layer however the plane distribution mode is inconsistent with the phenomenon observed in laboratory tests or engineering practice wang et al 2017 meanwhile many previous studies indicate that the dynamic characteristics of the foundation will be significantly affected by the dimensions of scour hole around the foundation liang et al 2018 2020 lin and wu 2019 therefore the scour hole dimensions should be reasonably considered in the analysis in order to better reflect the scour effect on the dynamic characteristics of the foundation the objective of this paper is to investigate the kinematic seismic response of the potential types of foundation for qs bridge and to analyze the change of the kinematic seismic response of the foundation after scour firstly a simplified analytical method in time domain for calculating the seismic response of the ccpf is proposed in which the nonlinearity of the soil around the ccpf is properly considered the effectiveness of the proposed in calculating the dynamic responses of the ccpf is verified by the centrifuge shaking table test results secondly the kinematic seismic responses of the ccpf for the qs bridge are analyzed finally the scouring effect is considered by an analytical model and the performance of the ccpf under combined action of earthquake and scouring is investigated 2 nonlinear kinematic seismic analysis of ccpf fig 2 shows the schematic diagram of a ccpf subjected to seismic load to investigate the kinematic seismic response of the soil foundation system the analysis process can be divided into two parts free field motion and kinematic seismic response 2 1 free field motion subjected to vertical propagated s wave the free field motion which refers to the response of the ground without any foundation or excavation usually assumes that the vertical propagated s wave is the only incident seismic wave to simplify seismic excitation from the bedrock the soil medium is idealized as a discrete lumped mass system and the dynamic equilibrium equation of the free field soil subjected to a vertical propagated s waves can be given as hashash and park 2001 1 m u c u k u m i u g where u u and u are the soil acceleration velocity and displacement vectors respectively u g is the acceleration at the ground base and i is the unit vector m c and k are the mass the damping and the stiffness matrices of soil respectively the damping matrix c is determined by hashash and park 2002 2 c a 0 m a 1 k where a 0 and a 1 are scalar values which can be calculated using two significant natural modes i and j 3 ξ i ξ j 1 4 π 1 f i f i 1 f j f j a 0 a 1 where ξ i and ξ j are the damping ratios for the frequencies f i and f j for site response analysis the frequency of the selected mode can be computed as 4 f m 2 m 1 v s 4 h where f m is the natural frequency of the corresponding mode m v s is the average shear wave velocity of the soil and h is the total height of the soil hashash 2020 suggested selecting frequencies corresponding to the natural frequency of the soil column and 5 times the natural frequency of the soil column for calculation regarding the soil nonlinearity in the analysis the hardin drnevich model is used for the backbone of the nonlinear shear stress strain curve as hardin and drnevich 1972 5 τ γ 1 g 0 γ τ f where τ f is the shear stress at failure γ and g 0 are the shear strain and the initial shear modulus of soil respectively the masing s rule was adopted to simulate the hysteretic behavior of soil and the dynamic equilibrium can be solved by the newmark β method this computational process has been integrated into the one dimensional nonlinear site response analysis software deepsoil that we can directly use hashash 2020 2 2 kinematic seismic response of a caisson the kinematic seismic response of caisson can be calculated by the excitation of the displacement response of the soil based on a nonlinear dynamic winkler model as illustrated in fig 3 the caisson is considered as a rigid structure with a mass of m c a length of d a diameter of b and an embedded depth d the interaction between caisson and soil is modeled by a series of springs and dashpots around the foundation moreover investigations indicate that the foundation mass has a remarkable beneficial effect on the filtering action liang et al 2013 conti et al 2018 therefore the foundation mass was also included in the kinematic interaction and the dynamic equilibrium equation of a rigid massive caisson foundation excited by a vertical seismic motion based on the above mentioned model can be given as 6 m b u b θ b c b u b θ b k b u b θ b h e f f m e f f where the mass matrix m b the stiffness matrix k b and the damping matrix c b can be expressed as 7 m b m c m c h 1 m c h 1 j c m c h 1 2 8 k b k h h k h r k r h k r r k h c 0 d k x z d z 0 d k x z z d z 0 d k x z z d z k r c 0 d k x z z 2 d z 0 d k r z d z 9 c b c h h c h r c r h c r r c h c 0 d c x z d z 0 d c x z z d z 0 d c x z z d z c r c 0 d c x z z 2 d z 0 d c r z d z where j c is the inertia moment of the caisson h 1 is the height from the center of gravity of the foundation to the bottom and k x z k r z and c x z c r z are the coefficients of the lateral and rocking springs that simulate the dynamic properties of soil around the caisson respectively by integrating the soil layer thickness along the side wall of the caisson k b and c b could be obtained as huang et al 2018 10 k h h k h c i 1 n k x i d i 11 k h r k r h i 1 n k x i d i z i 12 k r r k r c i 1 n k x i d i z i 2 1 12 d i 2 k r i d 13 c h h c h c i 1 n c x i d i 14 c h r c r h i 1 n c x i d i z i 15 c r r c r c i 1 n c x i d i z i 2 1 2 d i 2 c r i d 16 z i d j 0 i 1 d j d i 2 where d i is the thickness of the ith soil layer i 1 n around the caisson z i is the distance from the ground surface to the center of the ith layer k xi c xi and k ri c ri are the coefficients of the lateral and rocking springs that simulate the dynamic properties of ith soil layer and k hc c hc and k rc c rc are the stiffness and damping coefficients of the lateral and rocking springs that simulate the dynamic properties of soil at the bottom of the caisson respectively the computational formula mentioned above can be found in appendix a here h eff and m eff are the resultant horizontal load and moment relative to the bottom center of the caisson which are caused by the free field motion of the soil considering the horizontal and rocking response under the excitation h eff and m eff can be calculated by integrating the soil layer thickness along the side wall of the caisson given as 17 h e f f 0 d k x z i ω c x z u f f z d z k h c i ω c h c u f f d 18 m e f f 0 d k x z i ω c x z u f f z d z k h c i ω c h c u f f d d 0 d k r z i ω c r z u f f z d z k r c i ω c r c u f f d where u ff z and u f f z are the free field displacement and its derivative with respect to z respectively in order to analyze the kinematic seismic response of caisson foundation in time domain the h eff and m eff should be processed by the inverse fourier transform then equation 6 can be solved numerically at each time step using the newmark β method with linear acceleration assumption 2 3 kinematic seismic response of a pile group since ccpf is consisted of a caisson and a pile group the kinematic seismic response of the pile group should be obtained first the kinematic seismic response of the pile group in layered soil can be analyzed based on a nonlinear dynamic winkler model as shown in fig 4 it is necessary to establish a single pile analysis model and an interaction analysis model between two piles to study the seismic response of a pile group here the properties of a single pile includes diameter d 0 length l mass m p young s modulus e p and inertia moment i p the interaction between pile and soil is also modeled by a series of springs and dashpots the pile is divided equally into n p segments with an interval of h the equilibrium equation of the pile soil system can be written as 19 m p y c s y k p s y k s u f f c s u f f where m p c s and k s are the diagonal matrices of the pile mass the damping coefficients and the stiffness coefficients of the soil around the pile respectively the damping coefficient c hi i 1 n p in the matrix c s is defined as 4d 0 ρ si v si berger et al 1977 while the stiffness coefficient k hi in the matrix k s is defined as δe si e si is the soil young s modulus and δ is a constant related to the soil stiffness along the pile and it is in the range of 1 0 2 5 for typical soil and piles kagawa and kraft 2018 k ps is the stiffness matrix of the pile soil system given by huang et al 2018 20 k p s e p i p h 4 b h 0 4 2 2 b h 1 4 1 1 4 b h 2 4 1 1 4 b h i 4 1 1 4 b h n p 2 4 1 1 4 b h n p 1 2 2 4 b h n p n p 1 n p 1 where b h 0 2 4 λ h i 4 h 4 b h 1 5 4 λ h i 4 h 4 b h i 6 4 λ h i 4 h 4 2 i n p 2 b h n p 1 5 4 λ h i 4 h 4 b h n p 2 4 λ hn p 4 h 4 and ϕ since each pile is affected by the load and deflection of other piles in the group the interaction between two piles is also an important factor affecting the seismic response of the pile group regarding the incremental interaction

vertical displacement resulted from the vertical force are ignored for simplicity then by considering the dynamic compatibility conditions of the displacement and resultant force the incremental lateral dynamic equilibrium equations of pile group with n p piles under seismic excitation can be expressed as 26 a p 11 a p 12 a p 13 a p 21 a p 22 a p 23 a p 31 a p 32 a p 33 u p f p h m p g p p o

equations with newmark β method 2 5 nonlinear model for soil around foundation generally the soil behavior in an earthquake is highly nonlinear and therefore an appropriate nonlinear model is critical to reflect the nonlinear dynamic response of the foundation soil system the beam on nonlinear winker foundation is proved to be an efficient method to account for the nonlinear foundation soil interaction allotey and el naggar 2008 heidari et al 2014 tu et al 2020a as shown in fig 5 the hardin drnevich model is also used for the backbone of the nonlinear shear stress strain curve the modified masing s rule is adopted to obtain the soil hysteretic behavior under cyclic loads and the equations of the reloading and unloading curves can be written as 36 τ τ u r γ γ u r 1 δ g g 0 γ γ u r κ 0 τ f 37 κ 0 1 τ u r δ q τ f where γ ur and τ ur are the soil shear strain and stress at the beginning of unloading or reloading κ 0 is the modified pyke s factor pyke 1979 and signs of and represent the process of unloading and reloading respectively δ g and δ q are the shear modulus and strength degradation or hardening factors of soil for the foundation embedded in sand there is usually no gapping between the sand and the foundation when subjected to lateral loading gerolymos and gazetas 2006 however for the foundation embedded in clay in addition to the soil inelasticity the dynamic soil structure interaction also involves the separation or gapping between the foundation and the soil to account for the gapping effect the approach proposed by allotey and el naggar 2008 is incorporated in the nonlinear model mentioned above two parameters λ f and λ s are adopted to model the shape of soil hysteresis curve generated at different soil depths along the caisson or pile shaft as shown in fig 6 the reloading curve and reverse loading curve are controlled by λ f 0 λ f 1 and λ s 0 λ s 1 loading curve λ f is a reduced coefficient related to the past maximum shear stress τ ur which makes the curve produce a vertical translation λ s is a parameter controlling the shape of the curve λ f 0 or λ s 0 for a fully unconfined condition or pure gap while λ f λ s 1 for a fully confined condition at which there is no reduction for τ ur cyclic degradation or hardening behaviors should be also considered in the seismic analysis here the accumulated plastic shear strain γ p the difference between the total shear strain and the elastic shear strain is introduced into the nonlinear analytical model to simulate the cyclic hardening or degradation of soil the accumulated plastic shear strain γ p after n cycles is the sum of the plastic shear strain developed at each cycle as 38 σ x 4 γ 0 s d h 0 π s w s d tan θ s d tan θ s w s d tan θ x 2 s w s d tan θ x 2 h 0 2 2 d x 4 γ 0 h 0 tan θ π 0 s d tan θ s d tan θ x 2 x s d tan θ x 2 h 0 2 2 d x i 1 2 3 2 n 1 2 n then the degradation or hardening factor of soil can be expressed as huang and liu 2015 39 δ δ r e s 1 δ r e s e b γ p where δ represents the shear modulus factor δ g g i g 0 or the strength factor δ q τ uri τ f for clay b is a constant reflecting the degradation or hardening rate of the accumulative shear strain and δ res is the residual stiffness ratio δ gres g n g 0 or the residual strength factor δ qres τ urn τ f g 0 τ f g i τ uri and g n τ urn are the initial shear modulus strength the current shear modulus strength and the final residual shear modulus strength respectively as shown in fig 6 here the average shear strain in the soil around a pile foundation is approximately calculated as kagawa and kraft 1980 40 γ 1 υ 2 5 d 0 y where d 0 is the diameter of pile foundation and y is the displacement as mentioned above all the stiffness or damping coefficients are closely related to the shear modulus of soil and therefore the dynamic equilibrium eq 32 should be solved by iteration in fact the kinematic response of the foundation excited by the free field motion is not a symmetrical cycle during the iteration the displacement of the foundation at current time step is used to judge the state of the soil reloading or unloading first and then the soil parameters are determined according to the state of the soil 3 verification of the proposed method the centrifuge shaking table tests of the seismic response of a ccpf structure performed by zhong and huang 2014b are used to validate the proposed method as shown in fig 7 the similarity relationships of ccpf are listed in table 1 considering the centrifugal acceleration is 50 g the similarity ratio is set to 1 50 due to the different deformation mechanisms of foundation and superstructure different geometrical quantities should be considered for similar control here the lateral and rocking displacements of the caisson foundation are the main source of deformation the mass m c and inertia moment j c of the caisson foundation are used as the main control variables for the similarity ratio similarly the superstructure is also controlled by the mass and inertia moment while the pile foundation mainly takes account of the flexural rigidity e p i p and the compressive rigidity e p a p therefore the dimensions of ccpf and structure are summarized in table 2 and the dimensions of the ccpf in centrifuge test or prototype are shown in fig 7 the sandy soil is obtained in shanghai and the mean particle size d 50 of the soil is 0 07 mm the density of the soil in the centrifuge test is 1467 kg m3 the average shear wave velocity v s of the soil is 66 7 m s considering the stress level in the test accelerometers a1 a3 are used to obtain the seismic responses of the superstructure ccpf and free field respectively a seismic record often used in shanghai for the design of infrastructure is adopted as the base input motion as shown in fig 7 in order to calculate the seismic response of the ccpf structure an analytical model for ccpf structure interaction also should be established and the computational process would be divided into two steps step 1 calculating the kinematic response of the ccpf step 2 analyzing inertial response to construct a foundation structure interaction analysis model then analyze the seismic response of the ccpf structure here the kinematic response analysis of the ccpf is calculated by the proposed time domain method in section 2 the seismic response of the ccpf structure is calculated as follows fig 8 shows the seismic response analysis model of the ccpf structure in which the bottom of the model is a combined spring to simulate the stiffness of ccpf the ccpf structure will vibrate horizontally when excited by the kinematic seismic response of the ccpf for simplicity the seismic response of superstructure is investigated in frequency domain the dynamic equilibrium equation can be derived according to the resultant force and displacement compatibility conditions zhong and huang 2014a 41 k s ω 2 m u s θ s u b s θ b s 0 0 r h u b θ b d θ b where u s and θ s u bs and θ bs are the horizontal displacement and rocking angle of the superstructure and the ccpf respectively ω is the vibration circular frequency r h is the dynamic stiffness of the ccpf which equals the ratio of the resultant force on the ccpf to the displacement k s is the stiffness matrix of the ccpf structure given as 42 k s k s s k s b k b s k b b r h where m is the diagonal mass matrix of the ccpf structure given as 43 m m s s m b b all the elements of k s and m in eqs 42 and 43 can be found in appendix d after the calculations at all frequencies the seismic time history of ccpf structure can be obtained by inverse fourier transform figs 9 11 shows the measured acceleration time histories of the superstructure i e a1 the ccpf i e a2 and soil at the ground surface i e a3 in centrifuge shaking table test respectively then the acceleration time histories of the foundation calculated by the present time domain method the frequency domain method fdm in zhong and huang 2014a and the measurements in centrifuge shaking table test are compared as shown in figs 10 and 11 here the shear modulus factor δ g the strength factor δ q are assumed to be 1 for comparison with the frequency domain calculation results and shaping parameters λ f and λ s are both equal to 1 since there is usually no gapping between the sand and the foundation when subjected to lateral loading gerolymos and gazetas 2005 2006 2006 compared with the experimental results it is clear that the proposed time domain method considering soil nonlinearity provides much better predictions than the frequency domain method especially for the ccpf as expected considering soil nonlinearity will reduce the acceleration of the superstructure due to the energy dissipation caused by the soil damping it is worth noting that the dynamic equilibrium eq 41 is established based on the assumption of linearity for simplicity and this assumption of linearity in step 2 mentioned above may be the main reason for the difference between the calculation and centrifuge measurement for better illustration the fourier amplitude spectrum of acceleration for ccpf and superstructure are plotted in figs 12 and 13 it is obvious that the results calculated by the present time domain method are close to those in the centrifuge tests which also verifies the reliability of the proposed method however the results from the frequency domain method that ignores soil nonlinearity cannot well capture the seismic characteristics of the ccpf and superstructure at high frequencies both the centrifuge measurements and the proposed time domain method indicate that the fundamental frequencies of ccpf and superstructure are close to 3 65 hz i e point 4 in figs 12 and 1 66 hz i e point 3 in fig 13 respectively nevertheless the frequency domain method indicates that the fundamental frequencies of ccpf and superstructure are close to 0 97 hz i e point 2 in figs 12 and 0 97 hz i e point 2 in fig 13 respectively 4 case study ccpf for the qiongzhou strait bridge qiongzhou strait one of the three major straits in china is an important water channel between hainan island and leizhou peninsula according to the design sea crossing bridge is one of the alternatives and the ccpf is adopted as the bridge foundation as shown in fig 14 the height and the diameter of the caisson are 88 4 m and 90 m respectively the embedded depth d is 40 m the thickness of side wall of the caisson is 3 5 m while the thicknesses of top and base plates are 7 m and 12 m respectively the unit weight of the concrete caisson is 25 kn m3 the pile group comprises of 92 steel pipe piles with a pile spacing of 9 m the pile is 90 m in length and 1 8 m in diameter with a wall thickness of 30 cm the properties of soil layers surrounding the ccpf are listed in table 3 as mentioned in section 2 the shear modulus of soil around the foundation is one of the key parameters for the seismic analysis strictly the initial shear modulus and its degradation with shear strain should be obtained by in suit tests and laboratory tests yang and gu 2013 gu et al 2015b here a well recognized empirical equation based on laboratory test is used to calculate the initial shear modulus g 0 of clay hardin and drnevich 1972 44 g 0 3230 2 97 e 0 2 1 e 0 ocr k σ m 0 5 where σ m is the mean effective stress ocr is the over consolidation ratio e 0 is the void ratio of soil and k is a dimensionless parameter and depends on the plasticity index of the soil table 4 lists the initial shear modulus of the soil surrounding the ccpf the stress is calculated at the middle of the soil layer and a coefficient of lateral earth pressure at rest is assumed to be 1 sin ϕ where ϕ is the effective soil friction angle mayne and kulhawy 1982 gu et al 2015a meanwhile the hardin drnevich model is adopted to model the nonlinear shear stress strain behavior of the soil around the ccpf it was recommended that the degradation ratio δ g and δ q were in the range of 0 7 1 0 for clay vucetic and dobry 1988 allotey et al 2006 huang and liu 2015 allotey et al 2006 also suggested that λ f was in the range of 0 1 and λ s 1 meanwhile investigations indicate that λ f and λ s had a limited effect less than 10 on the predicted superstructure displacement boulanger et al 1999 allotey et al 2006 therefore it is assumed that δ g 0 8 δ q 1 0 λ f 0 2 and λ s 1 0 in this analysis strictly these values should be obtained from the laboratory tests or in suit tests such as resonant column test cyclic triaxial tests or cyclic torsional shear tests fig 15 shows the input acceleration time history and its fourier amplitude spectrum the peak input acceleration is 0 345 g and the dominant frequency is 0 58 hz according to the one dimension nonlinear site response analysis method proposed in section 2 1 the free field motion can be obtained fig 16 shows the acceleration and displacement time histories at the ground surface fig 17 shows the acceleration time histories and displacement time histories at the top center of ccpf for comparison the results calculated in time domain without considering the soil nonlinearity are also given as seen in fig 17 the seismic response of the ccpf is large in the first 15 0s which is consistent with the input motion and it shows a slight growth in the acceleration and displacement kinematic responses of ccpf when the soil nonlinearity is taken into account it should be noted that the peak acceleration and displacement of the ccpf occur at 11 4s but the peak acceleration of the input occurs at 6 9s see fig 15 this is mainly attributed to the intrinsic dynamic characteristics of the foundation and the hysteresis effect caused by the soil damping the resonant frequency of the foundation is also one of the main concerns in design fig 18 shows the fourier amplitude spectrum of the acceleration time histories of the ccpf it is obvious that there are three main peak frequencies during the seismic excitation which are consistent with the input motion in fig 15 b however the maximum fourier amplitude of input motion occurs at a frequency of 0 58 hz i e point 1 but the maximum fourier amplitude of the ccpf occurs at a frequency of 0 93 hz i e point 2 it indicates that the resonant frequency of the ccpf is close to frequency at the second peak around point 2 in fig 15 b in addition the results also indicate that the ccpf is insensitive to the excitation when the frequency is above 2 0 hz moreover the stress strain hysteresis loops of the soil in the earthquake at different soil depth around the ccpf are illustrated in fig 19 as seen in fig 19 the stress strain curves show s and oval shaped hysteresis loops due to the soil nonlinearity and the predetermined gap formation in the shear stress strain relationship meanwhile it is found that the mobilized shear strain of soil decreases as the depth increases and a maximum shear strain of about 2 0 10 3 occurs around the ccpf top it is expected that the average shear strain level in the soil is small which reasonably explains the small difference between the seismic response of ccpf obtained from elastic analyses and nonlinear analyses this also reflects the good seismic performance of the ccpf it should be noted that the shear modulus of soil is important for the dynamic response of the foundation and more reasonable values of the shear modulus factor δ g the strength factor δ q the shaping parameters λ f and λ s should be obtained from the laboratory tests or in suit tests such as resonant column test torsional shear test and cross hole wave velocity test 5 performance of ccpf under earthquake and scouring 5 1 the change of soil properties due to scour hole generally bridges usually suffer from multiple natural hazards and they are more vulnerable than under individual hazard wang et al 2014 liang et al 2020 scour effect is an important challenge for the bridge foundation which easily suffers from the wind and water waves in existing research the soil around the foundation is simply removed layer by layer to account for the scour effect during theoretical analyses liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 tu et al 2020b however the scour hole pattern is closely related to the water flow velocity water flow direction and foundation type chen 2010 wang et al 2017 with the formation of the scour hole the remaining soil undergoes an unloading stress history lin et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 liang et al 2018 therefore it is essential to propose a reasonable method to describe the change of soil stress state caused by the scour hole in calculating the seismic response of foundation under scour conditions according to the field monitoring data in taizhou yangtze river bridge it can be assumed that the scour occurs only around the caisson considering the relatively large dimension of the caisson in ccpf generally the scour hole around the foundation can be characterized by the scour width s w scour depth s d and scour hole slope angle θ as shown in fig 20 liang et al 2018 lin and lin 2020 therefore we can obtain the stress loss resulted from the scour effect as follows 45 σ m s σ m σ u l where σ m and σ m s are the mean effective stress before and after scour σ u l is the mean effective stress loss the stress loss around the caisson after scour can be obtained by the superposition method if ignoring three dimension effect the overall stress loss σ u l around the foundation can be represented by the shaded area in fig 20 which consists of a triangular and a quadrilateral scour hole therefore the σ u l of the point of interest caused by the scour hole can be expressed as 46 σ u l σ z 2 σ x 3 where σ x and σ z are the horizontal and vertical effective stress loss and can be calculated as kennedy et al 1980 47 σ z 2 γ 0 s d h 0 3 π s d tan θ 2 s w s d tan θ 1 s w s d tan θ x 2 h 0 2 2 d x 2 γ 0 h 0 3 tan θ π 0 s d tan θ x s d tan θ x 2 h 0 2 2 d x 48 σ x 4 γ 0 s d h 0 π s w s d tan θ s d tan θ s w s d tan θ x 2 s w s d tan θ x 2 h 0 2 2 d x 4 γ 0 h 0 tan θ π 0 s d tan θ s d tan θ x 2 x s d tan θ x 2 h 0 2 2 d x where γ 0 is the effective unit weight of soil before scour and h 0 is the embedded depth of the point of interest before scour as shown in fig 20 according to eq 44 the shear modulus of soil mainly depends on the void ratio and ocr of soil besides the stress state the scour erosion can be regarded as unloading process and therefore the change of void ratio δ e caused by the scour hole can be calculated in terms of the mean effective stress given by 49 δ e e 0 s e 0 κ ln σ m s σ m κ ln 1 2 k 0 γ 0 h 0 σ z 2 σ x 1 2 k 0 γ 0 h 0 where e 0 and e 0s are the void ratios before and after scour κ is the unloading index and k 0 is the lateral earth pressure coefficient at rest the ocr of the soil after scouring can be expressed as 50 o c r γ 0 h 0 γ 0 h 0 σ z then the initial shear modulus of soil after scour g 0s can be rewritten as 51 g 0 s 3230 2 97 e 0 s 2 1 e 0 s ocr k σ m s 0 5 as mentioned above in section 2 the coefficients of the distributed springs around the ccpf are closely related to the soil shear modulus which are the key parameters for calculating the kinematic seismic response of foundation once the g 0s is obtained by eq 51 then all the stiffness and damping coefficients mentioned in section 2 can be modified by the g 0s and the effect of scour hole dimensions can be obtained by substituting the modified stiffness and damping coefficients in eq 32 5 2 kinematic seismic response before and after scour here a scour hole with sd 20 m sw 10 m and angle θ 30 is adopted to investigate the effect of scour hole on the kinematic seismic response of the ccpf for the qiongzhou strait bridge fig 21 compares the acceleration time histories and displacement time histories of the ccpf before and after scour it is clear that the kinematic acceleration and displacement responses of the ccpf and superstructure obviously increase after scour meanwhile compared to the curves before scour the curves after scour shift slightly to the right of time axis this mainly attributes to higher nonlinear behavior of the soil around the foundation after scour when subjected to the same excitation as shown in fig 22 fig 22 shows the stress strain hysteresis loops of the soil at different soil depth around the ccpf as can be seen in fig 22 the calculated kinematic response of the ccpf after scour exhibits fat hysteresis loops than that of hysteresis loops in fig 19 when the soil depth is the same and the soil around pile head shows stronger nonlinear characteristics compared with the situation before scour according to the results from figs 19 and 22 the analysis model can effectively simulate both s and oval shape hysteresis loops fig 23 compares the acceleration fourier amplitude spectra of the ccpf before and after scour as seen in fig 23 the frequency corresponding to the maximum fourier amplitude decreases from 0 92 hz before scour to 0 55 hz after scour meanwhile the fourier amplitude after scour for the frequencies less than 1 0 hz significantly increases while it decreases for the frequencies larger than 1 0 hz the possible reason for this phenomenon is the decrease of main peak frequency after scour generally the fourier amplitude near the main peak frequency usually shows a larger value since the main peak frequency after scour becomes well below 1 0 hz the fourier amplitude after scour for the frequencies less than 1 0 hz decreases while it increases for the frequencies larger than 1 0 hz as expected it also clearly indicates that the stiffness of the system decreases remarkably due to the scour since the scour decreases the embedded depth and the effective stress of the remaining soil around the ccpf hence it is very important to consider the scour effect on the kinematic seismic response of the ccpf in practice it can be also found that the three main peak frequencies shift from high to low values compared to the frequencies before scour however the amplitude of the reduction is small this indicates that the dynamic characteristics at the main frequencies have changed after scour which is very important for the design of the dynamic performance of the ccpf 6 summary and conclusions in this study a nonlinear simplified analysis method in time domain was proposed to study the kinematic seismic response of the ccpf and the seismic time history can be directly used as input the reliability of the proposed method was verified by centrifuge test results the scour effect on the kinematic seismic response of the ccpf was also investigated the following conclusions can be drawn 1 a simplified analysis model for the ccpf was proposed in which the caisson is simplified as a rigid structure and the pile is assumed as an elastic beam embedded in the soil the proposed model can effectively simulate the nonlinear characteristics of the soil such as hysteresis loop and gapping the proposed time domain method considering soil nonlinearity provides a much better estimation of the acceleration time history of the ccpf than the frequency domain method without considering the soil nonlinearity soil nonlinearity will apparently reduce the acceleration response at the superstructure due to the energy dissipation caused by the soil damping 2 the resonant frequency of the ccpf for qiongzhou strait approximately ranges in 0 6 1 0 hz and the ccpf is insensitive to the excitation when its frequency is larger than 2 0 hz it was found that the difference of the seismic responses of the ccpf was smaller whether the soil nonlinearity was considered or not which is mainly attributed to the small average shear strain and good performance of the ccpf 3 the scour effect plays an important role in the kinematic seismic response of the ccpf the kinematic acceleration and displacement responses of the ccpf and superstructure obviously increase after scour meanwhile the curves after scour shift slightly to the right of time axis which is mainly attributed to higher nonlinear behavior of the soil around the foundation after scour when subjected to the same excitation the frequency corresponding to the maximum fourier amplitude decreases from 0 92 hz to 0 56 hz after scour it clearly indicates that the stiffness of the system decreases remarkably due to the scour credit authorship contribution statement wenbo tu investigation formal analysis visualization

20502,as a new type of bridge foundation in deep water the composite caisson piles foundation ccpf is inevitability suffered from multiple hazards such as earthquake scouring and erosion especially for sea crossing bridges in ocean environment in this study a simplified method in time domain is proposed for predicting the nonlinear kinematic seismic response of ccpf and the effect of scouring on the seismic response is investigated the proposed method is verified by the results of centrifuge shaking table tests it is found that compared with frequency domain method the proposed time domain method can give good estimations of the acceleration and the displacement of the ccpf especially at high frequencies moreover the kinematic seismic response of ccpf designed for the qiongzhou strait bridge is analyzed the results indicate that the proposed model can effectively simulate the soil nonlinearity and the soil nonlinearity significantly affects the kinematic seismic response of ccpf especially the acceleration and displacement time histories finally the scouring effect is considered by an analytical model and the performance of the ccpf under combined earthquake and scouring is

there are two potential foundation types proposed in the pre design of qs bridge including single caisson foundation and composite caisson piles foundation ccpf as shown in fig 1 tu et al 2020a zhang et al 2019 zhong and huang 2013 the main reason choosing caisson foundation as a candidate is its convenience of underwater construction and rich experience in sea crossing or river crossing bridges such as akashi kaikyo bridge in japan san francisco oakland bay bridge in usa and taizhou yangtze river bridge in china however considering the complicated deep water environment at the construction site ccpf is also considered as an innovative solution to overcome the lack of ultra deep sinking methods ccpf comprises of a caisson in the upper part and grouped piles in the lower part with the benefit of the piles the height or the embedded depth of the caisson can be effectively reduced which can significantly reduce the construction difficulty as shown in fig 1 for ccpf used in a sea crossing bridge two natural hazards earthquake and scouring should be fully considered in engineering design and analysis the seismic response of ccpf is an important issue when the bridge locates in a seismic zone e g the qs bridge locates in the seismic zone along the southeast coast of china many works have been done on the seismic response of caisson foundation using laboratory tests finite element modeling and theoretical analyses gerolymos and gazetas 2006 zafeirakos and gerolymos 2013 chang et al 2014 qin et al 2019 kaynia et al 2019 gaudio and rampello 2019 2021 conducted a series of 3d finite element analyses in the time domain to evaluate the nonlinear seismic performance of bridge piers on caisson foundations conti et al 2020 also performed 3d finite element modeling to analyze the seismic performance of bridge piers on caisson and pile foundations theoretical analyses have been widely used due to its simplicity and high computation efficiency tsigginos et al 2008 and varun et al 2009 developed an elastic model to analyze the seismic response of caisson foundation in frequency domain gerolymos and gazetas 2006 proposed a phenomenological winkler model to analyze the dynamic response of the caisson under horizontal excitation and this model can consider the nonlinearity of soil surrounding the caisson however it has not been further used to analyze the kinematic seismic response of caisson on the other hand a number of studies have been conducted to investigate the kinematic response of pile foundations fan et al 1991 mylonakis et al 1997 ahmad et al 2007 dezi et al 2009 anoyatis et al 2013 kaynia 2021 fan et al 1991 presented a set of kinematic interaction factors of pile foundations as a function of dimensionless frequency which can be readily applied to the frequency domain analysis anoyatis et al 2013 discussed the kinematic response of pile foundations in a homogeneous soil under different boundary conditions at the pile head and tip compared with traditional caisson foundation and pile foundation ccpf is a new type of deep water foundation and relevant studies are relatively few zhong and huang 2014a proposed a simplified method to study the seismic response of ccpf structure system based on the dynamic winkler model in frequency domain the frequency domain method is an efficient method and simple in computing it should be noted that the soil surrounding the foundation in zhong and huang 2014a was assumed to be elastic due to the limitation of the frequency domain method however it is well agreed that the actual soil always exhibits nonlinear characteristics under earthquakes therefore time domain method is needed to consider the nonlinear behavior of the soil around the foundation in earthquakes it is well known that the seismic response of foundation structure is intrinsically related to the kinematic interaction between soils and foundations zhang et al 2018 mylonakis and gazetas 2002 therefore it is essential to investigate the kinematic seismic response of the bridge foundation for better understanding the dynamic characteristics of the whole bridge huang et al 2018 proposed a time domain method to analyze the lateral dynamic response of ccpf which provides a helpful guidance for the earthquake design however the soil nonlinearity was considered by p y curves actually a more reasonable method for describing the soil nonlinear characteristics should be proposed from the perspective of the nonlinear soil stress strain curves moreover the scouring effect on the dynamic response of foundation has not been analyzed in huang et al 2018 generally bridge foundations are exposed to water waves and flows in deep water environment and it has been widely recognized that scouring around the foundation develops with times the field monitoring data shows that the maximum local scour depth of caisson foundation i e length width height 58 2 m 44 1 m 76 m embedded depth 55 m of taizhou yangtze river bridge is 17 4 m after one year chen 2010 it can be inferred that the ccpf located in qiongzhou strait is inevitably affected by the scouring due to the complex ocean environment statistics show that more than half of the bridge damages are related to the scour around the foundation peng et al 2019 lagasse and richardson 2001 this is an important challenge for the design and construction of the bridge foundation generally the scour effect can be considered as the loss of overburden stress resulted from the scour hole around the foundation the shape of scour hole around the bridge foundation is usually simplified as a plane distribution in theoretical analyses zhang et al 2017 which means that the soil is simply removed layer by layer however the plane distribution mode is inconsistent with the phenomenon observed in laboratory tests or engineering practice wang et al 2017 meanwhile many previous studies indicate that the dynamic characteristics of the foundation will be significantly affected by the dimensions of scour hole around the foundation liang et al 2018 2020 lin and wu 2019 therefore the scour hole dimensions should be reasonably considered in the analysis in order to better reflect the scour effect on the dynamic characteristics of the foundation the objective of this paper is to investigate the kinematic seismic response of the potential types of foundation for qs bridge and to analyze the change of the kinematic seismic response of the foundation after scour firstly a simplified analytical method in time domain for calculating the seismic response of the ccpf is proposed in which the nonlinearity of the soil around the ccpf is properly considered the effectiveness of the proposed in calculating the dynamic responses of the ccpf is verified by the centrifuge shaking table test results secondly the kinematic seismic responses of the ccpf for the qs bridge are analyzed finally the scouring effect is considered by an analytical model and the performance of the ccpf under combined action of earthquake and scouring is investigated 2 nonlinear kinematic seismic analysis of ccpf fig 2 shows the schematic diagram of a ccpf subjected to seismic load to investigate the kinematic seismic response of the soil foundation system the analysis process can be divided into two parts free field motion and kinematic seismic response 2 1 free field motion subjected to vertical propagated s wave the free field motion which refers to the response of the ground without any foundation or excavation usually assumes that the vertical propagated s wave is the only incident seismic wave to simplify seismic excitation from the bedrock the soil medium is idealized as a discrete lumped mass system and the dynamic equilibrium equation of the free field soil subjected to a vertical propagated s waves can be given as hashash and park 2001 1 m u c u k u m i u g where u u and u are the soil acceleration velocity and displacement vectors respectively u g is the acceleration at the ground base and i is the unit vector m c and k are the mass the damping and the stiffness matrices of soil respectively the damping matrix c is determined by hashash and park 2002 2 c a 0 m a 1 k where a 0 and a 1 are scalar values which can be calculated using two significant natural modes i and j 3 ξ i ξ j 1 4 π 1 f i f i 1 f j f j a 0 a 1 where ξ i and ξ j are the damping ratios for the frequencies f i and f j for site response analysis the frequency of the selected mode can be computed as 4 f m 2 m 1 v s 4 h where f m is the natural frequency of the corresponding mode m v s is the average shear wave velocity of the soil and h is the total height of the soil hashash 2020 suggested selecting frequencies corresponding to the natural frequency of the soil column and 5 times the natural frequency of the soil column for calculation regarding the soil nonlinearity in the analysis the hardin drnevich model is used for the backbone of the nonlinear shear stress strain curve as hardin and drnevich 1972 5 τ γ 1 g 0 γ τ f where τ f is the shear stress at failure γ and g 0 are the shear strain and the initial shear modulus of soil respectively the masing s rule was adopted to simulate the hysteretic behavior of soil and the dynamic equilibrium can be solved by the newmark β method this computational process has been integrated into the one dimensional nonlinear site response analysis software deepsoil that we can directly use hashash 2020 2 2 kinematic seismic response of a caisson the kinematic seismic response of caisson can be calculated by the excitation of the displacement response of the soil based on a nonlinear dynamic winkler model as illustrated in fig 3 the caisson is considered as a rigid structure with a mass of m c a length of d a diameter of b and an embedded depth d the interaction between caisson and soil is modeled by a series of springs and dashpots around the foundation moreover investigations indicate that the foundation mass has a remarkable beneficial effect on the filtering action liang et al 2013 conti et al 2018 therefore the foundation mass was also included in the kinematic interaction and the dynamic equilibrium equation of a rigid massive caisson foundation excited by a vertical seismic motion based on the above mentioned model can be given as 6 m b u b θ b c b u b θ b k b u b θ b h e f f m e f f where the mass matrix m b the stiffness matrix k b and the damping matrix c b can be expressed as 7 m b m c m c h 1 m c h 1 j c m c h 1 2 8 k b k h h k h r k r h k r r k h c 0 d k x z d z 0 d k x z z d z 0 d k x z z d z k r c 0 d k x z z 2 d z 0 d k r z d z 9 c b c h h c h r c r h c r r c h c 0 d c x z d z 0 d c x z z d z 0 d c x z z d z c r c 0 d c x z z 2 d z 0 d c r z d z where j c is the inertia moment of the caisson h 1 is the height from the center of gravity of the foundation to the bottom and k x z k r z and c x z c r z are the coefficients of the lateral and rocking springs that simulate the dynamic properties of soil around the caisson respectively by integrating the soil layer thickness along the side wall of the caisson k b and c b could be obtained as huang et al 2018 10 k h h k h c i 1 n k x i d i 11 k h r k r h i 1 n k x i d i z i 12 k r r k r c i 1 n k x i d i z i 2 1 12 d i 2 k r i d 13 c h h c h c i 1 n c x i d i 14 c h r c r h i 1 n c x i d i z i 15 c r r c r c i 1 n c x i d i z i 2 1 2 d i 2 c r i d 16 z i d j 0 i 1 d j d i 2 where d i is the thickness of the ith soil layer i 1 n around the caisson z i is the distance from the ground surface to the center of the ith layer k xi c xi and k ri c ri are the coefficients of the lateral and rocking springs that simulate the dynamic properties of ith soil layer and k hc c hc and k rc c rc are the stiffness and damping coefficients of the lateral and rocking springs that simulate the dynamic properties of soil at the bottom of the caisson respectively the computational formula mentioned above can be found in appendix a here h eff and m eff are the resultant horizontal load and moment relative to the bottom center of the caisson which are caused by the free field motion of the soil considering the horizontal and rocking response under the excitation h eff and m eff can be calculated by integrating the soil layer thickness along the side wall of the caisson given as 17 h e f f 0 d k x z i ω c x z u f f z d z k h c i ω c h c u f f d 18 m e f f 0 d k x z i ω c x z u f f z d z k h c i ω c h c u f f d d 0 d k r z i ω c r z u f f z d z k r c i ω c r c u f f d where u ff z and u f f z are the free field displacement and its derivative with respect to z respectively in order to analyze the kinematic seismic response of caisson foundation in time domain the h eff and m eff should be processed by the inverse fourier transform then equation 6 can be solved numerically at each time step using the newmark β method with linear acceleration assumption 2 3 kinematic seismic response of a pile group since ccpf is consisted of a caisson and a pile group the kinematic seismic response of the pile group should be obtained first the kinematic seismic response of the pile group in layered soil can be analyzed based on a nonlinear dynamic winkler model as shown in fig 4 it is necessary to establish a single pile analysis model and an interaction analysis model between two piles to study the seismic response of a pile group here the properties of a single pile includes diameter d 0 length l mass m p young s modulus e p and inertia moment i p the interaction between pile and soil is also modeled by a series of springs and dashpots the pile is divided equally into n p segments with an interval of h the equilibrium equation of the pile soil system can be written as 19 m p y c s y k p s y k s u f f c s u f f where m p c s and k s are the diagonal matrices of the pile mass the damping coefficients and the stiffness coefficients of the soil around the pile respectively the damping coefficient c hi i 1 n p in the matrix c s is defined as 4d 0 ρ si v si berger et al 1977 while the stiffness coefficient k hi in the matrix k s is defined as δe si e si is the soil young s modulus and δ is a constant related to the soil stiffness along the pile and it is in the range of 1 0 2 5 for typical soil and piles kagawa and kraft 2018 k ps is the stiffness matrix of the pile soil system given by huang et al 2018 20 k p s e p i p h 4 b h 0 4 2 2 b h 1 4 1 1 4 b h 2 4 1 1 4 b h i 4 1 1 4 b h n p 2 4 1 1 4 b h n p 1 2 2 4 b h n p n p 1 n p 1 where b h 0 2 4 λ h i 4 h 4 b h 1 5 4 λ h i 4 h 4 b h i 6 4 λ h i 4 h 4 2 i n p 2 b h n p 1 5 4 λ h i 4 h 4 b h n p 2 4 λ hn p 4 h 4 and ϕ since each pile is affected by the load and deflection of other piles in the group the interaction between two piles is also an important factor affecting the seismic response of the pile group regarding the incremental interaction load between pile and soil as a piece wise linear force the effect of lateral pile soil pile interaction can be given as el naggar and novak 1996 21 h int e r t i q 2 δ t s ϕ 1 u t i s ϕ u t i 1 s ϕ b δ t h int e r t i 1 q 1 δ t s ϕ φ 0 or 90 where i is the current time step h inter t i is the interaction force at time t i δt is the increment of each time step s is the pile spacing and ϕ is the angle between the lines of two piles and the direction of the interaction force q 1 and q 2 are the convolution integrals given by 22 q 1 t s j 0 δ t u t τ s j 1 τ δ t d τ a b d 0 2 s 1 b δ t e b δ t

0 3 4 v s i ϕ 0 25 t 0 s 0 5 d 0 v s i ϕ 90 where υ i is the poisson s ratio of the ith soil layer since this study mainly focuses on the lateral response of the foundation the vertical force and the vertical displacement resulted from the vertical force are ignored for simplicity then by considering the dynamic compatibility conditions of the displacement and resultant force the incremental lateral dynamic equilibrium equations of pile group with n p piles under seismic excitation can be expressed as 26 a p 11 a p 12 a p 13 a p 21 a p 22 a p 23 a p 31 a p 32 a p 33 u p f p h m p g p p o where f p h m is an equivalent incremental load acting on the pile head of each single pile which can be given by 27 f p h m e p i p h 4 f p 1 h m f pi h m f pn h m t 28 f p i h m e p i p h 4 2 h 3 δ

of each single pile and ap 11 ap 33 are the equivalent stiffness and damping derived from the finite difference method see appendix b 2 4 kinematic seismic response of ccpf by substituting the moment m g and the resultant horizontal load h g into eq 6 the dynamic equilibrium equation of the ccpf can be obtained as zhong and huang 2014 31 m b u b θ b c b u b θ b k b u b θ b h e f f g m e f f g h e f f m e f f combining eqs 6 and 26 the kinematic seismic response can be written as follows 32 a 11 a 12 a 13 a 14 a 15 a 21 a 22 a 23 a 24 a 25 a 31 a 32 a 33 a 34 a 35 a 41 a 42 a 43 a 44 a 45 a 51 a 52 a 53 a 54 a 55 u c u p f c h m f p h m p b p c p p o o where u c is the kinematic seismic displacement vector of caisson and f c h m is equivalent incremental load acting on the caisson base and a ij and p c can be found in appendix c u c and f c h m can be expressed by 33 u c δ u b δ θ b 34 f c h m δ q c eff δ m c eff p b is the equivalent incremental horizontal load and moment acted on the ccpf given by 35 p b e p i p h 4 2 h 3 δ h e f f e p i p 2 h 2 δ m e f f e p i p h 2 δ m e f f e p i p finally the kinematic seismic response of ccpf can be obtained by solving the dynamic equilibrium equations with newmark β method 2 5 nonlinear model for soil around foundation generally the soil behavior in an earthquake is highly nonlinear and therefore an appropriate nonlinear model is critical to reflect the nonlinear dynamic response of the foundation soil system the beam on nonlinear winker foundation is proved to be an efficient method to account for the nonlinear foundation soil interaction allotey and el naggar 2008 heidari et al 2014 tu et al 2020a as shown in fig 5 the hardin drnevich model is also used for the backbone of the nonlinear shear stress strain curve the modified masing s rule is adopted to obtain the soil hysteretic behavior under cyclic loads and the equations of the reloading and unloading curves can be written as 36 τ τ u r γ γ u r 1 δ g g 0 γ γ u r κ 0 τ f 37 κ 0 1 τ u r δ q τ f where γ ur and τ ur are the soil shear strain and stress at the beginning of unloading or reloading κ 0 is the modified pyke s factor pyke 1979 and signs of and represent the process of unloading and reloading respectively δ g and δ q are the shear modulus and strength degradation or hardening factors of soil for the foundation embedded in sand there is usually no gapping between the sand and the foundation when subjected to lateral loading gerolymos and gazetas 2006 however for the foundation embedded in clay in addition to the soil inelasticity the dynamic soil structure interaction also involves the separation or gapping between the foundation and the soil to account for the gapping effect the approach proposed by allotey and el naggar 2008 is incorporated in the nonlinear model mentioned above two parameters λ f and λ s are adopted to model the shape of soil hysteresis curve generated at different soil depths along the caisson or pile shaft as shown in fig 6 the reloading curve and reverse loading curve are controlled by λ f 0 λ f 1 and λ s 0 λ s 1 loading curve λ f is a reduced coefficient related to the past maximum shear stress τ ur which makes the curve produce a vertical translation λ s is a parameter controlling the shape of the curve λ f 0 or λ s 0 for a fully unconfined condition or pure gap while λ f λ s 1 for a fully confined condition at which there is no reduction for τ ur cyclic degradation or hardening behaviors should be also considered in the seismic analysis here the accumulated plastic shear strain γ p the difference between the total shear strain and the elastic shear strain is introduced into the nonlinear analytical model to simulate the cyclic hardening or degradation of soil the accumulated plastic shear strain γ p after n cycles is the sum of the plastic shear strain developed at each cycle as 38 σ x 4 γ 0 s d h 0 π s w s d tan θ s d tan θ s w s d tan θ x 2 s w s d tan θ x 2 h 0 2 2 d x 4 γ 0 h 0 tan θ π 0 s d tan θ s d tan θ x 2 x s d tan θ x 2 h 0 2 2 d x i 1 2 3 2 n 1 2 n then the degradation or hardening factor of soil can be expressed as huang and liu 2015 39 δ δ r e s 1 δ r e s e b γ p where δ represents the shear modulus factor δ g g i g 0 or the strength factor δ q τ uri τ f for clay b is a constant reflecting the degradation or hardening rate of the accumulative shear strain and δ res is the residual stiffness ratio δ gres g n g 0 or the residual strength factor δ qres τ urn τ f g 0 τ f g i τ uri and g n τ urn are the initial shear modulus strength the current shear modulus strength and the final residual shear modulus strength respectively as shown in fig 6 here the average shear strain in the soil around a pile foundation is approximately calculated as kagawa and kraft 1980 40 γ 1 υ 2 5 d 0 y where d 0 is the diameter of pile foundation and y is the displacement as mentioned above all the stiffness or damping coefficients are closely related to the shear modulus of soil and therefore the dynamic equilibrium eq 32 should be solved by iteration in fact the kinematic response of the foundation excited by the free field motion is not a symmetrical cycle during the iteration the displacement of the foundation at current time step is used to judge the state of the soil reloading or unloading first and then the soil parameters are determined according to the state of the soil 3 verification of the proposed method the centrifuge shaking table tests of the seismic response of a ccpf structure performed by zhong and huang 2014b are used to validate the proposed method as shown in fig 7 the similarity relationships of ccpf are listed in table 1 considering the centrifugal acceleration is 50 g the similarity ratio is set to 1 50 due to the different deformation mechanisms of foundation and superstructure different geometrical quantities should be considered for similar control here the lateral and rocking displacements of the caisson foundation are the main source of deformation the mass m c and inertia moment j c of the caisson foundation are used as the main control variables for the similarity ratio similarly the superstructure is also controlled by the mass and inertia moment while the pile foundation mainly takes account of the flexural rigidity e p i p and the compressive rigidity e p a p therefore the dimensions of ccpf and structure are summarized in table 2 and the dimensions of the ccpf in centrifuge test or prototype are shown in fig 7 the sandy soil is obtained in shanghai and the mean particle size d 50 of the soil is 0 07 mm the density of the soil in the centrifuge test is 1467 kg m3 the average shear wave velocity v s of the soil is 66 7 m s considering the stress level in the test accelerometers a1 a3 are used to obtain the seismic responses of the superstructure ccpf and free field respectively a seismic record often used in shanghai for the design of infrastructure is adopted as the base input motion as shown in fig 7 in order to calculate the seismic response of the ccpf structure an analytical model for ccpf structure interaction also should be established and the computational process would be divided into two steps step 1 calculating the kinematic response of the ccpf step 2 analyzing inertial response to construct a foundation structure interaction analysis model then analyze the seismic response of the ccpf structure here the kinematic response analysis of the ccpf is calculated by the proposed time domain method in section 2 the seismic response of the ccpf structure is calculated as follows fig 8 shows the seismic response analysis model of the ccpf structure in which the bottom of the model is a combined spring to simulate the stiffness of ccpf the ccpf structure will vibrate horizontally when excited by the kinematic seismic response of the ccpf for simplicity the seismic response of superstructure is investigated in frequency domain the dynamic equilibrium equation can be derived according to the resultant force and displacement compatibility conditions zhong and huang 2014a 41 k s ω 2 m u s θ s u b s θ b s 0 0 r h u b θ b d θ b where u s and θ s u bs and θ bs are the horizontal displacement and rocking angle of the superstructure and the ccpf respectively ω is the vibration circular frequency r h is the dynamic stiffness of the ccpf which equals the ratio of the resultant force on the ccpf to the displacement k s is the stiffness matrix of the ccpf structure given as 42 k s k s s k s b k b s k b b r h where m is the diagonal mass matrix of the ccpf structure given as 43 m m s s m b b all the elements of k s and m in eqs 42 and 43 can be found in appendix d after the calculations at all frequencies the seismic time history of ccpf structure can be obtained by inverse fourier transform figs 9 11 shows the measured acceleration time histories of the superstructure i e a1 the ccpf i e a2 and soil at the ground surface i e a3 in centrifuge shaking table test respectively then the acceleration time histories of the foundation calculated by the present time domain method the frequency domain method fdm in zhong and huang 2014a and the measurements in centrifuge shaking table test are compared as shown in figs 10 and 11 here the shear modulus factor δ g the strength factor δ q are assumed to be 1 for comparison with the frequency domain calculation results and shaping parameters λ f and λ s are both equal to 1 since there is usually no gapping between the sand and the foundation when subjected to lateral loading gerolymos and gazetas 2005 2006 2006 compared with the experimental results it is clear that the proposed time domain method considering soil nonlinearity provides much better predictions than the frequency domain method especially for the ccpf as expected considering soil nonlinearity will reduce the acceleration of the superstructure due to the energy dissipation caused by the soil damping it is worth noting that the dynamic equilibrium eq 41 is established based on the assumption of linearity for simplicity and this assumption of linearity in step 2 mentioned above may be the main reason for the difference between the calculation and centrifuge measurement for better illustration the fourier amplitude spectrum of acceleration for ccpf and superstructure are plotted in figs 12 and 13 it is obvious that the results calculated by the present time domain method are close to those in the centrifuge tests which also verifies the reliability of the proposed method however the results from the frequency domain method that ignores soil nonlinearity cannot well capture the seismic characteristics of the ccpf and superstructure at high frequencies both the centrifuge measurements and the proposed time domain method indicate that the fundamental frequencies of ccpf and superstructure are close to 3 65 hz i e point 4 in figs 12 and 1 66 hz i e point 3 in fig 13 respectively nevertheless the frequency domain method indicates that the fundamental frequencies of ccpf and superstructure are close to 0 97 hz i e point 2 in figs 12 and 0 97 hz i e point 2 in fig 13 respectively 4 case study ccpf for the qiongzhou strait bridge qiongzhou strait one of the three major straits in china is an important water channel between hainan island and leizhou peninsula according to the design sea crossing bridge is one of the alternatives and the ccpf is adopted as the bridge foundation as shown in fig 14 the height and the diameter of the caisson are 88 4 m and 90 m respectively the embedded depth d is 40 m the thickness of side wall of the caisson is 3 5 m while the thicknesses of top and base plates are 7 m and 12 m respectively the unit weight of the concrete caisson is 25 kn m3 the pile group comprises of 92 steel pipe piles with a pile spacing of 9 m the pile is 90 m in length and 1 8 m in diameter with a wall thickness of 30 cm the properties of soil layers surrounding the ccpf are listed in table 3 as mentioned in section 2 the shear modulus of soil around the foundation is one of the key parameters for the seismic analysis strictly the initial shear modulus and its degradation with shear strain should be obtained by in suit tests and laboratory tests yang and gu 2013 gu et al 2015b here a well recognized empirical equation based on laboratory test is used to calculate the initial shear modulus g 0 of clay hardin and drnevich 1972 44 g 0 3230 2 97 e 0 2 1 e 0 ocr k σ m 0 5 where σ m is the mean effective stress ocr is the over consolidation ratio e 0 is the void ratio of soil and k is a dimensionless parameter and depends on the plasticity index of the soil table 4 lists the initial shear modulus of the soil surrounding the ccpf the stress is calculated at the middle of the soil layer and a coefficient of lateral earth pressure at rest is assumed to be 1 sin ϕ where ϕ is the effective soil friction angle mayne and kulhawy 1982 gu et al 2015a meanwhile the hardin drnevich model is adopted to model the nonlinear shear stress strain behavior of the soil around the ccpf it was recommended that the degradation ratio δ g and δ q were in the range of 0 7 1 0 for clay vucetic and dobry 1988 allotey et al 2006 huang and liu 2015 allotey et al 2006 also suggested that λ f was in the range of 0 1 and λ s 1 meanwhile investigations indicate that λ f and λ s had a limited effect less than 10 on the predicted superstructure displacement boulanger et al 1999 allotey et al 2006 therefore it is assumed that δ g 0 8 δ q 1 0 λ f 0 2 and λ s 1 0 in this analysis strictly these values should be obtained from the laboratory tests or in suit tests such as resonant column test cyclic triaxial tests or cyclic torsional shear tests fig 15 shows the input acceleration time history and its fourier amplitude spectrum the peak input acceleration is 0 345 g and the dominant frequency is 0 58 hz according to the one dimension nonlinear site response analysis method proposed in section 2 1 the free field motion can be obtained fig 16 shows the acceleration and displacement time histories at the ground surface fig 17 shows the acceleration time histories and displacement time histories at the top center of ccpf for comparison the results calculated in time domain without considering the soil nonlinearity are also given as seen in fig 17 the seismic response of the ccpf is large in the first 15 0s which is consistent with the input motion and it shows a slight growth in the acceleration and displacement kinematic responses of ccpf when the soil nonlinearity is taken into account it should be noted that the peak acceleration and displacement of the ccpf occur at 11 4s but the peak acceleration of the input occurs at 6 9s see fig 15 this is mainly attributed to the intrinsic dynamic characteristics of the foundation and the hysteresis effect caused by the soil damping the resonant frequency of the foundation is also one of the main concerns in design fig 18 shows the fourier amplitude spectrum of the acceleration time histories of the ccpf it is obvious that there are three main peak frequencies during the seismic excitation which are consistent with the input motion in fig 15 b however the maximum fourier amplitude of input motion occurs at a frequency of 0 58 hz i e point 1 but the maximum fourier amplitude of the ccpf occurs at a frequency of 0 93 hz i e point 2 it indicates that the resonant frequency of the ccpf is close to frequency at the second peak around point 2 in fig 15 b in addition the results also indicate that the ccpf is insensitive to the excitation when the frequency is above 2 0 hz moreover the stress strain hysteresis loops of the soil in the earthquake at different soil depth around the ccpf are illustrated in fig 19 as seen in fig 19 the stress strain curves show s and oval shaped hysteresis loops due to the soil nonlinearity and the predetermined gap formation in the shear stress strain relationship meanwhile it is found that the mobilized shear strain of soil decreases as the depth increases and a maximum shear strain of about 2 0 10 3 occurs around the ccpf top it is expected that the average shear strain level in the soil is small which reasonably explains the small difference between the seismic response of ccpf obtained from elastic analyses and nonlinear analyses this also reflects the good seismic performance of the ccpf it should be noted that the shear modulus of soil is important for the dynamic response of the foundation and more reasonable values of the shear modulus factor δ g the strength factor δ q the shaping parameters λ f and λ s should be obtained from the laboratory tests or in suit tests such as resonant column test torsional shear test and cross hole wave velocity test 5 performance of ccpf under earthquake and scouring 5 1 the change of soil properties due to scour hole generally bridges usually suffer from multiple natural hazards and they are more vulnerable than under individual hazard wang et al 2014 liang et al 2020 scour effect is an important challenge for the bridge foundation which easily suffers from the wind and water waves in existing research the soil around the foundation is simply removed layer by layer to account for the scour effect during theoretical analyses liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 tu et al 2020b however the scour hole pattern is closely related to the water flow velocity water flow direction and foundation type chen 2010 wang et al 2017 with the formation of the scour hole the remaining soil undergoes an unloading stress history lin et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 liang et al 2018 therefore it is essential to propose a reasonable method to describe the change of soil stress state caused by the scour hole in calculating the seismic response of foundation under scour conditions according to the field monitoring data in taizhou yangtze river bridge it can be assumed that the scour occurs only around the caisson considering the relatively large dimension of the caisson in ccpf generally the scour hole around the foundation can be characterized by the scour width s w scour depth s d and scour hole slope angle θ as shown in fig 20 liang et al 2018 lin and lin 2020 therefore we can obtain the stress loss resulted from the scour effect as follows 45 σ m s σ m σ u l where σ m and σ m s are the mean effective stress before and after scour σ u l is the mean effective stress loss the stress loss around the caisson after scour can be obtained by the superposition method if ignoring three dimension effect the overall stress loss σ u l around the foundation can be represented by the shaded area in fig 20 which consists of a triangular and a quadrilateral scour hole therefore the σ u l of the point of interest caused by the scour hole can be expressed as 46 σ u l σ z 2 σ x 3 where σ x and σ z are the horizontal and vertical effective stress loss and can be calculated as kennedy et al 1980 47 σ z 2 γ 0 s d h 0 3 π s d tan θ 2 s w s d tan θ 1 s w s d tan θ x 2 h 0 2 2 d x 2 γ 0 h 0 3 tan θ π 0 s d tan θ x s d tan θ x 2 h 0 2 2 d x 48 σ x 4 γ 0 s d h 0 π s w s d tan θ s d tan θ s w s d tan θ x 2 s w s d tan θ x 2 h 0 2 2 d x 4 γ 0 h 0 tan θ π 0 s d tan θ s d tan θ x 2 x s d tan θ x 2 h 0 2 2 d x where γ 0 is the effective unit weight of soil before scour and h 0 is the embedded depth of the point of interest before scour as shown in fig 20 according to eq 44 the shear modulus of soil mainly depends on the void ratio and ocr of soil besides the stress state the scour erosion can be regarded as unloading process and therefore the change of void ratio δ e caused by the scour hole can be calculated in terms of the mean effective stress given by 49 δ e e 0 s e 0 κ ln σ m s σ m κ ln 1 2 k 0 γ 0 h 0 σ z 2 σ x 1 2 k 0 γ 0 h 0 where e 0 and e 0s are the void ratios before and after scour κ is the unloading index and k 0 is the lateral earth pressure coefficient at rest the ocr of the soil after scouring can be expressed as 50 o c r γ 0 h 0 γ 0 h 0 σ z then the initial shear modulus of soil after scour g 0s can be rewritten as 51 g 0 s 3230 2 97 e 0 s 2 1 e 0 s ocr k σ m s 0 5 as mentioned above in section 2 the coefficients of the distributed springs around the ccpf are closely related to the soil shear modulus which are the key parameters for calculating the kinematic seismic response of foundation once the g 0s is obtained by eq 51 then all the stiffness and damping coefficients mentioned in section 2 can be modified by the g 0s and the effect of scour hole dimensions can be obtained by substituting the modified stiffness and damping coefficients in eq 32 5 2 kinematic seismic response before and after scour here a scour hole with sd 20 m sw 10 m and angle θ 30 is adopted to investigate the effect of scour hole on the kinematic seismic response of the ccpf for the qiongzhou strait bridge fig 21 compares the acceleration time histories and displacement time histories of the ccpf before and after scour it is clear that the kinematic acceleration and displacement responses of the ccpf and superstructure obviously increase after scour meanwhile compared to the curves before scour the curves after scour shift slightly to the right of time axis this mainly attributes to higher nonlinear behavior of the soil around the foundation after scour when subjected to the same excitation as shown in fig 22 fig 22 shows the stress strain hysteresis loops of the soil at different soil depth around the ccpf as can be seen in fig 22 the calculated kinematic response of the ccpf after scour exhibits fat hysteresis loops than that of hysteresis loops in fig 19 when the soil depth is the same and the soil around pile head shows stronger nonlinear characteristics compared with the situation before scour according to the results from figs 19 and 22 the analysis model can effectively simulate both s and oval shape hysteresis loops fig 23 compares the acceleration fourier amplitude spectra of the ccpf before and after scour as seen in fig 23 the frequency corresponding to the maximum fourier amplitude decreases from 0 92 hz before scour to 0 55 hz after scour meanwhile the fourier amplitude after scour for the frequencies less than 1 0 hz significantly increases while it decreases for the frequencies larger than 1 0 hz the possible reason for this phenomenon is the decrease of main peak frequency after scour generally the fourier amplitude near the main peak frequency usually shows a larger value since the main peak frequency after scour becomes well below 1 0 hz the fourier amplitude after scour for the frequencies less than 1 0 hz decreases while it increases for the frequencies larger than 1 0 hz as expected it also clearly indicates that the stiffness of the system decreases remarkably due to the scour since the scour decreases the embedded depth and the effective stress of the remaining soil around the ccpf hence it is very important to consider the scour effect on the kinematic seismic response of the ccpf in practice it can be also found that the three main peak frequencies shift from high to low values compared to the frequencies before scour however the amplitude of the reduction is small this indicates that the dynamic characteristics at the main frequencies have changed after scour which is very important for the design of the dynamic performance of the ccpf 6 summary and conclusions in this study a nonlinear simplified analysis method in time domain was proposed to study the kinematic seismic response of the ccpf and the seismic time history can be directly used as input the reliability of the proposed method was verified by centrifuge test results the scour effect on the kinematic seismic response of the ccpf was also investigated the following conclusions can be drawn 1 a simplified analysis model for the ccpf was proposed in which the caisson is simplified as a rigid structure and the pile is assumed as an elastic beam embedded in the soil the proposed model can effectively simulate the nonlinear characteristics of the soil such as hysteresis loop and gapping the proposed time domain method considering soil nonlinearity provides a much better estimation of the acceleration time history of the ccpf than the frequency domain method without considering the soil nonlinearity soil nonlinearity will apparently reduce the acceleration response at the superstructure due to the energy dissipation caused by the soil damping 2 the resonant frequency of the ccpf for qiongzhou strait approximately ranges in 0 6 1 0 hz and the ccpf is insensitive to the excitation when its frequency is larger than 2 0 hz it was found that the difference of the seismic responses of the ccpf was smaller whether the soil nonlinearity was considered or not which is mainly attributed to the small average shear strain and good performance of the ccpf 3 the scour effect plays an important role in the kinematic seismic response of the ccpf the kinematic acceleration and displacement responses of the ccpf and superstructure obviously increase after scour meanwhile the curves after scour shift slightly to the right of time axis which is mainly attributed to higher nonlinear behavior of the soil around the foundation after scour when subjected to the same excitation the frequency corresponding to the maximum fourier amplitude decreases from 0 92 hz to 0 56 hz after scour it clearly indicates that the stiffness of the system decreases remarkably due to the scour credit authorship contribution statement wenbo tu investigation formal analysis visualization

20503,confinement can be considered as a passive method for controlling the vortex shedding behind bluff bodies however this technique is often accompanied with a considerable drag increase as a penalty this paper is aimed at investigating the effects of divergence ratio dr from 0 2 to 1 2 on flow characteristics instantaneous aerodynamic coefficients time mean drag coefficient strouhal number and rms value of lift coefficient and flow topology vorticity contour and streamlines around a confined square cylinder at a reynolds number of 100 furthermore the critical reynolds number where the onset of vortex shedding happens is determined for all diverged channels the results indicate that vortex shedding is completely suppressed for channels with 0 26 dr 0 45 for the channel with dr 0 26 a drag reduction has been achieved and the drag coefficient of the square cylinder reduces by 18 85 in comparison with that of the unbounded cylinder at re 100 furthermore the critical reynolds number which is determined to be 49 for the unconfined square cylinder is delayed to 101 in this channel it is also found that the drag coefficient the rms value of lift coefficient and strouhal number increase with divergence ratio while the vortex formation length and the wake width generally decrease keywords bluff body vortex shedding suppression confinement passive control diverged channel square cylinder 1 introduction vortex shedding behind bluff bodies has been the focus of many studies over recent decades owing to its fundamental significance and practical importance in industry and technology when the reynolds number exceeds a critical value vortex shedding appears in the wake of bluff bodies and a significant pressure drop is reported on the rear surface of the body this in turn could cause serious structural vibrations surface waves enhanced mixing acoustic noise and resonance and a considerable increase in the values of mean drag and also in lift fluctuations choi et al 2008 viero et al 2017 therefore vortex shedding is considered as a detrimental phenomenon and actions have to be taken to mitigate its disadvantages these actions are mainly classified as active and passive flow control methods in active flow control external energy by a powered device such as plasma actuators konstantinidis 2019 fluidic oscillators raghu 2013 woszidlo et al 2019 or mechanical actuators cattafestaiii et al 2001 schulmeister et al 2017 is imposed to the fluid flow on the other hand passive techniques rely on manipulating the flow by geometry modification using strips zhu et al 2018 slits mishra et al 2020 porous coatings sadeghipour et al 2020 vortex generators wang et al 2019 and etc compared to active flow control techniques passive methods are simpler and there is no need to input energy into the flow field assi et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 there are shear number of papers regarding the active and passive control of bluff body wakes which have been comprehensively reviewed by rashidi et al 2016 and gursul and wang 2018 confinement is one method to passively controlling the fluid flow around bluff bodies many investigations have been done to reveal the effects of confinement on flow characteristics and topology around bluff bodies it has been found that vortex shedding could be suppressed by confinement however with a drag penalty deepakkumar and jayavel 2018 turki et al 2003 highlighted the critical reynolds number increases when the square cylinder is confined effects of blockage ratio br ratio of the cylinder width to the channel height ranging from 0 1 to 0 9 on flow features around a confined circular cylinder were investigated by sahin and owens 2004 sharma and eswaran 2004a revealed that the drag coefficient pumping power and nusselt number of a square cylinder increase with increasing blockage ratio furthermore the root mean square rms value of lift coefficient decreases with blockage ratios from 0 1 to 0 3 followed by an increase under blockage ratios from 0 3 to 0 5 kumar de and dalal 2006 found that physics of flow around a confined triangular cylinder are similar to the unbounded case for low values of blockage ratio furthermore the rms value of lift coefficient increases with increasing blockage ratio patil and tiwari 2008 stated that the vortex formation length is generally reduced with increasing blockage ratio while the wake width has a downward trend until blockage ratio of 0 4 effects of asymmetric confinement were numerically studied by mettu et al 2006 for different values of reynolds number gap ratio and blockage ratio rehimi et al 2008 experimentally discovered the critical reynolds number is delayed from re 47 in the unbounded case to re 108 when a circular cylinder is centered between parallel walls three dimensional stability of a confined circular cylinder wake was analyzed by camarri and giannetti 2010 and griffith et al 2011 singha and sinhamahapatra 2010 showed that the strouhal number st increases with the blockage ratio while in contrast to kumar de and dalal 2006 the rms value of lift coefficient is reduced with the help of three dimensional direct numerical simulation mode a mode b and vortex dislocations were detected by kanaris et al 2011 behind a confined circular cylinder under a blockage ratio of 0 2 channel confinement and rotation were shown by prasad et al 2011 to have a stabilizing effect on the fluid flow which could be employed as a flow control method reyes et al 2013 experimentally proved that transition from the steady flow regime to the laminar vortex shedding behind a confined square cylinder does not occur abruptly and there is a reynolds number range where the recirculation bubble pulsates before the onset of vortex shedding investigation of the flow characteristics around a semi circular cylinder was the aim of the study conducted by kumar and dhiman 2015 they found that the length of recirculation region is reduced with increasing blockage ratio while it increases with reynolds number new et al 2015 revealed that the vortex formation length behind a confined wavy cylinder is shorter than the unbounded case by analyzing the fluid flow around a confined d shaped cylinder bhadauriya et al 2018 pointed out that the drag coefficient and strouhal number increase with blockage ratio while the rms value of lift coefficient decreases analysis of the fluid flow around a circular cylinder confined in a channel with a local waviness was the goal of research performed by deepakkumar and jayavel 2018 they revealed that not only the vortex shedding could be suppressed by this passive technique but also the drag coefficient decreases wang et al 2018 focused on flow features around a circular cylinder confined in a sudden expansion channel and investigated the effects of reynolds number cylinder position and the expansion ratio of the channel nie and lin 2019 highlighted that the critical reynolds number of a semi circular cylinder is lower than a full circular cylinder at a blockage ratio of 0 2 arumuru et al 2020 expressed that the vortex formation length and the wake width behind a circular cylinder placed in a circular pipe reduce at a high blockage ratio because of the acceleration of the pipe wall boundary layer ooi et al 2020 clarified the fluctuating lift force decreases with blockage ratio and reaches a zero value for the blockage ratio of 0 7 0 8 followed by a dramatic increase at a blockage ratio of around 0 9 by conducting experimental research around a circular cylinder placed in a channel vyas et al 2020 concluded that confinement has considerable effects on the size of the vortices and vortex shedding frequencies more details of studies discussed above are provided in table 1 to summarize although vortex shedding behind bluff bodies could be suppressed with confinement in some blockage ratios the drag coefficient significantly increases therefore serious doubts may be raised about the efficiency of bluff body confinement as a passive flow control method this problem is solved in the present research by confining the bluff body in a diverged channel the main objective of this paper is to numerically investigate the effects of divergence ratio from 0 2 to 1 2 on flow characteristics and topology around a square cylinder at re 100 furthermore critical reynolds number where the onset of vortex shedding happens is determined for all diverged channels the outcomes are compared to the unbounded square cylinder to highlight differences 2 methodology 2 1 problem definition the main focus of this paper is to assess the effects of divergence ratio on flow characteristics around a confined square cylinder with a side length of d divergence ratio is defined as the ratio of inlet length h i to outlet length h e in this research channels with dr 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 are chosen and are compared to the conventional confined square cylinder with dr 1 the ratio of the side length of the cylinder to inlet length is named as the entrance blockage ratio br e d h i and is equal to 0 5 for all confined cases in other words the divergence ratio is set by only changing the outlet length while the inlet length is constant it should be mentioned that the blockage ratio increases roughly with increment of the divergence ratio since the channel walls approach closer to the cylinder in order to evaluate the effects of convergency a channel with dr 1 2 is also taken into consideration the reynolds number is defined as re ρu d μ where ρ u and μ are density the uniform velocity at the inlet and dynamic viscosity respectively flow characteristics of all aforementioned cases are compared to the unbounded square cylinder at re 100 and also at the critical reynolds number 2 2 computational domain boundary conditions and mesh generation as shown in fig 1 the center of the square cylinder is placed 20d downstream of the inlet and is 40d away from the outlet to ensure the results are not affected by inlet and outlet boundaries the no slip boundary condition is imposed at walls of the channel and also surfaces of the cylinder there exist many applications of the confined flow that have used either a uniform that can be achieved using a bell month inlet piece for example or a parabolic velocity profile for a fully developed laminar flow as the inlet boundary condition mondal et al 2020 suzuki et al 1993 a parabolic velocity profile is implemented to provide a fully developed condition mettu et al 2006 sharma and eswaran 2004a however similar to zheng and alam 2017 mondal et al 2020 and chakraborty et al 2004 a uniform velocity profile velocity inlet is considered in this research as the inlet boundary condition while a constant pressure pressure outlet is used for the outlet boundary condition it should be mentioned that in the unbounded case the upper and lower boundaries are 10d away from the center of the cylinder while the inlet and outlet boundaries are placed 80d and 100d upstream and downstream of the center of the cylinder respectively as represented in fig 2 a high quality structured mesh is generated inside the channel and around the cylinder using gambit software the first cell lies 0 0001d away from the square surfaces and walls of the channel furthermore the mesh intensity around the rigid boundaries is high enough to capture all characteristics 2 3 governing equations and numerical method in this research two dimensional incompressible viscous and laminar fluid flow inside the channel and around the cylinder is governed by continuity and momentum equations represented in their non dimensional form as follows 1 u x v y 0 2 u t u u x v u y p x 1 re 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 3 v t u v x v v y p y 1 re 2 v x 2 2 v y 2 where u u u and v v u are the velocity components in the x x d and y y d directions respectively also p p ρu 2 denotes the pressure and t tu d signifies the time these equations are solved numerically based on the finite volume method in ansys fluent software convective terms are discretized by the second order upwind scheme and the second order implicit scheme is used for the temporal discretization simple algorithm is also employed for the pressure velocity coupling the solution is converged in each time step when the residuals for continuity x and y momentum components become less than 10 6 2 4 mesh and time independency studies mesh independency study is conducted to make assurance the obtained results are not under influence of the mesh size to exclude mesh dependency aerodynamic characteristics of the unbounded square cylinder are modeled at a reynolds number of 100 with different mesh sizes and compared to each other as tabulated in table 2 aerodynamic characteristics do not change significantly when the number of grid cell increases from 82 400 to 118 656 therefore in order to prevent a high computational cost the mesh with size of 82 400 is picked out as the best case time independency study is also done to analyze the sensitivity of the results to time step finally by weighing the accuracy of the results against the computational cost in table 3 a time step of 0 01 is chosen 2 5 validation to validate the numerical results aerodynamic parameters of the unbounded square cylinder obtained from the present study under unsteady flow are compared to those of sharma and eswaran 2004b at various reynolds numbers ranging from 60 to 140 as can be seen in fig 3 the present results accurately follow those of sharma and eswaran 2004b maximum and minimum average errors are those of lift coefficient rms 3 57 and drag coefficient 1 respectively furthermore aerodynamic parameters of the square cylinder confined in a channel with dr 1 and br 0 5 is compared to those of sharma and eswaran 2004a under unsteady flow at re 100 in table 4 according to this table results of the present study agree well with those of sharma and eswaran 2004a 3 results and discussion results obtained from the 2d numerical simulation of the fluid flow around the square cylinder confined in diverged channels are presented herein in two sections the first section is devoted to investigate the effects of divergence ratio on flow characteristics and topology around the cylinder at a reynolds number of 100 the second section deals with determination of the critical reynolds number for all cases 3 1 effects of divergence ratio instantaneous aerodynamic coefficients for the square cylinder confined in a channel with different divergence ratios are plotted in fig 4 in order to properly investigate the effects of confinement on flow characteristics the unbounded case where the square cylinder in not confined is also analyzed and compared to other confined cases according to fig 4 periodical variations of the lift coefficient c l f l 0 5ρdu 2 where f l is lift force n and the drag coefficient c d f d 0 5ρdu 2 where f d signifies drag force n imply the vortex shedding behind the square cylinder in order to reveal the flow physics during the vortex shedding vorticity contours and streamlines are demonstrated in fig 5 for the unbounded cylinder and confined cases with dr 1 2 1 and 0 8 as shown in fig 5 a negative and positive vortices shed from the upper and lower portions of the cylinder respectively and move away from the centerline while going downstream singha and sinhamahapatra 2010 according to sharma and eswaran 2004b the vortex shedding starts from the upper side of the cylinder while the fluid flow at the bottom side tends to penetrate the recirculation region with regards to streamlines penetration of the fluid from lower and upper sides of the cylinder into left and right sides of the recirculation region leads to the formation of a vortex at the upper side behind the cylinder which goes downstream with time conversely when the fluid from the upper and lower sides of the cylinder is drawn into the left and right sides of the recirculation region a vortex is created at the lower side behind the cylinder the model of streamlines presented here is in accordance to sharma and eswaran 2004b and eaton 1987 where the center and saddle of a shedding vortex approach each other and disappear before a new vortex is shed according to fig 4 and similar to past studies the drag coefficient and strouhal number st f d u where f is the frequency of vortex shedding s 1 significantly increase when the square cylinder is confined in a channel with dr 1 as shown in fig 5 b the drag penalty is accompanied with a considerable vortex shedding control the most important feature in a confined bluff body is generation of the opposite sign wall vorticity therefore four types of vortices could be traced in the wake of a confined square cylinder two types of such vortices result from the upper and lower sides of the cylinder and the other two types form due to the upper and lower channel walls interactions between the negative shear layer of the cylinder nc and the positive shear layer of the wall pw on the one hand and those between the cylinder s positive shear layer pc and the negative shear layer of the wall nw on the other hand are the main reasons of the vortex shedding dissipation sharma and eswaran 2004a according to deepakkumar and jayavel 2018 and griffith et al 2011 inversion of the vortex street where a vortex formed on one side of the cylinder reaches the opposite channel s wall downstream is identified for the confined square cylinder similar to sharma and eswaran 2004a streamlines in fig 5 b indicate small recirculation regions at channel walls which result from the flow oscillation during vortex shedding with an increase in divergence ratio to dr 1 2 the drag coefficient goes up by 30 51 while the strouhal number increases by 13 as shown in fig 5 c this increment in drag coefficient could be ascribed to an increase in obstruction of the fluid flow due to the approach of the channel walls closer to the cylinder resulting in a steeper velocity gradient mettu et al 2006 furthermore the vorticity generated by the channel walls becomes more significant with an increase in blockage ratio patil and tiwari 2008 it should be reminded that blockage ratio of the channel increases roughly with the increase of divergence ratio since the walls approach closer to the cylinder on the other hand the drag coefficient is reduced by 28 97 with a decrease in divergence ratio from 1 to 0 8 moreover the wall recirculation regions in dr 0 8 are slightly smaller than those in dr 1 which is in accordance to what sharma and eswaran 2004a pointed out a decreasing trend in the fluctuation amplitude of lift and drag coefficients proceeds with a further decrease in channel s divergence ratio to 0 6 in fig 4 surprisingly for the divergence ratio below 0 6 the fluctuations of lift and drag coefficients disappear meaning that the vortex shedding is suppressed for the channel with dr 0 4 and the fluid flow turns out to be the steady however for the divergence ratio of 0 2 the fluctuations in lift and drag coefficients appear again though their amplitudes are very small simulations are further extended to identify the critical divergence ratio range in which the vortex shedding is completely suppressed here the divergence ratio is increased from 0 2 to 0 6 with a step of 0 01 to find out the critical zone in this exercise dr 0 26 and dr 0 45 are determined as the lower and upper critical divergence ratios respectively where the vortex shedding disappears in their between to analyze what exactly is happening to the fluid flow for 0 2 dr 0 6 vorticity contours together with streamlines are illustrated in fig 6 according to this figure two stationary counter rotating symmetrically vortices are detected in the steady wake behind the square cylinder confined in channels with critical divergence ratios the size of these vortices generally decreases with increasing divergence ratio on the other hand the vorticity at the walls of channels with dr 0 2 and dr 0 6 which are beyond the critical range appears to be asymmetry and the fluid flow behaves unsteadily this unsteadiness could be justified by depicting the pressure coefficient diagram c p p p 0 5ρu 2 where p is freestream pressure pa along the top wall of channels and also by plotting the normalized x component velocity at the streamwise centerline of channels in fig 7 a and fig 7 b respectively as can be seen in fig 7 a the boundary layer at the top wall of channels with dr 0 2 and dr 0 6 is distorted by the flow oscillations and as a result a small recirculation region is formed at the channel top wall which makes the pressure coefficient fluctuated however the pressure coefficient for channels in the critical divergence ratio range is not fluctuated according to fig 7 b velocity increases initially at the centerline of all channels and reaches a maximum value and then decreases this peak value occurs more downstream as the divergence ratio increases oscillation of the streamwise velocity for dr 0 2 and 0 6 indicates the unsteady nature of the fluid flow and shedding of vortices in these channels this feature however is not observed for the channels in the critical divergence ratio range where the fluid flow is steady time mean drag coefficient rms value of lift coefficient and strouhal number of the square cylinder confined in diverged channels and the unbounded cylinder are depicted in fig 8 at re 100 according to this figure the strouhal number and rms value of lift coefficient are reduced with a decrease in the value of divergence ratio furthermore the drag coefficient is almost monotonically reduced with a decrease in divergence ratio and interestingly its value becomes less than the unbounded case at dr 0 26 therefore dr 0 26 is nominated as the most efficient divergence ratio owing to this fact that the drag coefficient of the square cylinder in this channel is 18 85 less than that in the unbounded case while experiencing no vortex shedding this outcome would be of high importance since past studies remarked the increased drag coefficient in a confined channel as a side effect therefore diverged channels could be taken into consideration as an efficient method for passively controlling the fluid flow behind bluff bodies effects of divergence ratio on the vortex formation length l f and the wake width w behind the square cylinder confined in diverged channels and the unbounded cylinder are shown in fig 9 at t 4 t is the vortex shedding period and re 100 according to new et al 2015 the vortex formation length is defined as the distance between the leeward side of the cylinder and the location at the streamwise centerline where the x component velocity reaches a zero value the wake width herein is defined as the peak to peak distance of the x component velocity in normalwise direction at the vortex formation length according to fig 9 and similar to patil and tiwari 2008 and sharma and eswaran 2004a the vortex formation length is generally reduced with increasing divergence ratio furthermore the wake width reduces with an increase in divergence ratio which causes the karman vortex street to be narrowed deepakkumar and jayavel 2018 it should be mentioned that the wake width of the unbounded square cylinder is much higher than the confined cases while the value of its vortex formation length is close to the channel with dr 0 6 3 2 determination of critical reynolds number when the reynolds number reaches the critical value the steady wake behind the cylinder starts to oscillate and the fluid flow becomes unsteady goharzadeh and molki 2014 as a consequence the shedding of large and spanwise vortices from the rear surface is yielded gibeau and ghaemi 2020 the transition to vortex shedding begins with the opening of the recirculation region and then penetrating of instant alleyways of the fluid into the recirculation region perry et al 1982 the onset of vortex shedding behind the unbounded square cylinder takes place at re 49 in the present study which is in the range of 45 re 50 reported by patil and tiwari 2008 however there exists a controversy about the value of the critical reynolds number for the confined square cylinder patil and tiwari 2008 sharma and eswaran 2004a suzuki et al 1993 for example it was found by patil and tiwari 2008 that the critical reynolds number for the square cylinder constrained in a channel with dr 1 is equal to 42 while it was proposed to be 65 by sharma and eswaran 2004a however this value is determined to be 71 in the present study the discrepancy involving the critical reynolds number is attributed to differences in the numerical methodology sharma and eswaran 2004a fig 10 shows that the critical reynolds number increases with divergence ratio initially and reaches a peak of 104 at dr 0 4 followed by a monotonic reduction to 62 at dr 1 2 this behavior is in accordance to past studies conducted by sharma and eswaran 2004a and patil and tiwari 2008 where the critical reynolds number had firstly upward and then downward trends with blockage ratio sharma and eswaran 2004a revealed that the channel walls at low values of blockage ratio impart stability to the fluid flow however after reaching a critical blockage ratio the fluid flow becomes unstable due to the interaction of the channel walls and the cylinder it is worth mentioning that the critical reynolds number in a diverged channel is higher than the unbounded case as well as the channel with dr 1 which could be considered as a positive point moreover the critical reynolds number of the most efficient channel dr 0 26 is 42 25 higher than the straight channel and around two time more than the unbounded case instantaneous aerodynamic coefficients of the square cylinder confined in diverged channels and the unbounded cylinder at the critical reynolds number are depicted in fig 11 as can be seen the fluctuation amplitude of lift and drag coefficients generally goes up with increasing divergence ratio up to dr 1 moreover the wavelength of the lift coefficient decreases with an increase in divergence ratio resulting in increment of the strouhal number spanwise vorticity contours of the square cylinder confined in diverged channels and the unbounded cylinder are represented in fig 12 at t 4 and the critical reynolds number with regards to the unbounded cylinder shedding of vortices in the near wake region becomes to an almost parallel shear flow at the far wake zone moreover shear layers of the cylinder in all cases are considerably stretched in the streamwise direction in comparison to re 100 however the stretch length of shear layers decreases with an increase in divergence ratio streamlines around the square cylinder confined in diverged channels and the unbounded cylinder are shown in fig 13 at t 4 and the critical reynolds number in contrast to the unbounded case two recirculation regions are found behind the confined square cylinder however the streamwise distance between these two recirculation regions is reduced with increasing divergence ratio in addition very small recirculation regions could be identified at the channel walls the time mean drag coefficient rms value of lift coefficient and strouhal number of the square cylinder confined in diverged channels and the unbounded cylinder are plotted in fig 14 at the critical reynolds number according to this figure the drag coefficient and the strouhal number of the square cylinder experience a non linearly increase with divergence ratio this trend also happens for rms value of lift coefficient until dr 1 where it reaches a peak of around 0 15 after that it reduces to about 0 13 at dr 1 2 it is worth mentioning that the strouhal number and rms value of lift coefficient at the critical reynolds number are lower than those at re 100 while generally an adverse trend is reported for the drag coefficient this difference in the drag coefficient is more profound at higher divergence ratios furthermore the drag coefficient of the most efficient channel dr 0 26 is almost 27 27 less than the drag coefficient of the unbounded cylinder at the critical reynolds number the vortex formation length and the wake width of the square cylinder confined in diverged channels and the unbounded cylinder are shown in fig 15 at t 4 and the critical reynolds number according to this figure both these parameters decrease when the divergence ratio increases however the range of variation in low values of divergence ratio is more sensible as expected the wake width of the unbounded square cylinder is much higher than the confined cylinder due to the absence of channel walls on the other hand the vortex formation length behind the unbounded cylinder which was close to dr 0 6 case at re 100 considerably increases and reaches a value of 2 87 at the critical reynolds number 4 conclusion this paper investigated the effects of divergence ratio on flow characteristics and structure around a confined square cylinder at a reynolds number of 100 and compared them to the unbounded square cylinder furthermore the critical reynolds number where the onset of vortex shedding takes place was determined for all tested cases the main findings of this study can be summarized as follows vortex shedding is completely suppressed for 0 26 dr 0 45 at re 100 the channel with dr 0 26 is a special case because not only vortex shedding is suppressed but also the drag coefficient of the square cylinder in this channel is 18 85 and 27 27 lower than the unbounded cylinder at re 100 and the critical reynolds number respectively furthermore its critical reynolds number is almost two times larger than the unbounded cylinder the drag coefficient rms value of lift coefficient and strouhal number generally increase with divergence ratio at both re 100 and the critical reynolds number the vortex formation length and the wake width generally decrease with divergence ratio at both re 100 and the critical reynolds number the critical reynolds number increases with divergence ratio and reaches a peak at dr 0 4 after which it reduces to 62 at dr 1 2 furthermore the critical reynolds number of the square cylinder confined in diverged channels is higher than that in the conventional channel with dr 1 and also the

20503,confinement can be considered as a passive method for controlling the vortex shedding behind bluff bodies however this technique is often accompanied with a considerable drag increase as a penalty this paper is aimed at investigating the effects of divergence ratio dr from 0 2 to 1 2 on flow characteristics instantaneous aerodynamic coefficients time mean drag coefficient strouhal number and rms value of lift coefficient and flow topology vorticity contour and streamlines around a confined square cylinder at a reynolds number of 100 furthermore the critical reynolds number where the onset of vortex shedding happens is determined for all diverged channels the results indicate that vortex shedding is completely suppressed for channels with 0 26 dr 0 45 for the channel with dr 0 26 a drag reduction has been achieved and the drag coefficient of the square cylinder reduces by 18 85 in comparison with that of the unbounded cylinder at re 100 furthermore the critical reynolds number which is determined to be 49 for the unconfined square cylinder is delayed to 101 in this channel it is also found that the drag coefficient the rms value of lift coefficient and strouhal number increase with divergence ratio while the vortex formation length and the wake width generally decrease keywords bluff body vortex shedding suppression confinement passive control diverged channel square cylinder 1 introduction vortex shedding behind bluff bodies has been the focus of many studies over recent decades owing to its fundamental significance and practical importance in industry and technology when the reynolds number exceeds a critical value vortex shedding appears in the wake of bluff bodies and a significant pressure drop is reported on the rear surface of the body this in turn could cause serious structural vibrations surface waves enhanced mixing acoustic noise and resonance and a considerable increase in the values of mean drag and also in lift fluctuations choi et al 2008 viero et al 2017 therefore vortex shedding is considered as a detrimental phenomenon and actions have to be taken to mitigate its disadvantages these actions are mainly classified as active and passive flow control methods in active flow control external energy by a powered device such as plasma actuators konstantinidis 2019 fluidic oscillators raghu 2013 woszidlo et al 2019 or mechanical actuators cattafestaiii et al 2001 schulmeister et al 2017 is imposed to the fluid flow on the other hand passive techniques rely on manipulating the flow by geometry modification using strips zhu et al 2018 slits mishra et al 2020 porous coatings sadeghipour et al 2020 vortex generators wang et al 2019 and etc compared to active flow control techniques passive methods are simpler and there is no need to input energy into the flow field assi et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 there are shear number of papers regarding the active and passive control of bluff body wakes which have been comprehensively reviewed by rashidi et al 2016 and gursul and wang 2018 confinement is one method to passively controlling the fluid flow around bluff bodies many investigations have been done to reveal the effects of confinement on flow characteristics and topology around bluff bodies it has been found that vortex shedding could be suppressed by confinement however with a drag penalty deepakkumar and jayavel 2018 turki et al 2003 highlighted the critical reynolds number increases when the square cylinder is confined effects of blockage ratio br ratio of the cylinder width to the channel height ranging from 0 1 to 0 9 on flow features around a confined circular cylinder were investigated by sahin and owens 2004 sharma and eswaran 2004a revealed that the drag coefficient pumping power and nusselt number of a square cylinder increase with increasing blockage ratio furthermore the root mean square rms value of lift coefficient decreases with blockage ratios from 0 1 to 0 3 followed by an increase under blockage ratios from 0 3 to 0 5 kumar de and dalal 2006 found that physics of flow around a confined triangular cylinder are similar to the unbounded case for low values of blockage ratio furthermore the rms value of lift coefficient increases with increasing blockage ratio patil and tiwari 2008 stated that the vortex formation length is generally reduced with increasing blockage ratio while the wake width has a downward trend until blockage ratio of 0 4 effects of asymmetric confinement were numerically studied by mettu et al 2006 for different values of reynolds number gap ratio and blockage ratio rehimi et al 2008 experimentally discovered the critical reynolds number is delayed from re 47 in the unbounded case to re 108 when a circular cylinder is centered between parallel walls three dimensional stability of a confined circular cylinder wake was analyzed by camarri and giannetti 2010 and griffith et al 2011 singha and sinhamahapatra 2010 showed that the strouhal number st increases with the blockage ratio while in contrast to kumar de and dalal 2006 the rms value of lift coefficient is reduced with the help of three dimensional direct numerical simulation mode a mode b and vortex dislocations were detected by kanaris et al 2011 behind a confined circular cylinder under a blockage ratio of 0 2 channel confinement and rotation were shown by prasad et al 2011 to have a stabilizing effect on the fluid flow which could be employed as a flow control method reyes et al 2013 experimentally proved that transition from the steady flow regime to the laminar vortex shedding behind a confined square cylinder does not occur abruptly and there is a reynolds number range where the recirculation bubble pulsates before the onset of vortex shedding investigation of the flow characteristics around a semi circular cylinder was the aim of the study conducted by kumar and dhiman 2015 they found that the length of recirculation region is reduced with increasing blockage ratio while it increases with reynolds number new et al 2015 revealed that the vortex formation length behind a confined wavy cylinder is shorter than the unbounded case by analyzing the fluid flow around a confined d shaped cylinder bhadauriya et al 2018 pointed out that the drag coefficient and strouhal number increase with blockage ratio while the rms value of lift coefficient decreases analysis of the fluid flow around a circular cylinder confined in a channel with a local waviness was the goal of research performed by deepakkumar and jayavel 2018 they revealed that not only the vortex shedding could be suppressed by this passive technique but also the drag coefficient decreases wang et al 2018 focused on flow features around a circular cylinder confined in a sudden expansion channel and investigated the effects of reynolds number cylinder position and the expansion ratio of the channel nie and lin 2019 highlighted that the critical reynolds number of a semi circular cylinder is lower than a full circular cylinder at a blockage ratio of 0 2 arumuru et al 2020 expressed that the vortex formation length and the wake width behind a circular cylinder placed in a circular pipe reduce at a high blockage ratio because of the acceleration of the pipe wall boundary layer ooi et al 2020 clarified the fluctuating lift force decreases with blockage ratio and reaches a zero value for the blockage ratio of 0 7 0 8 followed by a dramatic increase at a blockage ratio of around 0 9 by conducting experimental research around a circular cylinder placed in a channel vyas et al 2020 concluded that confinement has considerable effects on the size of the vortices and vortex shedding frequencies more details of studies discussed above are provided in table 1 to summarize although vortex shedding behind bluff bodies could be suppressed with confinement in some blockage ratios the drag coefficient significantly increases therefore serious doubts may be raised about the efficiency of bluff body confinement as a passive flow control method this problem is solved in the present research by confining the bluff body in a diverged channel the main objective of this paper is to numerically investigate the effects of divergence ratio from 0 2 to 1 2 on flow characteristics and topology around a square cylinder at re 100 furthermore critical reynolds number where the onset of vortex shedding happens is determined for all diverged channels the outcomes are compared to the unbounded square cylinder to highlight differences 2 methodology 2 1 problem definition the main focus of this paper is to assess the effects of divergence ratio on flow characteristics around a confined square cylinder with a side length of d divergence ratio is defined as the ratio of inlet length h i to outlet length h e in this research channels with dr 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 are chosen and are compared to the conventional confined square cylinder with dr 1 the ratio of the side length of the cylinder to inlet length is named as the entrance blockage ratio br e d h i and is equal to 0 5 for all confined cases in other words the divergence ratio is set by only changing the outlet length while the inlet length is constant it should be mentioned that the blockage ratio increases roughly with increment of the divergence ratio since the channel walls approach closer to the cylinder in order to evaluate the effects of convergency a channel with dr 1 2 is also taken into consideration the reynolds number is defined as re ρu d μ where ρ u and μ are density the uniform velocity at the inlet and dynamic viscosity respectively flow characteristics of all aforementioned cases are compared to the unbounded square cylinder at re 100 and also at the critical reynolds number 2 2 computational domain boundary conditions and mesh generation as shown in fig 1 the center of the square cylinder is placed 20d downstream of the inlet and is 40d away from the outlet to ensure the results are not affected by inlet and outlet boundaries the no slip boundary condition is imposed at walls of the channel and also surfaces of the cylinder there exist many applications of the confined flow that have used either a uniform that can be achieved using a bell month inlet piece for example or a

considered in this research as the inlet boundary condition while a constant pressure pressure outlet is used for the outlet boundary condition it should be mentioned that in the unbounded case the upper and lower boundaries are 10d away from the center of the cylinder while the inlet and outlet boundaries are placed 80d and 100d upstream and downstream of the center of the cylinder respectively as represented in fig 2 a high quality structured mesh is generated inside the channel and around the cylinder using gambit software the first cell lies 0 0001d away from the square surfaces and walls of the channel furthermore the mesh intensity around the rigid boundaries is high enough to capture all characteristics 2 3 governing equations and numerical method in this research two dimensional incompressible viscous and laminar fluid flow inside the channel and around the cylinder is governed by continuity and momentum equations represented in their non dimensional form as follows 1 u x v y

present results accurately follow those of sharma and eswaran 2004b maximum and minimum average errors are those of lift coefficient rms 3 57 and drag coefficient 1 respectively furthermore aerodynamic parameters of the square cylinder confined in a channel with dr 1 and br 0 5 is compared to those of sharma and eswaran 2004a under unsteady flow at re 100 in table 4 according to this table results of the present study agree well with those of sharma and eswaran 2004a 3 results and discussion results obtained from the 2d numerical simulation of the fluid flow around the square cylinder confined in diverged channels are presented herein in two sections the first section is devoted to investigate the effects of divergence ratio on flow characteristics and topology around the cylinder at a reynolds number of 100 the second section deals with determination of the critical reynolds number for all cases 3 1 effects of divergence ratio instantaneous aerodynamic coefficients for the square cylinder confined in a channel with different divergence ratios are plotted in fig 4 in order to properly investigate the effects of confinement on flow characteristics the unbounded case where the square cylinder in not confined is also analyzed and compared to other confined cases according to fig 4 periodical variations of the lift coefficient c l f l 0 5ρdu 2 where f l is lift force n and the drag coefficient c d f d 0 5ρdu 2 where f d signifies drag force n imply the vortex shedding behind the square cylinder in order to reveal the flow physics during the vortex shedding vorticity contours and streamlines are demonstrated in fig 5 for the unbounded cylinder and confined cases with dr 1 2 1 and 0 8 as shown in fig 5 a negative and positive vortices shed from the upper and lower portions of the cylinder respectively and move away from the centerline while going downstream singha and sinhamahapatra 2010 according to sharma and eswaran 2004b the vortex shedding starts from the upper side of the cylinder while the fluid flow at the bottom side tends to penetrate the recirculation region with regards to streamlines penetration of the fluid from lower and upper sides of the cylinder into left and right sides of the recirculation region leads to the formation of a vortex at the upper side behind the cylinder which goes downstream with time conversely when the fluid from the upper and lower sides of the cylinder is drawn into the left and right sides of the recirculation region a vortex is created at the lower side behind the cylinder the model of streamlines presented here is in accordance to sharma and eswaran 2004b and eaton 1987 where the center and saddle of a shedding vortex approach each other and disappear before a new vortex is shed according to fig 4 and similar to past studies the drag coefficient and strouhal number st f d u where f is the frequency of vortex shedding s 1 significantly increase when the square cylinder is confined in a channel with dr 1 as shown in fig 5 b the drag penalty is accompanied with a considerable vortex shedding control the most important feature in a confined bluff body is generation of the opposite sign wall vorticity therefore four types of vortices could be traced in the wake of a confined square cylinder two types of such vortices result from the upper and lower sides of the cylinder and the other two types form due to the upper and lower channel walls interactions between the negative shear layer of the cylinder nc and the positive shear layer of the wall pw on the one hand and those between the cylinder s positive shear layer pc and the negative shear layer of the wall nw on the other hand are the main reasons of the vortex shedding dissipation sharma and eswaran 2004a according to deepakkumar and jayavel 2018 and griffith et al 2011 inversion of the vortex street where a vortex formed on one side of the cylinder reaches the opposite channel s wall downstream is identified for the confined square cylinder similar to sharma and eswaran 2004a streamlines in fig 5 b indicate small recirculation regions at channel walls which result from the flow oscillation during vortex shedding with an increase in divergence ratio to dr 1 2 the drag coefficient goes up by 30 51 while the strouhal number increases by 13 as shown in fig 5 c this increment in drag coefficient could be ascribed to an increase in obstruction of the fluid flow due to the approach of the channel walls closer to the cylinder resulting in a steeper velocity gradient mettu et al 2006 furthermore the vorticity generated by the channel walls becomes more significant with an increase in blockage ratio patil and tiwari 2008 it should be reminded that blockage ratio of the channel increases roughly with the increase of divergence ratio since the walls approach closer to the cylinder on the other hand the drag coefficient is reduced by 28 97 with a decrease in divergence ratio from 1 to 0 8 moreover the wall recirculation regions in dr 0 8 are slightly smaller than those in dr 1 which is in accordance to what sharma and eswaran 2004a pointed out a decreasing trend in the fluctuation amplitude of lift and drag coefficients proceeds with a further decrease in channel s divergence ratio to 0 6 in fig 4 surprisingly for the divergence ratio below 0 6 the fluctuations of lift and drag coefficients disappear meaning that the vortex shedding is suppressed for the channel with dr 0 4 and the fluid flow turns out to be the steady however for the divergence ratio of 0 2 the fluctuations in lift and drag coefficients appear again though their amplitudes are very small simulations are further extended to identify the critical divergence ratio range in which the vortex shedding is completely suppressed here the divergence ratio is increased from 0 2 to 0 6 with a step of 0 01 to find out the critical zone in this exercise dr 0 26 and dr 0 45 are determined as the lower and upper critical divergence ratios respectively where the vortex shedding disappears in their between to analyze what exactly is happening to the fluid flow for 0 2 dr 0 6 vorticity contours together with streamlines are illustrated in fig 6 according to this figure two stationary counter rotating symmetrically vortices are detected in the steady wake behind the square cylinder confined in channels with critical divergence ratios the size of these vortices generally decreases with increasing divergence ratio on the other hand the vorticity at the walls of channels with dr 0 2 and dr 0 6 which are beyond the critical range appears to be asymmetry and the fluid flow behaves unsteadily this unsteadiness could be justified by depicting the pressure coefficient diagram c p p p 0 5ρu 2 where p is freestream pressure pa along the top wall of channels and also by plotting the normalized x component velocity at the streamwise centerline of channels in fig 7 a and fig 7 b respectively as can be seen in fig 7 a the boundary layer at the top wall of channels with dr 0 2 and dr 0 6 is distorted by the flow oscillations and as a result a small recirculation region is formed at the channel top wall which makes the pressure coefficient fluctuated however the pressure coefficient for channels in the critical divergence ratio range is not fluctuated according to fig 7 b velocity increases initially at the centerline of all channels and reaches a maximum value and then decreases this peak value occurs more downstream as the divergence ratio increases oscillation of the streamwise velocity for dr 0 2 and 0 6 indicates the unsteady nature of the fluid flow and shedding of vortices in these channels this feature however is not observed for the channels in the critical divergence ratio range where the fluid flow is steady time mean drag coefficient rms value of lift coefficient and strouhal number of the square cylinder confined in diverged channels and the unbounded cylinder are depicted in fig 8 at re 100 according to this figure the strouhal number and rms value of lift coefficient are reduced with a decrease in the value of divergence ratio furthermore the drag coefficient is almost monotonically reduced with a decrease in divergence ratio and interestingly its value becomes less than the unbounded case at dr 0 26 therefore dr 0 26 is nominated as the most efficient divergence ratio owing to this fact that the drag coefficient of the square cylinder in this channel is 18 85 less than that in the unbounded case while experiencing no vortex shedding this outcome would be of high importance since past studies remarked the increased drag coefficient in a confined channel as a side effect therefore diverged channels could be taken into consideration as an efficient method for passively controlling the fluid flow behind bluff bodies effects of divergence ratio on the vortex formation length l f and the wake width w behind the square cylinder confined in diverged channels and the unbounded cylinder are shown in fig 9 at t 4 t is the vortex shedding period and re 100 according to new et al 2015 the vortex formation length is defined as the distance between the leeward side of the cylinder and the location at the streamwise centerline where the x component velocity reaches a zero value the wake width herein is defined as the peak to peak distance of the x component velocity in normalwise direction at the vortex formation length according to fig 9 and similar to patil and tiwari 2008 and sharma and eswaran 2004a the vortex formation length is generally reduced with increasing divergence ratio furthermore the wake width reduces with an increase in divergence ratio which causes the karman vortex street to be narrowed deepakkumar and jayavel 2018 it should be mentioned that the wake width of the unbounded square cylinder is much higher than the confined cases while the value of its vortex formation length is close to the channel with dr 0 6 3 2 determination of critical reynolds number when the reynolds number reaches the critical value the steady wake behind the cylinder starts to oscillate and the fluid flow becomes unsteady goharzadeh and molki 2014 as a consequence the shedding of large and spanwise vortices from the rear surface is yielded gibeau and ghaemi 2020 the transition to vortex shedding begins with the opening of the recirculation region and then penetrating of instant alleyways of the fluid into the recirculation region perry et al 1982 the onset of vortex shedding behind the unbounded square cylinder takes place at re 49 in the present study which is in the range of 45 re 50 reported by patil and tiwari 2008 however there exists a controversy about the value of the critical reynolds number for the confined square cylinder patil and tiwari 2008 sharma and eswaran 2004a suzuki et al 1993 for example it was found by patil and tiwari 2008 that the critical reynolds number for the square cylinder constrained in a channel with dr 1 is equal to 42 while it was proposed to be 65 by sharma and eswaran 2004a however this value is determined to be 71 in the present study the discrepancy involving the critical reynolds number is attributed to differences in the numerical methodology sharma and eswaran 2004a fig 10 shows that the critical reynolds number increases with divergence ratio initially and reaches a peak of 104 at dr 0 4 followed by a monotonic reduction to 62 at dr 1 2 this behavior is in accordance to past studies conducted by sharma and eswaran 2004a and patil and tiwari 2008 where the critical reynolds number had firstly upward and then downward trends with blockage ratio sharma and eswaran 2004a revealed that the channel walls at low values of blockage ratio impart stability to the fluid flow however after reaching a critical blockage ratio the fluid flow becomes unstable due to the interaction of the channel walls and the cylinder it is worth mentioning that the critical reynolds number in a diverged channel is higher than the unbounded case as well as the channel with dr 1 which could be considered as a positive point moreover the critical reynolds number of the most efficient channel dr 0 26 is 42 25 higher than the straight channel and around two time more than the unbounded case instantaneous aerodynamic coefficients of the square cylinder confined in diverged channels and the unbounded cylinder at the critical reynolds number are depicted in fig 11 as can be seen the fluctuation amplitude of lift and drag coefficients generally goes up with increasing divergence ratio up to dr 1 moreover the wavelength of the lift coefficient decreases with an increase in divergence ratio resulting in increment of the strouhal number spanwise vorticity contours of the square cylinder confined in diverged channels and the unbounded cylinder are represented in fig 12 at t 4 and the critical reynolds number with regards to the unbounded cylinder shedding of vortices in the near wake region becomes to an almost parallel shear flow at the far wake zone moreover shear layers of the cylinder in all cases are considerably stretched in the streamwise direction in comparison to re 100 however the stretch length of shear layers decreases with an increase in divergence ratio streamlines around the square cylinder confined in diverged channels and the unbounded cylinder are shown in fig 13 at t 4 and the critical reynolds number in contrast to the unbounded case two recirculation regions are found behind the confined square cylinder however the streamwise distance between these two recirculation regions is reduced with increasing divergence ratio in addition very small recirculation regions could be identified at the channel walls the time mean drag coefficient rms value of lift coefficient and strouhal number of the square cylinder confined in diverged channels and the unbounded cylinder are plotted in fig 14 at the critical reynolds number according to this figure the drag coefficient and the strouhal number of the square cylinder experience a non linearly increase with divergence ratio this trend also happens for rms value of lift coefficient until dr 1 where it reaches a peak of around 0 15 after that it reduces to about 0 13 at dr 1 2 it is worth mentioning that the strouhal number and rms value of lift coefficient at the critical reynolds number are lower than those at re 100 while generally an adverse trend is reported for the drag coefficient this difference in the drag coefficient is more profound at higher divergence ratios furthermore the drag coefficient of the most efficient channel dr 0 26 is almost 27 27 less than the drag coefficient of the unbounded cylinder at the critical reynolds number the vortex formation length and the wake width of the square cylinder confined in diverged channels and the unbounded cylinder are shown in fig 15 at t 4 and the critical reynolds number according to this figure both these parameters decrease when the divergence ratio increases however the range of variation in low values of divergence ratio is more sensible as expected the wake width of the unbounded square cylinder is much higher than the confined cylinder due to the absence of channel walls on the other hand the vortex formation length behind the unbounded cylinder which was close to dr 0 6 case at re 100 considerably increases and reaches a value of 2 87 at the critical reynolds number 4 conclusion this paper investigated the effects of divergence ratio on flow characteristics and structure around a confined square cylinder at a reynolds number of 100 and compared them to the unbounded square cylinder furthermore the critical reynolds number where the onset of vortex shedding takes place was determined for all tested cases the main findings of this study can be summarized as follows vortex shedding is completely suppressed for 0 26 dr 0 45 at re 100 the channel with dr 0 26 is a special case because not only vortex shedding is suppressed but also the drag coefficient of the square cylinder in this channel is 18 85 and 27 27 lower than the unbounded cylinder at re 100 and the critical reynolds number respectively furthermore its critical reynolds number is almost two times larger than the unbounded cylinder the drag coefficient rms value of lift coefficient and strouhal number generally increase with divergence ratio at both re 100 and the critical reynolds number the vortex formation length and the wake width generally decrease with divergence ratio at both re 100 and the critical reynolds number the critical reynolds number increases with divergence ratio and reaches a peak at dr 0 4 after which it reduces to 62 at dr 1 2 furthermore the critical reynolds number of the square cylinder confined in diverged channels is higher than that in the conventional channel with dr 1 and also the

20504,deployment of tidal array farms is the next stage of tidal energy development which concentrates on the capture of the enormous energy characterization into the wake of tidal turbine aids in determining the tidal farm layout and energy yields this paper develops a framework that employs the computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation and machine learning to analyze turbine wake with high accuracy and good efficiency multilayer perceptron neural network mlp nn was introduced to establish the interrelation between the incoming flow conditions and the wake profiles the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans are associated with a k ε turbulence model to offer a number of datasets of wake profile for training testing and validation of the mlp nn models it was found that the mlp nn based model has achieved a considerably high level of accuracy by comparing it with empirical and numerical models the reliability of the mlp nn based model coupled with the wake combination rss model to predict the resultant wake profile and power output of multiple turbines are also assessed the techniques significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of wake predictions keywords artificial neural network multi layer perceptron neural network tidal energy turbine wake 1 introduction various types of tidal turbines with different designs and configurations have been installed individually around the world and showing pleasant performance the tidal energy development is moving to large scale tidal farm for substantial energy extraction stansby and stallard 2016 comprehensive understanding of the tidal turbine wake is useful to assess the influence of turbine may impact each other and the ambience extensive analytical experimental and numerical studies have been conducted to understand the physical nature of turbine wake and hydrodynamic performance harrison et al 2010 maganga et al 2010 pinon et al 2012 stallard et al 2015 tedds et al 2014 yan et al 2017 chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 yan et al 2020 chen et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a 2021b a precise characterization and prediction of turbine wake can significantly increase the efficiency of energy conversion in a tidal farm the efficiency of a properly arranged tidal farm could increase by up to 20 myers and bahaj 2012 besides the precise understanding of turbine wake can provide an insight into its hydro environmental impacts such as sediment transport laws and epps 2016 the mainstream approaches used for wake prediction are analytical models and numerical simulations analytical wake model is useful to predict the turbine wake deficit due to its simplicity and cost effectiveness the classic jensen wake model jensen 1983 which considers a top hat distribution for wake velocity deficit and is initially used in the wind farm the suitability of using jensen wake model for tidal turbine is testified by palm et al 2011 in which they modified the tidal turbine wake decay factor to fit the jensen model later on brutto et al 2016 improved the jensen model by considering the ambient turbulence of tidal farms and the mechanical features of the tidal stream turbine in addition the equations for predicting the velocity distribution within propeller jets have been reanalyzed and used for wake deficit estimation lam and chen 2014 lam et al 2015 chen et al 2020 also reanalyzed the equations used for velocity distribution of ship propeller jets and coupled with the jesen model proposed an analytical wake model for multi wake prediction nevertheless analytical wake models are dependent on empirical constants which should be calibrated through experiments or computational fluid dynamics cfd results the analytical models cannot precisely capture the characteristics of high turbulent wake flows which may result in poor tidal farm layout optimizations the recent popular numerical simulation methods such as reynolds averaged navier stokes rans and large eddy simulation les allowed more accurate characterization of turbine wake flows mcnaughton et al 2014 liu et al 2016 ouro et al 2019 harrison et al 2010 and turnock et al 2011 used actuator disks ad to represent the turbine and solved the rans equation combined with source terms derived from blade element momentum theory bemt to consider the turbulence induced by the turbine in addition wake interactions were also analyzed by implementing the ad method in the 3d model roms michelet et al 2020 however use ad to represent the turbine may largely overestimate the decay rate of turbulent kinetic energy within the wake using scaled tidal turbine model for wake characterization through numerical methods were also conducted even it requires high computational costs nuerberg and tao 2018 but direct cfd simulation of a tidal farm consisting of multiple turbines requires enormous computational resources due to refined mesh employed to resolve the boundary layer it is unaffordable in terms of computational cost to apply high fidelity cfd simulations for multi turbine wake analysis in recent years artificial intelligence ai approaches have wide applications in different field of engineering applications such as water level forecasting chang 2013 deo and sahin 2016 water quality prediction tanty and desmukh 2015 ravansalar et al 2016 shear rate prediction in rheological applications chin et al 2019a b power characteristic evaluation for cleaner energy system and application in the energy production system garg et al 2017a b huang et al 2018 etc among the ai approaches artificial neural network ann is a computational technique inspired by the human nerve cells neurons owing to its ability to model complicated relationships or to find partners in data ann has been extensively used to perform a non linear mapping between input and output vectors due to its simplicity flexibility and high capacity of modelling goertzel 2014 arqub 2017 chin et al 2019b most recently long short term memory lstm networks were also used for direct prediction of the power output in a wind farm considering wake losses yan 2018 additionally an ann model based on the back propagation bp algorithm is used for wake predictions of wind turbines ti et al 2020 though the wake of a wind turbine initially is similar to that downstream of a tidal stream turbine the highly constrained nature of the water column in the ocean has made the wake structures of tidal stream turbine is different from that of wind turbine bahaj and myers 2013 there are currently very limited studies on tidal wakes prediction by utilizing machine learning techniques the validity of ann model for tidal turbine wake prediction is yet to testify generally the prediction of the tidal turbine wake requires understanding the relationship between inflow conditions rotor characteristics and velocity and turbulence fields in the wake by taking merit of the strong regression capacity of machine learning the relationship can be well interrelated based on a proper big dataset wake predictions could be performed instantly while achieving equivalent accuracy to cfd simulations by a given machine learning model for the sake of efficient and accurate wake predictions a numerical framework of the wake model based on machine learning is proposed artificial neural network models are developed using multilayer perceptron neural network mlp nn approach the models are then trained and tested using a big dataset of wake flow which is generated by parallel computing of rans associated with k ε turbulence model once well trained the machine learning based wake model can efficiently characterize the wake flows of tidal farm comparable to the conventional analytical wake models while maintaining the favorable accuracy equivalent to the high fidelity numerical simulations this study is novel in its introduction of machine learning approaches for tidal turbine wake application 2 methodology 2 1 numerical set up a tri bladed tidal turbine with diameter of 0 7 m was created and the flow of wake was numerically modelled to acquire the flow dataset to train and tune the ann model the detailed information of the turbine geometry can be found in pinon et al 2012 the computational domain is 13 0 d 3 0 d and 3 0 d in the x y and z directions respectively see fig 1 and the inflow directs from x to x the inlet velocity are 0 6 0 8 1 0 1 2 1 4 m s with incoming turbulence of 3 5 8 and 15 the simulation does not take into account the effect of free surface the top side and bottom of the computational domain are set to be no slip walls a no slip moving wall condition is employed to the hub and blade surface to consider the turbine rotation and the tip speed ratio of the turbine is equivalent to 3 67 mesh refinement has been performed to improve the texture of the blade surface the sliding mesh modelling technique was used in the current study the grid elements inside the rotating zone are moving together with the rotor to represent the actual rotational effect the grid interface was created between the rotating zone and the stationary zone the arbitrary mesh interface ami was applied between the rotating zone and the stationary zone ami is a technique that permits the numerical simulation across disconnected but adjacent mesh domains the rans equations were used to model the wake flow due to their simplicity and they are more computationally economical than other methods such as direct numerical simulation dns and large eddy simulation les the equations are solved in ensemble averaged form including appropriate models for the effect of turbulence it has been stated that the k ε model is much better to represent anisotropic turbulence of the wake compared to the k ω sst model due to the boussinesq hypothesis of isotropic chick 2009 besides some studies have indicated that k ω sst model under predicts the eddy viscosity of the wake and the wake recovery rate batten et al 2013 therefore the turbulence is evaluated by the standard k ε turbulence model in the current study this model is semi empirical and solved flows based on the assumption that the rate of production and dissipation of turbulent flows are in near balance in energy transfer the dissipation of the energy ε can be expressed as eq 1 1 ε k 3 2 l where k represents the kinetic energy of the flow and l is the length scale involved this is related to the turbulent viscosity μ t based on the prandtl mixing length model as eq 2 2 μ t ρ c μ k 2 ε where c μ is an empirical constant and ρ is the density of the flow the standard k ε model uses the following transport equations for k and ε eq 3 and 4 3 ρ k t div ρ k u div μ t σ k g r a d k 2 μ t e i j e i j ρ ε and the ε equation as 4 ρ k t div ρ ε u div μ t σ ε g r a d ε c 1 ε ε k 2 μ t e i j e i j c 2 ε ρ ε 2 k where e i j is the mean rate of deformation of a fluid element in a turbulent flow the k and ε equations are developed by inserting them into the transport equations the transport equation has the transient term convection term diffusion term production term and destruction term the production term in the k equation is to transfer the energy from the mean flow to the turbulence whereas the destructive term is responsible for the dissipation of energy into heat due to the viscous nature of the flow 2 2 multilayer perceptron neural network multilayer perceptron neural network mlp nn is one of the most widely used neural network algorithms it functions in a network like manner a typical mlp nn has three main components input layer hidden layer output layer and neurons play a significant role in linking the aforementioned layers the input layer establishes all the correspondence parameters connected to the hidden layer the hidden layer is vital in solving the complexity of the problem being modelled meanwhile the role of output layers is to present the output data fig 2 shows the architecture of mlp nn in general form the net values at each hidden neuron are presented using eq 5 5 n e t v a l u e j i 1 n w i j x j b j where n e t v a l u e j is net input to node i in hidden or output layer x j are the inputs to node i or output of previous layer w i j are the weights representing the power of the relationship between the ith node and jth node n is the number of nodes and b j is the bias related to node j in mlp nn transfer function is essential to activate each of the neurons through the nonlinear transformation of the inputs parameters into an alternative space where the training samples are linearly separable in this case the selected transfer function is sigmoidal function and the formula is shown in eq 6 6 h j 1 1 e n e t v a l u e j where h j is the output node of j and is an element of the inputs to the nodes in the next layer the net values in the output layer and output neuron values are calculated by eqs 7 and 8 respectively 7 n e t v a l u e k 1 m w k h k b 8 o u t p u t n e u r o n v a l u e s 1 1 e n e t v a l u e where b is bias a proper data splitting ratio is essential to ensure the model is trained with enough possible input output patterns to learn and provided with a reasonable size of testing data for model evaluation purposes in fact there is no solid principle to restrict the ratio however as recommended in several studies akter and desai 2018 alimissis et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 chin et al 2019b 2020 the most common percentage for training data is ranged between 60 and 90 while testing data should be 40 10 since this is the first attempt to introduce the use of artificial intelligence for wake modelling in tidal turbine the authors set the ratio by selecting the upper limit 90 for the training the main reason is to figure out the most possible input output patterns a more comprehensive study can be done in the near future to finalize the data splitting ratio in which the model can perform to achieve the best performance next it was proceeded with the selection of parameters to build up the network among all the number of hidden layer was fixed to one a proper selection of transfer function in hidden layer is essential as it can have a significant impact on the target of the model in this study sigmoid transfer function was selected because it was proven that the suitability of the transfer function to be used in the prediction model sharma and venugopalan 2014 besides levenberg marquardt algorithm is chosen to train the ann modelling due to its ability to minimize the combination of mean squared errors resulting from a large amount of data hameed et al 2017 one of the main challenging tasks while designing the architecture of a mlp nn is the selection of the number of hidden neurons this is mainly due to underfitting and overfitting issues that may occur under the condition of too few neurons and too many neurons respectively the accuracy and reliability of the proposed models may be significantly affected by both issues in this study the number of hidden neurons increased gradually from 2 to 10 using the trial and error method the overall process for the mlp nn model development is depicted in fig 3 2 3 performance criteria after developing numerous artificial intelligence models it is essential to have a clear visualization of their performance to achieve that purpose a series of statistical evaluation criteria were used to assess the model performance which are pearson correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae akaike information criterion aic bayesian information criterion bic and average percentage error the formulas of performance criteria are defined in the following 9 r n x i y i x i y i n x i 2 x i ² n y i 2 y i ² 10 m a e y i x i

pairs x is the observed variable y is the predicted variable k is the number of model parameters the number of estimated variables in the model plus the intercept l is maximised likelihood and rss is residual sum of squares 3 results and discussion 3 1 numerical validation and grid independence study the employed numerical model has to be validated before it is applied for data training the numerical results are compared with experimental data in the literature pinon et al 2012 mycek et al 2014a as presented in fig 4 the numerical results reasonably predict the velocity of profiles in turbine wakes under different turbulence conditions though few discrepancies are still presented considering the employed numerical model is cost effective in terms of computational time compared with the other expensive time dependent simulation eg les the numerical model is appropriate for dataset generation and used for machine learning the numerical results of the normalized centreline velocities through the computational domain were compared between three sets of grids with different numbers of cells the flow is 0 8 m s with incoming turbulence of 5 the difference is insignificant as illustrated in fig 5 it can be seen that the finest mesh with 215369 elements of mesh gave no discernible changes on the prediction of wake velocity at the centreline which the average difference of the predictions between 215369 and 134540 cells is within 4 implying that the mesh with 134540 cells could produce a convergent result of the numerical simulation therefore the mesh with 134540 cells was used for the wake flow data generation 3 2 multi layer perceptron neural network model this paper aims to introduce the use of artificial intelligence approaches in turbine wake application therefore it became the main task to compare developed models and select the well performed architecture mlp nn is applied in this study to investigate its suitability for developing a prediction model to deal with turbine wake application and compare its effectiveness in terms of accuracy several comparative statistical analyses were performed on the developed mlp nn models developed using the feed forward back propagation method using different numbers of hidden neurons ranges from 2 to 13 table 1 tabulates the results of the analyses first of all in terms of the pearson correlation coefficient a general theory indicates that a value is closer to 1 representing a strong linear relationship between the predicted and observed values from table 1 the r value is recorded at around 0 99 for all the investigated models meanwhile from the perspective of mae and rmse the lower error values suggest a more accurate estimate in this study as presented via table 1 both the mae and rmse values exhibit a fluctuation trend but generally in a reducing manner when the number of hidden neurons increased from 2 to 10 nevertheless when the number of hidden neurons increased over 9 a model accuracy deterioration can be observed where the mae and rmse values begin to rise again on the other hand akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic are common analyses on the fitting of data to the model for both cases a low value is always favorable it is observed that all the examined models have shown aic and bic values ranging in between 501 and 625 the values show a fluctuation trend while the number of hidden neurons increased from 2 to 10 nonetheless the most negative value is recorded at model ii with values of 625 82 and 619 25 for aic and bic respectively the statistical analyses displayed in table 1 implies that the mlp nn model ii is the best performance model further verification of the appropriateness of model ii to achieve the objective of this study is conducted through the investigation on the average percentage error of each model a smaller percentage error indicates a higher accuracy for the prediction model fig 6 illustrates the average percentage error for the proposed mlp nn models it is noticed that the average percentage error for the 9 tested models falls below 11 it is encouraging as a small value is always preferable among the observed values the lowest should be 6 1 which is recorded by model ii it shows that the model has the ability to achieve at least an average of 93 9 accuracy which in turn can provide a considerably accurate prediction to sum up the model ii with 3 hidden neurons is apparently the best performed model as it has a r value of 0 995 approximate 1 the lowest mean absolute error 0 02 the lowest root mean squared error 0 05 the most negative akaike information criterion 625 82 the most negative bayesian information criterion 619 24 and the lowest average percentage error

analytical model the analytical wake model of lam et al 2014 is employed to predict the standalone turbine wake and compare with the mlp nn and simulation results the prediction model of lam et al 2014 is written as 16 u u o u o u m i n e 0 5 r 0 065 x r 2 where u is wake velocity at any positions in the wake u o is the incoming velocity u min is the minimum velocity at downstream r is the turbine blade radius note that u min in eq 16 varies along with the downstream and it is an empirical equation that is related to the efflux velocity 17 u e f u o 1 c t where c t is thrust force coefficient fig 8 illustrates the comparison of wake velocity predicted by the numerical model mlp nn and analytical model it is evident that mlp nn shows a pleasant agreement with the rans simulation results the analytical wake model of lam et al 2014 reasonably predicts the structure of the turbine however in comparison with the simulation results an obvious difference still can be found the analytical wake model underestimates the maximum wake deficit at x d 3 0 and overestimates the maximum wake deficit at x d 4 0 and 7 0 the discrepancy probably results from that the analytical model referenced the equations used for velocity distribution prediction of ship propeller jets it also uses c t to compute the force to represent the turbine actions on the flow these simplifications may significantly affect the accuracy of wake prediction and cause inaccurate estimation of power generation of tidal farms 3 4 multi wake prediction wake prediction for multiple turbines is usually performed by combining multiple turbine wakes together by applying the wake combination model to examine the wake prediction of ai based model for the prediction of the wake profiles downstream of two tidal turbines validation cases employing the mlp nn based model coupled with wake combination models are performed three widely employed wake combination models i e geometric sum gs model linear

rss model depicted reasonable agreement with the measurement data at x d 5 2 6 0 and 7 0 for the case of l 6 d see fig 9b the performance of mlp nn based model coupled with gs and rss combination models showed similar performance with that of case l 4 d for the case of l 8 d the mlp nn based model combined with gs model predicts the wake profile at x d 10 0 reasonably well and exhibit discrepancies at x d 11 0 and 12 0 the mlp nn based model coupled with rss model still showed reasonable agreement with the experimental results at x d 10 0 11 0 and 12 0 the mlp nn based model coupled with ls model overestimates the wake deficit for all the cases especially at the region 0 4 z d 0 4 the influence of the inflow turbulence level on the wake interaction is also studied the wake deficit profile of two tidal turbines with i 15 is shown in fig 10 it is again proved that the mlp nn based model coupled with rss combination model showed reasonable agreement with the experimental results for all the cases this again testifies the reliability of the mlp nn model coupled with rss combination model for the multiple wakes velocity predictions besides wake deficit profiles in fig 10a b and 10c are similar in terms of wake shape and this phenomenon is also observed in fig 8 it suggests that characteristics of the resultant wake might be dominated by the nearest upstream turbine 3 5 power prediction the power generated of tidal turbines is estimated using the machine learning based wake model the power is calculated as follows 21 p 1 2 ρ c p a u 3 where c p is the power coefficient a is the blade swept area u is the free stream velocity the machine learning based wake model associated with rss model is used to assess the power generation which is considering 8 tidal turbines aligned in a row with inflow turbulence levels of 8 the turbine s diameter d is equal to 10 m the inflow velocity of the first turbine is assumed to be 2 0 m s and the inter turbine distance is 7 0 d note that the power of the turbines only depends on the wake velocity as the c p is assumed to be invariant and the c t is 0 8 for all turbines the power outputs of the 8 turbines predicted by the mlpnn based wake model are assessed and are depicted in fig 11 the field measurement data of horns rev wind farm is used for comparison purposes the horns rev wind farm is characterized by a low turbulence level 8 and comprises 80 vestas v80 2 mw wind turbines with 7 d spacing the rotor diameter of the wind turbine is 80 m and the hub center is located at 70 m above sea level it is been observed that the power significantly drops at the second turbine and the power productions remain approximately constant this can be explained by the fact that the short inter device distance limits the recovery speed of the turbine wake flow it also can be seen that the power output curve of the simulated 8 tidal turbines depicts a similar trend with that of the wind turbines at horns wind farm the turbines behind the first turbine generate less power due to the wake loss however the power output predictions of the 8 aligned tidal turbines reveal that the power production remains approximately constant further downstream it is unlike the wind farm in which the power output at downstream turbines fluctuates slightly the reason for such dissimilarity might be due to the ambient environment at the wind farm overall the mlpnn based model coupled with the wake combination model provides reasonable predictions of power output for the 8 aligned tidal stream turbines 4 conclusion a novel framework that employs the machine learning and cfd coupling approach to develop a wake model with good balance of efficiency and high accuracy is developed to improve the turbine wake predictions the mlpnn based model was developed to establish the relationship between the inflow conditions and wake deficit the results presented that the developed ai model is able to establish the complex interrelation between inflow conditions and the wake deficit the mlp nn based model coupled with wake combination rss model is also able to compute the resultant wake profile of multiple

20504,deployment of tidal array farms is the next stage of tidal energy development which concentrates on the capture of the enormous energy characterization into the wake of tidal turbine aids in determining the tidal farm layout and energy yields this paper develops a framework that employs the computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation and machine learning to analyze turbine wake with high accuracy and good efficiency multilayer perceptron neural network mlp nn was introduced to establish the interrelation between the incoming flow conditions and the wake profiles the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans are associated with a k ε turbulence model to offer a number of datasets of wake profile for training testing and validation of the mlp nn models it was found that the mlp nn based model has achieved a considerably high level of accuracy by comparing it with empirical and numerical models the reliability of the mlp nn based model coupled with the wake combination rss model to predict the resultant wake profile and power output of multiple turbines are also assessed the techniques significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of wake predictions keywords artificial neural network multi layer perceptron neural network tidal energy turbine wake 1 introduction various types of tidal turbines with different designs and configurations have been installed individually around the world and showing pleasant performance the tidal energy development is moving to large scale tidal farm for substantial energy extraction stansby and stallard 2016 comprehensive understanding of the tidal turbine wake is useful to assess the influence of turbine may impact each other and the ambience extensive analytical experimental and numerical studies have been conducted to understand the physical nature of turbine wake and hydrodynamic performance harrison et al 2010 maganga et al 2010 pinon et al 2012 stallard et al 2015 tedds et al 2014 yan et al 2017 chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 yan et al 2020 chen et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a 2021b a precise characterization and prediction of turbine wake can significantly increase the efficiency of energy conversion in a tidal farm the efficiency of a properly arranged tidal farm could increase by up to 20 myers and bahaj 2012 besides the precise understanding of turbine wake can provide an insight into its hydro environmental impacts such as sediment transport laws and epps 2016 the mainstream approaches used for wake prediction are analytical models and numerical simulations analytical wake model is useful to predict the turbine wake deficit due to its simplicity and cost effectiveness the classic jensen wake model jensen 1983 which considers a top hat distribution for wake velocity deficit and is initially used in the wind farm the suitability of using jensen wake model for tidal turbine is testified by palm et al 2011 in which they modified the tidal turbine wake decay factor to fit the jensen model later on brutto et al 2016 improved the jensen model by considering the ambient turbulence of tidal farms and the mechanical features of the tidal stream turbine in addition the equations for predicting the velocity distribution within propeller jets have been reanalyzed and used for wake deficit estimation lam and chen 2014 lam et al 2015 chen et al 2020 also reanalyzed the equations used for velocity distribution of ship propeller jets and coupled with the jesen model proposed an analytical wake model for multi wake prediction nevertheless analytical wake models are dependent on empirical constants which should be calibrated through experiments or computational fluid dynamics cfd results the analytical models cannot precisely capture the characteristics of high turbulent wake flows which may result in poor tidal farm layout optimizations the recent popular numerical simulation methods such as reynolds averaged navier stokes rans and large eddy simulation les allowed more accurate characterization of turbine wake flows mcnaughton et al 2014 liu et al 2016 ouro et al 2019 harrison et al 2010 and turnock et al 2011 used actuator disks ad to represent the turbine and solved the rans equation combined with source terms derived from blade element momentum theory bemt to consider the turbulence induced by the turbine in addition wake interactions were also analyzed by implementing the ad method in the 3d model roms michelet et al 2020 however use ad to represent the turbine may largely overestimate the decay rate of turbulent kinetic energy within the wake using scaled tidal turbine model for wake characterization through numerical methods were also conducted even it requires high computational costs nuerberg and tao 2018 but direct cfd simulation of a tidal farm consisting of multiple turbines requires enormous computational resources due to refined mesh employed to resolve the boundary layer it is unaffordable in terms of computational cost to apply high fidelity cfd simulations for multi turbine wake analysis in recent years artificial intelligence ai approaches have wide applications in different field of engineering applications such as water level forecasting chang 2013 deo and sahin 2016 water quality prediction tanty and desmukh 2015 ravansalar et al 2016 shear rate prediction in rheological applications chin et al 2019a b power characteristic evaluation for cleaner energy system and application in the energy production system garg et al 2017a b huang et al 2018 etc among the ai approaches artificial neural network ann is a computational technique inspired by the human nerve cells neurons owing to its ability to model complicated relationships or to find partners in data ann has been extensively used to perform a non linear mapping between input and output vectors due to its simplicity flexibility and high capacity of modelling goertzel 2014 arqub 2017 chin et al 2019b most recently long short term memory lstm networks were also used for direct prediction of the power output in a wind farm considering wake losses yan 2018 additionally an ann model based on the back propagation bp algorithm is used for wake predictions of wind turbines ti et al 2020 though the wake of a wind turbine initially is similar to that downstream of a tidal stream turbine the highly constrained nature of the water column in the ocean has made the wake structures of tidal stream turbine is different from that of wind turbine bahaj and myers 2013 there are currently very limited studies on tidal wakes prediction by utilizing machine learning techniques the validity of ann model for tidal turbine wake prediction is yet to testify generally the prediction of the tidal turbine wake requires understanding the relationship between inflow conditions rotor characteristics and velocity and turbulence fields in the wake by taking merit of the strong regression capacity of machine learning the relationship can be well interrelated based on a proper big dataset wake predictions could be performed instantly while achieving equivalent accuracy to cfd simulations by a given machine learning model for the sake of efficient and accurate wake predictions a numerical framework of the wake model based on machine learning is proposed artificial neural network models are developed using multilayer perceptron neural network mlp nn approach the models are then trained and tested using a big dataset of wake flow which is generated by parallel computing of rans associated with k ε turbulence model once well trained the machine learning based wake model can efficiently characterize the wake flows of tidal farm comparable to the conventional analytical wake models while maintaining the favorable accuracy equivalent to the high fidelity numerical simulations this study is novel in its introduction of machine learning approaches for tidal turbine wake application 2 methodology 2 1 numerical set up a tri bladed tidal turbine with diameter of 0 7 m was created and the flow of wake was numerically modelled to acquire the flow dataset to train and tune the ann model the detailed information of the turbine geometry can be found in pinon et al 2012 the computational domain is 13 0 d 3 0 d and 3 0 d in the x y and z directions respectively see fig 1 and the inflow directs from x to x the inlet velocity are 0 6 0 8 1 0 1 2 1 4 m s with incoming turbulence of 3 5 8 and 15 the simulation does not take into account the effect of free surface the top side and bottom of the computational domain are set to be no slip walls a no slip moving wall condition is employed to the hub and blade surface to consider the turbine rotation and the tip speed ratio of the turbine is equivalent to 3 67 mesh refinement has been performed to improve the texture of the blade surface the sliding mesh modelling technique was used in the current study the grid elements inside the rotating zone are moving together with the rotor to represent the actual rotational effect the grid interface was created between the rotating zone and the stationary zone the arbitrary mesh interface ami was applied between the rotating zone and the stationary zone ami is a technique that permits the numerical simulation across disconnected but adjacent mesh domains the rans equations were used to model the wake flow due to their simplicity and they are more computationally economical than other methods such as direct numerical simulation dns and large eddy simulation les the equations are solved in ensemble averaged form including appropriate models for the effect of turbulence it has been stated that the k ε model is much better to represent anisotropic turbulence of the wake compared to the k ω sst model due to the boussinesq hypothesis of isotropic chick 2009 besides some studies have indicated that k ω sst model under predicts the eddy viscosity of the wake and the wake recovery rate batten et al 2013 therefore the turbulence is evaluated by the standard k ε turbulence model in the current study this model is semi empirical and solved flows based on the assumption that the rate of production and dissipation of turbulent flows are in near balance in energy transfer the dissipation of the energy ε can be expressed as eq 1 1 ε k 3 2 l where k represents the kinetic energy of the flow and l is the length scale involved this is related to the turbulent viscosity μ t based on the prandtl mixing length model as eq 2 2 μ t ρ c μ k 2 ε where c μ is an empirical constant and ρ is the density of the flow the standard k ε model uses the following transport equations for k and ε eq 3 and 4 3 ρ k t div ρ k u div μ t σ k g r a d k 2 μ t e i j e i j ρ ε and the ε equation as 4 ρ k t div ρ ε u div μ t σ ε g r a d ε c 1 ε ε k 2 μ t e i j e i j c 2 ε ρ ε 2 k where e i j is the mean rate of deformation of a fluid element in a turbulent flow the k and ε equations are developed by inserting them into the transport equations the transport equation has the transient term convection term diffusion term production term and destruction term the production term in the k equation is to transfer the energy from the mean flow to the turbulence whereas the destructive term is responsible for the dissipation of energy into heat due to the viscous nature of the flow 2 2 multilayer perceptron neural network multilayer perceptron neural network mlp nn is one of the most widely used neural network algorithms it functions in a network like manner a typical mlp nn has three main components input layer hidden layer output layer and neurons play a significant role in linking the aforementioned layers the input layer establishes all the correspondence parameters connected to the hidden layer the hidden layer is vital in solving the complexity of the problem being modelled meanwhile the role of output layers is to present the output data fig 2 shows the architecture of mlp nn in general form the net values at each hidden neuron are presented using eq 5 5 n e t v a l u e j i 1 n w i j x j b j where n e t v a l u e j is net input to node i in hidden or output layer x j are the inputs to node i or output of previous layer w i j are the weights representing the power of the relationship between the ith node and jth node n is the number of nodes and b j is the bias related to node j in mlp nn transfer function is essential to activate each of the neurons through the nonlinear transformation of the inputs parameters into an alternative space where the training samples are linearly separable in this case the selected transfer function is sigmoidal function and the formula is shown in eq 6 6 h j 1 1 e n e t v a l u e j where h j is the output node of j and is an element of the inputs to the nodes in the next layer the net values in the output layer and output neuron values are calculated by eqs 7 and 8 respectively 7 n e t v a l u e k 1 m w k h k b 8 o u t p u t n e u r o n v a l u e s 1 1 e n e t v a l u e where b is bias a proper data splitting ratio is essential to ensure the model is trained with enough possible input output patterns to learn and provided with a reasonable size of testing data for model evaluation purposes in fact there is no solid principle to restrict the ratio however as recommended in several studies akter and desai 2018 alimissis et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 chin et al 2019b 2020 the most common percentage for training data is ranged between 60 and 90 while testing data should be 40 10 since this is the first attempt to introduce the use of artificial intelligence for wake modelling in tidal turbine the authors set the ratio by selecting the upper limit 90 for the training the main reason is to figure out the most possible input output patterns a more comprehensive study can be done in the near future to finalize the data splitting ratio in which the model can perform to achieve the best performance next it was proceeded with the selection of parameters to build up the network among all the number of hidden layer was fixed to one a proper selection of transfer function in hidden layer is essential as it can have a significant impact on the target of the model in this study sigmoid transfer function was selected because it was proven that the suitability of the transfer function to be used in the prediction model sharma and venugopalan 2014 besides levenberg marquardt algorithm is chosen to train the ann modelling due to its ability to minimize the combination of mean squared errors resulting from a large amount of data hameed et al 2017 one of the main challenging tasks while designing the architecture of a mlp nn is the selection of the number of hidden neurons this is mainly due to underfitting and overfitting issues that may occur under the condition of too few neurons and too many neurons respectively the accuracy and reliability of the proposed models may be significantly affected by both issues in this study the number of hidden neurons increased gradually from 2 to 10 using the trial and error method the overall process for the mlp nn model development is depicted in fig 3 2 3 performance criteria after developing numerous artificial intelligence models it is essential to have a clear visualization of their performance to achieve that purpose a series of statistical evaluation criteria were used to assess the model performance which are pearson correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae akaike information criterion aic bayesian information criterion bic and average percentage error the formulas of performance criteria are defined in the following 9 r n x i y i x i y i n x i 2 x i ² n y i 2 y i ² 10 m a e y i x i

pairs x is the observed variable y is the predicted variable k is the number of model parameters the number of estimated variables in the model plus the intercept l is maximised likelihood and rss is residual sum of squares 3 results and discussion 3 1 numerical validation and grid independence study the employed numerical model has to be validated before it is applied for data training the numerical results are compared with experimental data in the literature pinon et al 2012 mycek et al 2014a as presented in fig 4 the numerical results reasonably predict the velocity of profiles in turbine wakes under different turbulence conditions though few discrepancies are still presented considering the employed numerical model is cost effective in terms of computational time compared with the other expensive time dependent simulation eg les the numerical model is appropriate for dataset generation and used for machine learning the numerical results of the normalized centreline velocities through the computational domain were compared between three sets of grids with different numbers of cells the flow is 0 8 m s with incoming turbulence of 5 the difference is insignificant as illustrated in fig 5 it can be seen that the finest mesh with 215369 elements of mesh gave no discernible changes on the prediction of wake velocity at the centreline which the average difference of the predictions between 215369 and 134540 cells is within 4 implying that the mesh with 134540 cells could produce a convergent result of the numerical simulation therefore the mesh with 134540 cells was used for the wake flow data generation 3 2 multi layer perceptron neural network model this paper aims to introduce the use of artificial intelligence approaches in turbine wake application therefore it became the main task to compare developed models and select the well performed architecture mlp nn is applied in this study to investigate its suitability for developing a prediction model to deal with turbine wake application and compare its effectiveness in terms of accuracy several comparative statistical analyses were performed on the developed mlp nn models developed using the feed forward back propagation method using different numbers of hidden neurons ranges from 2 to 13 table 1 tabulates the results of the analyses first of all in terms of the pearson correlation coefficient a general theory indicates that a value is closer to 1 representing a strong linear relationship between the predicted and observed values from table 1 the r value is recorded at around 0 99 for all the investigated models meanwhile from the perspective of mae and rmse the lower error values suggest a more accurate estimate in this study as presented via table 1 both the mae and rmse values exhibit a fluctuation trend but generally in a reducing manner when the number of hidden neurons increased from 2 to 10 nevertheless when the number of hidden neurons increased over 9 a model accuracy deterioration can be observed where the mae and rmse values begin to rise again on the other hand akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic are common analyses on the fitting of data to the model for both cases a low value is always favorable it is observed that all the examined models have shown aic and bic values ranging in between 501 and 625 the values show a fluctuation trend while the number of hidden neurons increased from 2 to 10 nonetheless the most negative value is recorded at model ii with values of 625 82 and 619 25 for aic and bic respectively the statistical analyses displayed in table 1 implies that the mlp nn model ii is the best performance model further verification of the appropriateness of model ii to achieve the objective of this study is conducted through the investigation on the average percentage error of each model a smaller percentage error indicates a higher accuracy for the prediction model fig 6 illustrates the average percentage error for the proposed mlp nn models it is noticed that the average percentage error for the 9 tested models falls below 11 it is encouraging as a small value is always preferable among the observed values the lowest should be 6 1 which is recorded by model ii it shows that the model has the ability to achieve at least an average of 93 9 accuracy which in turn can provide a considerably accurate prediction to sum up the model ii with 3 hidden neurons is apparently the best performed model as it has a r value of 0 995 approximate 1 the lowest mean absolute error 0 02 the lowest root mean squared error 0 05 the most negative akaike information criterion 625 82 the most negative bayesian information criterion 619 24 and the lowest average percentage error

analytical wake model underestimates the maximum wake deficit at x d 3 0 and overestimates the maximum wake deficit at x d 4 0 and 7 0 the discrepancy probably results from that the analytical model referenced the equations used for velocity distribution prediction of ship propeller jets it also uses c t to compute the force to represent the turbine actions on the flow these simplifications may
