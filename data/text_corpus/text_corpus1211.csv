6055,urban water demand forecasting is a significant issue in the design maintenance and operation of a reliable and economical water supply system the large variations in daily water demand are the leading source of health risks due to water pressure drops within the distribution network increasing the likelihood of contamination leaking into the system and or excessive retention time this study presents an explicit mathematical equation based on the air temperature and precipitation effects on the outdoors water uses and the seasonal and weekly trends in the domestic industrial water demands that can accurately forecast the daily water demand fluctuations for a municipality recent time series prediction methods are based on linear non linear and hybrid methods that can be effectively applied to solve time series problems however due to the presence of the high frequency values in the data these methods show some limitations for practical applications to solve these limitations this study introduced a non linear model through a grouping method of data handling for water demand management and tested for the case study city of guelph ontario canada the coefficient of determination and mean absolute percent error of the new water demand forecast model was 71 03 and 2 93 respectively compared to 56 12 and 3 49 for the popular linear model 58 91 and 3 37 for the non linear model 61 37 and 3 28 for the hybrid model respectively the proposed new model will allow optimizing the water storage costs versus pumping capacity costs of the water supply system to maximize the usage of the lower electricity costs for the production pumping at the off peak hours further to assist the city with water demand management and reduce its peaking factors keywords variable non linear pre processing stochastic model water demand 1 introduction the potable water supply for the city of guelph is dependent on groundwater sources managing the daily water demand of the residents businesses and other customers in the community through forecasting is key in creating a reliable and economic system the groundwater source of the city of guelph is of high quality and does not require much treatment the main daily operation cost is for electricity for pumping in ontario the electricity costs during on peak hours of the day are roughly double the cost for the off peak hours the water supply system from the sources to the demand nodes is generally designed based on a uniform water demand pattern for the whole system however the city of guelph has large fluctuations in its population due to rage percentage 20 of university students and requirements from their industrial customers in the summer the outdoor water demand for watering the lawns and gardens and for the top up of the swimming pools have large fluctuations depending on the air temperature and precipitation which increase water demand the daily water demand in the city of guelph varies from roughly 30 000 m3 to as high as 60 000 m3 with large predictable weekly and seasonal trends the larger fluctuations in daily water demand is a challenge for any city as they are required to design water storage to meet their peak water demands therefore management of peak water day demand allows for reduction in capital costs and infrastructure requirements ensuring public safety and water availability for emergencies the correlation of the daily water demand wd with many climatic factors such as temperature and precipitation maidment and parzen 1984 miaou 1990 billings and agthe 1998 zhou et al 2000

schleich and hillenbrand 2009 shandas and parandvash 2010 and other different factors are strong and should be considered important parameters in modeling and forecasting in addition of these principal parameters other parameters such as wind speed ruth et al 2007 praskievicz and chang 2009 evapotranspiration agthe et al 1986 zhou et al 2000 house square footage domene and saurí 2006 wentz and gober 2007 chang et al 2010 size of outdoor space tinker et al 2005 house peters et al 2010 housing typology zhang and brown 2005 fox et al 2009 were also taken into consideration daily water demand forecast model can allow a municipality to proactively implement programming to effectively manage water use decreasing the demand for capital projects to ensure peak water demands could be met and thus provides for lower water rates for their customers furthermore their distribution system can be optimized by decreasing the need to maintain extra storage capacity reserved for emergencies or significant peaks experienced through water demand thus conservation and outside water use management programs can take advantage of demand forecasting to effectively water use during these times of high demand additionally by proving that they are managing their water use the risk that groundwater dependent communities like the city of guelph are under pressure to optimize the supply so the water is taking permits are not exceeding the provincial regulations it is noted that researchers have successfully applied time series modeling based on stochastic modeling linear and or artificial intelligence methods non linear for water demand forecasting as detailed below jain and ormsbee 2002 employed several artificial neural network models conventionally regression and time series analysis to model and forecast short term water demand they considered the rainfall and maximum air temperature and the past water demands as effective parameters for water demand forecast model these detailed authors limitation of approaches and concluded the non linear approach could be improved by some other training algorithms and linear methods can be improved by correct modeling of residuals of time series herrera et al 2010 employed different learning machine methods to forecast hourly urban water demand these authors revealed a disappointing performance of applied methods and proposed a further study on weighted pattern based method improvement wu and yan 2010 utilized two genetic programming gp approaches to find a model for water demand forecast for a real water system these authors used two previous day demands and average temperature to construct the gp models their obtained results showed the average temperature has a significant impact on water demand fullerton et al 2016 applied for a linear transfer function forecasting model based on the autoregressive integrated moving average arima to forecast monthly water consumption in el paso city in texas usa these authors considered several climatic economic and flow rates as inputs for the model development they concluded changes in climatic and economic parameters have more impact on consumption per customer compared to changes in water rates parameters lopez et al 2018 introduced a multi model predictor architecture for water demand forecasting in water distribution networks these authors applied the decomposition of the time series as quantitative and qualitative information yin et al 2018 developed a feedforward artificial neural network model to forecast urban water resources and energy demand ghalehkhondabi et al 2017 reviewed soft computing techniques for water demand forecast these authors concluded although each soft computing method has some advantages but there is a need to develop more accurate models for forecasting water demand most recently bonakdari et al 2018 introduced a new insight in time series modeling by detailing three linear nonlinear hybrid methods zeynoddin et al 2018 proposed a new methodology for modeling of a time series this methodology is based on a combination of stationarization techniques and normality transforms into three different scenarios zeynoddin et al 2018 and ebtehaj et al 2019 highlighted the impact of appropriate pre processing techniques for elimination of deterministic term in time series could lead to a reliable linear approach with higher accuracy compared to non linear approaches although all previous studies applied stochastic methods and artificial intelligence techniques and they made observational predictions for different cases but none of them proposed an explicit equation for practical application following of successful application of linear ebtehaj et al 2019 nonlinear zaji et al 2018 and hybrid models zeynoddin et al 2018 2019 moeeni et al 2017ab moeeni and bonakdari 2017 in time series prediction in time series prediction at first we aimed to propose a model with an explicit equation with high accuracy for forecasting of the water demand the obtained results showed the hybrid model was able to predict wd time series better than linear model but due to the presence of the high frequency values in the data this hybrid model shows some limitations for practical applications to overcome the limitations of statistical and artificial intelligence and hybrid models a nonlinear variable based model was proposed this study exhibits how using knowledge and information about the nature of data can help to define the non linear modeling inputs and expand the applications of wd forecasting this paper proposes a new tool in time series modelling that improves water demand forecasting 2 data description the city of guelph is located in southwestern ontario canada with a population of approximately 135 000 the main source of guelph s drinking water is from groundwater wells and a shallow groundwater collector system located throughout the city and outside of the city s boundary the city has three pressure zones and within those three water towers with a combined capacity of 11 200 m3 the daily water demand for 1128 days from january 01 2015 to june 05 2018 were used for this study the first 788 days of data were used for training the model and the remainder of data was used for testing purposes table 1 summarizes the statistical indices of wd data used in this study in addition a visualization of this characteristics is provided in the lower section of the fig 1 in this figure the box plot of the time series alongside the histograms of the time series and the intervals used in the modeling procedure are provided as shown in fig 1 the time series shows the increasing trend over time in the figure the alternation of averaged daily water demand for the city is illustrated alongside the growth of population for four consecutive years from 2015 to 2018 as wd for the city of guelph is continuing to increase a reliable forecast model is essential to meet the customer water demands and for the system to adapt to future climate and drought conditions in addition due to the high frequency of wd the peaks wss the pumping stations reservoirs and storage systems should manage efficiency to provide the demand of customers the climatic variables are not equivalently impacted water demand throughout the year especially by considering climate changes effect on weather events fig 2 shows water demand temperature and precipitation for two months august and september 2017 as expected the maximum water demand generally occurs during periods of hot and dry weather therefore it is expected the peak water demand occurred in summer with the maximum values of water demand in august however as shown in fig 2 for the city of guelph in 2017 the maximum demand occurred in september 2017 it should be noted that the precipitation on august 11 and 12 caused a decrease in water demand on august 12 and 13 while the temperature remains almost constant the precipitation on august 17 impacts the water demand on the next three days due to lack of precipitation in the second half of september and increasing of the temperatures the maximum water demand value was anticipated to occur on september 25 this example shows there is a need to a reliable forecasted water demand model for the municipality in order to manage peak water day demand outside of normal anticipated peak water conditions hot and dry days noted in august versus september 3 methods wd modeling in this study is completed using two general concepts in the first concept wd is solved as a time series problem so that the historical wd dataset is used to predict the future wd in this modeling concept three general scenarios are defined and the linear modeling is presented by the use of stochastic methods nonlinear modeling using the method of a generalized structure of the group method of data handling gs gmdh and a hybrid method that combines two the previous method these scenarios are respectively expressed as scenarios 1 2 and 3 fig 3 in the second concept independent time series parameters were selected to model to forecast dependent variable wd using gs gmdh model in the following all elements of the flowchart are discussed in details below 3 1 time series components investigation and processing methods stochastic modeling is one of the prediction methods of time series based on the concepts of statistics and probabilities this modeling method is capable of modeling the hydrological phenomena that occurred linearly to model the hydrological processes the time series resulting from these processes should have two characteristics the first feature is the stationary time series which means the constant indices such as mean standard deviation and other statistical characteristics over time the second feature is the normal distribution of data since the dominant hydrological phenomena do not have these two conditions it is necessary to identify and examine the factors affecting these two conditions each time series consists of four components of stochastic trend rotation and jump in the form of wd t s t t t p t j t the three components of process period and jump are called deterministic and identifiable components these three components that are created by sudden events jumps continuous and partial changes trends or regular and frequent changes period in hydrological phenomena should be separated from time series and only a stochastic component remains for modeling therefore accurate identification of these components by various tests and elimination or reduction of their impact on time series is of great importance through appropriate simple and precise methods the first test applied to any given period is the augmented dicky fuller test adf said and dickey 1984 this test examines the time series static the test relationship is as follows 1 δ w d t α β 1 t β 2 t 2 γ w d t 1 ϕ 1 δ w d t 1 ϕ p 1 δ w d t p 1 ε t 2 τ γ σ γ 3 h 0 γ 0 4 h 1 γ 0 where δ is the first order differential operator on wd data α β1 and β2 is a constant value and the coefficient of linear trend and the squared trend which can be considered zero ϕi is the self correlation coefficient i th p is the maximum order of self regression τ is the static of adf test γ estimated root coefficient σ γ standard error of estimated coefficient h0 assumption zero based on unit root and h1 is the alternative assumption that there is no root unit this static time series test examines the time series based on the existence or absence of the root of a linear two order linear model fitted to a time series the absence of the unit root means the stationary of the time series if the probability of the test statistic is less than 5 confidence level the time series is static if the series is un static p adf 5 its factors should be identified mann kendal tests are used to examine seasonal and non seasonal trends in time series hamed 2008 5 u mk mk 1 var mk 0 5 mk 0 0 mk 0 mk 1 var mk 0 5 mk 0 in this relationship the mk statistic of mann kendal test var mk variance um is the standardized mk value the value of the variance and the test statistic are obtained as follows 6 mk i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn w d j w d i 7 var mk 1 18 n n 1 2 n 5 g p t g t g 1 2 t g 5 where p is the number of identical groups tg is the number of observations in the g th group sgn is the sign function and n is the number of data seasonal mann kendal smk test is also expressed by the following relationships 8 s k i 1 n k 1 j i 1 n k 1 sgn w

covariance in the test statistic in seasons i and j in these two tests if the probability of the test statistic is higher than the significance level of α in this research is α 0 05 the time series is not trend after studying the trend the periodic time series is checked using the fisher test novick 1994 12 f n n 2 α k 2 β k 2 4 z 1 k w d t α z cos ω z t β z sin ω z t 13 α z 2 n t 1 n w d t cos 2 π

critical value f at the confidence level f 2 n 2 is lower than the f value 17 f f 2 n 2 for a significant level of 5 the degree of freedom in the denominator is 3 the mann whitney mw test is a non parametric test used to check jumps in time series in this test by dividing the series into sub series samples of the entire data are examined and if the data is evenly distributed there is a lack of jump in the data mann and whitney 1947 the test statistic is presented as follows 18 u mw t 1 n 1 r g t n 1 n 1 n 2 1 2 n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 1 12 where the series g t sorted by the original series wd t r g t the degree of function g t n1 and n2 are the number of members of the original series the sum of which is equal to the main series if the probability corresponds to the test statistic in the normal probability distribution p u mw the is greater than confidence level α the assumption of the same distribution of series is acceptable and the main series is jump free after identifying the factors affecting the stationary of the time series it is time to choose the appropriate methods to eliminate or reduce the impact of these factors differentiation is one of the simplest and most widely used methods the differentiation takes place in two non seasonal and seasonal modes with delays proportional to the time series ω 19 n s d i f f w d t w d t 1 20 s d i f f w d t w d t s where n s diff and s diff are non seasonal and seasonal differentiated data respectively t is time and s is a seasonal step differentiation with the stabilization of the mean in the time series by eliminating changes in the time series level will eliminate the trend and seasonal variations in the series and ultimately the stationary of the series standardization std is one of the preprocessing methods used to modify the data distribution scale so that the observational data has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one 21 std wd t wd s d where std is the standardized data wd the average of the data and sd is the average deviation of the data with the help of spectral analysis based on the fourier series expansion a time series can be separated into sinusoidal and cosine functions hence the periodic component can be presented as a function of time and by reducing the component of the time series the periodic component is eliminated and the series is stationary 22 p t wd t z 1 k α z cos 2 π f z t

harmonic of base frequency eq 15 k is the maximum harmonic value that 2z and 2z 1 are for even and odd data respectively the periodic term is obtained by reducing the above value from the original time series as follows 23 s f w d t p t the normal distribution is one of the most probable continuous distributions in probability theory and the second condition of stochastic modeling the jarque

and wd data turning to linear data modeling is achieved stochastic models are used to model data these models have different modeling parameters that are divided into two groups of seasonal and non seasonal parameters the desired parameters represent the relationship of each data with pre existing data the simplest form of the stochastic model is the auto regressive model ar p which uses a non integral self ordered parameter of order p if the moving average parameter to ar added the autoregressive moving average arma is formed by adding a differential operator in arma the autoregressive integrated moving average arima model is obtained if seasonal parameters are used in the model seasonal arima sarima is obtained box et al 2015 model relations are as follows 26 arma p q φ b w d t θ b

3 2 nonlinear modeling gs gmdh the gmdh method is one of the iterative heuristic family algorithms that detect linear and nonlinear polynomials and modulates and matched the pattern based on observed data ivakhnenko 1971 farlow 1984 the gmdh neural network is a self organized network and consists of several layers and each layer consists of several neurons all of which have the same structure the prominent feature observed in this type of network indicates that the previous stage or previous layer m neurons are the factor or generator of the production of new neurons in the cm 2 among the produced neurons it is imperative that some of them be removed to prevent divergence of the network then called neuron dead neurons lemke 1997 in general volterra kolmogorov gabor vkg polynomials can be used to model complex systems which include a set of data with multiple inputs and one output 33 y a 0 i 1 n a i x i i 1 n j 1 n a ij x i x ij i 1 n j 1 n k 1 n a ijk x i x j x k in which x x1 x2 xn is the input vectors y is the output of the model and ai the polynomial coefficients vkg polynomials are approximated using quadratic polynomials these second valley polynomials are based on binary combinations of network inputs the gmdh algorithm is introduced using this idea as a learning method for modeling complex systems ivakhnenko 1971 madala and ivakhenko 1994 the gmdh neural network has a neural network structure and forward and includes a set of neurons that connect the various input pairs through a quadratic polynomial each layer in this network consists of one or more processor units each of which has two inputs and one output these units play the role of model components and are considered as a quadratic polynomial the unknown parameters of the gmdh algorithm are the polynomial coefficients of the above equation to calculate the output value for each input vector x x1 x2 xn according to eq 33 the mean squared error must be minimized 34 e i 1 n y i y i 2 to find the minimum error value the partial derivative of the above relation is used by placing the relation 33 in this partial derivative a matrix equation is obtained as follows 35 aa y 36 a a 0 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 a 5 37 y y 1 y m t 38 a 1 x 1 p x 1 q x 1 p 2 x 1 q 2 x 1 p x 1 q 1 x 2 p x 2 q x 2 p 2 x 2 q 2 x 2 p x 2 q 1 x np x nq x np 2 x nq 2 x np x nq the matrix equation solving method of equation 35 is using the singular value decomposition svd method using this method the unknown is obtained as follows 39 a a t a 1 a t y where at is the transpose of matrix a by using this solution the unknown can be calculated in any state one of the main advantages of gmdh is that 1 this method chooses a polynomial structure without the need to estimate the previous one and directly from the input data 2 when the data is not very suitable and have error quite effective and useful so that this algorithm can estimate a non linear function with a finite number of data and 3 in this algorithm the probability of an overfitting occurrence is very small however this method has disadvantages as with all methods 1 modeling using a polynomial second order in problems that may require higher polynomials and 2 the input neurons in each layer is taken from the adjacent layer to generalize the gmdh network the use of the adjacent layer in the construction of the next layer should be deleted this item is considered in this study and the inputs of each layer can be of all layers this kind of neural network is called generalize structure gmdh gs gmdh also in this study the model presented by gs gmdh is in third order polynomials and moreover each neuron can have two or three inputs instead of two inputs 3 3 hybrid linear nonlinear methodology the hybrid method applied in this study is a combination of two previous linear and nonlinear methods with different discussed pre processing scenarios that have been coded in the matlab software the wd time series data are decomposed into linear and nonlinear components as wd t wdl t wdn t where wd t is the water demand in time t wdl t is the linear component of wd t and wdn t is the non linear component of wd t the linear component is evaluated by the stochastic method subsequent to removing the estimated linear component wdl t from the data a residual of the stochastic model is obtained time series residuals ought to contain only nonlinear relationships with each other the acf diagram of residuals for various lags was drawn to find the input combination for non linear modeling by gs gmdh method by modeling residuals using gs gmdh the nonlinear component of water demand time series can be modeled then by applying the obtained linear and nonlinear models for data during the training and testing stages water demand is forecasted 3 4 effective variables on water demand several micro and macro scale municipal parameters and climatic variables affect water demand in an urban area many studies were carried out to define common effective variables on temporal or spatial wd modeling in general these variables could be determined by considering impacts of seasonal and periodic wd climatic conditions and municipal parameters in wd time series modeling seasonal and cyclical variations can be defined by julian day x1 and week day x2 the main climatic factors including precipitation and temperature have a great impact on wd these effects are defined by forecasted daily precipitation x3 and temperature x6 antecedent 3 days total precipitation x4 and temperature x7 antecedent 7 days total precipitation x5 and temperature x8 several economic parameters including water price household size population growth income size of outdoor space pool and garden can impact wd variations these municipal parameters recapitulate in previous day production x9 and last 3 and 7 days average production x10 and x11 respectively table 2 summarizes all considered input parameters for forecasting of the wd value x12 the correlation coefficients between the wd data and the effective variables mentioned above during the study period have been listed in table 2 as well the results of the correlation coefficient analysis showed that the wd data has the highest correlation with the x11 x10 and x9 respectively also it was observed that though the correlation between the wd data and other factors reduced considerably however some correlations exist between them particularly the x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 x7 moreover between factors themselves correlations are observed 3 5 the time series wd modeling in the first scenario modeling is done based on linear based stochastic models therefore to take into account the fundamental conditions using stochastic methods based on the normalization of data the time series static and the independence of the residuals a general methodology is presented for this purpose the normalization of the data is evaluated first using the jb test and in the absence of a normal condition in the time series the data is normalized using box cox transformation after normalization the time series stationary is evaluated for this purpose the adt test is evaluated for quantitative evaluation as well as acf and pacf charts for qualitative evaluation in the absence of static before the modeling with stochastic methods identifies and removes deterministic terms are done to identify the trend mann kendal mk and seasonal mk tests are used to identify the jump from the mann whitney test and to identify the period from the fisher test if any of these deterministic terms are present using different stationary methods including non seasonal differencing n s diff seasonal differencing s diff standardization std and spectral analysis sf try to remove them to ensure the absence of deterministic terms in the series using the new series and identifying various parameters related to stochastic methods arma arima and sarima methods are modeled finally the residuals of stochastic models are evaluated using the ljung box test to verify the correctness of the modeling in the absence of the remaining residues stochastic modeling should be done in the second scenario the non linear gs gmdh method a new method for predicting wd is used in this method the first step is identifying the input method of the model so using the acf charts the parameters are identified for the data used in this study the following model is defined 40 wd t f wd t 1 wd t 2 wd t 3 wd t 4 wd t 5 wd t 7 wd t 10 after identification of the model the gs gmdh model parameters including the order of equations second and third order the number of input neurons to each layer two to three and finally the maximum number of allowed layers are modeled after modeling the performance of the gs gmdh method is evaluated by using data that does not play any role in model training in the third scenario there is a fairly similar trend to the second scenario with the difference that in order to model wd in this scenario the raw wd time series is not used and the residuals of the linear stochastic based model as a series used in the hybrid method is used therefore the input of the model will also change the model used in this study is defined as follows 41 wd t f wd t 3 wd t 16 wd t 17 wd t 22 wd t 25 wd t 29 wd t 34 in the second sense for wd modeling 11 different parameters are considered

procedure wd data was first evaluated using adf acf and pacf tests the probability of the test statistic is less than 5 and indicates the stationary of the series in the diagrams of the acf and pacf series fig 4 it is also observed that the time series was taken at 9 non seasonal first lags and is placed in the confidence range however in these graphs it can be seen that there are also many seasonal correlations that indicate the existence of a periodic process in a time series where the adf test was unable to identify it therefore the necessity of using lateral stationary tests is determined along with the adf test mann whitney mann kendal and fisher tests were performed on the series concerning the frequency and trend in the time series the results are presented in table 3 these results show that the series has seasonal and non seasonal trends mkwd and smkwd 0 05 very high frequency f wd 21842 3 and also slightly jump in data umw wd 0 05 therefore the series needs to be preprocessed using appropriate methods and these definite components of the time series are eliminated before performing the preprocesses the series was tested using the jb test to examine the data distribution the probability of this test was less than 5 p jb wd 1 3 which represents an abnormal distribution of data thus before any preprocessing the data was normalized using the boxcox normalize conversion after normalization the probability by the jb test varied to 5 2 although this change is negligible according to the test criteria data is considered normal according to the acf chart it is seen that the series is correlated with the multiples of 7 lags but to ensure the spectral density of the data is also plotted in fig 5 a large spectral density is observed at the frequency equivalent to step 7 on the other hand this diagram shows the existence of a hidden alternate with step 3 5 which should be removed using appropriate methods after normalizing the data were stationary using the methods mentioned in the previous sections the results are presented in table 3 unlike the std and sf methods non seasonal and seasonal differentiation methods by step 7 were able to eliminate seasonal and non seasonal trends and jumps in time series although the std and sf methods were able to reduce the impact of the jump in the series they were not able to remove it on the other hand none of the methods have been able to eliminate frequencies in the series and have led to its increase the high fisher test statistic can be attributed to the frequency with step 3 5 in the data due to the static state of the series based on adf and acf charts the series of stationary methods in fig 6 part i can be modeled using the arma model in this figure it can be seen that the n s diff method perfectly eliminates the seasonal non seasonal correlations in the series and needs a maximum non seasonal parameter for modeling but this method has not been able to eliminate seasonal correlation and even increase it therefore if the arma model is used due to the lack of use of seasonal parameters in modeling this will affect the model s results the s diff method can effectively eliminate seasonal correlations with step 7 but non physical correlations with the same number still exist std and sf methods do not have much effect on seasonal and non seasonal correlations hence the number of non physical parameters for modeling is similar to the original series these correlations reach up to 9 non seasonal parameters for modeling with the arma model the feature of the arima and sarima stochastic models is the existence of seasonal and non linear differential operators in the model itself as well as consideration of seasonal parameters in the sarima model so if the arima and sarima models used the results are as described in table 3 and the acf part ii and iii charts the differential operator in the arima model causes a very small increase in the process of the n s diff series but as shown in the table the jump test result is improved by up to 85 on the other hand with the negativity of the frequency test it is also observed that the hidden alternate with step 3 5 has been well removed in the series although seasonal periodic is still observed in step 7 in series fig 6 std and sf methods were used to improve the results therefore according to the acf diagrams if the arima model is used with non seasonal differential and seasonal parameters then a maximum of 1 parameter for modeling is required with the fact that the main problem in the time series is the occurrence of different frequencies if the arima model is used with seasonal differentiation instead of non seasonal differentiation in the model the results will be significant changes if using s diff with step 7 in the arima model all seasonal correlations observed in the acf chart is cleared with step 7 the results of the fisher test are better and a reduction of about 93 relative to the non seasonal differentiation which is a significant amount although the mann kendal and mann whitney test statistics have been slightly lower than the non seasonal differential the maximum number of non seasonal parameters required for modeling is increased to 3 units but the elimination of seasonal correlations in the series fig 6 part ii can have positive results in modeling using the arima model

parameters in the model changes can be made in fig 6 part iii and table 4 part iii ns s diff by using the sarima model and applying differentials the probability of corresponding statistics of all tests has increased and improved the frequency in general is eliminated in the time series and the maximum number of seasonal and non seasonal parameters is reduced to 1 by using differential operators in the sarima model the best performance of the preprocessing is the sf method sf p mk 94 16 smk 91 45 mw 97 62 mw 57943 adf 0 01 5 2 linear stochastic based modeling the wd time series modeling was performed based on pre processing and introduced linear models at this stage the generated time series of each pre processing were modeled using arma arima and sarima linear models based on different scenarios at first the produced data were modeled using the arma model in the following using the arima model differentiations the data were modeled in seasonal and non seasonal differential equations finally seasonal arima model was applied to the data the proposed parameters for each model were determined based on the acf and pacf charts showing the maximum number of parameter parameters required in tables 3 and 4 according to the nature of the study the available facilities for the arma and arima models were the number of identical parameters and the order of the parameters was considered to be at most 9 p and q 0 1 2 8 9 with a maximum of 2 parameters for the sarima model the total number of models tested was 999 the results of superior models based on different indices in each group are presented in table 5 the values of r2 and vaf for each model in the range r2 45 93 56 11 and vaf 33 87 55 25 respectively indicate that modeling results are close and also weak in any of the modeling methods arma arima with nonseasonal differencing d arima with seasonal differencing d and sarima the standardization method has the highest values of r2 and vaf and has the lowest error values and accuracy indices of theil ui and uii in the following spectral analysis sf and differential n s diff and s diff methods are located at short distances respectively the best performance of the models is also obtained by using the arma model and standardization method std arma s t d r 2 56 11 v a f 55 25 m a p e 3 492 a i c c 5272 9 u i 2 34 u i i 4 67 given the average values of the indices presented in table 6 it can be concluded that the arma modeling technique with its relatively large number of parameters has been more successful than other modeling methods regardless of seasonal parameters this method with average indices arma modeling r2 55 83 vaf 54 47 mape 3 52 aicc 5274 3 ui 2 35 uii 4 71 with a slight difference was better than arima modeling with nonseasonal and seasonal differencing and sarima respectively in fig 7 the plot of main and modeled data is presented the characteristic of this graph in the ineffectiveness is of the limiting values therefore the power of models in predicting mean and maximum values can be seen according to the arma chart as mentioned earlier there is a better power in modeling the heights and limiting values than other methods the average values and box box areas for standardization std are very close to actual values in fig 8 results of the ljung box test is presented for the residuals of the model regarding the results of the residuals of the arma model figure a it is completely independent and the modeling is done correctly if the sarima model presents the weakest results the residuals have many time correlations in general linear modeling techniques could not model limited values this issue can be seen in fig 9 this chart shows the values of the superior linear method and the main wd data for the test period it can be seen that the stochastic modeling method has well simulated linear values but has not been able to model limited values see fig 10 5 3 comparison of the time series based modeling linear nonlinear hybrid models with variables based modeling after modeling the presented methodology for modeling wd time series concept using linear on different pre processing scenario 1 in this section the performance of gs gmdh and arma gs gmdh methods as nonlinear and hybrid methods respectively are compared under scenarios 2 and 3 with scenario 1 fig 9 shows the scatter plot of each of the three methods the results of this figure show that qualitatively the performance of the three methods is almost the same with most of the estimated values having an error of less than 10 the values with relative errors of over 10 are presented in either case with underestimation and overestimation the distribution of the errors presented by this model around the 45 degree line in two directions is approximately equal comparison of the presented methods based on the concept of a time series with the proposed method using independent variables shows that in the gs gmdh variable method the predicted wd values are less error except a few small instances other examples are predicted with relative error less than 10 fig 11 shows the distribution of the relative error associated with linear nonlinear and hybrid time series concepts and the gs gmdh variable method the results presented in this figure show that in all three methods using the time series concept more than 75 of the samples in the test mode have a relative line of less than 5 and 95 of the data a relative error less than 10 it is also observed that in all three methods the maximum relative error is less than 20 the results of this figure indicate that the performance of the three methods is almost the same in different domains the best performance is with the hybrid method comparison of the hybrid method with gs gmdh variable shows that only 2 of the predicted samples have a relative error of more than 10 using the gs gmdh variable method and in all the defined domains the method gs gmdh variable has better performance than the time series concept fig 12 shows the taylor diagram taylor 2001 for each of the three methods presented in scenarios 1 through 3 of the time series concepts and the gs gmdh variable method in this method the performance of each model is evaluated simultaneously by considering the values of root mean square error standard deviation and correlation coefficient the results of this figure indicate a very small difference between the three methods presented based on the time series concept the weakest performance is related to the linear method and the best performance with a very small difference is related to the hybrid method the remarkable difference between the gs gmdh variable method and the best done method based on the time series concept indicates a significant advantage of this method according to the explanation it is concluded that in the prediction of wd the use of independent parameters is considered as a strong method and the definition of linear nonlinear or even time series concepts cannot be used as a reliable method the variable based methods as suggested in this study could be considered as an appropriate alternative in fact in prediction of wd side factors have a greater impact than the historical values of this variable the quantitative evaluation of the uncertainties in water demand prediction using proposed linear nonlinear and hybrid are provided in table 7 the uncertainty analysis ua is calculated for the testing dataset ebtehaj et al 2018 2019 azimi et al 2018 the employed ua in this study is calculated based on the individual prediction error ipe and standard deviation prediction error sdpe by considering the sdpe confidence bound is defined around forecasted values of an error by the wilson score method without continuity correction wsmcc the 95 confidence band is approximated using 1 96 sdpe the ua results are summarized in table 7 it is clear that the proposed hybrid model has accomplished better than linear and nonlinear method the hybrid models over predicted the water demand wd while the linear and nonlinear techniques under predicted the wd the wub for linear and nonlinear models are close and ranged from 647 96 to 648 12 while that for the proposed hybrid model was lower wub 624 25 than others consequently the proposed integrated stochastic model with a generalized structure of the group method of data handling for water demand predicting had the smallest wub of all compared methods comparison between the best time series concept model hybrid with variables based model proved the higher performance of the gs gmdh variable with lower wub of 586 8 quantitative comparison of linear nonlinear and hybrid methods in modeling mode using time series concept and gs gmdh method in variable based mode using different statistical indices table 7 shows that the highest and lowest correlation coefficient in the time series concept is related to linear and hybrid methods so that the difference in r in these two methods is less than 5 also the relative error index indicates that all three methods with relative error predict the water demand of less than 4 so that the difference between the lowest and highest relative error values is about 0 21 which is a very small amount other indices provided in this table also confirm the relatively similar performance of all three methods in addition to the accuracy of each model the simplicity parameter of the model as an important parameter in the comparison of models should be considered the aicc index which considers the amount of accuracy and complexity of the model simultaneously shows that the least complexity is related to the linear method aicc 5274 3 and the most are nonlinear aicc 5423 26 therefore it can be said that the scenario 1 as a method with a certain degree of accuracy and simplicity can be used as an alternative method in wd modeling while it is similar to using this method in combination with nonlinear method in addition to increasing the accuracy of the model it leads to a simpler model than the nonlinear method comparison of time series based models using the gs gmdh method presented in variable based modeling mode shows that the use of independent parameters in wd prediction leads to a better performance than solving this problem as a time series problem as the gs gmdh variable method performs best in all of the indexes presented in table 8 to verify the average and variation of relative errors of each predictive model the box plot that is not sensitive to outliers as a nonparametric method is employed as shown in fig 13 it is observed that the lowest relative error is related to the gs gmdh variable while the highest error value is obtained for nonlinear model result in addition the lowest median of the relative error is also related to gs gmdh variable according to this figure the relative error distribution of the gs gmdh variable in comparison with other models proved the higher performance of the proposed variables based approach in water demand prediction 6 conclusions water demand management provides the opportunity to mitigate capital investments for the water supply systems and most importantly conserve the finite resource of groundwater that a municipality relies on we hypothesized that the daily water demand has predictable weekly and seasonal trends and may also depend on climatic factors such as air temperature and precipitation we analyzed five years of the daily water demand records for the case study city of guelph using various tests and modeled using pre processing methods and advanced stochastic non linear artificial intelligence models to develop an accurate daily water demand forecast model through standardization and spectral analysis seasonal and non seasonal data were processed the results of the tests on the methods and parameters obtained from the acf and pacf charts generated four linear regression models arma arima with non seasonal differencing and arima with seasonal differencing and sarima which were considered however the performance of different methods especially the differential fragmentation method non seasonal differentiation and subsequent seasonal differentiation showed to be more accurate in pre processing data and eliminated deterministic terms jump trend period in comparison to the two other methods standardization and spectral analysis however when modeling standardization std and spectral analysis methods there was better performance best performance was observed when using standardization pre processing std and arma linear modeling method with the following indices arma std r2 56 11 vaf 55 25 mape 3 492 aicc 5272 9 ui 2 34 uii 4 67 linear modeling results showed that due to the multiple frequencies in the original wd series and the high frequency values in the data the linear method could not model wd with a high correlation coefficient therefore two models of gs gmdh and an integrated stochastic model with a generalized structure of the group method of data handling in wd modeling was introduced the results of the comparison of the linear model with the two non linear and hybrid models presented in this study showed that although the accuracy of the proposed models is better than the linear model the disparity is small as well as the simplicity of the linear model with the lowest aicc value the quantitative and qualitative results presented in this study indicate the superiority of the proposed variable based gs gmdh method to the popular time series modelling methods the proposed new gs gmdh daily water demand forecast model will allow optimizing the water storage costs versus pumping capacity costs for the water supply system to maximize the usage of the lower electricity costs for the production pumping at the off peak hours better prediction of water demand will also ensure the

6055,urban water demand forecasting is a significant issue in the design maintenance and operation of a reliable and economical water supply system the large variations in daily water demand are the leading source of health risks due to water pressure drops within the distribution network increasing the likelihood of contamination leaking into the system and or excessive retention time this study presents an explicit mathematical equation based on the air temperature and precipitation effects on the outdoors water uses and the seasonal and weekly trends in the domestic industrial water demands that can accurately forecast the daily water demand fluctuations for a municipality recent time series prediction methods are based on linear non linear and hybrid methods that can be effectively applied to solve time series problems however due to the presence of the high frequency values in the data these methods show some limitations for practical applications to solve these limitations this study introduced a non linear model through a grouping method of data handling for water demand management and tested for the case study city of guelph ontario canada the coefficient of determination and mean absolute percent error of the new water demand forecast model was 71 03 and 2 93 respectively compared to 56 12 and 3 49 for the popular linear model 58 91 and 3 37 for the non linear model 61 37 and 3 28 for the hybrid model respectively the proposed new model will allow optimizing the water storage costs versus pumping capacity costs of the water supply system to maximize the usage of the lower electricity costs for the production pumping at the off peak hours further to assist the city with water demand management and reduce its peaking factors keywords variable non linear pre processing stochastic model water demand 1 introduction the potable water supply for the city of guelph is dependent on groundwater sources managing the daily water demand of the residents businesses and other customers in the community through forecasting is key in creating a reliable and economic system the groundwater source of the city of guelph is of high quality and does not require much treatment the main daily operation cost is for electricity for pumping in ontario the electricity costs during on peak hours of the day are roughly double the cost for the off peak hours the water supply system from the sources to the demand nodes is generally designed based on a uniform water demand pattern for the whole system however the city of guelph has large fluctuations in its population due to rage percentage 20 of university students and requirements from their industrial customers in the summer the outdoor water demand for watering the lawns and gardens and for the top up of the swimming pools have large fluctuations depending on the air temperature and precipitation which increase water demand the daily water demand in the city of guelph varies from roughly 30 000 m3 to as high as 60 000 m3 with large predictable weekly and seasonal trends the larger fluctuations in daily water demand is a challenge for any city as they are required to design water storage to meet their peak water demands therefore management of peak water day demand allows for reduction in capital costs and infrastructure requirements ensuring public safety and water availability for emergencies the correlation of the daily water demand wd with many climatic factors such as temperature and precipitation maidment and parzen 1984 miaou 1990 billings and agthe 1998 zhou et al 2000

schleich and hillenbrand 2009 shandas and parandvash 2010 and other different factors are strong and should be considered important parameters in modeling and forecasting in addition of these principal parameters other parameters such as wind speed ruth et al 2007 praskievicz and chang 2009 evapotranspiration agthe et al 1986 zhou et al 2000 house square footage domene and saurí 2006 wentz and gober 2007 chang et al 2010 size of outdoor space tinker et al 2005 house peters et al 2010 housing typology zhang and brown 2005 fox et al 2009 were also taken into consideration daily water demand forecast model can allow a municipality to proactively implement programming to effectively manage water use decreasing the demand for capital projects to ensure peak water demands could be met and thus provides for lower water rates for their customers furthermore their distribution system can be optimized by decreasing the need to maintain extra storage capacity reserved for emergencies or significant peaks experienced through water demand thus conservation and outside water use management programs can take advantage of demand forecasting to effectively water use during these times of high demand additionally by proving that they are managing their water use the risk that groundwater dependent communities like the city of guelph are under pressure to optimize the supply so the water is taking permits are not exceeding the provincial regulations it is noted that researchers have successfully applied time series modeling based on stochastic modeling linear and or artificial intelligence methods non linear for water demand forecasting as detailed below jain and ormsbee 2002 employed several artificial neural network models conventionally regression and time series analysis to model and forecast short term water demand they considered the rainfall and maximum air temperature and the past water demands as effective parameters for water demand forecast model these detailed authors limitation of approaches and concluded the non linear approach could be improved by some other training algorithms and linear methods can be improved by correct modeling of residuals of time series herrera et al 2010 employed different learning machine methods to forecast hourly urban water demand these authors revealed a disappointing performance of applied methods and proposed a further study on weighted pattern based method improvement wu and yan 2010 utilized two genetic programming gp approaches to find a model for water demand forecast for a real water system these authors used two previous day demands and average temperature to construct the gp models their obtained results showed the average temperature has a significant impact on water demand fullerton et al 2016 applied for a linear transfer function forecasting model based on the autoregressive integrated moving average arima to forecast monthly water consumption in el paso city in texas usa these authors considered several climatic economic and flow rates as inputs for the model development they concluded changes in climatic and economic parameters have more impact on consumption per customer compared to changes in water rates parameters lopez et al 2018 introduced a multi model predictor architecture for water demand forecasting in water distribution networks these authors applied the decomposition of the time series as quantitative and qualitative information yin et al 2018 developed a feedforward artificial neural network model to forecast urban water resources and energy demand ghalehkhondabi et al 2017 reviewed soft computing techniques for water demand forecast these authors concluded although each soft computing method has some advantages but there is a need to develop more accurate models for forecasting water demand most recently bonakdari et al 2018 introduced a new insight in time series modeling by detailing three linear nonlinear hybrid methods zeynoddin et al 2018 proposed a new methodology for modeling of a time series this methodology is based on a combination of stationarization techniques and normality transforms into three different scenarios zeynoddin et al 2018 and ebtehaj et al 2019 highlighted the impact of appropriate pre processing techniques for elimination of deterministic term in time series could lead to a reliable linear approach with higher accuracy compared to non linear approaches although all previous studies applied stochastic methods and artificial intelligence techniques and they made observational predictions for different cases but none of them proposed an explicit equation for practical application following of successful application of linear ebtehaj et al 2019 nonlinear zaji et al 2018 and hybrid models zeynoddin et al 2018 2019 moeeni et al 2017ab moeeni and bonakdari 2017 in time series prediction in time series prediction at first we aimed to propose a model with an explicit equation with high accuracy for forecasting of the water demand the obtained results showed the hybrid model was able to predict wd time series better than linear model but due to the presence of the high frequency values in the data this hybrid model shows some limitations for practical applications to overcome the limitations of statistical and artificial intelligence and hybrid models a nonlinear variable based model was proposed this study exhibits how using knowledge and information about the nature of data can help to define the non linear modeling inputs and expand the applications of wd forecasting this paper proposes a new tool in time series modelling that improves water demand forecasting 2 data description the city of guelph is located in southwestern ontario canada with a population of approximately 135 000 the main source of guelph s drinking water is from groundwater wells and a shallow groundwater collector system located throughout the city and outside of the city s boundary the city has three pressure zones and within those three water towers with a combined capacity of 11 200 m3 the daily water demand for 1128 days from january 01 2015 to june 05 2018 were used for this study the first 788 days of data were used for training the model and the remainder of data was used for testing purposes table 1 summarizes the statistical indices of wd data used in this study in addition a visualization of this characteristics is provided in the lower section of the fig 1 in this figure the box plot of the time series alongside the histograms of the time series and the intervals used in the modeling procedure are provided as shown in fig 1 the time series shows the increasing trend over time in the figure the alternation of averaged daily water demand for the city is illustrated alongside the growth of population for four consecutive years from 2015 to 2018 as wd for the city of guelph is continuing to increase a reliable forecast model is essential to meet the customer water demands and for the system to adapt to future climate and drought conditions in addition due to the high frequency of wd the peaks wss the pumping stations reservoirs and storage systems should manage efficiency to provide the demand of customers the climatic variables are not equivalently impacted water demand throughout the year especially by considering climate changes effect on weather events fig 2 shows water demand temperature and precipitation for two months august and september 2017 as expected the maximum water demand generally occurs during periods of hot and dry weather therefore it is expected the peak water demand occurred in summer with the maximum values of water demand in august however as shown in fig 2 for the city of guelph in 2017 the maximum demand occurred in september 2017 it should be noted that the precipitation on august 11 and 12 caused a decrease in water demand on august 12 and 13 while the temperature remains almost constant the precipitation on august 17 impacts the water demand on the next three days due to lack of precipitation in the second half of september and increasing of the temperatures the maximum water demand value was anticipated to occur on september 25 this example shows there is a need to a reliable forecasted water demand model for the municipality in order to manage peak water day demand outside of normal anticipated peak water conditions hot and dry days noted in august versus september 3 methods wd modeling in this study is completed using two general concepts in the first concept wd is solved as a time series problem so that the historical wd dataset is used to predict the future wd in this modeling concept three general scenarios are defined and the linear modeling is presented by the use of stochastic methods nonlinear modeling using the method of a generalized structure of the group method of data handling gs gmdh and a hybrid method that combines two the previous method these scenarios are respectively expressed as scenarios 1 2 and 3 fig 3 in the second concept independent time series parameters were selected to model to forecast dependent variable wd using gs gmdh model in the following all elements of the flowchart are discussed in details below 3 1 time series components investigation and processing methods stochastic modeling is one of the prediction methods of time series based on the concepts of statistics and probabilities this modeling method is capable of modeling the hydrological phenomena that occurred linearly to model the hydrological processes the time series resulting from these processes should have two characteristics the first feature is the stationary time series which means the constant indices such as mean standard deviation and other statistical characteristics over time the second feature is the normal distribution of data since the dominant hydrological phenomena do not have these two conditions it is necessary to identify and examine the factors affecting these two conditions each time series consists of four components of stochastic trend rotation and jump in the form of wd t s t t t p t j t the three components of process period and jump are called deterministic and identifiable components these three components that are created by sudden events jumps continuous and partial changes trends or regular and frequent changes period in hydrological phenomena should be separated from time series and only a stochastic component remains for modeling therefore accurate identification of these components by various tests and elimination or reduction of their impact on time series is of great importance through appropriate simple and precise methods the first test applied to any given period is the augmented dicky fuller test adf said and dickey 1984 this test examines the time series static the test relationship is as follows 1 δ w d t α β 1 t β 2 t 2 γ w d t 1 ϕ 1 δ w d t 1 ϕ p 1 δ w d t p 1 ε t 2 τ γ σ γ 3 h 0 γ 0 4 h 1 γ 0 where δ is the first order differential operator on wd data α β1 and β2 is a constant value and the coefficient of linear trend and the squared trend which can be considered zero ϕi is the self correlation coefficient i th p is the maximum order of self regression τ is the static of adf test γ estimated root coefficient σ γ standard error of estimated coefficient h0 assumption zero based on unit root and h1 is the alternative assumption that there is no root unit this static time series test examines the time series based on the existence or absence of the root of a linear two order linear model fitted to a time series the absence of the unit root means the stationary of the time series if the probability of the test statistic is less than 5 confidence level the time series is static if the series is un static p adf 5 its factors should be identified mann kendal tests are used to examine seasonal and non seasonal trends in time

variance and the test statistic are obtained as follows 6 mk i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn w d j w d i 7 var mk 1 18 n n 1 2 n 5 g p t g t g 1 2 t g 5 where p is the number of identical groups tg is the number of observations in the g th group sgn is the sign function and n is the number of data seasonal mann kendal smk test is also expressed by the following relationships 8 s k i 1 n k 1 j i 1 n k 1 sgn w

covariance in the test statistic in seasons i and j in these two tests if the probability of the test statistic is higher than the significance level of α in this research is α 0 05 the time series is not trend after studying the trend the periodic time series is checked using the fisher test novick 1994 12 f n n 2 α k 2 β k 2 4 z 1 k w d t α z cos ω z t β z sin ω z t 13 α z 2 n t 1 n w d t cos 2 π

critical value f at the confidence level f 2 n 2 is lower than the f value 17 f f 2 n 2 for a significant level of 5 the degree of freedom in the denominator is 3 the mann whitney mw test is a non parametric test used to check jumps in time series in this test by dividing the series into sub series samples of the entire data are examined and if the data is evenly distributed there is a lack of jump in the data mann and whitney 1947 the test statistic is presented as follows 18 u mw t 1 n 1 r g t n 1 n 1 n 2 1 2 n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 1 12 where the series g t sorted by the original series wd t r g t the degree of function g t n1 and n2 are the number of members of the original series the sum of which is equal to the main series if the probability corresponds to the test statistic in the normal probability distribution p u mw the is greater than confidence level α the assumption of the same distribution of series is acceptable and the main series is jump free after identifying the factors affecting the stationary of the time series it is time to choose the appropriate methods to eliminate or reduce the impact of these factors differentiation is one of the simplest and most widely used methods the differentiation takes place in two non seasonal and seasonal modes with delays proportional to the time series ω 19 n s d i f f w d t w d t 1 20 s d i f f w d t w d t s where n s diff and s diff are non seasonal and seasonal differentiated data respectively t is time and s is a seasonal step differentiation with the stabilization of the mean in the time series by eliminating changes in the time series level will eliminate the trend and seasonal variations in the series and ultimately the stationary of the series standardization std is one of the preprocessing methods used to modify the data distribution scale so that the observational data has a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one 21 std wd t wd s d where std is the standardized data wd the average of the data and sd is the average deviation of the data with the help of spectral analysis based on the fourier series expansion a time series can be separated into sinusoidal and cosine functions hence the periodic component can be presented as a function of time and by reducing the component of the time series the periodic component is eliminated and the series is stationary 22 p t wd t z 1 k α z cos 2 π f z t

and wd data turning to linear data modeling is achieved stochastic models are used to model data these models have different modeling parameters that are divided into two groups of seasonal and non

3 2 nonlinear modeling gs gmdh the gmdh method is one of the iterative heuristic family algorithms that detect linear and nonlinear polynomials and modulates and matched the pattern based on observed data ivakhnenko 1971 farlow 1984 the gmdh neural network is a self organized network and consists of several layers and each layer consists of several neurons all of which have the same structure the prominent feature observed in this type of network indicates that the previous stage or previous layer m neurons are the factor or generator of the production of new neurons in the cm 2 among the produced neurons it is imperative that some of them be removed to prevent divergence of the network then called neuron dead neurons lemke 1997 in general volterra kolmogorov gabor vkg polynomials can be used to model complex systems which include a set of data with multiple inputs and one output 33 y a 0 i 1 n a i x i i 1 n j 1 n a ij x i x ij i 1 n j 1 n k 1 n a ijk x i x j x k in which x x1 x2 xn is the input vectors y is the output of the model and ai the polynomial coefficients vkg polynomials are approximated using quadratic polynomials these second valley polynomials are based on binary combinations of network inputs the gmdh algorithm is introduced using this idea as a learning method for modeling complex systems ivakhnenko 1971 madala and ivakhenko 1994 the gmdh neural network has a neural network structure and forward and includes a set of neurons that connect the various input pairs through a quadratic polynomial each layer in this network consists of one or more processor units each of which has two inputs and one output these units play the role of model components and are considered as a quadratic polynomial the unknown parameters of the gmdh algorithm are the polynomial coefficients of the above equation to calculate the output value for each input vector x x1 x2 xn according to eq 33 the mean squared error must be minimized 34 e i 1 n y i y i 2 to find the minimum error value the partial derivative of the above relation is used by placing the relation 33 in this partial derivative a matrix equation is obtained as follows 35 aa y 36 a a 0 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 a 5 37 y y 1 y m t 38 a 1 x 1 p x 1 q x 1 p 2 x 1 q 2 x 1 p x 1 q 1 x 2 p x 2 q x 2 p 2 x 2 q 2 x 2 p x 2 q 1 x np x nq x np 2 x nq 2 x np x nq the matrix equation solving method of equation 35 is using the singular value decomposition svd method using this method the unknown is obtained as follows 39 a a t a 1 a t y where at is the transpose of matrix a by using this solution the unknown can be calculated in any state one of the main advantages of gmdh is that 1 this method chooses a polynomial structure without the need to estimate the previous one and directly from the input data 2 when the data is not very suitable and have error quite effective and useful so that this algorithm can estimate a non linear function with a finite number of data and 3 in this algorithm the probability of an overfitting occurrence is very small however this method has disadvantages as with all methods 1 modeling using a polynomial second order in problems that may require higher polynomials and 2 the input neurons in each layer is taken from the adjacent layer to generalize the gmdh network the use of the adjacent layer in the construction of the next layer should be deleted this item is considered in this study and the inputs of each layer can be of all layers this kind of neural network is called generalize structure gmdh gs gmdh also in this study the model presented by gs gmdh is in third order polynomials and moreover each neuron can have two or three inputs instead of two inputs 3 3 hybrid linear nonlinear methodology the hybrid method applied in this study is a combination of two previous linear and nonlinear methods with different discussed pre processing scenarios that have been coded in the matlab software the wd time series data are decomposed into linear and nonlinear components as wd t wdl t wdn t where wd t is the water demand in time t wdl t is the linear component of wd t and wdn t is the non linear component of wd t the linear component is evaluated by the stochastic method subsequent to removing the estimated linear component wdl t from the data a residual of the stochastic model is obtained time series residuals ought to contain only nonlinear relationships with each other the acf diagram of residuals for various lags was drawn to find the input combination for non linear modeling by gs gmdh method by modeling residuals using gs gmdh the nonlinear component of water demand time series can be modeled then by applying the obtained linear and nonlinear models for data during the training and testing stages water demand is forecasted 3 4 effective variables on water demand several micro and macro scale municipal parameters and climatic variables affect water demand in an urban area many studies were carried out to define common effective variables on temporal or spatial wd modeling in general these variables could be determined by considering impacts of seasonal and periodic wd climatic conditions and municipal parameters in wd time series modeling seasonal and cyclical variations can be defined by julian day x1 and week day x2 the main climatic factors including precipitation and temperature have a great impact on wd these effects are defined by forecasted daily precipitation x3 and temperature x6 antecedent 3 days total precipitation x4 and temperature x7 antecedent 7 days total precipitation x5 and temperature x8 several economic parameters including water price household size population growth income size of outdoor space pool and garden can impact wd variations these municipal parameters recapitulate in previous day production x9 and last 3 and 7 days average production x10 and x11 respectively table 2 summarizes all considered input parameters for forecasting of the wd value x12 the correlation coefficients between the wd data and the effective variables mentioned above during the study period have been listed in table 2 as well the results of the correlation coefficient analysis showed that the wd data has the highest correlation with the x11 x10 and x9 respectively also it was observed that though the correlation between the wd data and other factors reduced considerably however some correlations exist between them particularly the x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6 x7 moreover between factors themselves correlations are observed 3 5 the time series wd modeling in the first scenario modeling is done based on linear based stochastic models therefore to take into account the fundamental conditions using stochastic methods based on the normalization of data the time series static and the independence of the residuals a general methodology is presented for this purpose the normalization of the data is evaluated first using the jb test and in the absence of a normal condition in the time series the data is normalized using box cox transformation after normalization the time series stationary is evaluated for this purpose the adt test is evaluated for quantitative evaluation as well as acf and pacf charts for qualitative evaluation in the absence of static before the modeling with stochastic methods identifies and removes deterministic terms are done to identify the trend mann kendal mk and seasonal mk tests are used to identify the jump from the mann whitney test and to identify the period from the fisher test if any of these deterministic terms are present using different stationary methods including non seasonal differencing n s diff seasonal differencing s diff standardization std and spectral analysis sf try to remove them to ensure the absence of deterministic terms in the series using the new series and identifying various parameters related to stochastic methods arma arima and sarima methods are modeled finally the residuals of stochastic models are evaluated using the ljung box test to verify the correctness of the modeling in the absence of the remaining residues stochastic modeling should be done in the second scenario the non linear gs gmdh method a new method for predicting wd is used in this method the first step is identifying the input method of the model so using the acf charts the parameters are identified for the data used in this study the following model is defined 40 wd t f wd t 1 wd t 2 wd t 3 wd t 4 wd t 5 wd t 7 wd t 10 after identification of the model the gs gmdh model parameters including the order of equations second and third order the number of input neurons to each layer two to three and finally the maximum number of allowed layers are modeled after modeling the performance of the gs gmdh method is evaluated by using data that does not play any role in model training in the third scenario there is a fairly similar trend to the second scenario with the difference that in order to model wd in this scenario the raw wd time series is not used and the residuals of the linear stochastic based model as a series used in the hybrid method is used therefore the input of the model will also change the model used in this study is defined as follows 41 wd t f wd t 3 wd t 16 wd t 17 wd t 22 wd t 25 wd t 29 wd t 34 in the second sense for wd modeling 11 different parameters are considered

box test statistic in the χ2 distribution is greater than the α confidence level q 0 05 q α the residue series is independent and the model is appropriate 5 results and discussion 5 1 preprocessing procedure wd data was first evaluated using adf acf and pacf tests the probability of the test statistic is less than 5 and indicates the stationary of the series in the diagrams of the acf and pacf series fig 4 it is also observed that the time series was taken at 9 non seasonal first lags and is placed in the confidence range however in these graphs it can be seen that there are also many seasonal correlations that indicate the existence of a periodic process in a time series where the adf test was unable to identify it therefore the necessity of using lateral stationary tests is determined along with the adf test mann whitney mann kendal and fisher tests were performed on the series concerning the frequency and trend in the time series the results are presented in table 3 these results show that the series has seasonal and non seasonal trends mkwd and smkwd 0 05 very high frequency f wd 21842 3 and also slightly jump in data umw wd 0 05 therefore the series needs to be preprocessed using appropriate methods and these definite components of the time series are eliminated before performing the preprocesses the series was tested using the jb test to examine the data distribution the probability of this test was less than 5 p jb wd 1 3 which represents an abnormal distribution of data thus before any preprocessing the data was normalized using the boxcox normalize conversion after normalization the probability by the jb test varied to 5 2 although this change is negligible according to the test criteria data is considered normal according to the acf chart it is seen that the series is correlated with the multiples of 7 lags but to ensure the spectral density of the data is also plotted in fig 5 a large spectral density is observed at the frequency equivalent to step 7 on the other hand this diagram shows the existence of a hidden alternate with step 3 5 which should be removed using appropriate methods after normalizing the data were stationary using the methods mentioned in the previous sections the results are presented in table 3 unlike the std and sf methods non seasonal and seasonal differentiation methods by step 7 were able to eliminate seasonal and non seasonal trends and jumps in time series although the std and sf methods were able to reduce the impact of the jump in the series they were not able to remove it on the other hand none of the methods have been able to eliminate frequencies in the series and have led to its increase the high fisher test statistic can be attributed to the frequency with step 3 5 in the data due to the static state of the series based on adf and acf charts the series of stationary methods in fig 6 part i can be modeled using the arma model in this figure it can be seen that the n s diff method perfectly eliminates the seasonal non seasonal correlations in the series and needs a maximum non seasonal parameter for modeling but this method has not been able to eliminate seasonal correlation and even increase it therefore if the arma model is used due to the lack of use of seasonal parameters in modeling this will affect the model s results the s diff method can effectively eliminate seasonal correlations with step 7 but non physical correlations with the same number still exist std and sf methods do not have much effect on seasonal and non seasonal correlations hence the number of non physical parameters for modeling is similar to the original series these correlations reach up to 9 non seasonal parameters for modeling with the arma model the feature of the arima and sarima stochastic models is the existence of seasonal and non linear differential operators in the model itself as well as consideration of seasonal parameters in the sarima model so if the arima and sarima models used the results are as described in table 3 and the acf part ii and iii charts the differential operator in the arima model causes a very small increase in the process of the n s diff series but as shown in the table the jump test result is improved by up to 85 on the other hand with the negativity of the frequency test it is also observed that the hidden alternate with step 3 5 has been well removed in the series although seasonal periodic is still observed in step 7 in series fig 6 std and sf methods were used to improve the results therefore according to the acf diagrams if the arima model is used with non seasonal differential and seasonal parameters then a maximum of 1 parameter for modeling is required with the fact that the main problem in the time series is the occurrence of different frequencies if the arima model is used with seasonal differentiation instead of non seasonal differentiation in the model the results will be significant changes if using s diff with step 7 in the arima model all seasonal correlations observed in the acf chart is cleared with step 7 the results of the fisher test are better and a reduction of about 93 relative to the non seasonal differentiation which is a significant amount although the mann kendal and mann whitney test statistics have been slightly lower than the non seasonal differential the maximum number of non seasonal parameters required for modeling is increased to 3 units but the elimination of seasonal correlations in the series fig 6 part ii can have positive results in modeling using the arima model

parameters in the model changes can be made in fig 6 part iii and table 4 part iii ns s diff by using the sarima model and applying differentials the probability of corresponding statistics of all tests has increased and improved the frequency in general is eliminated in the time series and the maximum number of seasonal and non seasonal parameters is reduced to 1 by using differential operators in the sarima model the best performance of the preprocessing is the sf method sf p mk 94 16 smk 91 45 mw 97 62 mw 57943 adf 0 01 5 2 linear stochastic based modeling the wd time series modeling was performed based on pre processing and introduced linear models at this stage the generated time series of each pre processing were modeled using arma arima and sarima linear models based on different scenarios at first the produced data were modeled using the arma model in the following using the arima model differentiations the data were modeled in seasonal and non seasonal differential equations finally seasonal arima model was applied to the data the proposed parameters for each model were determined based on the acf and pacf charts showing the maximum number of parameter parameters required in tables 3 and 4 according to the nature of the study the available facilities for the arma and arima models were the number of identical parameters and the order of the parameters was considered to be at most 9 p and q 0 1 2 8 9 with a maximum of 2 parameters for the sarima model the total number of models tested was 999 the results of superior models based on different indices in each group are presented in table 5 the values of r2 and vaf for each model in the range r2 45 93 56 11 and vaf 33 87 55 25 respectively indicate that modeling results are close and also weak in any of the modeling methods arma arima with nonseasonal differencing d arima with seasonal differencing d and sarima the standardization method has the highest values of r2 and vaf and has the lowest error values and accuracy indices of theil ui and uii in the following spectral analysis sf and differential n s diff and s diff methods are located at short distances respectively the best performance of the models is also obtained by using the arma model and standardization method std arma s t d r 2 56 11 v a f 55 25 m a p e 3 492 a i c c 5272 9 u i 2 34 u i i 4 67 given the average values of the indices presented in table 6 it can be concluded that the arma modeling technique with its relatively large number of parameters has been more successful than other modeling methods regardless of seasonal parameters this method with average indices arma modeling r2 55 83 vaf 54 47 mape 3 52 aicc 5274 3 ui 2 35 uii 4 71 with a slight difference was better than arima modeling with nonseasonal and seasonal differencing and sarima respectively in fig 7 the plot of main and modeled data is presented the characteristic of this graph in the ineffectiveness is of the limiting values therefore the power of models in predicting mean and maximum values can be seen according to the arma chart as mentioned earlier there is a better power in modeling the heights and limiting values than other methods the average values and box box areas for standardization std are very close to actual values in fig 8 results of the ljung box test is presented for the residuals of the model regarding the results of the residuals of the arma model figure a it is completely independent and the modeling is done correctly if the sarima model presents the weakest results the residuals have many time correlations in general linear modeling techniques could not model limited values this issue can be seen in fig 9 this chart shows the values of the superior linear method and the main wd data for the test period it can be seen that the stochastic modeling method has well simulated linear values but has not been able to model limited values see fig 10 5 3 comparison of the time series based modeling linear nonlinear hybrid models with variables based modeling after modeling the presented methodology for modeling wd time series concept using linear on different pre processing scenario 1 in this section the performance of gs gmdh and arma gs gmdh methods as nonlinear and hybrid methods respectively are compared under scenarios 2 and 3 with scenario 1 fig 9 shows the scatter plot of each of the three methods the results of this figure show that qualitatively the performance of the three methods is almost the same with most of the estimated values having an error of less than 10 the values with relative errors of over 10 are presented in either case with underestimation and overestimation the distribution of the errors presented by this model around the 45 degree line in two directions is approximately equal comparison of the presented methods based on the concept of a time series with the proposed method using independent variables shows that in the gs gmdh variable method the predicted wd values are less error except a few small instances other examples are predicted with relative error less than 10 fig 11 shows the distribution of the relative error associated with linear nonlinear and hybrid time series concepts and the gs gmdh variable method the results presented in this figure show that in all three methods using the time series concept more than 75 of the samples in the test mode have a relative line of less than 5 and 95 of the data a relative error less than 10 it is also observed that in all three methods the maximum relative error is less than 20 the results of this figure indicate that the performance of the three methods is almost the same in different domains the best performance is with the hybrid method comparison of the hybrid method with gs gmdh variable shows that only 2 of the predicted samples have a relative error of more than 10 using the gs gmdh variable method and in all the defined domains the method gs gmdh variable has better performance than the time series concept fig 12 shows the taylor diagram taylor 2001 for each of the three methods presented in scenarios 1 through 3 of the time series concepts and the gs gmdh variable method in this method the performance of each model is evaluated simultaneously by considering the values of root mean square error standard deviation and correlation coefficient the results of this figure indicate a very small difference between the three methods presented based on the time series concept the weakest performance is related to the linear method and the best performance with a very small difference is related to the hybrid method the remarkable difference between the gs gmdh variable method and the best done method based on the time series concept indicates a significant advantage of this method according to the explanation it is concluded that in the prediction of wd the use of independent parameters is considered as a strong method and the definition of linear nonlinear or even time series concepts cannot be used as a reliable method the variable based methods as suggested in this study could be considered as an appropriate alternative in fact in prediction of wd side factors have a greater impact than the historical values of this variable the quantitative evaluation of the uncertainties in water demand prediction using proposed linear nonlinear and hybrid are provided in table 7 the uncertainty analysis ua is calculated for the testing dataset ebtehaj et al 2018 2019 azimi et al 2018 the employed ua in this study is calculated based on the individual prediction error ipe and standard deviation prediction error sdpe by considering the sdpe confidence bound is defined around forecasted values of an error by the wilson score method without continuity correction wsmcc the 95 confidence band is approximated using 1 96 sdpe the ua results are summarized in table 7 it is clear that the proposed hybrid model has accomplished better than linear and nonlinear method the hybrid models over predicted the water demand wd while the linear and nonlinear techniques under predicted the wd the wub for linear and nonlinear models are close and ranged from 647 96 to 648 12 while that for the proposed hybrid model was lower wub 624 25 than others consequently the proposed integrated stochastic model with a generalized structure of the group method of data handling for water demand predicting had the smallest wub of all compared methods comparison between the best time series concept model hybrid with variables based model proved the higher performance of the gs gmdh variable with lower wub of 586 8 quantitative comparison of linear nonlinear and hybrid methods in modeling mode using time series concept and gs gmdh method in variable based mode using different statistical indices table 7 shows that the highest and lowest correlation coefficient in the time series concept is related to linear and hybrid methods so that the difference in r in these two methods is less than 5 also the relative error index indicates that all three methods with relative error predict the water demand of less than 4 so that the difference between the lowest and highest relative error values is about 0 21 which is a very small amount other indices provided in this table also confirm the relatively similar performance of all three methods in addition to the accuracy of each model the simplicity parameter of the model as an important parameter in the comparison of models should be considered the aicc index which considers the amount of accuracy and complexity of the model simultaneously shows that the least complexity is related to the linear method aicc 5274 3 and the most are nonlinear aicc 5423 26 therefore it can be said that the scenario 1 as a method with a certain degree of accuracy and simplicity can be used as an alternative method in wd modeling while it is similar to using this method in combination with nonlinear method in addition to increasing the accuracy of the model it leads to a simpler model than the nonlinear method comparison of time series based models using the gs gmdh method presented in variable based modeling mode shows that the use of independent parameters in wd prediction leads to a better performance than solving this problem as a time series problem as the gs gmdh variable method performs best in all of the indexes presented in table 8 to verify the average and variation of relative errors of each predictive model the box plot that is not sensitive to outliers as a nonparametric method is employed as shown in fig 13 it is observed that the lowest relative error is related to the gs gmdh variable while the highest error value is obtained for nonlinear model result in addition the lowest median of the relative error is also related to gs gmdh variable according to this figure the relative error distribution of the gs gmdh variable in comparison with other models proved the higher performance of the proposed variables based approach in water demand prediction 6 conclusions water demand management provides the opportunity to mitigate capital investments for the water supply systems and most importantly conserve the finite resource of groundwater that a municipality relies on we hypothesized that the daily water demand has predictable weekly and seasonal trends and may also depend on climatic factors such as air temperature and precipitation we analyzed five years of the daily water demand records for the case study city of guelph using various tests and modeled using pre processing methods and advanced stochastic non linear artificial intelligence models to develop an accurate daily water demand forecast model through standardization and spectral analysis seasonal and non seasonal data were processed the results of the tests on the methods and parameters obtained from the acf and pacf charts generated four linear regression models arma arima with non seasonal differencing and arima with seasonal differencing and sarima which were considered however the performance of different methods especially the differential fragmentation method non seasonal differentiation and subsequent seasonal differentiation showed to be more accurate in pre processing data and eliminated deterministic terms jump trend period in comparison to the two other methods standardization and spectral analysis however when modeling standardization std and spectral analysis methods there was better performance best performance was observed when using standardization pre processing std and arma linear modeling method with the following indices arma std r2 56 11 vaf 55 25 mape 3 492 aicc 5272 9 ui 2 34 uii 4 67 linear modeling results showed that due to the multiple frequencies in the original wd series and the high frequency values in the data the linear method could not model wd with a high correlation coefficient therefore two models of gs gmdh and an integrated stochastic model with a generalized structure of the group method of data handling in wd modeling was introduced the results of the comparison of the linear model with the two non linear and hybrid models presented in this study showed that although the accuracy of the proposed models is better than the linear model the disparity is small as well as the simplicity of the linear model with the lowest aicc value the quantitative and qualitative results presented in this study indicate the superiority of the proposed variable based gs gmdh method to the popular time series modelling methods the proposed new gs gmdh daily water demand forecast model will allow optimizing the water storage costs versus pumping capacity costs for the water supply system to maximize the usage of the lower electricity costs for the production pumping at the off peak hours better prediction of water demand will also ensure the

were generally the best cdfs for the 9 epis in china by comparing the results during 2021 2100 with 1961 2017 the return periods increased as the epis increased it was especially apparent in southeast china where the annual mean precipitation was above 1300 mm the increases of the trends were significant for epis especially in northwestern china including the maximum 1 day precipitation number of heavy precipitation days number of very heavy precipitation days extremely wet days and annual total wet day precipitation the simple daily intensity index increased in northeast china decreased in western china but had no significant change in other regions the maximum 5 day precipitation and consecutive wet days decreased in most areas except western china the consecutive dry days decreased in northern china and increased in southeast china this study provides region and site specific optimal cdfs and return period information and reveals the spatiotemporal changes of 9 epis at different return periods of 10 20 50 and 100 years under the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios for 2021 2100 the obtained results are useful for guiding disaster prevention efforts in different regions of china

wang et al 2018 in recent years extreme precipitation events have tended to occur more frequently scoccimarro et al 2013 the frequency of extreme precipitation events is predicted to increase in the future including in china guo et al 2018 lau et al 2013 yuan et al 2015 which will also increase the risks of drought floods landslides and agricultural disasters extreme precipitation indices epis have been commonly used to characterize extreme precipitation events in past studies a deep understanding of the spatiotemporal patterns of epis and a reasonable prediction method are necessary for water related disaster prevention efforts and decision making extreme precipitation indices epis have been extensively used to quantitatively characterize extreme precipitation events each index has an interior meaning table s1 for example the day count type has fixed thresholds r10 r20 r100 etc while the percentile type r95p and r99p is relative to the base period and used among a wide variety of climates and it overcomes the weakness of a fixed threshold li et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 due to only less than 60 years of precipitation data are available in china it is difficult to estimate return periods of 50 or 100 year by original probability distribution cumulative distribution functions cdfs are useful in calculating the frequency properties of epis which is standard to estimate the return period of epis cunnane 1989 cunnane 1989 listed more than 20 cdfs these functions have been commonly divided into four families namely the normal including the normal log normal distribution ln2 and three parameter log normal distribution ln3 the extreme value including the general extreme value gev gumbel log gumbel and weibull the pearson iii p iii and logarithmic p iii and the generalized pareto gpa malamud and turcotte 2006 however the epis frequency may be exaggerated or underestimated if unsuitable cdfs are used without considering the most appropriate cdf are site or region specific tan and gan 2017 analysed the frequency of heavy precipitation in canada using the gev and gpa distributions and found that compared to the gpa the gev tended to underestimate annual maximum precipitation in the western and eastern coastal regions of canada forestieri et al 2018 analysed the frequency of extreme rainfall in sicily using the ln3 gev and two component extreme value distributions and concluded that for shorter return periods all three distributions performed well but for longer return periods the ln3 performed the best the gev generalized logistic generalized normal p iii and gpa distributions were used to fit the experience frequency of extreme events the results showed that the annual maximum precipitation had increasing trends at most stations and the gev was the most appropriate distribution du et al 2013 wang et al 2016b analysed 11 epis over the western yellow sea coast in china at 12 weather stations during 1951 2011 and concluded that extreme precipitation events have become more concentrated and intense in the last decades although several studies investigated the frequency changes of epis in different parts of china the site or region specific best cdfs of different epis in china have not been systematically investigated this limited the applications for characterizing extreme precipitation events in the study regions of interest in china different general circulation models gcms have been widely used to project future changes of epis li et al 2012 um et al 2017 however gcm outputs have overly coarse spatial resolutions with hundreds of square kilometres to be applied at regional scales fu et al 2017 different downscaling methods namely statistical downscaling dynamic downscaling and the combination of the two have been applied to overcome this obstacle optimal resolution data can be generated by dynamic downscaling manage et al 2016 however the cost of computation is much higher statistical downscaling uses a statistical transfer function to downscale the gcms data from a grid to a point scale meteorological series liu and zuo 2012 the meteorological series can easily be extended if a reliable daily historical climatic data series is available several studies have analysed the frequency of historical and projected extreme precipitation events in china wu et al 2018 analysed the temporal distribution patterns trends and return levels of epis daily precipitation 99th percentile and concluded that along the southeast coastline in the lower lancang river and on the hainan island all daily extreme precipitation would exceed 300 and 400 mm under 20 and 50 year return periods shao et al 2015 analysed the frequency of annual maximum precipitation during 1951 2010 and found that the estimated frequency for the 50 year return period agreed with the observed annual maximum precipitation series at most of the stations wen et al 2015 analysed changes in extreme temperature and extreme precipitation in china in historical 1901 2005 and future 2006 2100 periods and revealed that the regional mean extreme precipitation in the 10 20 and 50 year return periods would increase 7 9 13 4 during 2006 2100 compared to 1901 2005 yin et al 2016 projected the change of 3 epis including maximum precipitation for 1 day 3 days and 7 days in 20 and 50 year return periods during 1961 2000 and 2001 2050 and found that the 3 epis would increase during 2001 2050 compared to 1961 2000 and some places the middle reaches of the yellow river and the lower reaches and plain area of the huaihe river will even increase more than 30 although many studies have analysed the frequency of such day count epis rx1day rxnday in china limited studies have projected the frequency of epis that revealed different inherent natures of extreme precipitation e g sdii r10 cdd and rx95p by selecting the best cdfs in mainland china to narrow this gap we aim to 1 analyse the spatiotemporal variations of the 9 selected epis during 1961 2017 in 7 different sub regions and for mainland china 2 select the most appropriate cdfs from 10 commonly used cdfs for the 9 epis at 552 study sites and 7 sub regions 3 analyse the spatial distribution of the 9 epis for 10 20 50 and 100 year return periods and 4 project spatiotemporal changes of the 9 epis at different return periods for 10 20 50 and 100 year periods under the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios during 2021 2100 this research reveals changes within the site or region specific return periods of different epis in china which may provide useful references for extreme precipitation event prevention and disaster recovery efforts 2 data and methodology 2 1 weather data and study sites the observed daily precipitation data at 552 weather stations during 1961 2017 were collected from the china meteorological data sharing network http data cma cn china is divided into 7 different sub regions fig 1 detailed sub region information is provided by peng et al 2017 and ayantobo et al 2017 the climatic conditions in each sub region and for china are referred to in table 1 of yao et al 2018a 2 2 selection of extreme precipitation indices and the best cdf nine epis computed at the annual time scale are selected from the expert team on climate change detection and indices http etccdi pacificclimate org docs etccdmindicescomparison1 pdf to characterize the extreme precipitation events table s1 the total precipitation of the 99th percentile is calculated during 1961 1990 at each site the 10 commonly used cdfs namely the normal ln2 ln3 gumbel gev weibull two parameter gamma p iii poisson and gpa table 1 were compared by their performances when using the 9 epis of these the gpa distribution is a heavy tailed distribution the gev ln2 gumbel and ln3 are regularly varying distributions and the p iii weibull and normal distribution are slightly tailed el adlouni et al 2008 ye et al 2013 the parameters of each cdf are estimated with the maximum likelihood method archer 1998 which is an asymptotically efficient and unbiased method therefore it is one of the best methods to estimate parameters in cdfs in hydrology strupczewski et al 2001 although only the maximum likelihood method was applied the goodness of fit properties of the best cdfs for each epi indicated the applicability of the method the meanings of the terms are described in table s2 the return period is defined as the reciprocal of 1 p where p is the non exceedance probability coming from the cdf the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and akaike information criterion aic satishsiyengar 1997 are used to assess the performances of the selected cdfs the kolmogorov smirnov test is a nonparametric hypothesis test that evaluates the difference between the cdfs of the distributions of the two sample data vectors in each dataset miller 1956 aic is a useful index in evaluating the performance of different gcms compared with bayesian information criterion bic the penalty of aic type ensures an important minimax property it is minimax rate optimal for both parametric and nonparametric cases yang 2006 the equations for estimating the three indices are written as follows 1 r 2 i 1 n x i x m y i y m 2 i 1 n x i x m 2 i 1 n y i y m 2 2 rmse i 1 n p e i p i 2 n 3 aic n ln π r m s e 2 2 m where y i and x i are the ith estimated and observed probability values of the epis respectively n is the number of years pei and pi are the experience and theoretical frequency values respectively m is the number of parameters the higher the r 2 or the lower the rmse and aic values the better the goodness of fit 2 3 climate projections 2 3 1 statistical downscaling the nwai wg statistical downscaling and climate projection model was developed by liu and zuo 2012 using a modified richardson type weather generator the gcms data were used to drive the nwai wg statistical downscaling model to efficiently generate a daily time series and incorporate the series into multiple gcms anwar et al 2015 touch et al 2015 wang et al 2015 yang et al 2013 this method consists of both spatial and temporal downscaling procedures the purpose of spatial downscaling is to downscale the monthly gcm precipitation data from grid cells to sites the bias correction required transferring the result using functions obtained from observed and gcm historical data in the training period of 1961 2000 temporal downscaling is used to generate the daily data from monthly data using a weather generator liu and zuo 2012 daily precipitation data are downscaled by wgen stochastic weather generator richardson and wright 1984 the precipitation were simulated by 2 parameter gamma distribution and the density function is written as follows 4 1 α γ β x α β 1 e x α α 0 β 0 whereαis sharpness parameter and β is scale parameter the probability of rain on a given day depends on the wet or dry status of the previous day the conditional probabilities denoted asp m w w andp m w d are calculated for each calendar month see details in liu and zuo 2012 fig s1 displayed the q q plots that showed the quantiles of observed precipitation versus the quantiles of raw gcm precipitation and downscaled precipitation for the period 1961 2000 at wugong station as an example which is located near the middle part of china the downscaling method effectively corrected the biases of the 28 raw gcm projected precipitation resulting in little difference with observed precipitation values similar results were obtained at the other 551 sites data not shown this outcome confirmed the necessity of downscaling 2 3 2 gcm evaluation multi model ensemble and model weight the monthly gridded weather data generated from 28 gcms table s3 were downloaded from the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 site https esgf data dkrz de search cmip5 dkrz taylor s diagram and skill score s were used to evaluate the performance of the 28 gcms taylor s method combined standard deviation and a correlation coefficient in a single diagram to evaluate the performances of different gcms the taylor s skill score s is slightly modified wang et al 2016a 5 s 4 l r 2 σ f σ r σ r σ f 2 1 r 0 2 where r is the correlation coefficient r 0 is maximum r 0 999 σ f and σ r are the standard deviations of the simulated and observed time series respectively the larger the s value the better the gcm s performance a weighted ensemble approach was used to reduce the uncertainty in the projected variables wang et al 2016b 2016 this approach has better projection skills than ensembles with equal weights bishop and abramowitz 2012 wang et al 2016a b taylor s skill score s was used to rank the performance of the 28 gcms for each epi the weight of each gcm is calculated by guo et al 2018 6 u j j 1 n s s j 7 w i u j j 1 n u j where n is the number of gcms sj is the rank of the ith gcm j 1 2 28 ui can be considered the combined performance indicator for the ith gcm wi is the weight of the ith gcm and can be considered the normalized value of ri the radiative forcing and co2 emission are prescribed by representative concentration pathways rcp the 4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios were chosen for future projection 3 results 3 1 the decadal changes of 9 epis in 7 sub regions of china fig 2 illustrates the range of long term mean epis during 1961 2017 in 7 sub regions in china the figure showed the following 1 there were large differences in the 9 epis in different sub regions 2 the values of 8 epis except cdd which indicated dry conditions generally decreased in sub regions vii to v iv iii ii vi and i and cdd generally decreased in i ii vi iv iii vii and v 3 there were large ranges for the 8 epis except cdd for humid and super humid regions iv v and vii and small ranges for arid or semi arid sub regions i ii and vi cdd had large ranges in sub regions i and vi 4 the values for the median annual rx1day from 1961 to 2017 for sub regions i to vii were 18 0 38 3 54 6 76 1 97 6 25 8 and 123 mm 5 the values of all epis had regional characteristics for the 8 wet epis the values almost ranked in an increasing order of sub regions i vi ii iii iv iv and vii for dry epi i e cdd it was almost reversed 3 2 the best selected cdfs of the 9 epis the ten theoretical cdfs were compared with the experience frequency values to select the most appropriate cdf for each epi at each site the wugong station which is located almost in the centre of china and has a warm temperate continental monsoon climate with annual mean precipitation of 633 7 mm was chosen as a demonstration site for the selection of the best cdf fig 3 tables 2 and s4 the gpa and poisson distributions performed poorly for most epis as the gumbel generally underestimated the frequencies of all 9 epis especially for probabilities 2 the ln2 performed accurately for the 8 epis but overestimated the frequency of r20 the other distributions were generally accurate the values of aic r2 and rmse consistently indicated that the most appropriate cdfs of rx1day rx5day sdii r10 r20 cwd cdd r99p and prcptot were gev ln2 gamma ln3 normal p iii ln2 gev and ln3 respectively at the wugong weather station when considering the smallest aic values the selected cdfs were not reject the null hypothesis by kolmogorov smirnov k s test table s5 using similar procedures as the evaluation at wugong the most appropriate distributions of the 9 epis for each site in china were selected fig 4 the colored dots denoted different cumulative distribution function type which demonstrated the optimal cdf in china for each epi although the regional difference of optimal cdf was not obvious there were similar distribution for many nearby sites for example the pearson iii was the optimal distribution for r10 in southwest sub region i the number of sites whose epis had the most appropriate cdfs is presented in table 3 overall the best performing cdfs across china were p iii gev ln2 and ln3 these four cdfs together occupied 91 6 88 4 78 6 59 1 60 1 83 2 80 6 76 8 and 66 of the total 552 sites corresponding to rx1day rx5day sdii r10 r20 cwd cdd r99p and prcptot respectively in addition the weibull and normal distributions performed well for r10 and r20 and the gamma distribution performed well for r99p and prcptot the poisson gumbel and gpa distributions performed worse the p iii performed generally better than the other cdfs for each epi but specifically gev performed best for rx1day and rx5day and ln3 was the best for sdii furthermore the most appropriate distribution for each epi in different sub regions is shown in table 4 the applicability of the 10 cdfs for different epis across china was ranked from best to worst as gev p iii ln2 ln3 normal weibull gamma gumbel pareto and poisson for mainland china p iii was better than gev because it performed best for 6 out of 9 epis overall for different epis sites and sub regions the performances of the 10 cdfs differed which showed a necessity for further analysis of the return periods obtained from the site specific best cdf 3 3 the 10 20 50 and 100 year return periods for the 9 epis the spatial distributions of the 10 20 50 and 100 year return periods obtained from the site specific best cdf are mapped in fig 5 at the 10 year return period the ranges of 9 epis varied at the return periods of 20 50 and 100 years the epi ranges positively correlated with the return periods especially in southern china sub regions iv v and vii the spatial distribution of 8 out of 9 epis except cdd had similar patterns which agreed with the general decreasing elevation three level catena landform in china from the northwest to the southeast cdds in partial southwest china were higher than in surrounding places implying a longer duration of dry conditions these results agreed well with ayantobo et al 2017 who conducted a drought frequency analysis for mainland china using a standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index for droughts and several copula functions overall the longer the return period the higher the flooding and waterlogging risks in southeast china 3 4 future changes of epis at different return periods 3 4 1 multi model ensemble fig 6 shows the taylor diagram of 9 epis in china generated from the selected 28 gcms and observations in china during 1961 2000 skill scores were calculated for annual epis during the reference period 1961 2000 the red solid lines are contour lines of s as defined in eq 4 the values of s were used to rank the performances of 28 gcms in the next section each number represents a model id in table s2 based on this the weights for 28 gcms according to formulas 5 and 6 were calculated table s6 shows the weights of 28 gcms for 9 epis 3 4 2 future projection future projections of the epis were conducted using the multi model ensemble method the changes in epis between the 28 gcms during the period 2021 2100 compared to the period 1961 2017 are illustrated for the 10 20 50 and 100 year return periods under the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios fig 7 the larger the ranges are the greater the differences between the 28 gcms the differences between the 28 gcms were large for rx1day rx5day cdd r99p and prcptot but were small for sdii cwd r10 and r20 at the 10 year return period rx1day ranged from 3 3 to 9 44 mm rx5day ranged from 17 7 to 1 76 mm sdii varied from 0 4 to 0 91 mm per day r10 ranged from 0 27 to 3 4 days r20 ranged from 0 58 to 1 95 days cwd ranged from 1 78 to 1 48 days cdd changed from 22 4 to 17 mm r99p ranged from 22 4 to 125 mm and prcptot ranged from 6 2 to 138 9 mm under the rcp4 5 scenario respectively rx1day ranged from 0 55 to 13 9 rx5day varied from 12 8 to 9 9 sdii ranged from 0 29 to 0 77 per day r10 ranged from 0 27 to 3 5 days r20 ranged from 0 38 to 2 02 cwd ranged from 1 8 to 1 37 days cdd ranged from 21 9 to 16 r99p ranged from 25 8 to 153 6 and prcptot changed from 13 7 to 174 2 under the rcp8 5 scenario respectively as the return period increased from 20 to 50 to 100 years the values and ranges of 7 epis increased but cwd and cdd decreased the median values of 7 epis except cwd and cdd were higher under the rcp8 5 than the rcp4 5 scenario the future epi changes for the different return periods consistently implied the possible increasing risks of rx1day rx5day sdii r10 r20 r99p and prcptot in china the percentage change of epis under different return periods is shown in fig 8 the increase was more obvious for rx1day values larger than 30 are approximately 22 7 of the area of china under 10 return periods for rcp4 5 r10 approximately 22 7 r20 approximately 33 5 r99p 60 and prcptot approximately 7 5 especially in northwest china sub region i and vi sdii increased in northeast china sub region iii decreased in western china and had no significant trends in other regions rx5day and cwd decreased in most areas except in western china partial of sub regions i and vi cdd also decreased but showed different spatial patterns with rx5day and cwd with almost all of china decreasing and approximately 58 of the country s area decreasing by more than 30 the changes for rcp8 5 were similar to the rcp4 5 scenario and are shown in fig s2 4 discussions 4 1 frequency analysis of epis in this study we found that the optimal distribution for different sub regions and epis varied indicating that single frequency distribution of each epi may be inaccurate for china so it is worth selecting the optimal distribution for each site and for different epis before conducting frequency analysis the selected optimal cdf for each region in china can be used as a good reference frequency analysis of epis has been previously conducted in several studies feng et al 2007 analysed the frequency of rx1day rx2day rx5day and rx10day in china using the gev distribution during the period of 1951 2000 they showed that decreasing trends are mainly distributed in northern china and increasing trends are distributed in the yangtze river basin and northwest china this study analysed the spatiotemporal pattern and frequency return periods characteristics of 9 epis during historical and future periods in china feng et al 2007 showed similar spatial patterns with our study for rx1day and rx5day at the 10 year return period however the values of rx1day and rx5day during 1961 2017 in this research were higher by approximately 10 45 mm indicating more frequent extreme precipitation events after the year 2000 chen et al 2013 analysed the frequency of r10 r95p rx1day and rx5day by 5 cdfs in the yangtze river basin in china during 1960 2009 and found that p iii general normal and gev performed better although their results were similar to those in our study in our results ln2 and ln3 also performed better for such day count indices r10 r20 cwd cdd the best cdfs were selected from 10 commonly used cdfs in this research which were different from several other studies and showed better site region or epi specific frequency features 4 2 future projection of epis under different return periods the return period reflects the probability of extreme precipitation events 10 year or 20 year are relatively common while 50 100 year are relatively rare this study provided the spatial distribution of epis under different return periods by using the optimal distributions it can be used as useful references for disaster prevention and management under different situations for research related to the epi trends under different rcp scenarios and at changing return periods shao et al 2015 wen et al 2015 yin et al 2016 yuan et al 2015 projected rx1day rx3day rx15day and rx30day using five gcms analysed their frequency characteristics with the gev distribution and found that rx1day rx3day rx15day and rx30day would increase overall in china in the future however the projected epis only included maximum precipitation amounts i e rx1day rx2day rx30day etc in this study we projected the changes of 9 epis under different return periods and the frequency changes of these projected epis were symmetric additionally the increasing trends of the wet indices r10 sdii r10 r20 r99p and prcptot were more significant in dry regions sub regions i ii and partial sub region vi and the increases in rx1day r10 r20 and r99p were higher than that in prcptot this implied a possible relief from drought conditions in the future however because the increased precipitation projections were not large and extreme precipitation may reduce water use efficiency dry regions may still suffer from both drought and flooding disasters and those potential events still need to be paid attention to in the future in wet regions sub regions v and vii the decrease area percentage 0 to 20 of rx1day and rx5day mainly distributed in western part of sub region v under different return periods and other epis increased small 0 15 in wet region however due to the base value of epi were high in wet regions fig 5 small increase also can enhance risk of flooding disasters 4 3 uncertainty in the gcms former studies have projected epis under different rcp scenarios in different parts of china using multi gcms and different downscaling methods bao et al 2017 chen et al 2018 yang et al 2012 zou and zhou 2013 different gcms or downscaling methods brought uncertainty to the results which are also error sources of future projection shen et al 2018 estimated the uncertainty related to gcms to analyse climate change impacts on hydrology and their results showed that values projected by 20 gcms were highly uncertain and increased significantly over time woldemeskel et al 2014 evaluated the uncertainties of gcm projected precipitations over the periods 1960 1999 and 2001 2099 and the results indicated that the uncertainty in precipitation projections mainly came from model structural uncertainty in this research fig 7 epis also varied when projected by different gcms although the rx1day which was projected by the multi model ensemble see fig s3 showed an increasing trend there were still a few gcms showed decreasing trends see fig 7 this clearly showed the uncertainty of different gcms however uncertainty can also be generated from different downscaling methods as shown by this research and other studies kharin and zwiers 2005 the adoption of a multi gcm ensemble with different downscaling methods could decrease the possible uncertainty to a satisfactory extent in this research 28 gcms were used via the weighted ensemble method which can effectively decrease the uncertainty of projecting epis 4 4 implications for agriculture production precipitation is one of the dominant factors affecting agriculture and crop yields in china feng et al 2018 continuous rainy day could result in high soil moisture in field and damage crop roots due to hypoxia it mainly occurred in huanghuaihai plain jianghuai river basin middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin and coastal areas of south china sub regions v and vii the indices of cwd r10 and r20 reflect the rainy days in our results although the increase was only 0 10 in sub region v and vii it still increased the risk of disaster therefore disaster prevention should be strengthened heavy rain could result in floods and destroy farmland sdii rx1day rx5day and r99p can reflect heavy rain and rx5day would decrease but other indices rx1day sdii and r99p would increase in the future so it is important to strengthen the construction of drainage works and breed some crop cultivars to cope with an increased frequency and magnitude of heavy rains water shortages have critical impacts on crop growth in key stages cdd is the only index in several epis that denotes some respects of extreme drought in this research cdd values were larger in sub regions i ii and vi where wheat is one of the main crops and decreased significantly with large variability under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios implying that drought may decline in the future however for a deeper understanding of drought conditions some popularly used drought indices e g standard precipitation index standard precipitation evapotranspiration index and evaporative demand drought index are better and are strongly recommended li et al 2016 yao et al 2018b 5 conclusions the gev p iii ln2 and ln3 generally performed better among the 10 selected cdfs in china although they performed differently for the 9 epis and 7 sub regions these four cdfs together occupied 91 6 88 4 78 6 59 1 60 1 83 2 80 6 76 8 and 66 of the total 552 sites for rx1day rx5day sdii r10 r20 cwd cdd r99p and prcptot respectively however the performances of the gumbel gpa and poisson distributions were poor the values and ranges of epis positively correlated with return periods from 10 to 20 50 and 100 years this was especially apparent in southern china sub regions iv v and vii where the annual mean precipitation was above 1300 mm thus implying higher risks of extreme wet events flooding or waterlogging the spatial distributions of the epis return periods clearly reflected the sub regional characteristics of extremely dry and extremely wet events the increase was more significant for rx1day r10 r20 r99p and prcptot especially in northwestern china sub region i and vi sdii increased in northeastern china sub region iii decreased in western china and had no significant changes in other regions rx5day and cwd exhibited expected decreases in western china a part of sub region i and vi cdd shows decreases in the whole of china while only parts of sub regions v and vii show increases these results imply more challenges in preventing landslides floods and potential damages to crop production therefore there is an urgent need for breeding improvements in heavy rain tolerance crops as well as improvements in precipitation forecasting methods declaration of

6056,the cumulative distribution functions cdfs of extreme precipitation indices epis characterize the occurrence of extreme precipitation events but some cdfs have been either exaggerated or underestimated in this study we selected the most suitable cdfs from ten commonly used functions i e normal two and three parameter log normal extreme value type i generalized extreme value gev

the nine epis for the historical and projected future periods at 10 20 50 and 100 year return periods were investigated the results showed that the gev pearson iii three and two parameter log normal were generally the best cdfs for the 9 epis in china by comparing the results during 2021 2100 with 1961 2017 the return periods increased as the epis increased it was especially apparent in southeast china where the annual mean precipitation was above 1300 mm the increases of the trends were significant for epis especially in northwestern china including the maximum 1 day precipitation number of heavy precipitation days number of very heavy precipitation days extremely wet days and annual total wet day precipitation the simple daily intensity index increased in northeast china decreased in western china but had no significant change in other regions the maximum 5 day precipitation and consecutive wet days decreased in most areas except western china the consecutive dry days decreased in northern china and increased in southeast china this study provides region and site specific optimal cdfs and return period information and reveals the spatiotemporal changes of 9 epis at different return periods of 10 20 50 and 100 years under the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios for 2021 2100 the obtained results are useful for guiding disaster prevention efforts in different regions of china

wang et al 2018 in recent years extreme precipitation events have tended to occur more frequently scoccimarro et al 2013 the frequency of extreme precipitation events is predicted to increase in the future including in china guo et al 2018 lau et al 2013 yuan et al 2015 which will also increase the risks of drought floods landslides and agricultural disasters extreme precipitation indices epis have been commonly used to characterize extreme precipitation events in past studies a deep understanding of the spatiotemporal patterns of epis and a reasonable prediction method are necessary for water related disaster prevention efforts and decision making extreme precipitation indices epis have been extensively used to quantitatively characterize extreme precipitation events each index has an interior meaning table s1 for example the day count type has fixed thresholds r10 r20 r100 etc while the percentile type r95p and r99p is relative to the base period and used among a wide variety of climates and it overcomes the weakness of a fixed threshold li et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 due to only less than 60 years of precipitation data are available in china it is difficult to estimate return periods of 50 or 100 year by original probability distribution cumulative distribution functions cdfs are useful in calculating the frequency properties of epis which is standard to estimate the return period of epis cunnane 1989 cunnane 1989 listed more than 20 cdfs these functions have been commonly divided into four families namely the normal including the normal log normal distribution ln2 and three parameter log normal distribution ln3 the extreme value including the general extreme value gev gumbel log gumbel and weibull the pearson iii p iii and logarithmic p iii and the generalized pareto gpa malamud and turcotte 2006 however the epis frequency may be exaggerated or underestimated if unsuitable cdfs are used without considering the most appropriate cdf are site or region specific tan and gan 2017 analysed the frequency of heavy precipitation in canada using the gev and gpa distributions and found that compared to the gpa the gev tended to underestimate annual maximum precipitation in the western and eastern coastal regions of canada forestieri et al 2018 analysed the frequency of extreme rainfall in sicily using the ln3 gev and two component extreme value distributions and concluded that for shorter return periods all three distributions performed well but for longer return periods the ln3 performed the best the gev generalized logistic generalized normal p iii and gpa distributions were used to fit the experience frequency of extreme events the results showed that the annual maximum precipitation had increasing trends at most stations and the gev was the most appropriate distribution du et al 2013 wang et al 2016b analysed 11 epis over the western yellow sea coast in china at 12 weather stations during 1951 2011 and concluded that extreme precipitation events have become more concentrated and intense in the last decades although several studies investigated the frequency changes of epis in different parts of china the site or region specific best cdfs of different epis in china have not been systematically investigated this limited the applications for characterizing extreme precipitation events in the study regions of interest in china different general circulation models gcms have been widely used to project future changes of epis li et al 2012 um et al 2017 however gcm outputs have overly coarse spatial resolutions with hundreds of square kilometres to be applied at regional scales fu et al 2017 different downscaling methods namely statistical downscaling dynamic downscaling and the combination of the two have been applied to overcome this obstacle optimal resolution data can be generated by dynamic downscaling manage et al 2016 however the cost of computation is much higher statistical downscaling uses a statistical transfer function to downscale the gcms data from a grid to a point scale meteorological series liu and zuo 2012 the meteorological series can easily be extended if a reliable daily historical climatic data series is available several studies have analysed the frequency of historical and projected extreme precipitation events in china wu et al 2018 analysed the temporal distribution patterns trends and return levels of epis daily precipitation 99th percentile and concluded that along the southeast coastline in the lower lancang river and on the hainan island all daily extreme precipitation would exceed 300 and 400 mm under 20 and 50 year return periods shao et al 2015 analysed the frequency of annual maximum precipitation during 1951 2010 and found that the estimated frequency for the 50 year return period agreed with the observed annual maximum precipitation series at most of the stations wen et al 2015 analysed changes in extreme temperature and extreme precipitation in china in historical 1901 2005 and future 2006 2100 periods and revealed that the regional mean extreme precipitation in the 10 20 and 50 year return periods would increase 7 9 13 4 during 2006 2100 compared to 1901 2005 yin et al 2016 projected the change of 3 epis including maximum precipitation for 1 day 3 days and 7 days in 20 and 50 year return periods during 1961 2000 and 2001 2050 and found that the 3 epis would increase during 2001 2050 compared to 1961 2000 and some places the middle reaches of the yellow river and the lower reaches and plain area of the huaihe river will even increase more than 30 although many studies have analysed the frequency of such day count epis rx1day rxnday in china limited studies have projected the frequency of epis that revealed different inherent natures of extreme precipitation e g sdii r10 cdd and rx95p by selecting the best cdfs in mainland china to narrow this gap we aim to 1 analyse the spatiotemporal variations of the 9 selected epis during 1961 2017 in 7 different sub regions and for mainland china 2 select the most appropriate cdfs from 10 commonly used cdfs for the 9 epis at 552 study sites and 7 sub regions 3 analyse the spatial distribution of the 9 epis for 10 20 50 and 100 year return periods and 4 project spatiotemporal changes of the 9 epis at different return periods for 10 20 50 and 100 year periods under the rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios during 2021 2100 this research reveals changes within the site or region specific return periods of different epis in china which may provide useful references for extreme precipitation event prevention and disaster recovery efforts 2 data and methodology 2 1 weather data and study sites the observed daily precipitation data at 552 weather stations during 1961 2017 were collected from the china meteorological data sharing network http data cma cn china is divided into 7 different sub regions fig 1 detailed sub region information is provided by peng et al 2017 and ayantobo et al 2017 the climatic conditions in each sub region and for china are referred to in table 1 of yao et al 2018a 2 2 selection of extreme precipitation indices and the best cdf nine epis computed at the annual time scale are selected from the expert team on climate change detection and indices http etccdi pacificclimate org docs etccdmindicescomparison1 pdf to characterize the extreme precipitation events table s1 the total precipitation of the 99th percentile is calculated during 1961 1990 at each site the 10 commonly used cdfs namely the normal ln2 ln3 gumbel gev weibull two parameter gamma p iii poisson and gpa table 1 were compared by their performances when using the 9 epis of these the gpa distribution is a heavy tailed distribution the gev ln2 gumbel and ln3 are regularly varying distributions and the p iii weibull and normal distribution are slightly tailed el adlouni et al 2008 ye et al 2013 the parameters of each cdf are estimated with the maximum likelihood method archer 1998 which is an asymptotically efficient and unbiased method therefore it is one of the best methods to estimate parameters in cdfs in hydrology strupczewski et al 2001 although only the maximum likelihood method was applied the goodness of fit properties of the best cdfs for each epi indicated the applicability of the method the meanings of the terms are described in table s2 the return period is defined as the reciprocal of 1 p where p is the non exceedance probability coming from the cdf the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and akaike information criterion aic satishsiyengar 1997 are used to assess the performances of the selected cdfs the kolmogorov smirnov test is a nonparametric hypothesis test that evaluates the difference between the cdfs of the distributions of the two sample data vectors in each dataset miller 1956 aic is a useful index in evaluating the performance of different gcms compared with bayesian information criterion bic the penalty of aic type ensures an important minimax property it is minimax rate optimal for both parametric and nonparametric cases yang 2006 the equations for estimating the three indices are written as follows 1 r 2 i 1 n x i x m y i y m 2 i 1 n x i x m 2 i 1 n y i y m 2 2 rmse i 1 n p e i p i 2 n 3 aic n ln π r m s e 2 2 m where y i and x i are the ith estimated and observed probability values of the epis respectively n is the number of years pei and pi are the experience and theoretical frequency values respectively m is the number of parameters the higher the r 2 or the lower the rmse and aic values the better the goodness of fit 2 3 climate projections 2 3 1 statistical downscaling the nwai wg statistical downscaling and climate projection model was developed by liu and zuo 2012 using a modified richardson type weather generator the gcms data were used to drive the nwai wg statistical downscaling model to efficiently generate a daily time series and incorporate the series into multiple gcms anwar et al 2015 touch et al 2015 wang et al 2015 yang et al 2013 this method consists of both spatial and temporal downscaling procedures the purpose of spatial downscaling is to downscale the monthly gcm precipitation data from grid cells to sites the bias correction required transferring the result using functions obtained from observed and gcm historical data in the training period of 1961 2000 temporal downscaling is used to generate the daily data from monthly data using a weather generator liu and zuo 2012 daily precipitation data are downscaled by wgen stochastic weather generator richardson and wright 1984 the precipitation were simulated by 2 parameter gamma distribution and the density function is written as follows 4 1 α γ β x α β 1 e x α α 0 β 0 whereαis sharpness parameter and β is scale parameter the probability of rain on a given day depends on the wet or dry status of the previous day the conditional probabilities denoted asp m w w andp m w d are calculated for each calendar month see details in liu and zuo 2012 fig s1 displayed the q q plots that showed the quantiles of observed precipitation versus the quantiles of raw gcm precipitation and downscaled precipitation for the period 1961 2000 at wugong station as an example which is located near the middle part of china the downscaling method effectively corrected the biases of the 28 raw gcm projected precipitation resulting in little difference with observed precipitation values similar results were obtained at the other 551 sites data not shown this outcome confirmed the necessity of downscaling 2 3 2 gcm evaluation multi model ensemble and model weight the monthly gridded weather data generated from 28 gcms table s3 were downloaded from the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 site https esgf data dkrz de search cmip5 dkrz taylor s diagram and skill score s were used to evaluate the performance of the 28 gcms taylor s method combined standard deviation and a correlation coefficient in a single diagram to evaluate the performances of different gcms the taylor s skill score s is slightly modified wang et al 2016a 5 s 4 l r 2 σ f σ r σ r σ f 2 1 r 0 2 where r is the correlation coefficient r 0 is maximum r 0 999 σ f and σ r are the standard deviations of the simulated and observed time series respectively the larger the s value the better the gcm s performance a weighted ensemble approach was used to reduce the uncertainty in the projected variables wang et al 2016b 2016 this approach has better projection skills than ensembles with equal weights bishop and abramowitz 2012 wang et al 2016a b taylor s skill score s was used to rank the performance of the 28 gcms for each epi the weight of each gcm is calculated by guo et al 2018 6 u j j 1 n s s j 7 w i u j j 1 n u j where n is the number of gcms sj is the rank of the ith gcm j 1 2 28 ui can be considered the combined performance indicator for the ith gcm wi is the weight of the ith gcm and can be considered the normalized value of ri the radiative forcing and co2 emission are prescribed by representative concentration pathways rcp the 4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios were chosen for future projection 3 results 3 1 the decadal changes of 9 epis in 7 sub regions of china fig 2 illustrates the range of long term mean epis during 1961 2017 in 7 sub regions in china the figure showed the following 1 there were large differences in the 9 epis in different sub regions 2 the values of 8 epis except cdd which indicated dry conditions generally decreased in sub regions vii to v iv iii ii vi and i and cdd generally decreased in i ii vi iv iii vii and v 3 there were large ranges for the 8 epis except cdd for humid and super humid regions iv v and vii and small ranges for arid or semi arid sub regions i ii and vi cdd had large ranges in sub regions i and vi 4 the values for the median annual rx1day from 1961 to 2017 for sub regions i to vii were 18 0 38 3 54 6 76 1 97 6 25 8 and 123 mm 5 the values of all epis had regional characteristics for the 8 wet epis the values almost ranked in an increasing order of sub regions i vi ii iii iv iv and vii for dry epi i e cdd it was almost reversed 3 2 the best selected cdfs of the 9 epis the ten theoretical cdfs were compared with the experience frequency values to select the most appropriate cdf for each epi at each site the wugong station which is located almost in the centre of china and has a warm temperate continental monsoon climate with annual mean precipitation of 633 7 mm was chosen as a demonstration site for the selection of the best cdf fig 3 tables 2 and s4 the gpa and poisson distributions performed poorly for most epis as the gumbel generally underestimated the frequencies of all 9 epis especially for probabilities 2 the ln2 performed accurately for the 8 epis but overestimated the frequency of r20 the other distributions were generally accurate the values of aic r2 and rmse consistently indicated that the most appropriate cdfs of rx1day rx5day sdii r10 r20 cwd cdd r99p and prcptot were gev ln2 gamma ln3 normal p iii ln2 gev and ln3 respectively at the wugong weather station when considering the smallest aic values the selected cdfs were not reject the null hypothesis by kolmogorov smirnov k s test table s5 using similar procedures as the evaluation at wugong the most appropriate distributions of the 9 epis for each site in china were selected fig 4 the colored dots denoted different cumulative distribution function type which demonstrated the optimal cdf in china for each epi although the regional difference of optimal cdf was not obvious there were similar distribution for many nearby sites for example the pearson iii was the optimal distribution for r10 in southwest sub region i the number of sites whose epis had the most appropriate cdfs is presented in table 3 overall the best performing cdfs across china were p iii gev ln2 and ln3 these four cdfs together occupied 91 6 88 4 78 6 59 1 60 1 83 2 80 6 76 8 and 66 of the total 552 sites corresponding to rx1day rx5day sdii r10 r20 cwd cdd r99p and prcptot respectively in addition the weibull and normal distributions performed well for r10 and r20 and the gamma distribution performed well for r99p and prcptot the poisson gumbel and gpa distributions performed worse the p iii performed generally better than the other cdfs for each epi but specifically gev performed best for rx1day and rx5day and ln3 was the best for sdii furthermore the most appropriate distribution for each epi in different sub regions is shown in table 4 the applicability of the 10 cdfs for different epis across china was ranked from best to worst as gev p iii ln2 ln3 normal weibull gamma gumbel pareto and poisson for mainland china p iii was better than gev because it performed best for 6 out of 9 epis overall for different epis sites and sub regions the performances of the 10 cdfs differed which showed a necessity for further analysis of the return periods obtained from the site specific best cdf 3 3 the 10 20 50 and 100 year return periods for the 9 epis the spatial distributions of the 10 20 50 and 100 year return periods obtained from the site specific best cdf are mapped in fig 5 at the 10 year return period the ranges of 9 epis varied at the return periods of 20 50 and 100 years the epi ranges positively correlated with the return periods especially in southern china sub regions iv v and vii the spatial distribution of 8 out of 9 epis except cdd had similar patterns which agreed with the general decreasing elevation three level catena landform in china from the northwest to the southeast cdds in partial southwest china were higher than in surrounding places implying a longer duration of dry conditions these results agreed well with ayantobo et al 2017 who conducted a drought frequency analysis for mainland china using a standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index for droughts and several copula functions overall the longer the return period the higher the flooding and waterlogging risks in southeast china 3 4 future changes of epis at different return periods 3 4 1 multi model ensemble fig 6 shows the taylor diagram of 9 epis in china generated from the selected 28 gcms and observations in china during 1961 2000 skill scores were calculated for annual epis during the reference period 1961 2000 the red solid lines are contour lines of s as defined in eq 4 the values of s were used to rank the performances of 28 gcms in the next section each number represents a model id in table s2 based on this the weights for 28 gcms according to formulas 5 and 6 were calculated table s6 shows the weights of 28 gcms for 9 epis 3 4 2 future projection future projections of the epis were conducted using the multi model ensemble method the changes in epis between the 28 gcms during the period 2021 2100 compared to the period 1961 2017 are illustrated for the 10 20 50 and 100 year return periods under the rcp4 5 and 8 5 scenarios fig 7 the larger the ranges are the greater the differences between the 28 gcms the differences between the 28 gcms were large for rx1day rx5day cdd r99p and prcptot but were small for sdii cwd r10 and r20 at the 10 year return period rx1day ranged from 3 3 to 9 44 mm rx5day ranged from 17 7 to 1 76 mm sdii varied from 0 4 to 0 91 mm per day r10 ranged from 0 27 to 3 4 days r20 ranged from 0 58 to 1 95 days cwd ranged from 1 78 to 1 48 days cdd changed from 22 4 to 17 mm r99p ranged from 22 4 to 125 mm and prcptot ranged from 6 2 to 138 9 mm under the rcp4 5 scenario respectively rx1day ranged from 0 55 to 13 9 rx5day varied from 12 8 to 9 9 sdii ranged from 0 29 to 0 77 per day r10 ranged from 0 27 to 3 5 days r20 ranged from 0 38 to 2 02 cwd ranged from 1 8 to 1 37 days cdd ranged from 21 9 to 16 r99p ranged from 25 8 to 153 6 and prcptot changed from 13 7 to 174 2 under the rcp8 5 scenario respectively as the return period increased from 20 to 50 to 100 years the values and ranges of 7 epis increased but cwd and cdd decreased the median values of 7 epis except cwd and cdd were higher under the rcp8 5 than the rcp4 5 scenario the future epi changes for the different return periods consistently implied the possible increasing risks of rx1day rx5day sdii r10 r20 r99p and prcptot in china the percentage change of epis under different return periods is shown in fig 8 the increase was more obvious for rx1day values larger than 30 are approximately 22 7 of the area of china under 10 return periods for rcp4 5 r10 approximately 22 7 r20 approximately 33 5 r99p 60 and prcptot approximately 7 5 especially in northwest china sub region i and vi sdii increased in northeast china sub region iii decreased in western china and had no significant trends in other regions rx5day and cwd decreased in most areas except in western china partial of sub regions i and vi cdd also decreased but showed different spatial patterns with rx5day and cwd with almost all of china decreasing and approximately 58 of the country s area decreasing by more than 30 the changes for rcp8 5 were similar to the rcp4 5 scenario and are shown in fig s2 4 discussions 4 1 frequency analysis of epis in this study we found that the optimal distribution for different sub regions and epis varied indicating that single frequency distribution of each epi may be inaccurate for china so it is worth selecting the optimal distribution for each site and for different epis before conducting frequency analysis the selected optimal cdf for each region in china can be used as a good reference frequency analysis of epis has been previously conducted in several studies feng et al 2007 analysed the frequency of rx1day rx2day rx5day and rx10day in china using the gev distribution during the period of 1951 2000 they showed that decreasing trends are mainly distributed in northern china and increasing trends are distributed in the yangtze river basin and northwest china this study analysed the spatiotemporal pattern and frequency return periods characteristics of 9 epis during historical and future periods in china feng et al 2007 showed similar spatial patterns with our study for rx1day and rx5day at the 10 year return period however the values of rx1day and rx5day during 1961 2017 in this research were higher by approximately 10 45 mm indicating more frequent extreme precipitation events after the year 2000 chen et al 2013 analysed the frequency of r10 r95p rx1day and rx5day by 5 cdfs in the yangtze river basin in china during 1960 2009 and found that p iii general normal and gev performed better although their results were similar to those in our study in our results ln2 and ln3 also performed better for such day count indices r10 r20 cwd cdd the best cdfs were selected from 10 commonly used cdfs in this research which were different from several other studies and showed better site region or epi specific frequency features 4 2 future projection of epis under different return periods the return period reflects the probability of extreme precipitation events 10 year or 20 year are relatively common while 50 100 year are relatively rare this study provided the spatial distribution of epis under different return periods by using the optimal distributions it can be used as useful references for disaster prevention and management under different situations for research related to the epi trends under different rcp scenarios and at changing return periods shao et al 2015 wen et al 2015 yin et al 2016 yuan et al 2015 projected rx1day rx3day rx15day and rx30day using five gcms analysed their frequency characteristics with the gev distribution and found that rx1day rx3day rx15day and rx30day would increase overall in china in the future however the projected epis only included maximum precipitation amounts i e rx1day rx2day rx30day etc in this study we projected the changes of 9 epis under different return periods and the frequency changes of these projected epis were symmetric additionally the increasing trends of the wet indices r10 sdii r10 r20 r99p and prcptot were more significant in dry regions sub regions i ii and partial sub region vi and the increases in rx1day r10 r20 and r99p were higher than that in prcptot this implied a possible relief from drought conditions in the future however because the increased precipitation projections were not large and extreme precipitation may reduce water use efficiency dry regions may still suffer from both drought and flooding disasters and those potential events still need to be paid attention to in the future in wet regions sub regions v and vii the decrease area percentage 0 to 20 of rx1day and rx5day mainly distributed in western part of sub region v under different return periods and other epis increased small 0 15 in wet region however due to the base value of epi were high in wet regions fig 5 small increase also can enhance risk of flooding disasters 4 3 uncertainty in the gcms former studies have projected epis under different rcp scenarios in different parts of china using multi gcms and different downscaling methods bao et al 2017 chen et al 2018 yang et al 2012 zou and zhou 2013 different gcms or downscaling methods brought uncertainty to the results which are also error sources of future projection shen et al 2018 estimated the uncertainty related to gcms to analyse climate change impacts on hydrology and their results showed that values projected by 20 gcms were highly uncertain and increased significantly over time woldemeskel et al 2014 evaluated the uncertainties of gcm projected precipitations over the periods 1960 1999 and 2001 2099 and the results indicated that the uncertainty in precipitation projections mainly came from model structural uncertainty in this research fig 7 epis also varied when projected by different gcms although the rx1day which was projected by the multi model ensemble see fig s3 showed an increasing trend there were still a few gcms showed decreasing trends see fig 7 this clearly showed the uncertainty of different gcms however uncertainty can also be generated from different downscaling methods as shown by this research and other studies kharin and zwiers 2005 the adoption of a multi gcm ensemble with different downscaling methods could decrease the possible uncertainty to a satisfactory extent in this research 28 gcms were used via the weighted ensemble method which can effectively decrease the uncertainty of projecting epis 4 4 implications for agriculture production precipitation is one of the dominant factors affecting agriculture and crop yields in china feng et al 2018 continuous rainy day could result in high soil moisture in field and damage crop roots due to hypoxia it mainly occurred in huanghuaihai plain jianghuai river basin middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin and coastal areas of south china sub regions v and vii the indices of cwd r10 and r20 reflect the rainy days in our results although the increase was only 0 10 in sub region v and vii it still increased the risk of disaster therefore disaster prevention should be strengthened heavy rain could result in floods and destroy farmland sdii rx1day rx5day and r99p can reflect heavy rain and rx5day would decrease but other indices rx1day sdii and r99p would increase in the future so it is important to strengthen the construction of drainage works and breed some crop cultivars to cope with an increased frequency and magnitude of heavy rains water shortages have critical impacts on crop growth in key stages cdd is the only index in several epis that denotes some respects of extreme drought in this research cdd values were larger in sub regions i ii and vi where wheat is one of the main crops and decreased significantly with large variability under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios implying that drought may decline in the future however for a deeper understanding of drought conditions some popularly used drought indices e g standard precipitation index standard precipitation evapotranspiration index and evaporative demand drought index are better and are strongly recommended li et al 2016 yao et al 2018b 5 conclusions the gev p iii ln2 and ln3 generally performed better among the 10 selected cdfs in china although they performed differently for the 9 epis and 7 sub regions these four cdfs together occupied 91 6 88 4 78 6 59 1 60 1 83 2 80 6 76 8 and 66 of the total 552 sites for rx1day rx5day sdii r10 r20 cwd cdd r99p and prcptot respectively however the performances of the gumbel gpa and poisson distributions were poor the values and ranges of epis positively correlated with return periods from 10 to 20 50 and 100 years this was especially apparent in southern china sub regions iv v and vii where the annual mean precipitation was above 1300 mm thus implying higher risks of extreme wet events flooding or waterlogging the spatial distributions of the epis return periods clearly reflected the sub regional characteristics of extremely dry and extremely wet events the increase was more significant for rx1day r10 r20 r99p and prcptot especially in northwestern china sub region i and vi sdii increased in northeastern china sub region iii decreased in western china and had no significant changes in other regions rx5day and cwd exhibited expected decreases in western china a part of sub region i and vi cdd shows decreases in the whole of china while only parts of sub regions v and vii show increases these results imply more challenges in preventing landslides floods and potential damages to crop production therefore there is an urgent need for breeding improvements in heavy rain tolerance crops as well as improvements in precipitation forecasting methods declaration of

6057,accurate and reliable rainfall data is one of the fundamental prerequisites in hydrological modelling the rainfall data at a desired location can be reconstructed using interpolation methods such as inverse distance weighting idw which is frequently used in hydrology in standard idw neighbors are selected based on geographical proximity or nearest neighbor idw nn however in a basin with variable topography nearby rain gauges may be located at very different elevations and thus they may not accurately represent the spatial connection in rainfall in this work the theory of networks with nodes and links as the basis is applied to select neighbors while applying idw two variants of neighbor selection models are proposed idw with linked neighbours idw ln and idw with clustered neighbors idw cn for reconstruction thirty years of daily rainfall data from 430 rain gauges in murray darling basin mdb are utilized to evaluate the performance of the proposed models one station leave out cross validation approach is used and the associated root mean squared error rmse and bias percentage bp are calculated different values of number of neighbors n correlation threshold ct and clustering coefficient range ccr are used to measure the errors associated with the proposed models on comparing with idw nn results show that reconstruction using idw ln has lower rmse at about 30 percent of stations and lower bp for about 50 percent of stations while idw cn shows lower rmse at about 25 percent of stations and lower bp for about 45 percent of stations the idw nn performed better than idw ln and idw cn at more than 50 percent of stations though the average error associated with all the three models are comparable for all ct values in a natural system a concept like traditional idw idw nn may be more accurate than the network based approach idw ln and idw cn but may not be completely efficient in accounting the spatial rainfall variability the encouraging results for the reconstruction of rainfall in this study seem to indicate that the approach can be further helpful in the reconstruction of a wide range of meteorological parameters with spatial correlation

modelling reliable rainfall record is one of the basic prerequisites the data collected from available rain gauges in a catchment may not provide the necessary or accurate information because of a number of reasons firstly the density of the rain gauges may be high in certain areas but very low in other areas even within a catchment secondly some rain gauges may become dysfunctional and thirdly the topography may be complex having many inaccessible regions the lack of rainfall data at a desired location can be overcome by using spatial interpolation previous studies have examined among others deterministic and stochastic approaches to reconstruct daily records using spatial interpolation algorithms ranging from simple techniques such as thiessen polygons thiessen 1911 or inverse distance weighting di piazza et al 2011 schemes to more complex and computationally intensive approaches such as geostatistical kriging buytaert et al 2006 or regression based prism interpolation daly et al 2008 among all the different spatial interpolation methods the inverse distance weighting idw robertson 1967 is perhaps the most commonly used method in hydrology the success of the idw method depends fundamentally on the presence of positive spatial correlations between the data observed at neighboring rain gauges griffith 1992 the underlying assumption is that the data from nearby points are more related than the data from locations far from each other in accordance to tobler s first law of geography tobler 1970 this presumption may not be applicable in certain situations particularly in regions with complex topography shi et al 2017 in such regions even when rain gauges are located geographically closer rainfall data recorded at seemingly neighboring stations can vary significantly due to the variability in topography see for instance berndtsson 1988 and li et al 2014 for additional details in relation to spatio temporal variability spatial patterns are consistently influenced by topography and wind direction especially in mountainous areas barros and lettenmaier 1993 barry 1992 considering these limitations a better understanding of spatial connections between rain gauges and the effect of including such information in idw method need to be explored in recent years the theory of networks has been widely applied for studying the spatial and temporal evolution of a wide range of complex systems and associated phenomena barabási and albert 1999 girvan and newman 2002 konapala and mishra 2017 li et al 2010 milo et al 2002 the application of network theory in hydrology and water resources is relatively new with increasing number of publications on the topics of connections in rainfall stream flow river networks and virtual water trade networks see sivakumar 2015 for a general account of this topic as for rainfall malik et al 2012 investigated the spatial and temporal characteristics of extreme summer monsoon rainfall in south asia boers et al 2013 used networks based concepts to investigate the south american monsoon system sams spatial characteristics of extreme rainfall synchronicity by analyzing gridded daily rainfall data see also boers et al 2015 for subsequent complex networks based studies on south american rainfall in order to examine the annual dynamics of precipitation around the world scarsoglio et al 2013 analyzed a 70 year long january 1941 december 2010 gridded precipitation dataset in the course of the analysis of monthly rainfall data for a period of 68 years at 230 rain gauge stations across australia sivakumar and woldemeskel 2015 employed the concepts of clustering coefficient and degree distribution for the examination of spatial connections in rainfall the clustering coefficient is a measure of local density and represents the tendency of a network to cluster watts and strogatz 1998 jha et al 2015 attempted to provide a hydrological explanation for the results of the complex network based methods for rainfall the clustering coefficient method was applied to two different rain gauge networks in australia 57 stations in western australian stations and 45 stations in the sydney region and the results were interpreted as topographical properties of rain gauge stations latitude longitude and elevation and rainfall data characteristics mean standard deviation and variation coefficient jha and sivakumar 2017 naufan et al 2018 studied the spatial connections in rainfall data from a regional climate model in the context of climate change with the encouraging results detailed by these preliminary studies the present study aims to apply network theory to take into account the spatial connections across a rain gauge network into the idw approach to reconstruct the rainfall data at a desired location we use the concepts of networks to analyze the significance of spatial connections and spatial correlation in the rainfall network we propose three variants of inverse distance weighing i e idw nn nearest neighbors model idw ln linked neighbors model and idw cn clustered neighbors model to study the significance of spatial and temporal connection over spatial correlation for implementation we consider the daily rain gauge data of 430 rain gauge stations located in the murray darling basin to evaluate the performance of the proposed models we use the one station leave out cross validation approach we also study the effect of location and elevation of the rain gauges on the performance of the proposed models 2 methodology 2 1 idw with nearest neighbors idw nn we use the idw method in its standard form to estimate the rainfall at a desired location using weighted average of rainfall at n nearest neighbors as shown in fig 1 a referred as idw nn hereafter the following formula is used 1 p i x 1 n 1 d x t p x x 1 n 1 d x t where p i is the estimate of rainfall at the desired location i p x represents rainfall at a neighboring location x d x is the distance from the location x to the location i where rainfall is being estimated and n is the number of neighborsand t is a positive real number called the power parameter for the sake of simplicity t 2 is considered in further idw calculation eq 1 estimates the weighted average of the rainfall recorded at the nearest n rain gauges to select a fixed value of the number of neighbors in the application of idw nn a sensitivity analysis on the number of neighbors is performed for the sensitivity analysis the nearest neighbors are varied from 1 to 15 in the calculation of idw nn and the error statistics associated with the reconstruction of the data are evaluated more details about the sensitivity analysis are provided in section 4 1 2 2 idw with linked neighbors idw ln in the case of idw nn the neighbors are generally determined based on the geographical proximity only as is done in the present study as well here we introduce the concept of network to identify the neighbors a network is a set of points connected together by a set of lines as shown in fig 1 b the points are called nodes or vertices and the lines are referred as links or edges mathematically a network can be represented as g p e where p is a set of n nodes p 1 p 2 p n and e is a set of m links in the present context rain gauges can be considered as nodes of the network and the connections among them will be the links there are various ways and measures to study the network properties such as clustering coefficient degree centrality and degree distribution see newman 2012 and estrada 2012 for details the clustering coefficient is used in this study to investigate the spatial connections in the rain gauge network the clustering coefficient c c is a measure of the local density of a network and quantifies the network s tendency to cluster to find the clustering coefficient the first step is to assign a correlation threshold ct to identify the neighbors of research station i i e links that have correlations exceeding ct we refer the number of such neighbors as k i for instance suppose there are 10 rain gauges surrounding the research node out of 10 there are only 5 rain gauges at which the correlation of rainfall at the research node i exceeds the preselected ct value as shown in fig 1 b then there would be k i k i 1 2 possible links among k i neighbors of research station i blue lines in fig 1 c see also sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 for additional details the second step in the estimation of clustering coefficient is to find the possible links between k i nodes which also exceed beyond ct let e i be the number of links among neighboring stations with correlations exceeding ct four links shown in violet lines in fig 1 d we refer the corresponding nodes as linked neighbors of the research station we propose a variant of idw nn in which we consider only linked neighbors in the idw approach which we refer as idw ln furthermore to study the sensitivity of ct on the reconstruction of data using idw ln the ct values are varied from 0 3 to 0 9 more details about the sensitivity analysis are provided in section 4 3 2 3 idw with clustered neighbors idw cn the third step in the calculation of cc at the research station is to use formula 2 cc i 2 e i k i k i 1 where e i is the number of links that actually exist between these k i stations and k i k i 1 2 are the total number of possible links between these k i stations the procedure to find the value of e i and k i is repeated for each and every node research gauge station in the network to obtain the clustering coefficient at the corresponding node once we get the cc value for all the nodes in the network different clustering coefficient ranges ccr can be defined to classify the nodes into various groups for example four different clusters shown in red green yellow and blue in fig 1 e now as another variant of idw nn we can consider only those nodes as neighbors which belong to the same cc range as the research node in applying idw we refer this as idw cn hereafter further to study the sensitivity of ccr on the reconstruction of data using idw cn three ccr are fixed i e 0 3 to 0 6 0 4 to 0 7 and 0 5 to 0 8 2 4 verification of the interpolated rainfall once the rainfall has been reconstructed at the research node using one of the three models idw nn idw ln idw cn we estimate the root mean square error rmse and the bias percentage bp at that node as follows 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n p x i p x i 2 4 bp i 1 n p x i p x i 100 p x i where p x i is the reconstructed rainfall and p x i is the observed rainfall at station x i lower value of rmse and bp associated with the reconstruction of data implies the better performance of the model used in the reconstruction of the data the rmse measures the average magnitude of the error it is the representation of the data around the line of best fit the rmse does not necessarily increase with the variance of the errors but increases with the variance of the frequency distribution of error magnitudes however the bp measures the average tendency of the interpolated values to be larger or smaller than their observed ones 2 5 experimental setup we apply the one station leave out cross validation approach to assess the performance of the idw nn idw ln and idw cn models one station leave out cross validation approach leaves one station out of the training data i e if there are n stations in the original sample then n 1 stations are used to train the model and the selected station is used as the validation station this is repeated for all combinations in which the original sample can be separated this way and then the error is averaged for all trials to give overall effectiveness it is used in determining the hyper parameters of a model in the sense that it identifies which parameters will result in the lowest test error as described in sections 2 1 to 2 3 in applying three different idws the number of neighbors has to be determined also in the case of idw ln and idw cn a suitable correlation threshold needs to be used we perform our analysis in the following three steps to systematically find out i the sensitivity of number of neighbours correlation threshold and clustering coefficient range on the reconstructed data ii the relationship of the error statistics associated with the reconstruction of rainfall data with the elevation of the rain gauge stations and iii the spatial distribution of errors in the reconstructed rainfall data 3 study area and dataset we consider rainfall data from the largest river basin in australia namely the murray darling basin mdb fig 2 the mdb contains the catchment of the murray river length 2508 km and the darling river length 1472 km covering a large portion of south east area approximately 106 k m 2 of the australian continent the basin extends from 138 81 o to 152 42 o longitudes and 37 51 o to 25 32 o latitude most regions of the basin are flat and low lying but the coastal areas of the basin contain mountains the great dividing range the climate in the mdb is mostly semi arid causing variability in rainfall at different temporal scales that affect australian agriculture daily rainfall data from 430 rain gauges for the period of january 1985 to december 2014 were collected from the bureau of meteorology bom in australia table 1 provides a summary statistic of the rainfall data from the 430 rain gauges at the daily scale 4 results to evaluate the relative improvement if any in the reconstructed rainfall data using the concept of networks we devise two sets of experiments compare results of idw ln with idw nn and that of idw cn with idw nn the results from idw nn are used as reference the number of neighbors in idw ln and idw cn models is expected to vary by changing ct clustering coefficient range ccr and other relevant parameters further in special cases when for instance ct is very high a research node may not have any neighbor at all to avoid such scenarios in the analysis we introduce the concept of a valid station the interpretation of which is slightly different in case of idw ln and idw cn models 4 1 sensitivity of the number of neighbors in idw nn model to perform the sensitivity analysis we vary the number of neighbors from 1 to 15 and use leave one station out cross validation at each rain gauge station the rmse and bp values presented in fig 3 a and 3b respectively show the error values averaged over 430 rain gauge stations it is clear from the plots that both average rmse and average bp decrease except average bp for 6 neighbors where a slight increase is seen as the number of neighbors increases from 1 to 15 the magnitude of average rmse values varies from 3 11 to 3 86 while the average bp values vary from 16 to 18 5 low error statistics demonstrate that the idw nn model is able to reconstruct the rainfall data accurately over a major part of the basin since the ranges of rmse and bp are low it can also be concluded that the variation in the error values with the increase in the number of neighbors is not significant the purpose of the sensitivity analysis was to select a fixed number of neighbors which can be used in later analysis using idw ln and idw cn fig 3 shows that after number of neighbors equals to five there is no significant change in the average error values hence we decide to use five neighbors in further analysis the average rmse with 5 neighbors in idw nn is 3 19 and the associated average bp is 16 166 as shown in fig 3 in future analysis we will use these error statistics rmse 3 19 and bp 16 17 to compare the performance of the idw ln and idw cn models 4 2 concept of a valid station a valid station is a rain gauge station for which a specific model idw ln or idw cn will have sufficient number of neighbors for the reconstruction of rainfall for the idw nn model all rain gauges are valid stations because the selection of neighbors is independent of a certain ct or ccr in the case of idw ln model we define a valid station only when it has at least five neighbors as obtained in the previous section for a given ct similarly for the idw cn model a station with at least five neighbors for a given ct and ccr is considered a valid station 4 3 sensitivity of the ct in idw ln model after fixing the number of neighborhood to five the next task is to fix the correlation threshold used in the idw ln model the sensitivity analysis of ct is performed by changing its values from 0 3 to 0 9 in the idw ln model it is expected that with the increase in ct the number of valid stations would go down table 2 shows that out of 430 rain gauge stations 427 are identified as valid stations by applying a very low threshold on correlation as 0 3 with the increase in ct up to 0 6 there are minor changes in the number of valid stations however there was a major drop in the number of valid stations for ct 0 7 and higher both the idw nn and idw ln models were applied at the same set of valid stations to estimate the error statistics rmse and bp for instance 422 valid stations exist by using ct 0 4 then for each of these 422 stations we use 5 geographically nearby neighbors as decided in section 4 2 to apply idw nn on the other hand we use 5 linked neighbors in the calculation of idw in case of idw ln the average values of rmse and bp correspond to errors averaged over all the valid stations e g 422 in case of ct 0 4 table 2 shows that the average rmse decreases as ct increases which is valid for both idw nn and idw ln models by comparing the third and fourth columns in table 2 it can be concluded that the value of average rmse is relatively higher in the case of reconstructed rainfall using idw ln similar observation is also made in the case of average bp as shown in table2 since these results are averaged values of errors over all the valid stations we decide to explore what percentage of valid stations actually shows less rmse and or bp using the idw ln model from table 2 it can be seen that at about 28 5 to 31 8 of valid stations rmse in reconstructing the data using the idw ln model is lower than that from the idw nn model similarly at about 28 5 to 50 3 of valid stations bp values are found to be less when the idw ln model is used in reconstructing the rainfall data the average rmse and bp values associated with both idw nn and idw ln are comparable the next obvious question is to determine at each of the valid stations whether the rmse and bp values are higher from the idw nn model or from the idw ln fig 4 shows the scatter diagram between the errors associated with each valid station from both of these idw models in fig 4 if the points fall on the identity line it means that at a valid station the errors in the reconstructed rainfall data from the idw nn and idw ln models are equal if a point falls above or below the identity line it will be interpreted as the associated error from the idw ln model is higher or lower respectively for the sake of simplicity in presentation plots corresponding to only 3 ct values i e 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 are shown in fig 4 as seen the cloud of points decreases as ct increases because the number of valid stations decreased significantly from 422 to 7 see table 2 in fig 4 a to c as the points are close to the identity line the difference in the associated rmse with idw nn and idw ln is quite low on the other hand the plots of the bp error indicate in fig 4 d to f shows a much wider scatter than the rmse error mainly because the percentage bias is relative and rmse is absolute error 4 4 variation of errors in idw ln with location of valid stations since there is a large topographical variation in mdb see fig 2 we investigate into whether there is a relationship between the errors in reconstructing the rainfall data and the elevation of the rain gauge station when the idw nn and idw ln models are used in this direction the first task is to observe the location of the valid stations located in the mdb where the idw ln model performed better than idw nn model the aim here is to examine whether by introducing the concept of network the reconstruction model is able to take into account the topographical variations better or not fig 5 shows the performance of the idw ln model compared to the idw nn model as a function of topography of the rain gauge stations fig 5 a shows the location of the valid stations with lower rmse and bp using the idw ln model compared to errors associated with the idw nn model for ct 0 3 to 0 6 since the number of valid stations decreased significantly after ct 0 6 we choose to present the locations of the valid stations in the mdb only corresponding to four ct values i e 0 3 to 0 6 from both the rows of fig 5 a it is evident that the number of valid stations decreases with an increase in the ct value from 0 3 to 0 6 the north west part of the mdb has the least number of valid stations for idw ln empty square in fig 5 a which implies that it is the least connected region of the basin based on the correlation of rain gauge data similarly the second row of fig 5 a shows that the valid stations corresponding to lower bp are more or less equally distributed in the mdb fig 5 b shows the performance of the idw ln model as a function of different elevation bands of the rain gauges the whole rain gauge network is divided into six elevation bands i e below 200 m 200 to 400 m 400 to 600 m 600 to 800 m 800 to 1000 m and above 1000 m for each elevation band fig 5 b presents the bar plots of the total number of rain gauges associated with the band total number of idw ln valid stations associated with the band total number of valid stations with lower rmse from idw ln as compared to idw nn and total number of valid stations with lower bp from idw ln as compared to idw nn for simplicity only ct 0 6 is considered for presentation in fig 5 b it can be concluded from fig 5 b that the rain gauge stations where the idw ln model showed lower rmse than the idw nn model is equal to nearly 30 percent of the valid stations in that particular elevation band this implies that the performance of the model is independent of the elevation of the rain gauge stations the rain gauge stations which yielded lower bp from idw ln than the idw nn model is equal to nearly 50 percent of the valid stations in all the elevation bands see fig 5 b thus it is not straightforward to derive any definite conclusion about the effect of topography on the performance of idw ln and idw nn models in the reconstruction of the rainfall using either the idw ln model or the idw nn model see fig 5 a and b 4 5 variation of errors in the idw ln model with elevations of valid stations next we explore the relationship between the elevations of the valid stations and the magnitude of the associated error estimates from the idw ln model in reconstructing the rainfall data in fig 6 the rmse and bp values associated with each of the valid stations are plotted against its elevation for ct 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 for simplicity we present the results for only these three selected ct values as it is clear from the scatter of values in fig 6 a to 6 c the valid stations with low rmse obtained from the idw ln model are situated at low elevations mostly below 500 m with rmse value up to 3 5 see fig 6 a the rain gauge stations situated at higher elevations in the mdb basin above 800 m show higher rmse values above 4 the bp values associated with the idw ln model are relatively low mostly below 30 at the high elevation areas of the basin above 500 m and reach to as high as 60 for low elevation areas below 300 m of the basin which is mainly because the sample size of the lower elevation bands is larger fig 5 b as compared to that at the higher elevation bands 4 6 sensitivity of ct and ccr in the idw cn model after studying the performance of the idw ln model now we analyze the error statistics associated with the idw cn model the sensitivity analysis of the correlation threshold ct and the clustering coefficient range ccr are performed by changing the ct values from 0 3 to 0 9 for three different cc ranges 0 3 to 0 6 0 4 to 0 7 and 0 5 to 0 8 respectively in the idw cn model tables 3 and 4 show that out of the 430 rain gauge stations for ccr equal to 0 3 to 0 6 the number of valid stations ranges from 421 to 0 for different ct values 0 3 to 0 9 as the ccr increases to 0 5 to 0 8 the selected valid station range decreases i e from 146 to 0 these observations indicate that for higher ccr the number of valid stations decreases significantly because the clusters become more specific for higher ct and ccr in terms of the magnitude of errors table 3 shows that the average rmse increases as the ccr increases for each ct value 0 3 to 0 9 which is valid for both the idw nn and idw cn models by comparing the average rmse associated with the idw nn and idw cn models in each ccr it can be concluded that the value of the average rmse is relatively higher in the case of reconstructed rainfall using the idw cn model than that using the idw nn model for all ccr values similar observation is made also in the case of the average bp as shown in table 4 further to compare the rmse and bp from the idw cn model or from the idw nn model at each of the valid stations plots of rmse and bp associated with the idw cn model with the corresponding idw nn model errors for all the valid stations are generated figs 7 and 8 show that the scatter between the errors associated with each valid station from both of these idw models for three ct values 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 3 ccr values 0 3 to 0 6 0 4 to 0 7 0 5 to 0 8 in both figures the cloud of points decreases as the ct and ccr increases because the number of valid stations decreases significantly at higher ct and ccr see tables 3 and 4 as shown in fig 7 the rmse scatter plots shift above the identity line as ct and ccr increases which indicates that the error associated with a valid station increases as ct and ccr increases in the idw cn model in fig 8 the points are scattered almost evenly around the identity line hence the associated bp with the idw cn model and the idw nn model differs from low to high value tables 3 and 4 also list the percentages of valid stations showing less rmse and or bp respectively using the idw cn model for three different ccr values the percentage of valid stations with lower rmse and bp associated with the idw cn model than that from the idw nn decreases as the ct and ccr increase hence the idw cn model works fairly well at lower ct and ccr values when compared to their higher values 4 7 variation of errors in the idw cn with locations of valid stations to investigate the relationship of errors in reconstructing rainfall data using the idw nn and idw cn models with the topography of the rain gauge station we identify the valid station locations in the mdb where the idw cn model performed better than the idw nn model the motivation here is to examine whether by introducing the concept of clusters the reconstruction model is able to take into account the topographical variations better or not fig 9 a shows the performance of the idw cn model compared to that of the idw nn model as a function of the locations of the rain gauges for ccr 0 3 to 0 6 as the number of valid stations for the ccr values 0 4 to 0 7 and 0 5 to 0 8 are significantly low tables 3 and 4 the locations of valid stations for these two ccr values are not plotted for the sack of simplicity the locations of valid stations associated with lower rmse and bp at different ct and ccr do not show any particular trend and are randomly located in the case of the idw cn model this particular observation may be due to the specific nature of clusters associated with the idw cn model fig 9 b shows the performance of the idw cn model as a function of different elevation bands in which the rain gauges are located for simplicity in representation only ct 0 6 and ccr 0 3 to 0 6 are considered in this figure the stations with lower rmse and bp from the idw cn model than the idw nn model more or less equally belong to all elevation ranges therefore it is not straightforward to derive any definitive conclusion about the effect of topography on the errors in reconstructing the rainfall using either the idw cn model or the idw nn model fig 9 a and b 4 8 variation of errors in idw cn with elevation of valid stations finally we explore the relationship between the elevations of the valid stations with the associated error estimates from the idw cn models in reconstructing the rainfall data in figs 10 and 11 rmse and bp values associated with each of the valid station is plotted against its elevation for ct 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 fig 10 indicates that the rmse is low at low elevations and increases as the elevation increases for all ct and ccr the plot of bp associated with a valid station against the elevation of station do not show any particular trend see fig 11 which indicates that the associated bp value is independent of the elevation of a valid station 5 discussion and conclusions the results from our analysis show that there is no particular model among idw nn idw ln and idw cn that has consistently the lowest rmse and bp associated with all the valid stations the idw ln model and the idw cn model show lower rmse at about 30 of the stations these two models have comparable the difference is small rmse values at the rest 70 stations see tables 2 3 and 4 similarly 50 of the stations show lower bp while having no major changes in bp values at the remaining 50 of the stations these results indicate that at least at around 30 of the stations in the idw ln model and the idw cn model show better results for rainfall reconstruction the effect of topography and elevation of valid stations on the performance of the three models can be interpreted from figs 5 and 9 as these figures show the performance of the models is mostly independent of the location of the rain gauge stations the effect of elevation of the rain gauge stations on the performance of the models can be explored further by considering a rain gauge network in which the rain gauges are distributed evenly in all elevation bands unlike the mdb the plots of the elevation of the rain gauge station versus the magnitude of the errors rmse and bp figs 10 and 11 show that the magnitude of rmse associated with the idw ln model and the idw cn model has low values at low elevations and it increases as the elevation increases whereas the associated bp is independent of the elevation of the rain gauge station this indicates that the performance of the idw nn idw ln and idw cn models depend upon the type of error statistics being considered for a natural system traditional idw approaches such as the idw nn model may be better suited than the networks based approach idw ln and idw cn from the perspective of error statistics however they may not be completely effective in accounting the spatial rainfall variability especially when the complexity of the system is high such as where there are significant variations in topography and elevations for such situations the concepts of networks may be better suited even when they are not able to completely explain the properties of the whole system it is possible that a large part of a basin behaves in accordance with the spatial correlation assumption inherent in the traditional approaches while the other parts may have properties that may be better explained using the concepts of networks as seen from the results of the present study at some valid stations in the mdb the traditional idw nn model provided very high errors likely due to the significant variations in topography and elevations of the surrounding conditions therefore using the new concept of networks idw ln and idw cn models along with traditional spatial correlation idw nn approach could very likely yield a much better methodology for the reconstruction of rainfall and other meteorological variables the findings from this study are certainly helpful in filling the gaps in meteorological data developing interpolated surface by carefully

6057,accurate and reliable rainfall data is one of the fundamental prerequisites in hydrological modelling the rainfall data at a desired location can be reconstructed using interpolation methods such as inverse distance weighting idw which is frequently used in hydrology in standard idw neighbors are selected based on geographical proximity or nearest neighbor idw nn however in a basin with variable topography nearby rain gauges may be located at very different elevations and thus they may not accurately represent the spatial connection in rainfall in this work the theory of networks with nodes and links as the basis is applied to select neighbors while applying idw two variants of neighbor selection models are proposed idw with linked neighbours idw ln and idw with clustered neighbors idw cn for reconstruction thirty years of daily rainfall data from 430 rain gauges in murray darling basin mdb are utilized to evaluate the performance of the proposed models one station leave out cross validation approach is used and the associated root mean squared error rmse and bias percentage bp are calculated different values of number of neighbors n correlation threshold ct and clustering coefficient range ccr are used to measure the errors associated with the proposed models on comparing with idw nn results show that reconstruction using idw ln has lower rmse at about 30 percent of stations and lower bp for about 50 percent of stations while idw cn shows lower rmse at about 25 percent of stations and lower bp for about 45 percent of stations the idw nn performed better than idw ln and idw cn at more than 50 percent of stations though the average error associated with all the three models are comparable for all ct values in a natural system a concept like traditional idw idw nn may be more accurate than the network based approach idw ln and idw cn but may not be completely efficient in accounting the spatial rainfall variability the encouraging results for the reconstruction of rainfall in this study seem to indicate that the approach can be further helpful in the reconstruction of a wide range of meteorological parameters with spatial correlation

et al 2008 among all the different spatial interpolation methods the inverse distance weighting idw robertson 1967 is perhaps the most commonly used method in hydrology the success of the idw method depends fundamentally on the presence of positive spatial correlations between the data observed at neighboring rain gauges griffith 1992 the underlying assumption is that the data from nearby points are more related than the data from locations far from each other in accordance to tobler s first law of geography tobler 1970 this presumption may not be applicable in certain situations particularly in regions with complex topography shi et al 2017 in such regions even when rain gauges are located geographically closer rainfall data recorded at seemingly neighboring stations can vary significantly due to the variability in topography see for instance berndtsson 1988 and li et al 2014 for additional details in relation to spatio temporal variability spatial patterns are consistently influenced by topography and wind direction especially in mountainous areas barros and lettenmaier 1993 barry 1992 considering these limitations a better understanding of spatial connections between rain gauges and the effect of including such information in idw method need to be explored in recent years the theory of networks has been widely applied for studying the spatial and temporal evolution of a wide range of complex systems and associated phenomena barabási and albert 1999 girvan and newman 2002 konapala and mishra 2017 li et al 2010 milo et al 2002 the application of network theory in hydrology and water resources is relatively new with increasing number of publications on the topics of connections in rainfall stream flow river networks and virtual water trade networks see sivakumar 2015 for a general account of this topic as for rainfall malik et al 2012 investigated the spatial and temporal characteristics of extreme summer monsoon rainfall in south asia boers et al 2013 used networks based concepts to investigate the south american monsoon system sams spatial characteristics of extreme rainfall synchronicity by analyzing gridded daily rainfall data see also boers et al 2015 for subsequent complex networks based studies on south american rainfall in order to examine the annual dynamics of precipitation around the world scarsoglio et al 2013 analyzed a 70 year long january 1941 december 2010 gridded precipitation dataset in the course of the analysis of monthly rainfall data for a period of 68 years at 230 rain gauge stations across australia sivakumar and woldemeskel 2015 employed the concepts of clustering coefficient and degree distribution for the examination of spatial connections in rainfall the clustering coefficient is a measure of local density and represents the tendency of a network to cluster watts and strogatz 1998 jha et al 2015 attempted to provide a hydrological explanation for the results of the complex network based methods for rainfall the clustering coefficient method was applied to two different rain gauge networks in australia 57 stations in western australian stations and 45 stations in the sydney region and the results were interpreted as topographical properties of rain gauge stations latitude longitude and elevation and rainfall data characteristics mean standard deviation and variation coefficient jha and sivakumar 2017 naufan et al 2018 studied the spatial connections in rainfall data from a regional climate model in the context of climate change with the encouraging results detailed by these preliminary studies the present study aims to apply network theory to take into account the spatial connections across a rain gauge network into the idw approach to reconstruct the rainfall data at a desired location we use the concepts of networks to analyze the significance of spatial connections and spatial correlation in the rainfall network we propose three variants of inverse distance weighing i e idw nn nearest neighbors model idw ln linked neighbors model and idw cn clustered neighbors model to study the significance of spatial and temporal connection over spatial correlation for implementation we consider the daily rain gauge data of 430 rain gauge stations located in the murray darling basin to evaluate the performance of the proposed models we use the one station leave out cross validation approach we also study the effect of location and elevation of the rain gauges on the performance of the proposed models 2 methodology 2 1 idw with nearest neighbors idw nn we use the idw method in its standard form to estimate the rainfall at a desired location using weighted average of rainfall at n nearest neighbors as shown in fig 1 a referred as idw nn hereafter the following formula is used 1 p i x 1 n 1 d x t p x x 1 n 1 d x t where p i is the estimate of rainfall at the desired location i p x represents rainfall at a neighboring location x d x is the distance from the location x to the location i where rainfall is being estimated and n is the number of neighborsand t is a positive real number called the power parameter for the sake of simplicity t 2 is considered in further idw calculation eq 1 estimates the weighted average of the rainfall recorded at the nearest n rain gauges to select a fixed value of the number of neighbors in the application of idw nn a sensitivity analysis on the number of neighbors is performed for the sensitivity analysis the nearest neighbors are varied from 1 to 15 in the calculation of idw nn and the error statistics associated with the reconstruction of the data are evaluated more details about the sensitivity analysis are provided in section 4 1 2 2 idw with linked neighbors idw ln in the case of idw nn the neighbors are generally determined based on the geographical proximity only as is done in the present study as well here we introduce the concept of network to identify the neighbors a network is a set of points connected together by a set of lines as shown in fig 1 b the points are called nodes or vertices and the lines are referred as links or edges mathematically a network can be represented as g p e where p is a set of n nodes p 1 p 2 p n and e is a set of m links in the present context rain gauges can be considered as nodes of the network and the connections among them will be the links there are various ways and measures to study the network properties such as clustering coefficient degree centrality and degree distribution see newman 2012 and estrada 2012 for details the clustering coefficient is used in this study to investigate the spatial connections in the rain gauge network the clustering coefficient c c is a measure of the local density of a network and quantifies the network s tendency to cluster to find the clustering coefficient the first step is to assign a correlation threshold ct to identify the neighbors of research station i i e links that have correlations exceeding ct we refer the number of such neighbors as k i for instance suppose there are 10 rain gauges surrounding the research node out of 10 there are only 5 rain gauges at which the correlation of rainfall at the research node i exceeds the preselected ct value as shown in fig 1 b then there would be k i k i 1 2 possible links among k i neighbors of research station i blue lines in fig 1 c see also sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 for additional details the second step in the estimation of clustering coefficient is to find the possible links between k i nodes which also exceed beyond ct let e i be the number of links among neighboring stations with correlations exceeding ct four links shown in violet lines in fig 1 d we refer the corresponding nodes as linked neighbors of the research station we propose a variant of idw nn in which we consider only linked neighbors in the idw approach which we refer as idw ln furthermore to study the sensitivity of ct on the reconstruction of data using idw ln the ct values are varied from 0 3 to 0 9 more details about the sensitivity analysis are provided in section 4 3 2 3 idw with clustered neighbors idw cn the third step in the calculation of cc at the research station is to use formula 2 cc i 2 e i k i k i 1 where e i is the number of links that actually exist between these k i stations and k i k i 1 2 are the total number of possible links between these k i stations the procedure to find the value of e i and k i is repeated for each and every node research gauge station in the network to obtain the clustering coefficient at the corresponding node once we get the cc value for all the nodes in the network different clustering coefficient ranges ccr can be defined to classify the nodes into various groups for example four different clusters shown in red green yellow and blue in fig 1 e now as another variant of idw nn we can consider only those nodes as neighbors which belong to the same cc range as the research node in applying idw we refer this as idw cn hereafter further to study the sensitivity of ccr on the reconstruction of data using idw cn three ccr are fixed i e 0 3 to 0 6 0 4 to 0 7 and 0 5 to 0 8 2 4 verification of the interpolated rainfall once the rainfall has been reconstructed at the research node using one of the three models idw nn idw ln idw cn we estimate the root mean square error rmse and the bias percentage bp at that node as follows 3 rmse 1 n i 1 n p x i p x i 2 4 bp i 1 n p x i p x i 100 p x i where p x i is the reconstructed rainfall and p x i is the observed rainfall at station x i lower value of rmse and bp associated with the reconstruction of data implies the better performance of the model used in the reconstruction of the data the rmse measures the average magnitude of the error it is the representation of the data around the line of best fit the rmse does not necessarily increase with the variance of the errors but increases with the variance of the frequency distribution of error magnitudes however the bp measures the average tendency of the interpolated values to be larger or smaller than their observed ones 2 5 experimental setup we apply the one station leave out cross validation approach to assess the performance of the idw nn idw ln and idw cn models one station leave out cross validation approach leaves one station out of the training data i e if there are n stations in the original sample then n 1 stations are used to train the model and the selected station is used as the validation station this is repeated for all combinations in which the original sample can be separated this way and then the error is averaged for all trials to give overall effectiveness it is used in determining the hyper parameters of a model in the sense that it identifies which parameters will result in the lowest test error as described in sections 2 1 to 2 3 in applying three different idws the number of neighbors has to be determined also in the case of idw ln and idw cn a suitable correlation threshold needs to be used we perform our analysis in the following three steps to systematically find out i the sensitivity of number of neighbours correlation threshold and clustering coefficient range on the reconstructed data ii the relationship of the error statistics associated with the reconstruction of rainfall data with the elevation of the rain gauge stations and iii the spatial distribution of errors in the reconstructed rainfall data 3 study area and dataset we consider rainfall data from the largest river basin in australia namely the murray darling basin mdb fig 2 the mdb contains the catchment of the murray river length 2508 km and the darling river length 1472 km covering a large portion of south east area approximately 106 k m 2 of the australian continent the basin extends from 138 81 o to 152 42 o longitudes and 37 51 o to 25 32 o latitude most regions of the basin are flat and low lying but the coastal areas of the basin contain mountains the great dividing range the climate in the mdb is mostly semi arid causing variability in rainfall at different temporal scales that affect australian agriculture daily rainfall data from 430 rain gauges for the period of january 1985 to december 2014 were collected from the bureau of meteorology bom in australia table 1 provides a summary statistic of the rainfall data from the 430 rain gauges at the daily scale 4 results to evaluate the relative improvement if any in the reconstructed rainfall data using the concept of networks we devise two sets of experiments compare results of idw ln with idw nn and that of idw cn with idw nn the results from idw nn are used as reference the number of neighbors in idw ln and idw cn models is expected to vary by changing ct clustering coefficient range ccr and other relevant parameters further in special cases when for instance ct is very high a research node may not have any neighbor at all to avoid such scenarios in the analysis we introduce the concept of a valid station the interpretation of which is slightly different in case of idw ln and idw cn models 4 1 sensitivity of the number of neighbors in idw nn model to perform the sensitivity analysis we vary the number of neighbors from 1 to 15 and use leave one station out cross validation at each rain gauge station the rmse and bp values presented in fig 3 a and 3b respectively show the error values averaged over 430 rain gauge stations it is clear from the plots that both average rmse and average bp decrease except average bp for 6 neighbors where a slight increase is seen as the number of neighbors increases from 1 to 15 the magnitude of average rmse values varies from 3 11 to 3 86 while the average bp values vary from 16 to 18 5 low error statistics demonstrate that the idw nn model is able to reconstruct the rainfall data accurately over a major part of the basin since the ranges of rmse and bp are low it can also be concluded that the variation in the error values with the increase in the number of neighbors is not significant the purpose of the sensitivity analysis was to select a fixed number of neighbors which can be used in later analysis using idw ln and idw cn fig 3 shows that after number of neighbors equals to five there is no significant change in the average error values hence we decide to use five neighbors in further analysis the average rmse with 5 neighbors in idw nn is 3 19 and the associated average bp is 16 166 as shown in fig 3 in future analysis we will use these error statistics rmse 3 19 and bp 16 17 to compare the performance of the idw ln and idw cn models 4 2 concept of a valid station a valid station is a rain gauge station for which a specific model idw ln or idw cn will have sufficient number of neighbors for the reconstruction of rainfall for the idw nn model all rain gauges are valid stations because the selection of neighbors is independent of a certain ct or ccr in the case of idw ln model we define a valid station only when it has at least five neighbors as obtained in the previous section for a given ct similarly for the idw cn model a station with at least five neighbors for a given ct and ccr is considered a valid station 4 3 sensitivity of the ct in idw ln model after fixing the number of neighborhood to five the next task is to fix the correlation threshold used in the idw ln model the sensitivity analysis of ct is performed by changing its values from 0 3 to 0 9 in the idw ln model it is expected that with the increase in ct the number of valid stations would go down table 2 shows that out of 430 rain gauge stations 427 are identified as valid stations by applying a very low threshold on correlation as 0 3 with the increase in ct up to 0 6 there are minor changes in the number of valid stations however there was a major drop in the number of valid stations for ct 0 7 and higher both the idw nn and idw ln models were applied at the same set of valid stations to estimate the error statistics rmse and bp for instance 422 valid stations exist by using ct 0 4 then for each of these 422 stations we use 5 geographically nearby neighbors as decided in section 4 2 to apply idw nn on the other hand we use 5 linked neighbors in the calculation of idw in case of idw ln the average values of rmse and bp correspond to errors averaged over all the valid stations e g 422 in case of ct 0 4 table 2 shows that the average rmse decreases as ct increases which is valid for both idw nn and idw ln models by comparing the third and fourth columns in table 2 it can be concluded that the value of average rmse is relatively higher in the case of reconstructed rainfall using idw ln similar observation is also made in the case of average bp as shown in table2 since these results are averaged values of errors over all the valid stations we decide to explore what percentage of valid stations actually shows less rmse and or bp using the idw ln model from table 2 it can be seen that at about 28 5 to 31 8 of valid stations rmse in reconstructing the data using the idw ln model is lower than that from the idw nn model similarly at about 28 5 to 50 3 of valid stations bp values are found to be less when the idw ln model is used in reconstructing the rainfall data the average rmse and bp values associated with both idw nn and idw ln are comparable the next obvious question is to determine at each of the valid stations whether the rmse and bp values are higher from the idw nn model or from the idw ln fig 4 shows the scatter diagram between the errors associated with each valid station from both of these idw models in fig 4 if the points fall on the identity line it means that at a valid station the errors in the reconstructed rainfall data from the idw nn and idw ln models are equal if a point falls above or below the identity line it will be interpreted as the associated error from the idw ln model is higher or lower respectively for the sake of simplicity in presentation plots corresponding to only 3 ct values i e 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 are shown in fig 4 as seen the cloud of points decreases as ct increases because the number of valid stations decreased significantly from 422 to 7 see table 2 in fig 4 a to c as the points are close to the identity line the difference in the associated rmse with idw nn and idw ln is quite low on the other hand the plots of the bp error indicate in fig 4 d to f shows a much wider scatter than the rmse error mainly because the percentage bias is relative and rmse is absolute error 4 4 variation of errors in idw ln with location of valid stations since there is a large topographical variation in mdb see fig 2 we investigate into whether there is a relationship between the errors in reconstructing the rainfall data and the elevation of the rain gauge station when the idw nn and idw ln models are used in this direction the first task is to observe the location of the valid stations located in the mdb where the idw ln model performed better than idw nn model the aim here is to examine whether by introducing the concept of network the reconstruction model is able to take into account the topographical variations better or not fig 5 shows the performance of the idw ln model compared to the idw nn model as a function of topography of the rain gauge stations fig 5 a shows the location of the valid stations with lower rmse and bp using the idw ln model compared to errors associated with the idw nn model for ct 0 3 to 0 6 since the number of valid stations decreased significantly after ct 0 6 we choose to present the locations of the valid stations in the mdb only corresponding to four ct values i e 0 3 to 0 6 from both the rows of fig 5 a it is evident that the number of valid stations decreases with an increase in the ct value from 0 3 to 0 6 the north west part of the mdb has the least number of valid stations for idw ln empty square in fig 5 a which implies that it is the least connected region of the basin based on the correlation of rain gauge data similarly the second row of fig 5 a shows that the valid stations corresponding to lower bp are more or less equally distributed in the mdb fig 5 b shows the performance of the idw ln model as a function of different elevation bands of the rain gauges the whole rain gauge network is divided into six elevation bands i e below 200 m 200 to 400 m 400 to 600 m 600 to 800 m 800 to 1000 m and above 1000 m for each elevation band fig 5 b presents the bar plots of the total number of rain gauges associated with the band total number of idw ln valid stations associated with the band total number of valid stations with lower rmse from idw ln as compared to idw nn and total number of valid stations with lower bp from idw ln as compared to idw nn for simplicity only ct 0 6 is considered for presentation in fig 5 b it can be concluded from fig 5 b that the rain gauge stations where the idw ln model showed lower rmse than the idw nn model is equal to nearly 30 percent of the valid stations in that particular elevation band this implies that the performance of the model is independent of the elevation of the rain gauge stations the rain gauge stations which yielded lower bp from idw ln than the idw nn model is equal to nearly 50 percent of the valid stations in all the elevation bands see fig 5 b thus it is not straightforward to derive any definite conclusion about the effect of topography on the performance of idw ln and idw nn models in the reconstruction of the rainfall using either the idw ln model or the idw nn model see fig 5 a and b 4 5 variation of errors in the idw ln model with elevations of valid stations next we explore the relationship between the elevations of the valid stations and the magnitude of the associated error estimates from the idw ln model in reconstructing the rainfall data in fig 6 the rmse and bp values associated with each of the valid stations are plotted against its elevation for ct 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 for simplicity we present the results for only these three selected ct values as it is clear from the scatter of values in fig 6 a to 6 c the valid stations with low rmse obtained from the idw ln model are situated at low elevations mostly below 500 m with rmse value up to 3 5 see fig 6 a the rain gauge stations situated at higher elevations in the mdb basin above 800 m show higher rmse values above 4 the bp values associated with the idw ln model are relatively low mostly below 30 at the high elevation areas of the basin above 500 m and reach to as high as 60 for low elevation areas below 300 m of the basin which is mainly because the sample size of the lower elevation bands is larger fig 5 b as compared to that at the higher elevation bands 4 6 sensitivity of ct and ccr in the idw cn model after studying the performance of the idw ln model now we analyze the error statistics associated with the idw cn model the sensitivity analysis of the correlation threshold ct and the clustering coefficient range ccr are performed by changing the ct values from 0 3 to 0 9 for three different cc ranges 0 3 to 0 6 0 4 to 0 7 and 0 5 to 0 8 respectively in the idw cn model tables 3 and 4 show that out of the 430 rain gauge stations for ccr equal to 0 3 to 0 6 the number of valid stations ranges from 421 to 0 for different ct values 0 3 to 0 9 as the ccr increases to 0 5 to 0 8 the selected valid station range decreases i e from 146 to 0 these observations indicate that for higher ccr the number of valid stations decreases significantly because the clusters become more specific for higher ct and ccr in terms of the magnitude of errors table 3 shows that the average rmse increases as the ccr increases for each ct value 0 3 to 0 9 which is valid for both the idw nn and idw cn models by comparing the average rmse associated with the idw nn and idw cn models in each ccr it can be concluded that the value of the average rmse is relatively higher in the case of reconstructed rainfall using the idw cn model than that using the idw nn model for all ccr values similar observation is made also in the case of the average bp as shown in table 4 further to compare the rmse and bp from the idw cn model or from the idw nn model at each of the valid stations plots of rmse and bp associated with the idw cn model with the corresponding idw nn model errors for all the valid stations are generated figs 7 and 8 show that the scatter between the errors associated with each valid station from both of these idw models for three ct values 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 3 ccr values 0 3 to 0 6 0 4 to 0 7 0 5 to 0 8 in both figures the cloud of points decreases as the ct and ccr increases because the number of valid stations decreases significantly at higher ct and ccr see tables 3 and 4 as shown in fig 7 the rmse scatter plots shift above the identity line as ct and ccr increases which indicates that the error associated with a valid station increases as ct and ccr increases in the idw cn model in fig 8 the points are scattered almost evenly around the identity line hence the associated bp with the idw cn model and the idw nn model differs from low to high value tables 3 and 4 also list the percentages of valid stations showing less rmse and or bp respectively using the idw cn model for three different ccr values the percentage of valid stations with lower rmse and bp associated with the idw cn model than that from the idw nn decreases as the ct and ccr increase hence the idw cn model works fairly well at lower ct and ccr values when compared to their higher values 4 7 variation of errors in the idw cn with locations of valid stations to investigate the relationship of errors in reconstructing rainfall data using the idw nn and idw cn models with the topography of the rain gauge station we identify the valid station locations in the mdb where the idw cn model performed better than the idw nn model the motivation here is to examine whether by introducing the concept of clusters the reconstruction model is able to take into account the topographical variations better or not fig 9 a shows the performance of the idw cn model compared to that of the idw nn model as a function of the locations of the rain gauges for ccr 0 3 to 0 6 as the number of valid stations for the ccr values 0 4 to 0 7 and 0 5 to 0 8 are significantly low tables 3 and 4 the locations of valid stations for these two ccr values are not plotted for the sack of simplicity the locations of valid stations associated with lower rmse and bp at different ct and ccr do not show any particular trend and are randomly located in the case of the idw cn model this particular observation may be due to the specific nature of clusters associated with the idw cn model fig 9 b shows the performance of the idw cn model as a function of different elevation bands in which the rain gauges are located for simplicity in representation only ct 0 6 and ccr 0 3 to 0 6 are considered in this figure the stations with lower rmse and bp from the idw cn model than the idw nn model more or less equally belong to all elevation ranges therefore it is not straightforward to derive any definitive conclusion about the effect of topography on the errors in reconstructing the rainfall using either the idw cn model or the idw nn model fig 9 a and b 4 8 variation of errors in idw cn with elevation of valid stations finally we explore the relationship between the elevations of the valid stations with the associated error estimates from the idw cn models in reconstructing the rainfall data in figs 10 and 11 rmse and bp values associated with each of the valid station is plotted against its elevation for ct 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 fig 10 indicates that the rmse is low at low elevations and increases as the elevation increases for all ct and ccr the plot of bp associated with a valid station against the elevation of station do not show any particular trend see fig 11 which indicates that the associated bp value is independent of the elevation of a valid station 5 discussion and conclusions the results from our analysis show that there is no particular model among idw nn idw ln and idw cn that has consistently the lowest rmse and bp associated with all the valid stations the idw ln model and the idw cn model show lower rmse at about 30 of the stations these two models have comparable the difference is small rmse values at the rest 70 stations see tables 2 3 and 4 similarly 50 of the stations show lower bp while having no major changes in bp values at the remaining 50 of the stations these results indicate that at least at around 30 of the stations in the idw ln model and the idw cn model show better results for rainfall reconstruction the effect of topography and elevation of valid stations on the performance of the three models can be interpreted from figs 5 and 9 as these figures show the performance of the models is mostly independent of the location of the rain gauge stations the effect of elevation of the rain gauge stations on the performance of the models can be explored further by considering a rain gauge network in which the rain gauges are distributed evenly in all elevation bands unlike the mdb the plots of the elevation of the rain gauge station versus the magnitude of the errors rmse and bp figs 10 and 11 show that the magnitude of rmse associated with the idw ln model and the idw cn model has low values at low elevations and it increases as the elevation increases whereas the associated bp is independent of the elevation of the rain gauge station this indicates that the performance of the idw nn idw ln and idw cn models depend upon the type of error statistics being considered for a natural system traditional idw approaches such as the idw nn model may be better suited than the networks based approach idw ln and idw cn from the perspective of error statistics however they may not be completely effective in accounting the spatial rainfall variability especially when the complexity of the system is high such as where there are significant variations in topography and elevations for such situations the concepts of networks may be better suited even when they are not able to completely explain the properties of the whole system it is possible that a large part of a basin behaves in accordance with the spatial correlation assumption inherent in the traditional approaches while the other parts may have properties that may be better explained using the concepts of networks as seen from the results of the present study at some valid stations in the mdb the traditional idw nn model provided very high errors likely due to the significant variations in topography and elevations of the surrounding conditions therefore using the new concept of networks idw ln and idw cn models along with traditional spatial correlation idw nn approach could very likely yield a much better methodology for the reconstruction of rainfall and other meteorological variables the findings from this study are certainly helpful in filling the gaps in meteorological data developing interpolated surface by carefully

6058,to quantitatively investigate the lid low impact development effects under different storms and terrain conditions an experimental urban catchment with lid measures is developed in this work the surface runoff control effects of the experimental lid measures are evaluated by quantifying and comparing the peak runoff reduction rate to a traditional infrastructure with no lid the experimental results on three cross and longitudinal slopes under three storm intensities show that the measured peak runoff of the traditional infrastructures is higher than that of the lid indicating that lid reduces the peak runoff considerably as the storm intensities are increased from 0 47 mm min to 0 84 mm min the peak runoff reduction rates decrease from 14 48 to 4 91 highlighting that lid effects are more significant for low to moderate intensity of storms the effect of lid in reducing the peak runoff is more significant for a gentler cross or longitudinal slope for example the highest reduction in peak runoff 14 48 occurs when a gentle longitudinal and cross slope of 1 is incorporated moreover the effect of lid is more sensitive to the longitudinal slope when compared to the cross slope the findings from this study quantify that the lid measures are more effective for low intensity storm across gentler slopes while the results help in understanding the mechanism of lid effects for optimizing infrastructure planning they also provide a systematically measured data for numerical model validation and coefficient calibration keywords lid storm terrain slope runoff reduction

used lid measures include permeable pavements bioretention facilities green roofs vegetative swales rain gardens rain barrels and so on davis et al 2009 yoo et al 2015 ahiablame and shakya 2016 the effects of the lid measures on the surface runoff are influenced by the lid measures themselves hydrological and terrain conditions etc getter et al 2007 davis et al 2009 gilroy and mccuen 2009 beecham and razzaghmanesh 2015 goh et al 2017 for instance rainfall intensity is proven to be an effective factor for the rain water retention capacity for green roofs as that in teemusk and mander 2007 such effect is also demonstrated for the permeable pavements by fassman and blackbourn 2010 regarding the terrain slopes getter et al 2007 and palla et al 2015 find the considerable impacts on the surface runoff respectively for green roofs and permeable pavements therefore the rainfall intensity and terrain slope are considered to be two of the most concerned impacting factors for lid effects guan et al 2016 goh et al 2017 sedyowati and susanti 2017 and in turn systematically investigation is required since the long term data for the effects of the realistic lid measures are normally rare experimentally evaluating the lid effects are becoming more and more popular ahiablame et al 2012 andersen et al 1999 richards et al 2017 many studies on evaluating the effect of lid on surface runoff have engaged in this field collins et al 2007 aravena and dussaillant 2009 lefevre et al 2012 yang et al 2013 valinski chandler 2015 palla et al 2015 however most existing lid effect experiments do not consider all the factors influencing its effects simultaneously andersen et al 1999 kamali et al 2017 vanwoert et al 2005 for instance fassman and blackbourn 2010 investigated the effects of permeable pavement under different rainfall intensities through experiments finding that permeable pavement could effectively mitigate surface runoff kamali et al 2017 designed a laboratory experiment by just considering rainfall intensity to evaluate the trend and extend of infiltration capacity for permeable pavement field scale experimental rain gardens were constructed by yang et al 2013 effectively reduced both flow peak and volume under natural and simulated runoff events richards et al 2017 explored runoff reduction effect based on the raingardens experiment under different rainfall events the hydrologic performance of bioretentions was also evaluated on the basis of a rainfall watershed bioretention system experiment under various rainfall intensities gülbaz and kazezyilmaz alhan 2017 the abovementioned experimental studies cover different types of lid measures finding the lid measures play a significant role for surface runoff control under certain rainfall conditions but heavy storms and terrain features such as slopes together are not taken into account as mentioned before the lid measures are normally designed to control the runoff for the storm with short return period few researches investigate the lid effects for the relatively heavy storms though the quantitative evaluation is necessary for lid plan and design optimization lee et al 2012 chui et al 2016 chui et al 2016 assessed the hydrological effects and cost effectiveness of specific lid practices under heavy storm events proposing an approach selecting feasible lid plans in terms of runoff control and cost hu et al 2019 focused on flood mitigation performance of lid measures under different storms concluding that the lids are more effective on flood mitigation for long rainfall duration and less effective in shorter and heavier storms in spite of the findings the terrain features of the urban area which is also a key factor for lid performance are not taken into account though with regular catchment hydrological process affected by the terrain slopes he et al 2018 simons et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 moreover the methods they applied for assessing lid performance in storms are numerical models the experimental investigation suppling measured data is still desired through setting up an experimental platform with varying slopes embedded by modelled lid measures this work quantitatively investigates the lid effects on surface runoff process under different terrain slopes and storm intensities the remainder of the paper is organized as follows the experimental platform for lid effect and the methods for data analysis are described in section 2 the results of the measured lid effects changing with storm intensities and slopes are presented and discussed in section 3 brief conclusions are finally drawn in section 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 simulated rainfall experiment of the lid effects to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the lid measures affected by the storm intensities and terrain slopes a simulated rainfall experimental platform was built at xi an university of technology china as plotted in fig 1 it is actually a physical model using a geometric similarity scale of 1 100 based on the sponge city prototype in fengxi new town xixian new area xi an city being one of the 30 pilot cities for the sponge city program in china the sponge city pilot area employs the lid measures together with the traditional flood management features e g the improved storm drainage networks aiming at achieving sustainable urban storm management elliott and trowsdale 2007 damodaram et al 2010 the typical lid measures applied are the permeable pavements and detention pond system the permeable pavement is a kind of infiltration system laid in sidewalks squares and parks in urban areas able to quickly pass rainwater runoff into the soil kamali et al 2017 the detention ponds can be constructed to store and attenuate surface runoff giacomoni et al 2014 in the experimental system the permeable pavement detention ponds and land use changing are modelled in the experimental system as lid measures as plotted in fig 1 in addition the roads buildings and vegetation are also physically modelled in the experiment the platform consists of rainfall simulator steel frame urban surface plates water collecting tanks and sink of the infiltrated water figs 1 and 2 it is 7 m long and 3 m wide a rainfall simulator with seven nozzles is distributed uniformly along the two sides providing an effective rainfall area more than 21 m2 fig 1 three storm intensities 0 47 0 65 and 0 84 mm min 1 termed as storm c storm b and storm a are used respectively in the experiment to represent different storms through changing the nozzles with different aperture the selected storms are devised by considering the local designing short term 2 h storms with the return periods of 10a 50a 100a respectively hou et al 2019 the similarity scale of storm intensity is assumed the same as that of the velocity i e the square root of the geometric similarity scale based on the law of gravity similarity as tested the uniformity coefficient of selected rainfall is higher than 80 indicating a good uniformity of the experimental rainfalls the simulated rainfalls cannot produce satisfactory lighter storm with the return period shorter than 10 years since the lighter storm would lead to very low uniformity coefficient as tested it is also the reason why the experimental storms with the return period shorter than 10 years are not chosen in this work fig 3 shows the sketch of simulated urban surface with the longitudinal slope i1 and cross slope i2 the longitudinal slope and the cross slope can be adjusted from 0 to 20 and 0 to 10 respectively three longitudinal slopes 1 5 10 and two cross slopes 1 5 are used in the experiment these slopes can express the actual slope of urban topography because actual urban surface slopes are commonly lower than 10 wang et al 2018b a longitudinal channel is designed in the middle of the model surface as the main road with the width of 0 3 m used also as a surface water drainage channel on the left and right hand sides of the experimental urban surface there are four cross channels with the width of 0 2 m representing the urban roads the two simulated urban surfaces fixed on the steel frame consist of 48 two layer rectangular acrylic plates on each side the infiltration capacity can be adjusted by changing the effective permeable area on each plate and therefore can reflect different land use patterns including lid measures e g permeable pavement each permeable plate has two layers the upper layer has a dimension of 0 54 m 0 33 m and the lower layer 0 48 m 0 29 m is a little smaller as shown in fig 3 to facilitate sliding both acrylic plates punched by a large amount of uniform rectangular holes with the area of 10 mm 0 8 mm the effective permeable area which controlling experimental infiltration rate can be adjusted to produce high middle and low infiltration effects by means of sliding the lower layer plate and in turn modifying the penetrating area of the holes at the plates connecting the two layers the measured infiltration rate of the punched plates is between 0 mm h to 110 mm h in the experiment since the same similarity scale as the storm intensity is considered it represents the prototype infiltration rate of 0 mm h to 1100 mm h covering that of the realistic permeable pavement ranging from 30 mm h to 450 mm h as tested by the authors for example the observed infiltration rate keeps nearly constant around 0 7 mm min 42 mm h for the storm a on the 1 longitudinal and cross slopes fig 4 it verifies the punched acrylic plates can be applied to physically model the infiltration process for actual urban surface including permeable pavement under saturated state the whole experimental urban surface system is supported by a steel frame located above a cement basin which collects infiltrated water passing through the experimental urban surface plates two water tanks are located adjacent to the platform to collect the surface runoff from the main channel and the infiltrated water from the cement basin respectively aiming at measuring the surface runoff and infiltration rate fig 2 2 2 measuring and analyzing methods in the experiment the simulated storms can cause surface runoff in the modelled urban surface and the runoff converges to the central channel the surface runoff and the infiltrated water will be collected in two tanks respectively and therefore the surface runoff rate can be evaluated by measuring the increasing rate of the water volume since the lid measures will reduce the surface runoff in the rainfall runoff process the lid effects can be expressed by analyzing the reducing pattern of the surface runoff from the experimental results dietz 2007 hood et al 2007 zhu and chen 2017 considering that only a constant storm intensity can be generated using the experimental setup in this study the peak runoff reduction rate is employed as a key indicator to reflect the lid effect the simulated storm events last for 12 min and the measurement continues for another 5 min to catch the runoff descending process after the rain stops the experiment includes two types of urban surface patterns to reflect the lid and traditional urban development patterns for the traditional urban development pattern the urban surface is considered as impermeable and the detention ponds are removed an experimental scheme with eighteen experimental cases is designed for each urban surface pattern under the conditions of three storm intensities three longitudinal slopes and three cross slopes see table 1 in order to guarantee data reliability and consistency each case is replicated by three times as that in mahmoodabadi and sajjadi 2016 in this experiment the water depth in the tanks is monitored by high precision digital pressure sensors with collecting frequency of a second the surface runoff volume is calculated from the measured water depth in the tanks the extreme elimination method ma et al 2014 and mean filling method are used to analyze time series data for runoff unrealistic extreme values caused by the water surface fluctuation are directly removed the missing values are replaced by the mean values at middle fluctuating stage of the entire runoff curve in the experiment the peak runoff reduction rates r peak are obtained by comparing the measured mean peak runoff of lid measures and traditional urban development as 1 r peak q tri q lid q tri where q tri and q lid are the mean peak runoff at the steady state of the measured runoff for traditional urban development and lid measures respectively 3 results and discussion the lid effects on the surface runoff under different storm intensities and terrain slopes are investigated by analyzing the experimental results in this work the impacting effect of the storm and slope are respectively presented in sections 3 1 and 3 2 3 1 lid effects of storm intensities the measured surface runoff under the lid and traditional urban development conditions for all considered storm intensities is illustrated in figs 5 7 all of the measured surface runoff increases at the beginning and reaches a steady state prior to the recession process t 12 min the runoff then decreases rapidly and lasts for about 5 min after the rain stopes it is clear that the measured runoff curves of the lid model are lower than that of the traditional urban development model before the rain stops t 12 min i e the peak runoff of lid is significantly lower than that of the traditional urban development condition expressing the lid measures could mitigate the surface runoff under all considered storm intensities moreover good performance of the lid measures for runoff controlling can also be reflected by a lower increasing and descending rate at the beginning and the end of the experiment respectively indicating again the lid measures have a detective runoff mitigation and retention effect figs 5 to 7 show that the lid effects vary with the storm intensity i e the peak runoff reduction rate becomes higher as the storm becomes less intense the phenomenon is also quantitatively analyzed in table 2 through using a peak runoff control rate as eq 1 compared to the surface runoff of the traditional urban development condition the lid measures can reduce the runoff peaks by 4 91 9 85 7 63 11 54 11 05 14 48 respectively for the storm a b and c on different lopes among them case c1 light storm and i1 1 i2 1 has the highest reduction rate and case a6 heavy storm and i1 10 i2 5 has the lowest reduction rate as the light storm event 0 47 mm min 1 the highest reduction rate 14 48 is 1 47 times higher than the highest reduction rate 9 85 of the heavy storm event 0 84 mm min 1 it shows that lid measures could play a more significant role for the low intense storm fig 8 a similar conclusion was also reported by gilroy and mccuen 2009 the results show that lid effects are more significant for low intensity of storms it is because that the detained and infiltrated runoff accounts for a larger proportion under the lid condition with the relatively lighter rains 3 2 lid effects of different slopes the measured surface runoffs under the lid conditions with different slopes for all considered storm intensities are illustrated in figs 9 to 11 the results of the peak runoff reduction rates with the changing slopes which contain three longitudinal slopes 1 5 10 and two cross slopes 1 5 are listed in table 2 the lid effects of slopes are analyzed by estimating the runoff reduction rate compared to the surface runoff of the traditional urban development condition the lid measures can reduce the runoff peaks by 5 21 14 48 4 91 12 73 respectively for 1 and 5 cross slopes on different longitudinal slopes regarding the longitudinal slope the lid measures can reduce the runoff peaks by 8 61 14 48 5 74 12 22 4 91 11 36 respectively for 1 5 and 10 longitudinal slope on different cross slopes for instance case a1 storm a and i1 1 i2 1 case b1 storm b and i1 1 i2 1 and case c1 storm c and i1 1 i2 1 have high runoff reduction rate especially that the reduction rates of case c1 keep the highest it is found that the surface runoff increases as the slopes increase but the peak runoff reduction rate becomes lower and lower this phenomenon is possibly because when the slopes increase the tangential forces along the slope increase and gravity forces normal to the slope decrease leading to fast surface flows lower infiltration rates and lower retention capacities the results also indicate that the surface runoff change is sensitive to the longitudinal and cross slope the sensitivity of the longitudinal and cross slopes is also investigated on the same cross slope the peak runoff reduction rate of the gentlest longitudinal slope is 2 6 2 8 times as high as that of the steepest one under all storms events for the same longitudinal slope the peak runoff reduction rate of the gentlest cross slope is 1 7 to 2 3 times as high as that of the steepest one in the experiment it is clear that for the same slope changing the lid effects of the cross slope vary in a more obvious way indicating the effect of the longitudinal slope is more significant it may because of a longer runoff path for longitudinal slope compared with cross slope more intense hydrological and hydraulic processes happen along the longitudinal slope a small change of longitudinal slope can therefore lead to considerable change for the reduction of surface runoff moreover the measured surface runoff on the steep longitudinal slope increases and decreases slightly faster than the gentle longitudinal slope at the beginning and the end of the experiment respectively under all considered storm intensities figs 9 to 11 indicating again that the lid has more obvious runoff retention effects on gentle slopes the finding is in accordance with that in vanwoert et al 2005 getter et al 2007 4 conclusions in order to quantitatively analyze lid effects under different terrain slope and storm conditions an experiment platform have been set up considering lid measures on different slopes under different storm intensities the runoff control effects of the experimental lid measures are monitored through measuring the peak runoff reduction rate compared to the experimental urban surface with traditional urban development style through analyzing the experimental results the conclusions are drawn as follows the experimental runoff peaks of traditional urban development are higher than that of the lid indicating the lid could considerably reduce the peak runoff as the storm intensities are increased from 0 47 mm min to 0 84 mm min the peak runoff reduction rates decrease from 14 48 to 4 91 lid effects are more significant for low and moderate intensity of storms than that of the heavy storm on the same urban slope for the same storm intensity the effect of lid in reducing the peak runoff is more significant for a gentler cross or longitudinal slope for instance the highest reduction in peak runoff 14 48 case c1 occurs when a gentle longitudinal and cross slope of 1 is incorporated moreover the results show that the effect of lid in reducing the peak runoff is more sensitive to the longitudinal slope when compared to the cross slope in summary lid measures are more effective along gentler milder slopes for low storm intensities as tested in the experiment while the results help in understanding the mechanism of lid effects for optimizing infrastructure planning they also provide a systematically measured data for numerical model validation and coefficient calibration it is clear that the initial soil moisture conditions and storm patterns also play an important role in generating runoff as demonstrated in boyd et al 1993 and wine et al 2012 some limitations therefore exist in the devised experiment which just considering the saturated soil and steady rainfall intensity however the overall reduction in peak runoff rates may still be representative of the lid effect while the amount of reduction may change when initial soil moisture and storm patterns are applied this needs further investigation and is beyond the scope of this work in addition to the above mentioned assumption the upscaling of the results to an actual urban catchment may cause differing degrees of reduction and also requires further investigation in the future work declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this work is partly supported by the national natural science foundation of

6058,to quantitatively investigate the lid low impact development effects under different storms and terrain conditions an experimental urban catchment with lid measures is developed in this work the surface runoff control effects of the experimental lid measures are evaluated by quantifying and comparing the peak runoff reduction rate to a traditional infrastructure with no lid the experimental results on three cross and longitudinal slopes under three storm intensities show that the measured peak runoff of the traditional infrastructures is higher than that of the lid indicating that lid reduces the peak runoff considerably as the storm intensities are increased from 0 47 mm min to 0 84 mm min the peak runoff reduction rates decrease from 14 48 to 4 91 highlighting that lid effects are more significant for low to moderate intensity of storms the effect of lid in reducing the peak runoff is more significant for a gentler cross or longitudinal slope for example the highest reduction in peak runoff 14 48 occurs when a gentle longitudinal and cross slope of 1 is incorporated moreover the effect of lid is more sensitive to the longitudinal slope when compared to the cross slope the findings from this study quantify that the lid measures are more effective for low intensity storm across gentler slopes while the results help in understanding the mechanism of lid effects for optimizing infrastructure planning they also provide a systematically measured data for numerical model validation and coefficient calibration keywords lid storm terrain slope runoff reduction

used lid measures include permeable pavements bioretention facilities green roofs vegetative swales rain gardens rain barrels and so on davis et al 2009 yoo et al 2015 ahiablame and shakya 2016 the effects of the lid measures on the surface runoff are influenced by the lid measures themselves hydrological and terrain conditions etc getter et al 2007 davis et al 2009 gilroy and mccuen 2009 beecham and razzaghmanesh 2015 goh et al 2017 for instance rainfall intensity is proven to be an effective factor for the rain water retention capacity for green roofs as that in teemusk and mander 2007 such effect is also demonstrated for the permeable pavements by fassman and blackbourn 2010 regarding the terrain slopes getter et al 2007 and palla et al 2015 find the considerable impacts on the surface runoff respectively for green roofs and permeable pavements therefore the rainfall intensity and terrain slope are considered to be two of the most concerned impacting factors for lid effects guan et al 2016 goh et al 2017 sedyowati and susanti 2017 and in turn systematically investigation is required since the long term data for the effects of the realistic lid measures are normally rare experimentally evaluating the lid effects are becoming more and more popular ahiablame et al 2012 andersen et al 1999 richards et al 2017 many studies on evaluating the effect of lid on surface runoff have engaged in this field collins et al 2007 aravena and dussaillant 2009 lefevre et al 2012 yang et al 2013 valinski chandler 2015 palla et al 2015 however most existing lid effect

affected by the storm intensities and terrain slopes a simulated rainfall experimental platform was built at xi an university of technology china as plotted in fig 1 it is actually a physical model using a geometric similarity scale of 1 100 based on the sponge city prototype in fengxi new town xixian new area xi an city being one of the 30 pilot cities for the sponge city program in china the sponge city pilot area employs the lid measures together with the traditional flood management features e g the improved storm drainage networks aiming at achieving sustainable urban storm management elliott and trowsdale 2007 damodaram et al 2010 the typical lid measures applied are the permeable pavements and detention pond system the permeable pavement is a kind of infiltration system laid in sidewalks squares and parks in urban areas able to quickly pass rainwater runoff into the soil kamali et al 2017 the detention ponds can be constructed to store and attenuate surface runoff giacomoni

buildings and vegetation are also physically modelled in the experiment the platform consists of rainfall simulator steel frame urban surface plates water collecting tanks and sink of the infiltrated water figs 1 and 2 it is 7 m long and 3 m wide a rainfall simulator with seven nozzles is distributed uniformly along the two sides providing an effective rainfall area more than 21 m2 fig 1 three storm intensities 0 47 0 65 and 0 84 mm min 1 termed as storm c storm b and storm a are used respectively in the experiment to represent different storms through changing the nozzles with different aperture the selected storms are devised by considering the local designing short term 2 h storms with the return periods of 10a 50a 100a respectively hou et al 2019 the similarity scale of storm intensity is assumed the same as that of the velocity i e the square root of the geometric similarity scale based on the law of gravity similarity as tested the uniformity coefficient of selected rainfall is higher than 80 indicating a good uniformity of the experimental rainfalls the simulated rainfalls cannot produce satisfactory lighter storm with the return period shorter than 10 years since the lighter storm would lead to very low uniformity coefficient as tested it is also the reason why the experimental storms with the return period shorter than 10 years are not chosen in this work fig 3 shows the sketch of simulated urban surface with the longitudinal slope i1 and cross slope i2 the longitudinal slope and the cross slope can be adjusted from 0 to 20 and 0 to 10 respectively three longitudinal slopes 1 5 10 and two cross slopes 1 5 are used in the experiment these slopes can express the actual slope of urban topography because actual urban surface slopes are commonly lower than 10 wang et al 2018b a longitudinal channel is designed in the middle of the model surface as the main road with the width of 0 3 m used also as a surface water drainage channel on the left and right hand sides of the experimental urban surface there are four cross channels with the width of 0 2 m representing the urban roads the two simulated urban surfaces fixed on the steel frame consist of 48 two layer rectangular acrylic plates on each side the infiltration capacity can be adjusted by changing the effective permeable area on each plate and therefore can reflect different land use patterns including lid measures e g permeable pavement each permeable plate has two layers the upper layer has a dimension of 0 54 m 0 33 m and the lower layer 0 48 m 0 29 m is a little smaller as shown in fig 3 to facilitate sliding both acrylic plates punched by a large amount of uniform rectangular holes with the area of 10 mm 0 8 mm the effective permeable area which controlling experimental infiltration rate can be adjusted to produce high middle and low infiltration effects by means of sliding the lower layer plate and in turn modifying the penetrating area of the holes at the plates connecting the two layers the measured infiltration rate of the punched plates is between 0 mm h to 110 mm h in the experiment since the same similarity scale as the storm intensity is considered it represents the prototype infiltration rate of 0 mm h to 1100 mm h covering that of the realistic permeable pavement ranging from 30 mm h to 450 mm h as tested by the authors for example the observed infiltration rate keeps nearly constant around 0 7 mm min 42 mm h for the storm a on the 1 longitudinal and cross slopes fig 4 it verifies the punched acrylic plates can be applied to physically model the infiltration process for actual urban surface including permeable pavement under saturated state the whole experimental urban surface system is supported by a steel frame located above a cement basin which collects infiltrated water passing through the experimental urban surface plates two water tanks are located adjacent to the platform to collect the surface runoff from the main channel and the infiltrated water from the cement basin respectively aiming at measuring the surface runoff and infiltration rate fig 2 2 2 measuring and analyzing methods in the experiment the simulated storms can cause surface runoff in the modelled urban surface and the runoff converges to the central channel the surface runoff and the infiltrated water will be collected in two tanks respectively and therefore the surface runoff rate can be evaluated by measuring the increasing rate of the water volume since the lid measures will reduce the surface runoff in the rainfall runoff process the lid effects can be expressed by analyzing the reducing pattern of the surface runoff from the experimental results dietz 2007 hood et al 2007 zhu and chen 2017 considering that only a constant storm intensity can be generated using the experimental setup in this study the peak runoff reduction rate is employed as a key indicator to reflect the lid effect the simulated storm events last for 12 min and the measurement continues for another 5 min to catch the runoff descending process after the rain stops the experiment includes two types of urban surface patterns to reflect the lid and traditional urban development patterns for the traditional urban development pattern the urban surface is considered as impermeable and the detention ponds are removed an experimental scheme with eighteen experimental cases is designed for each urban surface pattern under the conditions of three storm intensities three longitudinal slopes and three cross slopes see table 1 in order to guarantee data reliability and consistency each case is replicated by three times as that in mahmoodabadi and sajjadi 2016 in this experiment the water depth in the tanks is monitored by high precision digital pressure sensors with collecting frequency of a second the surface runoff volume is calculated from the measured water depth in the tanks the extreme elimination method ma et al 2014 and mean filling method are used to analyze time series data for runoff unrealistic extreme values caused by the water surface fluctuation are directly removed the missing values are replaced by the mean values at middle fluctuating stage of the entire runoff curve in the experiment the peak runoff reduction rates r peak are obtained by comparing the measured mean peak runoff of lid measures and traditional urban development as 1 r peak q tri q lid q tri where q tri and q lid are the mean peak runoff at the steady state of the measured runoff for traditional urban development and lid measures respectively 3 results and discussion the lid effects on the surface runoff under different storm intensities and terrain slopes are investigated by analyzing the experimental results in this work the impacting effect of the storm and slope are respectively presented in sections 3 1 and 3 2 3 1 lid effects of storm intensities the measured surface runoff under the lid and traditional urban development conditions for all considered storm intensities is illustrated in figs 5 7 all of the measured surface runoff increases at the beginning and reaches a steady state prior to the recession process t 12 min the runoff then decreases rapidly and lasts for about 5 min after the rain stopes it is clear that the measured runoff curves of the lid model are lower than that of the traditional urban development model before the rain stops t 12 min i e the peak runoff of lid is significantly lower than that of the traditional urban development condition expressing the lid measures could mitigate the surface runoff under all considered storm intensities moreover good performance of the lid measures for runoff controlling can also be reflected by a lower increasing and descending rate at the beginning and the end of the experiment respectively indicating again the lid measures have a detective runoff mitigation and retention effect figs 5 to 7 show that the lid effects vary with the storm intensity i e the peak runoff reduction rate becomes higher as the storm becomes less intense the phenomenon is also quantitatively analyzed in table 2 through using a peak runoff control rate as eq 1 compared to the surface runoff of the traditional urban development condition the lid measures can reduce the runoff peaks by 4 91 9 85 7 63 11 54 11 05 14 48 respectively for the storm a b and c on different lopes among them case c1 light storm and i1 1 i2 1 has the highest reduction rate and case a6 heavy storm and i1 10 i2 5 has the lowest reduction rate as the light storm event 0 47 mm min 1 the highest reduction rate 14 48 is 1 47 times higher than the highest reduction rate 9 85 of the heavy storm event 0 84 mm min 1 it shows that lid measures could play a more significant role for the low intense storm fig 8 a similar conclusion was also reported by gilroy and mccuen 2009 the results show that lid effects are more significant for low intensity of storms it is because that the detained and infiltrated runoff accounts for a larger proportion under the lid condition with the relatively lighter rains 3 2 lid effects of different slopes the measured surface runoffs under the lid conditions with different slopes for all considered storm intensities are illustrated in figs 9 to 11 the results of the peak runoff reduction rates with the changing slopes which contain three longitudinal slopes 1 5 10 and two cross slopes 1 5 are listed in table 2 the lid effects of slopes are analyzed by estimating the runoff reduction rate compared to the surface runoff of the traditional urban development condition the lid measures can reduce the runoff peaks by 5 21 14 48 4 91 12 73 respectively for 1 and 5 cross slopes on different longitudinal slopes regarding the longitudinal slope the lid measures can reduce the runoff peaks by 8 61 14 48 5 74 12 22 4 91 11 36 respectively for 1 5 and 10 longitudinal slope on different cross slopes for instance case a1 storm a and i1 1 i2 1 case b1 storm b and i1 1 i2 1 and case c1 storm c and i1 1 i2 1 have high runoff reduction rate especially that the reduction rates of case c1 keep the highest it is found that the surface runoff increases as the slopes increase but the peak runoff reduction rate becomes lower and lower this phenomenon is possibly because when the slopes increase the tangential forces along the slope increase and gravity forces normal to the slope decrease leading to fast surface flows lower infiltration rates and lower retention capacities the results also indicate that the surface runoff change is sensitive to the longitudinal and cross slope the sensitivity of the longitudinal and cross slopes is also investigated on the same cross slope the peak runoff reduction rate of the gentlest longitudinal slope is 2 6 2 8 times as high as that of the steepest one under all storms events for the same longitudinal slope the peak runoff reduction rate of the gentlest cross slope is 1 7 to 2 3 times as high as that of the steepest one in the experiment it is clear that for the same slope changing the lid effects of the cross slope vary in a more obvious way indicating the effect of the longitudinal slope is more significant it may because of a longer runoff path for longitudinal slope compared with cross slope more intense hydrological and hydraulic processes happen along the longitudinal slope a small change of longitudinal slope can therefore lead to considerable change for the reduction of surface runoff moreover the measured surface runoff on the steep longitudinal slope increases and decreases slightly faster than the gentle longitudinal slope at the beginning and the end of the experiment respectively under all considered storm intensities figs 9 to 11 indicating again that the lid has more obvious runoff retention effects on gentle slopes the finding is in accordance with that in vanwoert et al 2005 getter et al 2007 4 conclusions in order to quantitatively analyze lid effects under different terrain slope and storm conditions an experiment platform have been set up considering lid measures on different slopes under different storm intensities the runoff control effects of the experimental lid measures are monitored through measuring the peak runoff reduction rate compared to the experimental urban surface with traditional urban development style through analyzing the experimental results the conclusions are drawn as follows the experimental runoff peaks of traditional urban development are higher than that of the lid indicating the lid could considerably reduce the peak runoff as the storm intensities are increased from 0 47 mm min to 0 84 mm min the peak runoff reduction rates decrease from 14 48 to 4 91 lid effects are more significant for low and moderate intensity of storms than that of the heavy storm on the same urban slope for the same storm intensity the effect of lid in reducing the peak runoff is more significant for a gentler cross or longitudinal slope for instance the highest reduction in peak runoff 14 48 case c1 occurs when a gentle longitudinal and cross slope of 1 is incorporated moreover the results show that the effect of lid in reducing the peak runoff is more sensitive to the longitudinal slope when compared to the cross slope in summary lid measures are more effective along gentler milder slopes for low storm intensities as tested in the experiment while the results help in understanding the mechanism of lid effects for optimizing infrastructure planning they also provide a systematically measured data for numerical model validation and coefficient calibration it is clear that the initial soil moisture conditions and storm patterns also play an important role in generating runoff as demonstrated in boyd et al 1993 and wine et al 2012 some limitations therefore exist in the devised experiment which just considering the saturated soil and steady rainfall intensity however the overall reduction in peak runoff rates may still be representative of the lid effect while the amount of reduction may change when initial soil moisture and storm patterns are applied this needs further investigation and is beyond the scope of this work in addition to the above mentioned assumption the upscaling of the results to an actual urban catchment may cause differing degrees of reduction and also requires further investigation in the future work declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

6059,pumping tests are the most commonly used method for obtaining hydraulic conductivities in mine hydrogeological work while draining tests are a new hydrogeological test method in recent years

the draining tests are carried out in 5 coal mines the corresponding pumping test data are collected the data are compared and analyzed in several aspects and the fractured aquifer is taken as an

tests were corrected by some researchers guo 2013 chu and ju 2017 in recent years draining tests have been carried out in some coal mines in china zhai et al 2014 li 2017 and the data from those tests are used to analyze the water yield property of aquifers and solve for the parameters such as k liu 2015 in draining tests water flows by itself by means of the confined water head and thus it is not necessary to have pumping equipment installed which is different from in pumping tests furthermore the water volume and drawdown are not limited by the equipment capacity and the groundwater flow field characteristics can be simulated more realistically therefore draining tests have become a main test method in the hydrogeological exploration of large mines xu and gui 2002 shao et al 2014 by comparing the data from multiple draining tests with those from pumping tests in the same mining area it is found that the hydrogeological parameters such as k obtained from draining tests are much larger than those from pumping tests and the differences are even up to an order of magnitude so far no reasonable explanation has been provided for this phenomenon therefore this paper is aimed at finding out the causes for the differences in the k obtained from two different types of tests the data of pumping and draining tests from the five coal mines of liuqiao no 2 mine gaojiabao coal mine bucun coal mine qidong coal mine and xialiyuan coal mine are either collected through actual measurement or provided by each mine the causes for the differences in k are analyzed theoretically through data statistics this study has important theoretical guiding significance for the calculation of water resources and mine water inflows 2 test method both the pumping test and the draining test are test methods for obtaining the k however the two are different in on site construction for the pumping test hydrogeological parameters are obtained by observing the changes in water volume and water level when water is pumped in the actual wellbore the pumping test in the five mining areas are carried out in accordance with the requirements of procedure for pumping tests in geological exploration of coal resources ministry of coal industry of china 1980 in this procedure pumping holes pumping equipment observation methods and parameter calculation methods are clearly defined for the draining test confined water flows into the mine along the borehole by itself since the elevation of the hole is below the water level of the aquifer and a certain size of the depression cone is formed in the aquifer after the draining test the hydrogeological parameters of the aquifer can be solved through the relationship between the amount of water drained and the drawdown zheng et al 1998 because the principle task technical requirements and data collation method of the draining test are the same as of the pumping test the draining test is also carried out in the five mining areas according to the requirements of procedure for pumping tests in geological exploration of coal resources ministry of coal industry of china 1980 however in the draining test the changes in water pressure in observed instead of the changes in water level when compared with the corresponding hole in the pumping test the draining hole has a self flowing characteristic and thus most draining tests have the characteristics of large water output and large drawdown in this paper the draining test is carried out in five typical mines and the process is briefly described below 2 1 draining test in liuqiao no 2 mine liuqiao no 2 mine is located in the huaibei mining area of anhui province it is the limestone aquifer of taiyuan formation that affects this mine most the limestone layer of taiyuan formation in this area is about 130 m thick consisting of mudstones siltstones and 13 layer limestones from top to bottom l1 and l2 are folium limestones with a thickness of 2 3 m and a characteristic of weak water bearing and l3 and l4 are limestones with a thickness of 8 12 m on average for the limestone layer fissure caverns are developed which are rich in water and their water yield property is strong the draining test carried out at 600 m underground in south roadway was an unsteady flow draining test with maximum drawdown and well group interference water was drained through the fs1 fs3 holes from 14 30 on december 3 2009 till 15 15 on december 7th 2009 for a total of 96 75 h for the fs1 fs3 holes the draining rate was 20 88 18 25 and 9 26 l s respectively and the drawdown was 322 5 345 68 and 321 3 m respectively as a result the total amount of water drained is about 16685 m3 after draining the water level recovery phase began at 15 15 on december 5 2009 and ended 10 30 on december 9 2009 lasing for 42 25 h in this mine four pumping tests are also conducted on the 1 4 limestones of taiyuan formation through 4 holes 10b1 10b2 10b3 10b4 the location of those holes is shown in fig 1 2 2 draining test in gaojiabao no 1 mining area gaojiabao minefield is located in the binchang mining area of shaanxi province and its administrative district is under the jurisdiction of changwu county xianyang city shaanxi province the pore fissure confined sandstone aquifer of the lower cretaceous luohe formation located above the coal seam has an important influence on coal seam mining the draining test conducted in gaojiabao no 1 mining area started on march 25 2015 and ended on april 28 2015 lasting for 34 days for the three stages of the draining test the draining rate is 6 984 11 998 and 15 174 l s respectively and the drawdown is 76 01 125 07 and 180 m respectively after the draining the jt1 and jt2 holes were closed and the water level recovery began which continued from april 3 2015 to april 28 2015 in this mine there is also a pumping hole t1 in the downstream of luohe formation located within the no 1 mining area the location of those holes is shown in fig 2 2 3 draining test in 921 mining area of bucun coal mine bucun coal mine is affiliated to zibo mining group co ltd located in the southern central part of jidong coalfield zhangqiu coalfield what threatens bucun coal mine most is the aquifer of the middle carboniferous xujiazhuang limestone referred to as xu limestone the xu limestone generally develops into one layer with a thickness of 8 0 12 5 m and part of it develops into two layers furthermore the xu limestone has strong water yield property the draining test carried out in in this area started on may 20 2009 and ended on may 30 2009 lasting for 10 days this draining test was divided into four stages in the first stage the draining hole is lxf1 the draining rate is 37 7 l s and the total amount of water drained is 1233 912 m3 in the second stage the draining holes are lxf1 and lxf2 the maximum draining rate is 37 08 l s and the total amount of water drained is 2911 22 m3 in the third stage the draining holes are lxf1 lxf2 and lxf3 the maximum draining rate is 41 56 l s and the total amount of water drained is 8122 6 m3 in the fourth stage all the draining holes were closed and the water level water pressure recovery in the xu limestone was observed simultaneously in the 921 mining area the pumping test was also carried out on the xu limestone the 134 hole and 58 hole are used as pumping holes the location of those holes is shown in fig 3 2 4 draining test in qidong coal mine qidong coal mine is located in the southeast of suzhou city anhui province the quaternary layer above the bedrock of the mine is at about 189 25 453 00 m and the quaternary layer has 4 aquifers the bottom depth of the fourth aquifer is 189 25 453 m generally 285 400 m and the thickness of the water bearing sand layer is 0 59 10 m the draining test was carried out on the fourth aquifer of the loose layer in the southern mining area of qidong coal mine with the draining holes qf2 constructed along the belt uphill in the no 1 southern mining area among all the holes sq10 sq11 sq12 sq13 and sq14 are the observation holes for the fourth aquifer which are all at the ground level the draining test started on march 15 2014 and ended on march 20 2014 lasting for 5 days for the qf2 hole the draining rate is 13 8 l s and the drawdown is 7 68 m for the observation holes the drawdown is 2 17 3 67 m after the draining test the equation k q 2 π m s 1 s 2 l n r 2 r 1 is used to calculate the k where q is the draining rate m is the thickness of the aquifer r1 r2 are the distance from the draining hole to the peep hole 1 and the peep hole 2 respectively and s1 s2 are the drawdown of the peep hole 1 and the peep hole 2 respectively the sq14 hole is used as the no 1 hole and the other holes are used as the no 2 hole among the observation holes three sq10 sq11 sq12 are used for the pumping test the positional relationship of the holes is shown in fig 4 2 5 draining test in xialiyuan coal mine xialiyuan coal mine is located 1 km north of xialiyuan village in xiangyangbao township which is in pinglu district of shuozhou city in shanxi province the main mining coal seam of this mine is no 4 and 9 coal seams of taiyuan formation for the two coal seams the sandstone layer for the roof is a sandstone fractured aquifer which is the main aquifer of the mine for water filling the draining test conducted in this mine started at 10 00 on october 23 2013 and ended at 8 00 on october 28 2013 lasting for about 6 days this draining test is divided into two stages in the first stage the draining hole is jx1 the draining rate is 0 44 l s and the drawdown is 56 78 m in the second stage the draining hole is jx2 the draining rate is 0 456 l s and the drawdown is 59 8 m in the process of supplementary hydrogeological exploration a hole dm1 was constructed at ground level for the pumping test the location of those holes is shown in fig 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 data of pumping and draining tests through the draining tests described above the k of the aquifers in the five mining areas selected for study are obtained at the same time the k of the same aquifers from pumping tests are also provided by each mine after these data are collected they are compared and analyzed 3 1 1 data of liuqiao no 2 mine the data in table 1 show that the k of the peep hole are 2 43 9 99 md 1 from the draining test and 0 2 0 31 md 1 from the pumping test this indicates that the k obtained by the two test methods differ by an order of magnitude generally 3 1 2 data of gaojiabao no 1 mining area the k obtained from the pumping test and the draining test are shown in table 2 this table indicates that the k are 0 02716 0 02797 md 1 from the pumping test and 0 358 0 658 md 1 from the draining test and the former is one order of magnitude smaller than the latter 3 1 3 data of 921 mining area of bucun coal mine the parameters obtained from the draining and pumping tests are shown in table 3 this table indicates that the k are 0 0049 0 0976 md 1 from the pumping test and 2 455 6 585 md 1 from the draining test and the former is about 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the latter 3 1 4 data of qidong coal mine it is indicated in table 4 that the k obtained from the draining test are larger than that obtained from the pumping test for the same holes the average value is 1 74 for the former and 0 722 for the latter although the differences exist they are not up to an order of magnitude 3 1 5 data of xialiyuan coal mine the k obtained from the draining and pumping tests in xiayuanyuan coal mine are shown in table 5 this table indicates that the k are 0 046 0 0595 md 1 from the pumping test and 0 0924 0 0977 md 1 from the draining test and the k obtained by the two methods are not much different from the comparison of the k obtained from the pumping and draining tests in the five coal mines it is indicated that the k obtained from the pumping tests are quite different from those from the draining tests in liuqiao no 2 coal mine gaojiabao coal mine and bucun coal mine the differences are even up to two orders of magnitude although there are certain differences between the k from the pumping tests and from the draining tests in qidong coal mine and xialiyuan coal mine they are not up to an order of magnitude therefore it is necessary to analyze and discuss this phenomenon 3 2 discussion 3 2 1 analysis of possible causes for differences in pumping and draining test results k are determined by the void development characteristics of the rock mass itself however the causes for the changes of the calculated k are various including the heterogeneity of the rock mass itself the error of the test itself the error of the calculation etc cheng et al 2019 1 heterogeneity of rock mass itself in the cases listed in the previous sections the luohe formation sandstone of gaojiabao coal mine is a pore fractured aquifer and the water yield property of this aquifer is relatively uniform furthermore the pumping hole t1 in the table is also the peephole for the draining test see fig 2 although the parameters obtained from the two kinds of tests should be within the same range they differ greatly this may not be caused by the heterogeneity of the aquifer itself in qidong coal mine the draining hole is also used as the pumping hole but the k from the two kinds of tests are still different see fig 4 the k from both the pumping test and the draining test should be affected they are affected by the heterogeneity however the data from each mine show that the parameters obtained from the draining test are larger than those from the pumping test therefore the differences in k are not caused by the heterogeneity of the rock mass itself 2 error of test itself in the process of the pumping test all the test factors such as the well loss the presence of peepholes and the number of peepholes affect the accuracy of the parameters obtained from the tests but these only have limited influence and would not cause an error of one order of magnitude zhu et al 2014 the data from xialiyuan coal mine also indicates that the differences between the k from the draining test and from the pumping test are not always of an order of magnitude 3 error of calculation method in the draining test the theis equation or the method of water level recovery is used to obtain the parameters generally because it is difficult to achieve stable flow for the pumping test the dupuit equation is used to obtain the parameters but the theis equation is also used by some researchers no literature has reported that the results obtained by theis equation and dupuit equation have differences up to an order of magnitude 4 scale effect in recent years attention has been paid to the scale effect of the k in the study of groundwater science clauser 1992 halihan et al 2000 galvão et al 2015 király 1975 generally k increase with the increase of the scale but eventually tend to be constant values both the pumping test and the draining test are well scale tests according to the literature zhang 2000 boschan and noetinger 2012 k decrease with the increase of the drawdown because of the scale effect which is obviously opposite to the results from the pumping and draining tests therefore the scale effect cannot be used to explain the differences in the results from the pumping test and the draining test 5 intensity difference in addition to the above factors for errors in the literature where the differences in the k obtained from the pumping test and the draining test are up to an order of magnitude the largest difference lies in the significant difference in the pumping and draining intensity tables 1 3 indicates that the water yield in the draining test is about an order of magnitude larger than that in the pumping test the pumping and draining rate and the hydraulic conductivity in the data of liuqiao no 2 mine shown in table 1 the draining rate is the sum of fs1 fs2 and fs3 are made into a histogram by using excel see fig 6 this figure shows that the two parameters are correlated well the pumping and draining rates in the southern mining area of qidong coal mine and in xialiyuan coal mine have a small difference and thus the difference in the test results is relatively small as shown in tables 4 and 5 in order to further analyze the influence of the pumping or draining rate on the hydraulic conductivity in depth statistical analysis on the data of the five cases is carried out and then the average value of the pumping rates for each mine the average value of the draining rates the average value of the parameters from the pumping and draining tests and their corresponding multiples are obtained see table 6 moreover the correlation diagram is drawn as shown in fig 7 it indicates that the larger the multiple of the draining and pumping rate the larger the multiple of the hydraulic conductivity obtained from the draining and pumping tests and they are linearly correlated after linear fitting the correlation equation is y 0 9727x with a significant coefficient of 0 9353 indicating a positive proportional relationship between the two i e k drain k pump q drain q pump this means that the hydraulic conductivity is proportional to the draining or pumping rate 3 2 2 theoretical analysis of influence of draining and pumping intensity on hydraulic conductivities as mentioned earlier the main cause for the differences in the k obtained from the pumping test and draining tests lies in the difference in the pumping and draining intensity of those tests here a fractured aquifer is taken as an example for theoretical analysis the typical equation for the hydraulic conductivity of a single smooth fissure is as follows zhou and wang 2004 snow 1969 1 k f g b 2 12 v w where g is a constant b is the fissure width v w is the kinematic coefficient of viscosity of water for the entire fissure rock mass the hydraulic conductivity can be expressed as 2 k n g b 2 12 v w however all fissures are not permeable the groundwater in the fissures exists in the form of gravitational water bound water and capillary water etc for the fissure part occupied by bound water and capillary water gravitational water cannot pass freely when certain conditions are not satisfied as shown in fig 8 the space occupied by capillary water and bound water is an ineffective void for the gravitational water movement while the void in which gravitational water can move freely is an effective void the ratio of the effective void volume to the total volume can be expressed by ne even for the fissure that gravitational water can pass all of the fissure space is not flow space and some of the space is occupied by bound water therefore the width of the fissure portion that gravitational water can pass is referred to as effective width expressed by be the permeability of the fissure is determined by the effective width and thus eq 2 can be written as 3 k n e g b e 2 12 v w for capillary water the condition for it to move freely be able to move in the opposite direction to its own capillary force is that the hydraulic gradient of groundwater is greater than the capillary force for bound water it is divided into strongly bound water and weakly bound water generally strongly bound water cannot move the condition for weakly bound water movement is that the hydraulic gradient of groundwater is greater than the binding force of weakly bound water therefore be and ne are not fixed when the hydraulic gradient is increased part of the void occupied by the bound or capillary water is converted into the space that gravitational water can pass freely for this reason as the hydraulic gradient i increases be and ne increase and thus the hydraulic conductivity k increases according to eq 3 according to the statistics earlier from the pumping and draining tests it is found that the draining rate of the draining test is much larger than the pumping rate of the pumping test when the k from the draining test are different by an order of magnitude from those from the pumping test according to darcy s law q kia where q is the flow rate k is the non hydraulic conductivity i is the hydraulic gradient and a is the flow cross section for the pumping well of the confined aquifer the area of the flow cross section is a 2 π r m where r is the distance from the center of the well m is the thickness of the aquifer xue and wu 2014 when r is fixed the area of the flow cross section is a constant when q increases an increase in the hydraulic gradient i is resulted inevitably according to eq 3 the increase of the hydraulic gradient i will cause the hydraulic conductivitys k to increase here the extent to which the hydraulic conductivity k increases because of the increase of the hydraulic gradient i is further discussed according to the relevant literature fan et al 2017 gong et al 2018 there is a fractal feature in the rock mass which also means that the number of small fissures is much larger than the number of large fissures within a certain volume therefore when i increases ne has a large room for increase at the same time the increase of be will lead to the rapid increase of k since k and be have an exponential relationship based on the above it is also possible that the k obtained from the draining tests are an order of magnitude larger than those from the pumping tests for the pore aquifer the situation is a similar to the fractured aquifer which will not be discussed in detail here 3 3 evidence of intensity effects on hydraulic conductivities in water injection test results the intensity effects on k should be ubiquitous but the differences in the pumping intensity in conventional pumping tests are far from those between the intensities of the pumping and draining tests and thus it is difficult to find obvious evidence in pumping test data however the analysis of the data from water injection tests can also prove the intensity effects on sheng 2015 carried out the water injection tests with different water heads for the same boreholes and the resulted data are shown in tables 7 and 8 because the data of the first water injection test number 1 and number 6 may be affected by many factors they are not ignored the other data are plotted as shown in figs 9 and 10 and the law can be seen clearly the higher the water injection head the larger the water injection flow rate and the larger the hydraulic conductivity they are correlated significantly which also proves that the intensity effects have a significant influence on k through the analysis and discussion of the results described above it is found that the differences between the k from the pumping tests and the draining tests are due to the differences between the intensities of the pumping tests and the draining tests therefore the k have intensity effects this means that they are not fixed values under fixed geological conditions but increase as the hydraulic gradient increases this conclusion is of great theoretical significance in hydrogeological research 4 conclusion after the analysis and discussion of the results from the pumping and draining tests above the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the k obtained from the pumping tests are smaller than those from the draining tests for the same aquifer of the same mining area and the differences between the two are up to an order of magnitude in some mines 2 the method of pumping and draining tests the heterogeneity of the aquifer the calculation method for the parameters and the scale effect are not the main causes for the differences in the k obtained from the pumping and draining tests listed in this paper 3 with a fissure rock mass taken as an example it is found that the k mainly depend on the effective fissure rate and the effective fissure width when the pumping or draining intensity increases the hydraulic gradient i increases and thus the effective fissure rate and the effective fissure width increase resulting in an increase in the k this is the main cause for the differences in the k obtained from the pumping and draining tests 4 other data such as water injection test data can also prove that the k have intensity effects declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments we would like to express our gratitude to the managers of the 5 coal mines for

of coal resources ministry of coal industry of china 1980 in this procedure pumping holes pumping equipment observation methods and parameter calculation methods are clearly defined for the draining test confined water flows into the mine along the borehole by itself since the elevation of the hole is below the water level of the aquifer and a certain size of the depression cone is formed in the aquifer after the draining test the hydrogeological parameters of the aquifer can be solved through the relationship between the amount of water drained and the drawdown zheng et al 1998 because the principle task technical requirements and data collation method of the draining test are the same as of the pumping test the draining test is also carried out in the five mining areas according to the requirements of procedure for pumping tests in geological exploration of coal resources ministry of coal industry of china 1980 however in the draining test the changes in water pressure in observed instead of the changes in water level when compared with the corresponding hole in the pumping test the draining hole has a self flowing characteristic and thus most draining tests have the characteristics of large water output and large drawdown in this paper the draining test is carried out in five typical mines and the process is briefly described below 2 1 draining test in liuqiao no 2 mine liuqiao no 2 mine is located in the huaibei mining area of anhui province it is the limestone aquifer of taiyuan formation that affects this mine most the limestone layer of taiyuan formation in this area is about 130 m thick consisting of mudstones siltstones and 13 layer limestones from top to bottom l1 and l2 are folium limestones with a thickness of 2 3 m and a characteristic of weak water bearing and l3 and l4 are limestones with a thickness of 8 12 m on average for the limestone layer fissure caverns are developed which are rich in water and their water yield property is strong the draining test carried out at 600 m underground in south roadway was an unsteady flow draining test with maximum drawdown and well group interference water was drained through the fs1 fs3 holes from 14 30 on december 3 2009 till 15 15 on december 7th 2009 for a total of 96 75 h for the fs1 fs3 holes the draining rate was 20 88 18 25 and 9 26 l s respectively and the drawdown was 322 5 345 68 and 321 3 m respectively as a result the total amount of water drained is about 16685 m3 after draining the water level recovery phase began at 15 15 on december 5 2009 and ended 10 30 on december 9 2009 lasing for 42 25 h in this mine four pumping tests are also conducted on the 1 4 limestones of taiyuan formation through 4 holes 10b1 10b2 10b3 10b4 the location of those holes is shown in fig 1

998 and 15 174 l s respectively and the drawdown is 76 01 125 07 and 180 m respectively after the draining the jt1 and jt2 holes were closed and the water level recovery began which continued from april 3 2015 to april 28 2015 in this mine there is also a pumping hole t1 in the downstream of luohe formation located within the no 1 mining area the location of those holes is shown in fig 2 2 3 draining test in 921 mining area of bucun coal mine bucun coal mine is affiliated to zibo mining group co ltd located in the southern central part of jidong coalfield zhangqiu coalfield what threatens

second stage the draining holes are lxf1 and lxf2 the maximum draining rate is 37 08 l s and the total amount of water drained is 2911 22 m3 in the third stage the draining holes are lxf1 lxf2 and lxf3 the maximum draining rate is 41 56 l s and the total amount of water drained is 8122 6 m3 in the fourth stage all the draining holes were closed and the water level water pressure recovery in the xu limestone was observed simultaneously in the 921 mining area the pumping test was also carried out on the xu limestone the 134 hole and 58 hole are used as pumping holes the location of those holes is shown in fig 3 2 4 draining test in qidong coal mine qidong coal mine is located in the southeast of suzhou city anhui province the quaternary layer above the bedrock of the mine is at about 189 25

test was carried out on the fourth aquifer of the loose layer in the southern mining area of qidong coal mine with the draining holes qf2 constructed along the belt uphill in the no 1 southern mining area among all the holes sq10 sq11 sq12 sq13 and sq14 are the observation holes for the fourth aquifer which are all at the ground level the draining test started on march 15 2014 and ended on march 20 2014 lasting for 5 days for the qf2 hole the draining rate is 13 8 l s and the drawdown is 7 68 m for the observation holes the drawdown is 2 17 3 67 m after the draining test the equation k q 2 π

of xialiyuan village in xiangyangbao township which is in pinglu district of shuozhou city in shanxi province the main mining coal seam of this mine is no 4 and 9 coal seams of taiyuan formation for the two coal seams the sandstone layer for the roof is a sandstone fractured aquifer which is the main aquifer of the mine for water filling the draining test conducted in this mine started at 10 00 on october 23 2013 and ended at 8 00 on october 28 2013 lasting for about 6 days this draining test is divided into two stages in the first stage the draining hole is jx1 the draining rate is 0 44 l s

dm1 was constructed at ground level for the pumping test the location of those holes is shown in fig 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 data of pumping and draining tests through the draining tests described above the k of the aquifers in the five mining areas selected for study are obtained at the same time the k of the same aquifers from pumping tests are also provided by each mine after these data are collected they are compared and analyzed 3 1 1 data of liuqiao no 2 mine the data in table 1 show that the k of the peep hole are 2 43 9 99 md 1 from the draining test and 0 2 0 31 md 1 from the pumping test this indicates that the k obtained by the two test methods differ by an order of magnitude generally 3 1 2 data of gaojiabao no 1 mining area the k obtained from the pumping test and the draining test are shown in table 2 this table indicates that the k are 0 02716 0 02797 md 1 from the pumping test and 0 358 0 658 md 1 from the draining test and the former is one order of magnitude smaller than the latter 3 1 3 data of 921 mining area of bucun coal mine the parameters obtained from the draining and pumping tests are shown in table 3 this table indicates that the k are 0 0049 0 0976 md 1 from the pumping test and 2 455 6 585 md 1 from the draining test and the former is about 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the latter 3 1 4 data of qidong coal mine it is indicated in table 4 that the k obtained from the draining test are larger than that obtained from the pumping test for the same holes the average value is 1 74 for the former and 0 722 for the latter although the differences exist they are not up to an order of magnitude 3 1 5 data of xialiyuan coal mine the k obtained from the draining and pumping tests in xiayuanyuan coal mine are shown in table 5 this table indicates that the k are 0 046 0 0595 md 1 from the pumping test and 0 0924 0 0977 md 1 from the draining test and the k obtained by the two methods are not much different from the comparison of the k obtained from the pumping and draining tests in the five coal mines it is indicated that the k obtained from the pumping tests are quite different from those from the draining tests in liuqiao no 2 coal mine gaojiabao coal mine and bucun coal mine the differences are even up to two orders of magnitude although there are certain differences between the k from the pumping tests and from the draining tests in qidong coal mine and xialiyuan coal mine they are not up to an order of magnitude therefore it is necessary to analyze and discuss this phenomenon 3 2 discussion 3 2 1 analysis of possible causes for differences in pumping and draining test results k are determined by the void development characteristics of the rock mass itself however the causes for the changes of the calculated k are various including the heterogeneity of the rock mass itself the error of the test itself the error of the calculation etc cheng et al 2019 1 heterogeneity of rock mass itself in the cases listed in the previous sections the luohe formation sandstone of gaojiabao coal mine is a pore fractured aquifer and the water yield property of this aquifer is relatively uniform furthermore the pumping hole t1 in the table is also the peephole for the draining test see fig 2 although the parameters obtained from the two kinds of tests should be within the same range they differ greatly this may not be caused by the heterogeneity of the aquifer itself in qidong coal mine the draining hole is also used as the pumping hole but the k from the two kinds of tests are still different see fig 4 the k from both the pumping test and the draining test should be affected they are affected by the heterogeneity however the data from each mine show that the parameters obtained from the draining test are larger than those from the pumping test therefore the differences in k are not caused by the heterogeneity of the rock mass itself 2 error of test itself in the process of the pumping test all the test factors such as the well loss the presence of peepholes and the number of peepholes affect the accuracy of the parameters obtained from the tests but these only have limited influence and would not cause an error of one order of magnitude zhu et al 2014 the data from xialiyuan coal mine also indicates that the differences between the k from the draining test and from the pumping test are not always of an order of magnitude 3 error of calculation method in the draining test the theis equation or the method of water level recovery is used to obtain the parameters generally because it is difficult to achieve stable flow for the pumping test the dupuit equation is used to obtain the parameters but the theis equation is also used by some researchers no literature has reported that the results obtained by theis equation and dupuit equation have differences up to an order of magnitude 4 scale effect in recent years attention has been paid to the scale effect of the k in the study of groundwater science clauser 1992 halihan et al 2000 galvão et al 2015 király 1975 generally k increase with the increase of the scale but eventually tend to be constant values both the pumping test and the draining test are well scale tests according to the literature zhang 2000 boschan and noetinger 2012 k decrease with the increase of the drawdown because of the scale effect which is obviously opposite to the results from the pumping and draining tests therefore the scale effect cannot be used to explain the differences in the results from the pumping test and the draining test 5 intensity difference in addition to the above factors for errors in the literature where the differences in the k obtained from the pumping test and the draining test are up to an order of magnitude the largest difference lies in the significant difference in the pumping and draining intensity tables 1 3 indicates that the water yield in the draining test is about an order of magnitude larger than that in the pumping test the pumping and draining rate and the hydraulic conductivity in the data of liuqiao no 2 mine shown in table 1 the draining rate is the sum of fs1 fs2 and fs3 are made into a histogram by using excel see fig 6 this figure shows that the two parameters are correlated well the pumping and draining rates in the southern mining area of qidong coal mine and in xialiyuan coal mine have a small difference and thus the difference in the test results is relatively small as shown in tables 4 and 5 in order to further analyze the influence of the pumping or draining rate on the hydraulic conductivity in depth statistical analysis on the data of the five cases is carried out and then the average value of the pumping rates for each mine the average value of the draining rates the average value of the parameters from the pumping and draining tests and their corresponding multiples are obtained see table 6 moreover the correlation diagram is drawn as shown in fig 7 it indicates that the larger the multiple of the draining and pumping rate the larger the multiple of the hydraulic conductivity obtained from the draining and pumping tests and they are linearly correlated after linear fitting the correlation equation is y 0 9727x with a significant coefficient of 0 9353 indicating a positive proportional relationship between the two i e k drain k pump q drain q pump this means that the hydraulic conductivity is proportional to the draining or pumping rate 3 2 2 theoretical analysis of influence of draining and pumping intensity on hydraulic conductivities as mentioned earlier the main cause for the differences in the k obtained from the pumping test and draining tests lies in the difference in the pumping and draining intensity of those tests here a fractured aquifer is taken as an example for theoretical analysis the typical equation for the hydraulic conductivity of a single smooth fissure is as follows zhou and wang 2004 snow 1969 1 k f g b 2 12 v w where g is a constant b is the fissure width v w is the kinematic coefficient of viscosity of water for the entire fissure rock mass the hydraulic conductivity can be expressed as 2 k n g b 2 12 v w however all fissures are not permeable the groundwater in the fissures exists in the form of gravitational water bound water and capillary water etc for the fissure part occupied by bound water and capillary water gravitational water cannot pass freely when certain conditions are not satisfied as shown in fig 8 the space occupied by capillary water and bound water is an ineffective void for the gravitational water movement while the void in which gravitational water can move freely is an effective void the ratio of the effective void volume to the total volume can be expressed by ne even for the fissure that gravitational water can pass all of the fissure space is not flow space and some of the space is occupied by bound water therefore the width of the fissure portion that gravitational water can pass is referred to as effective width expressed by be the permeability of the fissure is determined by the effective width and thus eq 2 can be written as 3 k n e g b e 2 12 v w for capillary water the condition for it to move freely be able to move in the opposite direction to its own capillary force is that the hydraulic gradient of groundwater is greater than the capillary force for bound water it is divided into strongly bound water and weakly bound water generally strongly bound water cannot move the condition for weakly bound water movement is that the hydraulic gradient of groundwater is greater than the binding force of weakly bound water therefore be and ne are not fixed when the hydraulic gradient is increased part of the void occupied by the bound or capillary water is converted into the space that gravitational water can pass freely for this reason as the hydraulic gradient i increases be and ne increase and thus the hydraulic conductivity k increases according to eq 3 according to the statistics earlier from the pumping and draining tests it is found that the draining rate of the draining test is much larger than the pumping rate of the pumping test when the k from the draining test are different by an order of magnitude from those from the pumping test according to darcy s law q kia where q is the flow rate k is the non hydraulic conductivity i is the hydraulic gradient and a is the flow cross section for the pumping well of the confined aquifer the area of the flow cross section is a 2 π r m where r is the distance from the center of the well m is the thickness of the aquifer xue and wu 2014 when r is fixed the area of the flow cross section is a constant when q increases an increase in the hydraulic gradient i is resulted inevitably according to eq 3 the increase of the hydraulic gradient i will cause the hydraulic conductivitys k to increase here the extent to which the hydraulic conductivity k increases because of the increase of the hydraulic gradient i is further discussed according to the relevant literature fan et al 2017 gong et al 2018 there is a fractal feature in the rock mass which also means that the number of small fissures is much larger than the number of large fissures within a certain volume therefore when i increases ne has a large room for increase at the same time the increase of be will lead to the rapid increase of k since k and be have an exponential relationship based on the above it is also possible that the k obtained from the draining tests are an order of magnitude larger than those from the pumping tests for the pore aquifer the situation is a similar to the fractured aquifer which will not be discussed in detail here 3 3 evidence of intensity effects on hydraulic conductivities in water injection test results the intensity effects on k should be ubiquitous but the differences in the pumping intensity in conventional pumping tests are far from those between the intensities of the pumping and draining tests and thus it is difficult to find obvious evidence in pumping test data however the analysis of the data from water injection tests can also prove the intensity effects on sheng 2015 carried out the water injection tests with different water heads for the same boreholes and the resulted data are shown in tables 7 and 8 because the data of the first water injection test number 1 and number 6 may be affected by many factors they are not ignored the other data are plotted as shown in figs 9 and 10 and the law can be seen clearly the higher the water injection head the larger the water injection flow rate and the larger the hydraulic conductivity they are correlated significantly which also proves that the intensity effects have a significant influence on k through the analysis and discussion of the results described above it is found that the differences between the k from the pumping tests and the draining tests are due to the differences between the intensities of the pumping tests and the draining tests therefore the k have intensity effects this means that they are not fixed values under fixed geological conditions but increase as the hydraulic gradient increases this conclusion is of great theoretical significance in hydrogeological research 4 conclusion after the analysis and discussion of the results from the pumping and draining tests above the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the k obtained from the pumping tests are smaller than those from the draining tests for the same aquifer of the same mining area and the differences between the two are up to an order of magnitude in some mines 2 the method of pumping and draining tests the heterogeneity of the aquifer the calculation method for the parameters and the scale effect are not the main causes for the differences in the k obtained from the pumping and draining tests listed in this paper 3 with a fissure rock mass taken as an example it is found that the k mainly depend on the effective fissure rate and the effective fissure width when the pumping or draining intensity increases the hydraulic gradient i increases and thus the effective fissure rate and the effective fissure width increase resulting in an increase in the k this is the main cause for the differences in the k obtained from the pumping and draining tests 4 other data such as water injection test data can also prove that the k have intensity effects declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments we would like to express our gratitude to the managers of the 5 coal mines for
