15795,the success of river habitat restoration relies on accurate assessment proxies however determining how to quantitatively assess the impact of multiple stressors during flood discharge from high dams in riverine ecosystems and where and how to implement more reliable recovery interventions remain challenges here we developed a bottom up mechanistic framework for assessing the effects of total dissolved gas supersaturation tdgs and hydrodynamics on fish habitat quality and applied it to the downstream river reach of the xiangjiaba dam in southwest china the results showed that the available habitat area of river sturgeon was the smallest while chinese sucker had the largest available habitat area among the three target species under all discharge scenarios although the tdgs levels were evenly mixed laterally the habitat suitability index indicated that the suitable habitats were primarily within both sides of the river reach under all scenarios which is contrary to findings based on the traditional tdgs risk assessment model the traditional tdgs risk assessment model overestimates the impact of dams on habitats this divergence reflected the sensitivity of the habitat assessment to fish habitat preferences fish tolerance to tdgs and the biological response of fish under tdgs additionally the priority areas for restoration can be identified by habitat suitability index with lower values we simulated twenty four schemes and found that interventions such as stone groups ecological spur dike water retaining weir and river dredging can enhance habitat suitability for fish species under multiple stressors providing novel insights into where and how to mitigate the impact of tdgs our findings offer a transferable framework for the quantitative evaluation of fish habitat and implementation of restoration management during dam flood discharge periods thus providing a new perspective for biodiversity conservation and habitat restoration in dam regulated rivers with tdgs

stressors data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as the most extensively exploited source of renewable clean energy yang et al 2018 zaniolo et al 2020 hydropower produces great benefits to human social development including flood control hydropower generation navigation and the supply of reliable and affordable water hossain et al 2010 nevertheless in recent decades it has increasingly been recognized that hydropower operations may drastically alter river flow regimes watz et al 2022 these alterations have been proven to be a main determinant of river habitat quality barbarossa et al 2020 chen and olden 2017 thus posing significant challenges with respect to the conservation of freshwater biodiversity and fish habitat barbarossa et al 2021 a common theme in the analysis of these challenges and their possible solutions is that more attention should be given to the interactions among multiple stressors when assessing habitat quality and developing effective remediation activities arrigo et al 2020 liao et al 2018 vörösmarty et al 2010 however in the context of multiple stressors accurately assessing habitat quality and improving the resistance of river ecosystems to further deterioration are challenging tasks thomas et al 2016 a shift in freshwater fish cohort strength which is highly sensitive to almost all kinds of stresses can be employed as an effective indicator of the response to multiple stressors in river ecosystems zhao et al 2018 scientists have recognized that flow stressor is an important filter that is essential for shaping community structures by adjusting flow velocity and water depth in local areas damiani et al 2019 however fish would also experience another major challenge when dams release floods as the spill of dams can cause total dissolved gas supersaturation tdgs in rivers weitkamp and katz 1980 which may cause fish to suffer from gas bubble disease and even result in mortality in severe cases shen et al 2016 wang et al 2015 for example over 40 tons of fish downstream of the xiluodu dam located in the yangtze river died due to tdgs during the dam flood discharge period in 2014 cctv 2014 although research on tdgs topics has achieved significant advances assessments of the impacts of tdgs and implementation of restoration management still face the following major challenges 1 the need of improving the capacity to correctly evaluate the habitat quality and distribution for a success of river restoration algera et al 2022 and 2 the lack of a standardized protocol for determining where and how to conduct restoration management to protect biodiversity pander et al 2019 targeted efforts have been made to address the above challenges for instance assessment models based on a single tdgs stressor to evaluate the impact of tdgs on fish habitat were developed and applied to the lancang river and jinsha river china ma et al 2016 wan et al 2020 fish refuges could also be identified based on single tdgs concentrations during high dam flood discharge periods shen et al 2016 2019 however the tdgs stressor occurs simultaneously with a hydrodynamic stressor when high dams discharge flood a number of studies have demonstrated that complex interactions existed between hydrodynamic e g water depth and velocity and tdgs stressors fabris et al 2017 feng et al 2014 heggberget 1984 pleizier et al 2020a schiewe 1974 usually multiple stressors act simultaneously potentially increasing the intensity and range of ecological impacts european environment agency 2021 ormerod et al 2010 endeavours failing to consider the interactions may cause deviations in habitat assessments during flood discharge schinegger et al 2016 thus leading to the implementation of inappropriate interventions that are anticipated to have cascading deviant effects on ecological processes in riverine ecosystems olden and naiman 2010 until recently it still lacks robust attempts to integrate the interactions between tdgs and hydrodynamic stressors to evaluate their impact on fish habitat reservoir managers therefore still lack clear guidance regarding the quantitative effects of interactions between tdgs and hydrodynamic stressors on fish habitat and the development of effective river restoration plans effective management to conserve habitats is highly dependent on the ability to assess habitat status jung et al 2021 an increasingly popular approach for assessing fish habitats in water resource management is the habitat suitability model which closely integrates the hydraulic processes in river habitats and the preferred hydraulic conditions of target fish such as water depth velocity and substrate also referred to as the suitability index si bovee 1986 liu et al 2011 to quantitatively evaluate the influence of hydropower on fish habitats and the effect of river restoration niayifar et al 2018 despite the relative ease of applying water velocity water depth and substrate to habitat suitability models these stressors are considered independently and have no interactions between each other making these models less suitable for use in scenarios where there are interactions among multiple stressors to the best of our knowledge frameworks to assess fish habitat that link the interactions between tdgs and hydrodynamic stressors are still lacking at present thus integration of existing knowledge is needed to fill this gap habitat suitability models based on the si have the advantage of considering biological aspects compared to traditional tdgs risk assessment models which raises the question of whether it would be possible to improve the current habitat suitability models to link available knowledge concerning the interactions between tdgs and hydrodynamic stressors to support a more comprehensive assessment of fish habitat during high dam flood discharge periods developing interventions to reverse the trend of habitat degradation is a decisive step in habitat conservation theodoropoulos et al 2020 despite advances in mitigating the negative effect of tdgs single stressor abatement approaches focusing on tdgs stressor remain common spears et al 2021 for instance chen et al 2022 proposed a method to utilize the confluence at which low tdg water joins dam affected supersaturated tdg water for temporary tdgs mitigation and fish refuge creation li et al 2013 proposed measures to enhance the intensity of turbulence to accelerate tdg dissipation wan et al 2020 explored the optimal power generation schemes for expanding fish shelter areas at low tdg levels however single stressor mitigation approaches may be ineffective or fail when multiple stressors interact spears et al 2021 interventions proposed for a single stressor may cause a reduction in the tdgs stressor intensity in some areas but unintentionally undermine the effectiveness of habitat restoration under hydrodynamic stressor conditions such as fish not being able to access and survive in these areas due to velocity barriers liao et al 2022 thompson et al 2017 the current approaches for mitigating tdgs neglect the multiple stressor interactions potentially leading to ineffective recovery there is an urgent need to integrate the interactions between tdgs and hydrodynamic stressors and to develop practical restoration measures to support the effective management of ecosystems habitat restoration with in stream ecological engineering measures could offer opportunities because local hydraulic habitats can be adjusted zhang et al 2021 and the tdgs environment may be improved qing et al 2021 thus this raises the question of whether in stream ecological engineering measures are suitable for mitigating the negative impacts of tdgs in multiple stressor scenarios here we present a robust and transferable framework for habitat assessment during high dam flood discharge to enhance the probability of success of habitat creation and restoration the specific objectives of this study are to 1 link fish s physical habitat preferences and behavioral responses to tdgs to propose new metrics for habitat assessment by integrating the interactive effects of tdgs and hydrodynamic stressors 2 illustrate how important the interactions between hydrodynamics and tdgs are to fish habitat assessments by comparing the divergence of preferred habitats projected from traditional risk assessment models rams and the new framework 3 answer the questions of where and how to implement restoration interventions by using new ecological indicators and 4 explore whether ecological engineering measures can achieve positive effects for fish species in cases with multiple stressors by a series of restoration scenarios providing a new perspective for mitigating the negative impacts of tdgs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the jinsha river is the headwater of the yangtze river in china and has a total length of 3 464 km a rich variety of freshwater fishes inhabit the lower jinsha river which is an important supplemental channel for fish recruitment to the yangtze river zhang et al 2018 the xiangjiaba xjb dam 28 38 28 26 n 104 23 44 50 e with a height of 162 00 m a normal water level of 380 00 m above sea level and a total storage capacity of 5 163 billion m3 is the last cascade hydropower station on the jinsha river the average annual flow at the dam site is 4570 m3 s the largest aquatic reserve in china namely the national nature reserve of rare and endemic fish was established downstream of the xjb dam to protect various fish in this region there are two tributaries in the river reach namely hengjiang river and minjiang river which are located approximately 3 5 km and 32 km downstream of the dam with average annual flows of 294 m3 s and 2830 m3 s respectively in this study the river reach from the xjb dam to the outlet of the jinsha river with a length of 32 km was chosen as the study area fig 1 this reach was selected because it has a high tdgs risk during periods of flood discharge from the xjb dam and is of high concern to the chinese government in contrast long term field monitoring has shown that tdgs concentrations decreased significantly after the minjiang river converged with the mainstem and no fish mortality were observed indicating that the risk of tdgs downstream of the study reach is low 2 2 target fish due to the influence of multiple pressures induced by hydropower stations on the lower jinsha river the populations of river sturgeon acipenser dabryanusm and chinese sucker myxocyprinus asiaticus which have greatly declined in recent years zhuang et al 1997 they are both listed on the china red list of species as endangered species and on the international union for conservation of nature s red list of threatened species as critically endangered species and vulnerable species respectively additionally these two benthic species are legally protected in china and classified as national top level and second class protected animals respectively zhou et al 2020 silver carp hypophthalmichthys molitrix one of the four major chinese carp species is an economically important endemic and representative pelagic fish emerging data from many years of field sampling have shown that the resources for this species have greatly declined in the study reach cao et al 2007 the xjb dam generally discharges flood from july to september during which time juveniles of these fish conduct foraging and fattening activities in this study river reach and they thus face the potential threat of tdgs wan et al 2021 wei 2012 therefore we selected juveniles of chinese sucker river sturgeon and silver carp as the target fish for assessment and protection in this study 2 3 assessment framework coupling hydrodynamics and tdgs during flood discharge periods the framework presented in this paper is built on existing knowledge concerning environmental flow management the effects of tdgs on fish and the ecohydrology literature the mechanistic framework can be conceptualized as the integration of a hydrodynamic model a tdgs generation model a tdgs transport model and a fish habitat assessment model the diagram in fig 2 a outlines the major methodology of habitat assessment in high dam flood discharge systems which can be summarized as follows 1 establishing a tdgs generation model to predict the tdgs level based on external forcing data obtained by the release discharge schemes of river management 2 developing a depth averaged 2d hydrodynamic model to predict the flow field 3 embedding the tdgs prediction model into the depth averaged 2d hydrodynamic model and tdgs transport model to predict the distribution of tdgs 4 obtaining the tolerances avoidance characteristics and swimming performance of fish in the tdg supersaturated water from laboratory field experiments or online datasets 5 linking the response of fish to tdgs to fish physical habitat preferences by the coupling dynamically adjustable habitat suitability index da hsi model 6 coupling tdgs generation 2d hydrodynamics 2d tdgs transport and da hsi models to establish a habitat evaluation model 7 applying the habitat evaluation model to quantitatively assess fish habitat quality 2 3 1 hydrodynamic model in this study a depth averaged 2d mathematical model for the study river reach was established based on mike 21 with unstructured triangular computational grids to calculate the hydrodynamics and evaluate fish habitats detailed information on the hydrodynamic model is described in appendix a detailed channel topography surveys of the bed elevations in 2018 at this study river reach were measured using a real time kinematic rtk gps system consisting of a mobile mapper 10 gis gps receiver and a spectra precision sp60 gnss receiver trimble inc usa a total of 43 013 geometric data points based on the 1985 chinese national height datum were obtained over the reach the study river reach was discretized into 49 564 flexible computational elements in the horizontal plane with local mesh refinements around hydraulic structures and tributary mouths the time step of the model was specified as a constant of 60 s to ensure a stable and quick run time upstream and downstream boundary conditions were given as measured inflows and water levels respectively the hydrodynamic model was calibrated by adjusting manning s coefficient values representing resistance due to bed roughness for the reach these values were initially assigned with a homogeneous roughness across the entire reach based on literature values and the values were then adjusted in local areas to obtain a good match between the simulated and observed results in addition the root mean square error rmse and relative rmse rrmse were introduced to evaluate all the model results the field velocity data were obtained with a propeller current meter ls25 3a xiangruide china for which the measurement range of velocity was 0 04 10 0 m s with an accuracy of 0 01 m s this device was deployed in the site of the xjb hydrometric station downstream of the dam s1 and in the site 31 km downstream of the dam s2 fig 1 depth averaged velocities were measured by taking measurements at 0 6 times the total water depth from the water surface thirty six velocities in the s1 site were obtained from january to august 2017 and 15 velocities in the s2 site were obtained from july to august 2020 in addition we collected 5 velocities in the section 10 km downstream of the dam s3 on may 30 2019 from the china three gorges corporation fig 1 furthermore water level data from january 1 to december 31 2016 were obtained in the s1 site and at sankuaishi hydrometric station s4 puan hydrometric station s5 and daxuetan hydrometric station s6 using an rtk gps unit with an accuracy of 0 02 m fig 1 the validation results for the hydrodynamic values including velocity and water level are illustrated in fig a1 after calibration the manning s coefficient values ranged from 0 023 to 0 045 in the validated model the rmse and rrmse between simulated and monitored velocity values in the sites of s1 s2 and s3 were 0 08 m s and 2 55 0 10 m s and 7 97 and 0 03 m s and 3 65 respectively indicating that the model was accurate and highly reliable liao et al 2022 tang et al 2018 in addition the rmse and rrmse between simulated and monitored water levels in the sites of s1 s4 s5 and s6 were 0 25 m and 2 62 0 22 m and 2 02 0 20 m and 1 91 and 0 11 m and 1 17 respectively the overall trend of the simulated water level was basically the same as that for the measured water level therefore the established hydrodynamic model displayed good calculation accuracy and could be used for subsequent research 2 3 2 tdgs generation prediction model in this study the tdgs downstream of the xjb dam during the spilling process was calculated based on the tdgs generation model developed by ma et al 2016 tdgs observations in the study area were obtained in 2014 and 2020 the tdgs levels were recorded at eight sites fig 1 along the reach on september 3 and 4 2014 including the dam front within the xjb reservoir 1 left tailwater 2 right tailwater 3 spill 4 xjb hydrometric station 5 right bank flood protection embankment 6 jinsha river bridge 7 and rainbow bridge 8 using point four tgp portable trackers point four systems inc canada for these trackers the measurement range of tdgs was 0 200 with an accuracy of 2 daily monitoring at the four sites including the right bank 2 km downstream of the xjb dam 9 the left bank 1 km upstream of the end of the study river reach 10 the middle point 1 km upstream of the end of the study river reach 11 and the right bank 1 km upstream of the end of the study river reach 12 was conducted for 34 days from july to august 2020 moreover the flood discharge data and operation scheduling of flood discharge facilities were from the operational conditions of xjb reservoir verification of the tdgs generation model was performed by utilizing field measurement data the parameters used in tdgs generation calculations for xjb reservoir are shown in table a1 the predicted tdgs at the spill site 4 was 142 1 with an absolute error of 0 3 compared with field observations this finding indicated that the model predicted tdgs generation values were in accordance with the observed data and were suitable for use in the xjb reservoir simulations 2 3 3 tdgs transport model in this study a depth averaged two dimensional model for tdgs transport and dissipation processes was developed to predict the tdgs distribution downstream of xjb reservoir details are given in appendix a the model was validated with tdgs level measurements obtained at sites 5 to 12 the upstream boundary conditions were set based on the measured tdgs and discharge at the left tailwater right tailwater and spill locations the downstream boundary conditions were set based on the measured water level and tdgs level using a neumann boundary condition the simulated values of the tdgs were compared with the observed data fig a2 after repeated adjustment the adopted value of ϕ g which is a coefficient in the tdgs transport model that considers the effects of molecular and turbulent diffusion and influences the tdgs dissipation rate was calibrated as 1 42 10 8 s the rmse value for tdgs during the field observation period in 2014 was 0 05 and the rrmse was 1 57 the rmse and rrmse for tdgs at sites of 9 10 11 and 12 in 2020 were 0 81 and 6 78 0 89 and 5 02 0 49 and 8 99 and 1 02 and 5 60 respectively these finding suggested that the tdgs levels obtained by the mathematical model agreed well with the real levels 2 3 4 dynamically adjusted habitat suitability index model fish habitat preferences are often assessed using si curves for flow velocity water depth and substrate composition developed following the approach of bovee 1986 the si values for a single factor are described as a continuous suitability curve ranging from 0 indicating that the factors negatively affect fish habitat to 1 indicating that they are highly suitable for fish life remarkably the above si variables are considered independent and unchanged for assessments however the interactive effects of environmental variables are present in river ecosystems with tdgs stressor as shown in fig 2b the tolerance of specific fish to tdgs is affected by their vertical avoidance ability to tdgs and the water depth provided by the local region the preferred velocity of fish is related to swimming performance which in turn is influenced by tdgs schiewe 1974 the dissipation of tdgs is simultaneously influenced by water depth and velocity the interactive effects of environmental variables were taken into consideration in this study when evaluating fish habitat quality in tdgs rivers a new dynamically adjusted hsi model based on improved si curves considering the interactions of tdgs and hydrodynamic stressors was thus proposed to quantify the changes in habitat availability for freshwater fish species during the flood season 2 3 4 1 si curve model the tolerance of fish to tdgs is often described by the median lethal time lt50 which refers to the time when fish mortality reaches 50 at a specific tdgs level pleizier et al 2020a a longer lt50 at a specific tdgs level indicates that fish have a stronger tolerance and thus have a higher suitability for tdgs the si value at a tdgs level is defined as 1 when no mortality for fish occurs the suitability distribution of the tdgs level with lethal effects can be transformed into a standardized number based on the relationship between the lt50 of fish and the tdgs level if there were multiple target fish in the same study area the tdgs suitability curves of the specific target fish could be calculated based on their lt50 curves first silver carp was determined to be the fish with the strongest tolerance to tdgs among the three target fish according to their lt50 curves cao et al 2016a cao et al 2016b song et al 2018 second the virtual lt50 value corresponding to the maximum nonlethal tdgs level for silver carp with an si value of 1 was calculated according to the obtained lt50 curve finally the si values of different fish at different lethal tdgs levels were obtained by dividing the lt50 of specific fish at different tdgs levels by the virtual lt50 the si curves of the target fish were calculated as shown in fig 2c 2 3 4 2 dynamically adjustable si curve model there is evidence that fish in tdgs waters exhibit depth compensation behaviors that can alleviate gas bubble disease as depth increases heggberget 1984 shrimpton et al 1990 the distribution of river water depth can to some extent influence the impact of tdgs on fish the safety compensation depth is a functional measure that can be used in fish protection assessments below this depth the impact of tdgs on fish will shift from a suitability below 1 to a suitability equal to 1 the safety compensation depth can be estimated with the compensation depth equation developed by pleizier et al 2020b to determine whether the compensation depth strategy can be used by different species to eliminate the biological effects of tdgs experiments can be performed or online datasets can be applied wang et al 2020 based on the studies of cao et al 2016a and 2016b chinese sucker and silver carp have the ability to exploit depth compensation to avoid the threat of tdgs the vertical avoidance ability of river sturgeon in tdgs water was examined in this study according to the instructions of wang et al 2015 and the results showed that river sturgeon could use a compensation depth strategy to avoid the threat of tdgs appendix b benefiting from the compensation depth the si value for tolerance will change during the evaluation specifically the adjustment of compensation depth in local regions of river is fed back to the tdgs level and then to the si curve of tolerance thus new si values of tolerance for target fish can be determined after the adjustment of compensation depth in local areas the swimming capabilities of fish are closely related to their evasive capabilities foraging behaviors and reproduction behaviors webb 1984 juvenile fish are particularly sensitive to water velocity which can be an important control for both fish growth and fish mortality fabris et al 2019 the critical swimming speed v c is a special category of prolonged swimming above which fish cannot hold stations or effectively feed or utilized habitat v c thus provides an objective index of whether a patch of habitat is likely to be useable for juvenile fish fabris et al 2017 it follows that si values equal to 1 contribute to fish survival when the water velocity is below v c whereas the si has a value of 0 when the water velocity is above v c it has been recognized that tdgs may contribute to swimming performance loss in fish species schiewe 1974 which reduces the ability of fish to use certain habitats and in turn influences the si of water velocity in river sections specifically the adjustment of tdgs in local areas is fed back to v c of fish and then to the si of v c after changes in tdgs in the entire river the new si values of v c for target fish in the study reach can be regulated the v c of specific fish can be determined from the relationship curve linking v c and tdgs levels which are available in the published literature or could be obtained from experiments a curve that described the relationship between the v c of the chinese sucker and the tdgs level was reported by wang et al 2018 while ji 2020 found that the v c of silver carp during the flood season was not affected by different tdgs levels in addition the v c of river sturgeon was tested in this study according to the instructions of wang et al 2018 and the results showed that the v c of river sturgeon was not affected by different tdgs levels appendix b 2 3 4 3 hsi model with dynamical adjustment the h s i in the flood discharge period is a function of four life requisite components water depth velocity substrate and tdgs in this study and was calculated eq 1 as a combined si by utilizing the geometric mean yi et al 2017 which provides a more conservative estimate of habitat suitability by allowing the h s i to approach zero if any of the si values incorporated in the geometric mean are zero 1 h s i s i v s i s s i t d g 1 3 where s i t d g is the si value of the tolerance of fish at which the compensation depth is considered unless the target fish cannot exploit the compensation depth strategy and s i v and s i s are the suitability of the flow velocity and substrate respectively in the tdgs environment previous studies tested hsi criteria by comparing predicted habitat quality patches with survey results and showed that most of the investigated suitable habitats were located in areas with hsi 0 8 indicating that hsi 0 8 can be used as an evaluation criterion for suitable habitat carnie et al 2015 muñoz mas et al 2012 reeder et al 2021 storch 2002 tang et al 2021 therefore suitable habitat in this study was defined as habitats with hsi 0 8 2 3 5 fish habitat assessment model coupled with the tdgs stressor in this study the concept of weighted usable area w u a bovee 1986 which is calculated by multiplying the hsi value of each computational grid by the relevant element area and aggregating all values for the entire study reach was introduced to characterize the habitat quality w u a represents the area of available habitat in a river reach in a given discharge scenario and a larger w u a value indicates better habitat quality in this study the w u a of target fish under tdgs and flow stressors was proposed to assess habitat quality eq 2 2 w u a i 1 n h s i i a i where i represents the order number of grids h s i i is the h s i value of grid i n is the total number of model grids within the wetted area of the river and a i is the area for grid i in the established 2d hydrodynamic model m2 2 4 scenario design and habitat quality evaluation 2 4 1 scenario design in this study two flood discharge scenarios with a 2 year flood of 16800 m3 s t1 and a 5 year flood of 21800 m3 s t2 were selected to assess the fish habitat quality during the flood discharge period the t1 scenario represents the flow discharged at the normal discharge frequency which often occurs during the xjb dam flood discharge period assessing t1 can provide insight into the common state of fish habitat in the study river reach during flood discharge period the t2 scenario represents the flow discharged at the extreme frequency and assessing t2 can aid in understanding the extreme impact of flood discharge from the xjb dam on fish habitat in the study river reach the tdgs events under both scenarios and their effects are of great concern to the river managers in total 6 habitat evaluation scenarios 2 flood discharge simulations 3 fish species are presented in this study 2 4 2 rate of habitat quality change and contributions of stressors to habitat quality change to better understand how much habitat quality relies on the interactions between hydrodynamic and tdgs stressors we explored the changes in habitat quality and habitat spatial distribution between different discharge scenarios and identified the main factors that drive changes in habitat quality when intensity of stressors changes we quantified the change in habitat quality under different scenarios using the rate of habitat quality change defined as shown in eq 3 and h s i spatial change h s i under t 2 h s i under t 1 which were calculated for each target fish 3 habitat quality change rate wu a t 2 wu a t 1 wu a t 1 100 where w u a t 1 is the habitat quality in the t1 scenario and w u a t 2 is the habitat quality in the t2 scenario we calculated the contributions of tdgs to habitat quality changes using the rate of change in wua between scenarios t1 and t2 that was calculated based on a fixed water velocity of scenario t1 eq 4 a similar method was also used to illustrate the contributions of water velocity to habitat quality changes namely the rate of change in wua between scenarios t1 and t2 was calculated based on a fixed tdgs level of scenario t1 eq 5 4 tdgs contribution wu a t 2 with velocity under t 1 wu a t 1 wu a t 1 100 5 velocity contribution wu a t 2 with tdgs under t 1 wu a t 1 wu a t 1 100 where wu a t 2 with velocity under t 1 represents the habitat quality in the t2 scenario based on the velocity in the t1 scenario and wu a t 2 with tdgs under t 1 represents the habitat quality in the t2 scenario based on the tdgs level in the t1 scenario 2 4 3 rams calculations the traditional rams only use the tdgs level to determine the suitable habitat and areas where the tdgs level is below 120 is treated as safe for fish species in the yangtze river basin ma et al 2016 wan et al 2020 based on the traditional rams we identified the areas with tdgs levels below 120 for chinese sucker and silver carp and below 110 for river sturgeon under two scenarios and compared the results with the suitable habitat areas obtained based on the new framework to illustrate the divergence between the traditional rams and the new framework 2 5 examination of restoration effectiveness restoration interventions were designed to focus on candidate sites with unfavorable survival conditions considering biological behavior responses and typical techniques for enhancing fish habitats based on the results of predictive ecological models were introduced to test whether restoration led to ecological benefits in cases with multiple stressors the proposed habitat restoration interventions are listed in table a2 habitat restoration effectiveness was quantified as the reduction in the potential extinction region due to multiple stressors following the implementation of interventions for restoration restoration effectiveness was calculated based on the difference in w u a between the base model scenario without restoration and the habitat restoration schemes with restoration in each scenario this calculation was defined as follows 6 restoration effectiveness wu a ti with restoration wu a ti without restoration wu a ti without restoration 100 where w u a t i with restoration represents the habitat quality in the ti scenario with habitat restoration where i 1 and 2 and w u a t i without restoration represents the habitat quality in the ti scenario without habitat restoration a positive change indicates positive restoration effectiveness while a negative change indicates negative restoration effectiveness 3 results 3 1 distribution of the tdgs level and hydrodynamics downstream of the xjb dam and verification of the habitat assessment model the tdgs levels at the xjb dam generated by spill discharge were 156 and 162 in the t1 and t2 scenarios respectively fig 3 a compares the spatial changes in the tdgs levels under the t1 scenario and t2 scenario benefitting from the tailwater discharged from the powerhouse 7144 m3 s and the hengjiang river 394 m3 s rapid tdgs mixing processes occurred two times along the river reach in each discharge scenario the cross sections in which the tdgs mixed completely the difference between the maximum concentration and minimum concentration in the section was less than 2 occurred for the first time were located 2 67 km downstream of the dam and 2 76 km downstream of the dam in the t1 scenario and t2 scenario respectively where the average tdgs levels were 131 8 and 141 3 respectively the cross section where complete tdgs mixing occurred for the second time was located 3 0 km downstream of the confluence of the hengjiang river and 3 4 km downstream of the confluence of the hengjiang river in the t1 scenario and t2 scenario respectively with average values of 131 3 and 140 5 respectively the tdgs level progressively decreased as the longitudinal river distance increased the average value of the tdgs level at the outlet section decreased to 129 9 for the t1 scenario and 139 1 for the t2 scenario illustrating that the dissipation rate of tdgs is extremely low in this reach fig 3b and c present the simulation results of velocity and water depth for each scenario in t1 the flow velocity ranged from 0 20 m s to 14 78 m s with an average value of 2 06 m s and the water depth ranged from 0 21 m to 27 33 m with an average value of 14 25 m compared to t1 due to increased discharge from flood discharge orifices the flow velocity in t2 increased to the range of 0 31 m s to 15 40 m s with an average value of 2 06 m s and the water depth ranged from 0 32 m to 28 54 m with an average value of 15 80 m the performance of the habitat assessment model with coupled tdgs and hydrodynamic stressors was tested by comparing the predicted patches of habitat suitability with the fish preferred habitat locations surveyed during the flood discharge season by wei 2012 and meng et al 2019 along the study reach and the in situ observations conducted by cao et al 2017 and xue et al 2019 as shown in fig 3d the preferred locations of target fish species were within the model simulated high quality patch areas where most h s i values were larger than 0 8 this result was consistent with the results of the field investigations meng et al 2019 wei 2012 in addition no fish died due to the effect of gas bubble disease at the site 24 km downstream of the xjb dam with tdgs of 128 and water depth of 3 m cao et al 2017 xue et al 2019 compared with the prediction from our habitat assessment model it is found that this site was located in an area with an hsi greater than 0 8 these results suggest that our habitat assessment model accurately predicts the available habitat distribution for all the target fish species during the flood discharge season 3 2 divergence between the wua based and ram based assessments spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of fish habitat suitability obtained from the w u a based model is presented in fig 4 but similar results for the h s i distribution of different fish species were obtained for both discharge scenarios fig 4 regions with high values of h s i were primarily observed within both sides of the river reach under all scenarios these locations include tailwater areas where the flow was discharged from powerhouses river bend rb 1 the confluence of the hengjiang river rb 2 rb 3 and rb 4 each of these regions displayed h s i values higher than 0 8 throughout most of their domain indicating that they were conducive to fish survival other regions also had high h s i values but were relatively small and fragmented overall these regions can provide temporary shelter for fish while the central area of the whole river is not suitable for fish survival the habitat quality for different target fish changed with different flood discharge scenarios specifically the habitat quality of chinese sucker was the best in both habitat evaluation schemes with w u a values of 1 05 106 m2 and 8 92 105 m2 for the t1 scenario and t2 scenario respectively river sturgeon exhibited the poorest habitat quality under all assessment scenarios with a w u a value of 8 36 105 m2 in the t1 scenario and a w u a value of 7 30 105 m2 in the t2 scenario as water discharge increased from t1 to t2 the available habitat in the river reach for all target fish species decreased indicating that the fish survival threat increased with increasing stressor intensity however under the same hydrodynamic and tdgs transport models the available habitat outputs based on the traditional ram ma et al 2016 wan et al 2020 were smaller than those based on the w u a based model with area reductions of 45 83 and 45 60 for chinese sucker 45 08 and 45 58 for river sturgeon and 40 70 and 43 28 for silver carp under the t1 scenario and t2 scenario respectively compared to that obtained with the w u a based model the spatial distribution of available habitats estimated with the ram decreased in both sides of the river reach especially in rb 2 rb 3 and rb 4 and increased in tailwater areas in addition the discrepancies in the habitat qualities and spatial habitat distributions for chinese sucker and silver carp were explicitly captured by the w u a based model even though the maximum nonlethal tdgs levels were the same however the rams could not identify this key information and showed that the habitat qualities and spatial distributions are the same for both species fig 4b accordingly w u a defined available habitat expands but also contracts in some regions for example tailwater areas compared to that from ram 3 3 change rate of habitat quality and distribution the lowest rate of w u a change between scenario t1 and scenario t2 was detected for silver carp in all target fish with a value of 11 2 while the highest rate of w u a change was 15 4 for chinese sucker suggesting that chinese sucker is more sensitive to multiple stressors than the two other species the differences in the h s i values of the three target fish species under the two scenarios are presented in fig 5 intriguingly although the overall habitat quality of the three fish species decreased the habitat suitability in some regions of the river reach increased that mainly includes both sides of the river reach except for rbs 2 3 and 4 overall the benefits derived from the areas of increased h s i cannot offset the negative impact of the decreases in h s i in other areas thereby causing a decrease in the total habitat quality values of the river for all target fish specifically the largest w u a corresponding to the regions with an h s i increase occurred in the habitat of silver carp with an increase of 16 45 followed by the habitat of chinese sucker with an increase of 13 35 and river sturgeon with an increase of 13 3 the largest w u a corresponding to regions with decreased h s i occurred in the habitat of chinese sucker with a decrease of 28 77 followed by the habitat of silver carp with a decrease of 27 65 and river sturgeon habitat with the smallest decrease of 25 92 3 4 drivers of changes in habitat quality the contributions of velocity and tdgs to the projected w u a variations between the two scenarios were quantified by controlling the variation in a single stressor intensity projections for the control simulations showed that the contributions of velocity eq 5 to w u a change were 12 91 7 67 and 8 00 for chinese sucker river sturgeon and silver carp respectively while the contributions of tdgs eq 4 to w u a change were 1 79 1 59 and 1 81 for chinese sucker river sturgeon and silver carp respectively this result indicated that an increase in flow velocity dominated the decrease in tdgs to result in a degradation of habitat quality for the three target fish fig 6 a however available habitats supported by tdgs still increased slightly on both sides of the river reach due to an increase in the compensation depth as a result of high flow fig 6b this result is contrary to that obtained with the ram i e the greater the intensity of the tdgs stressor is the less suitable a habitat is for fish 3 5 examination of the ecological effectiveness of river restoration the hsi maps can spatially and explicitly illustrate fish survival based on the habitat characteristics at different locations a low suitability area is a potential candidate location for restoration according to the tdgs suitability results velocity suitability results and hsi maps in the t1 and t2 scenarios for all three target fish species restoration scenarios were designed to address unfavorable tdgs and hydrodynamic conditions the tdgs suitability of the study river reach was low on both sides of the river in both scenarios due to insufficient compensation water depths and low velocity suitability was observed since the velocities in some areas on both sides of the river were large habitat restoration schemes of river dredging rs1 water retaining weir rs2 stone groups rs3 and ecological spur dike rs4 were designed to improve the hsi of these areas as shown in fig 7 a river dredging rs1 was employed 25 6 km downstream of the dam with a dredging depth of 1 m the dredging area was located on the left bank and was 1000 m long and 90 m wide this process decreased the current speed and increased the water depth to reduce the impact of tdgs a water retaining weir rs2 the unilateral width of the weir crest ww was 75 m with large pebbles was constructed 24 7 km downstream of the dam to increase the water depth and decrease the water velocity on both sides of the section to create available habitat the unilateral width of the weir crest ww was 75 m stone groups rs3 were placed on the riverbed of the left river bank 16 0 km downstream of the dam to decrease the flow velocity and to generate an appropriate flow depth behind the stones for fish inhabitants to avoid tdgs damage stones with a diameter of 17 5 m were staggered by 4 in the horizontal direction and 9 in the longitudinal direction the horizontal and longitudinal distances between each stone were 15 m and 16 m respectively an ecological spur dike rs4 was established 17 6 km downstream of the dam to create suitable velocity habitats with sufficient compensation depths for all target fish species the angle between the dam axis and the flow direction was 90 the dike crest elevation was higher than the water surface and the height of the spur dike was 17 5 m in total 24 habitat simulations were applied to ultimately predict the habitat suitability at each node of the computational mesh of the study area for each habitat restoration scheme the w u a values of the habitats of all target fish increased compared with the levels without intervention in both t1 and t2 fig 7b and c implying that implementation of all the interventions designed in this study had a positive effect on habitat suitability specifically the positive effectiveness of habitat quality restoration in the t1 scenario was rs1 rs4 rs2 rs3 for chinese sucker a similar result was obtained for the ecological effectiveness of the four types of interventions in the t1 scenario for river sturgeon unlike chinese sucker and river sturgeon the ecological effectiveness of the four types of interventions for silver carp was different and the corresponding ranking was rs4 rs1 rs2 rs3 the highest positive w u a change in the t1 scenario was found in the rs3 scheme for silver carp 7 79 while the lowest positive w u a change was observed in the rs1 scheme for chinese sucker 0 21 in addition the response of all biotic elements to all habitat restorations was rs1 rs4 rs2 rs3 in the t2 scenario the w u a of chinese sucker was positively influenced with changes ranging from 0 55 to 8 68 additionally the improvement in habitat quality benefiting from the implementation of interventions ranged from 0 27 to 6 17 for river sturgeon and from 0 24 to 5 80 for silver carp additionally the same intervention in the same location triggered contrasting ecological responses for different fish species specifically the effectiveness of measures based on the responses of all fish species was ranked as chinese sucker river sturgeon silver carp in rs1 and rs3 under the t1 scenario the result for rs4 under both scenarios was chinese sucker silver carp river sturgeon and the result for rs2 in t1 rs1 in t2 rs2 in t2 and rs3 in t2 was river sturgeon silver carp chinese sucker 4 discussion 4 1 wua based model a reliable predictor of river ecosystem response during periods of flood discharge from high dams habitat restoration is a key strategy for recovering imperilled species while the results of restoration are increasingly being evaluated with respect to biotic responses wohl et al 2015 various research results in terms of the quantitative shifts in the ecosystem responses to multiple stressors were examined however there is no uniform framework that can be universally applied for quantifying fish habitat quality during periods of flood discharge from high dams considering tdgs and hydrodynamic stressors jaiswal and pandey 2019 although several scenario studies based on the conventional ram have accounted for the effects of specific concentrations of tdgs on fish survival ma et al 2016 shen et al 2016 wan et al 2020 the rationale for directly using the concentration field of tdgs in ecological impact assessments to evaluate future habitat quality is controversial first the data limitations related to the biological response of fish species are no longer a concern when using tolerance data for specific fish species rather than a unified tdgs threshold such as the threshold of 110 previously used in the columbia river system fidler and miller 1994 united states environmental protection agency usepa 1986 second the tdgs level is a proxy for only the tolerance characteristics of fish and is disassociated from avoidance ability more ecologically significant measures of the effects of tdgs on the biochemistry and behaviors of fish individuals are directly available based on experimental observations pleizier et al 2020b yuan et al 2021 additionally none of the reviewed rams attempted to link the tdgs stressor to the quality of available suitable habitats with hydrodynamic stressor which are known to act as an important filter that critically regulates the local response of fish to habitats theodoropoulos et al 2020 the previous rams ma et al 2016 wan et al 2020 highlighted that areas with tdgs levels that were evenly mixed laterally have the same potential in terms of fish habitat if the concentration of tdgs was greater than the tolerance of the target fish the corresponding habitat was unsuitable however in contrast to previous claims based on rams the habitat suitability results for the t1 and t2 scenarios projected from our framework showed that the suitable habitats were located on both sides of the river along the study reach although the tdgs levels were evenly mixed laterally the discrepancy indicated that previous studies models may have overestimated the impact of dams with tdgs stressor on fish habitats during flood discharge periods in addition the results of this study suggested that the w u a decrease from t1 to t2 was not based on the contribution of the enhanced intensity of tdgs the interpretation is that greater increases in river water depth due to increasing flood discharge gave fish species more compensation and that more unsuitable areas were eventually transformed into suitable areas benefiting from the compensation water depth and the vertical avoidance ability of species pleizier et al 2020b that said the benefits derived from the compensation depth effect offset the negative impact caused by the enhanced intensity of tdgs thus providing conditions for constructing fish shelter areas this result suggests that the decrease in w u a is a response to flow variations and mediated largely by feedback from the interactive effects of environmental variables based on further assessments of the complex interaction processes in ecosystems under multiple stressors during periods of flood discharge from high dams our study calls for caution in the use of imprecise indicators in habitat assessment and for the careful definition of the variables analyzed in particular our study emphasizes the dangers of relying on a simple singular tdgs concentration as a proxy to assess the impacts of flood discharge on ecosystems since ram is actually a negatively biased estimator when predicting habitat distributions we stress that the interactive effects of environmental variables need to be considered when evaluating fish habitat quality in tdgs water during the flood season as opposed to rashly and independently dividing risk areas for fish based on the distribution of the tdgs concentration notably in the latter case the deviation information obtained is likely to be potentially less valuable for improving the viability of target species in degraded rivers abily 2021 4 2 habitat restoration in response to tdgs and hydrodynamic stressors the large scale restoration of ecosystems is seen as pivotal to limiting species extinction jakovac et al 2020 and involves decisions regarding where to undertake restoration and what type of restoration to perform building on rams an expanding body of literature that focuses on the distribution of tdgs advocates reshaping or expanding areas with low tdgs levels to provide suitable shelter areas for fish ma et al 2016 shen et al 2016 wan et al 2020 however our study demonstrated problems implementing restoration guidelines we argue that enough is known about the biological responses of fish to tdgs and that it is unreasonable to only rely on the concentration of tdgs as a basis for river restoration which cannot help identify potential locations for restoration in practice the success of restoration in a given river depends on how the restored location is specified in the restoration problem and on the nature of the intervention type fonner et al 2021 locations can be defined as areas with low evaluation values in terms of river restoration with the location specified choosing the intervention type e g ecological spur dikes stone groups underwater dams or river dredging depends on the hydraulic and biochemical conditions that focal species prefer at a given location and in a specific period zhang et al 2021 in this study w u a is used as an index of habitat quality to assess the ecological effectiveness of restoration with larger w u a values corresponding to more available habitats and vice versa in addition regions with low hsi values are associated with low survival rates and can be considered population bottleneck areas thus they can become targets for restoration consequently the outputs h s i and w u a determined by our approach can be applied as reliable indicators to guide habitat restoration for fish species during flood discharge periods and to develop strategies that focus on where to undertake restoration additionally the outputs can also help with decision making regarding which types of conservation interventions should be implemented to increase ecosystem resilience rose et al 2016 4 3 framework applicability and extension the framework presented in this study supports the accurate assessment of habitat quality for heavily managed fish species under multiple stressors and allows the implementation of restoration interventions with the aim of riverine conservation notably this framework can be applied to other freshwater river systems affected by damming such as the columbia river bragg and johnston 2016 nevertheless the data availability for different fish species is the major constraint for extending the use of this framework habitat quality assessments may not be consistent in different river basins since the preferences for hydrodynamics and the responses to tdgs among fish species are totally different geist et al 2013 thus for applications in other river basins the target fishes considered and the associated physical habitat preferences tolerances and biological behavioral responses to tdgs need to be adjusted and determined after sufficient research in addition instantaneous forcing values e g time varying flood discharge processes can be input into the framework model therefore the framework can be used to quantitatively predict and assess the impact of future flood discharge plans on river ecosystems to help reservoir or watershed managers achieve early diagnoses of riverine ecosystem health subsequent modeling efforts e g many other ecological implementations of multiobjective optimization models chen and olden 2017 wan et al 2020 will benefit from the incorporation of our newly characterized fish habitat availability variable in different flood discharge scenarios allowing decision makers to better implement water management strategies that balance multiple ecological objectives 5 conclusions in this study a novel robust transferable framework was developed by incorporating tdgs and hydrodynamic stressor interactions to assess fish habitat during high dam flood discharge periods and successfully applied to the xjb dam which provides a new perspective for biodiversity conservation and habitat restoration in yangtze river basin this work led to the following main conclusions the framework indicated that available habitats for the three target fish species were located on both sides of the river along the studied reach although the tdgs level was evenly mixed laterally during the flood discharge period the habitat quality identified by traditional models was lower than that estimated by our framework previous models based only on tdgs stressor may have overestimated the impact of dams on fish habitats accurate assessments of the quality and spatial distribution of habitat during periods of flood discharge from high dams must consider the interactions between hydrodynamic and tdgs stressors the hsi provided important clues regarding the locations and types of restoration interventions that could be implemented this index can guide policymakers regarding where and how to implement river restoration measures during periods of flood discharge from high dams it is possible to achieve long term ecological effectiveness for fish species under multiple stressor conditions but interventions should be carefully designed and preoptimized in conclusion the proposed framework supports the identification of priority areas for restoration and shifts the selection and implementation of interventions from passive to active which can increase the probability of river restoration success ethical statement the animal study proposal was approved by the ethics committee for animal experiments of sichuan

15795,the success of river habitat restoration relies on accurate assessment proxies however determining how to quantitatively assess the impact of multiple stressors during flood discharge from high dams in riverine ecosystems and where and how to implement more reliable recovery interventions remain challenges here we developed a bottom up mechanistic framework for assessing the effects of total dissolved gas supersaturation tdgs and hydrodynamics on fish habitat quality and applied it to the downstream river reach of the xiangjiaba dam in southwest china the results showed that the available habitat area of river sturgeon was the smallest while chinese sucker had the largest available habitat area among the three target species under all discharge scenarios although the tdgs levels were evenly mixed laterally the habitat suitability index indicated that the suitable habitats were primarily within both sides of the river reach under all scenarios which is contrary to findings based on the traditional tdgs risk assessment model the traditional tdgs risk assessment model overestimates the impact of dams on habitats this divergence reflected the sensitivity of the habitat assessment to fish habitat preferences fish tolerance to tdgs and the biological response of fish under tdgs additionally the priority areas for restoration can be identified by habitat suitability index with lower values we simulated twenty four schemes and found that interventions such as stone groups ecological spur dike water retaining weir and river dredging can enhance habitat suitability for fish species under multiple stressors providing novel insights into where and how to mitigate the impact of tdgs our findings offer a transferable framework for the quantitative evaluation of fish habitat and implementation of restoration management during dam flood discharge periods thus providing a new perspective for biodiversity conservation and habitat restoration in dam regulated rivers with tdgs around the world graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords flood discharge total dissolved gas supersaturation water management habitat assessment model hydropower development multiple

produces great benefits to human social development including flood control hydropower generation navigation and the supply of reliable and affordable water hossain et al 2010 nevertheless in recent decades it has increasingly been recognized that hydropower operations may drastically alter river flow regimes watz et al 2022 these alterations have been proven to be a main determinant of river habitat quality barbarossa et al 2020 chen and olden 2017 thus posing significant challenges with respect to the conservation of freshwater biodiversity and fish habitat barbarossa et al 2021 a common theme in the analysis of these challenges and their possible solutions is that more attention should be given to the interactions among multiple stressors when assessing habitat quality and developing effective remediation activities arrigo et al 2020 liao et al 2018 vörösmarty et al 2010 however in the context of multiple stressors accurately assessing habitat quality and improving the resistance of river ecosystems to further deterioration are challenging tasks thomas et al 2016 a shift in freshwater fish cohort strength which is highly sensitive to almost all kinds of stresses can be employed as an effective indicator of the response to multiple stressors in river ecosystems zhao et al 2018 scientists have recognized that flow stressor is an important filter that is essential for shaping community structures by adjusting flow velocity and water depth in local areas damiani et al 2019 however fish would also experience another major challenge when dams release floods as the spill of dams can cause total dissolved gas supersaturation tdgs in rivers weitkamp and katz 1980 which may cause fish to suffer from gas bubble disease and even result in mortality in severe cases shen et al 2016 wang et al 2015 for example over 40 tons of fish downstream of the xiluodu dam located in the yangtze river died due to tdgs during the dam flood discharge period in 2014 cctv 2014 although research on tdgs topics has achieved significant advances assessments of the impacts of tdgs and implementation of restoration management still face the following major challenges 1 the need of improving the capacity to correctly evaluate the habitat quality and distribution for a success of river restoration algera et al 2022 and 2 the lack of a standardized protocol for determining where and how to conduct restoration management to protect biodiversity pander et al 2019 targeted efforts have been made to address the above challenges for instance assessment models based on a single tdgs stressor to evaluate the impact of tdgs on fish habitat were developed and applied to the lancang river and jinsha river china ma et al 2016 wan et al 2020 fish refuges could also be identified based on single tdgs concentrations during high dam flood discharge periods shen et al 2016 2019 however the tdgs stressor occurs simultaneously with a hydrodynamic stressor when high dams discharge flood a number of studies have demonstrated that complex interactions existed between hydrodynamic e g water depth and velocity and tdgs stressors fabris et al 2017 feng et al 2014 heggberget 1984 pleizier et al 2020a schiewe 1974 usually multiple stressors act simultaneously potentially increasing the intensity and range of ecological impacts european environment agency 2021 ormerod et al 2010 endeavours failing to consider the interactions may cause deviations in habitat assessments during flood discharge schinegger et al 2016 thus leading to the implementation of inappropriate interventions that are anticipated to have cascading deviant effects on ecological processes in riverine ecosystems olden and naiman 2010 until recently it still lacks robust attempts to integrate the interactions between tdgs and hydrodynamic stressors to evaluate their impact on fish habitat reservoir managers therefore still lack clear guidance regarding the quantitative effects of interactions between tdgs and hydrodynamic stressors on fish habitat and the development of effective river restoration plans effective management to conserve habitats is highly dependent on the ability to assess habitat status jung et al 2021 an increasingly popular approach for assessing fish habitats in water resource management is the habitat suitability model which closely integrates the hydraulic processes in river habitats and the preferred hydraulic conditions of target fish such as water depth velocity and substrate also referred to as the suitability index si bovee 1986 liu et al 2011 to quantitatively evaluate the influence of hydropower on fish habitats and the effect of river restoration niayifar et al 2018 despite the relative ease of applying water velocity water depth and substrate to habitat suitability models these stressors are considered independently and have no interactions between each other making these models less suitable for use in scenarios where there are interactions among multiple stressors to the best of our knowledge frameworks to assess fish habitat that link the interactions between tdgs and hydrodynamic stressors are still lacking at present thus integration of existing knowledge is needed to fill this gap habitat suitability models based on the si have the advantage of considering biological aspects compared to traditional tdgs risk assessment models which raises the question of whether it would be possible to improve the current habitat suitability models to link available knowledge concerning the interactions between tdgs and hydrodynamic stressors to support a more comprehensive assessment of fish habitat during high dam flood discharge periods developing interventions to reverse the trend of habitat degradation is a decisive step in habitat conservation theodoropoulos et al 2020 despite advances in mitigating the negative effect of tdgs single stressor abatement approaches focusing on tdgs stressor remain common spears et al 2021 for instance chen et al 2022 proposed a method to utilize the confluence at which low tdg water joins dam affected supersaturated tdg water for temporary tdgs mitigation and fish refuge creation li et al 2013 proposed measures to enhance the intensity of turbulence to accelerate tdg dissipation wan et al 2020 explored the optimal power generation schemes for expanding fish shelter areas at low tdg levels however single stressor mitigation approaches may be ineffective or fail when multiple stressors interact spears et al 2021 interventions proposed for a single stressor may cause a reduction in the tdgs stressor intensity in some areas but unintentionally undermine the effectiveness of habitat restoration under hydrodynamic stressor conditions such as fish not being able to access and survive in these areas due to velocity barriers liao et al 2022 thompson et al 2017 the current approaches for mitigating tdgs neglect the multiple stressor interactions potentially leading to ineffective recovery there is an urgent need to integrate the interactions between tdgs and hydrodynamic stressors and to develop practical restoration measures to support the effective management of ecosystems habitat restoration with in stream ecological engineering measures could offer opportunities because local hydraulic habitats can be adjusted zhang et al 2021 and the tdgs environment may be improved qing et al 2021 thus this raises the question of whether in stream ecological engineering measures are suitable for mitigating the negative impacts of tdgs in multiple stressor scenarios here we present a robust and transferable framework for habitat assessment during high dam flood discharge to enhance the probability of success of habitat creation and restoration the specific objectives of this study are to 1 link fish s physical habitat preferences and behavioral responses to tdgs to propose new metrics for habitat assessment by integrating the interactive effects of tdgs and hydrodynamic stressors 2 illustrate how important the interactions between hydrodynamics and tdgs are to fish habitat assessments by comparing the divergence of preferred habitats projected from traditional risk assessment models rams and the new framework 3 answer the questions of where and how to implement restoration interventions by using new ecological indicators and 4 explore whether ecological engineering measures can achieve positive effects for fish species in cases with multiple stressors by a series of restoration scenarios providing a new perspective for mitigating the negative impacts of tdgs 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the jinsha river is the headwater of the yangtze river in china and has a total length of 3 464 km a rich variety of freshwater fishes inhabit the lower jinsha river which is an important supplemental channel for fish recruitment to the yangtze river zhang et al 2018 the xiangjiaba xjb dam 28 38 28 26 n 104 23 44 50 e with a height of 162 00 m a normal water level of 380 00 m above sea level and a total storage capacity of 5 163 billion m3 is the last cascade hydropower station on the jinsha river the average annual flow at the dam site is 4570 m3 s the largest aquatic reserve in china namely the national nature reserve of rare and endemic fish was established downstream of the xjb dam to protect various fish in this region there are two tributaries in the river reach namely hengjiang river and minjiang river which are located approximately 3 5 km and 32 km downstream of the dam with average annual flows of 294 m3 s and 2830 m3 s respectively in this study the river reach from the xjb dam to the outlet of the jinsha river with a length of 32 km was chosen as the study area fig 1 this reach was selected because it has a high tdgs risk during periods of flood discharge from the xjb dam and is of high concern to the chinese government in contrast long term field monitoring has shown that tdgs concentrations decreased significantly after the minjiang river converged with the mainstem and no fish mortality were observed indicating that the risk of tdgs downstream of the study reach is low 2 2 target fish due to the influence of multiple pressures induced by hydropower stations on the lower jinsha river the populations of river sturgeon acipenser dabryanusm and chinese sucker myxocyprinus asiaticus which have greatly declined in recent years zhuang et al 1997 they are both listed on the china red list of species as endangered species and on the international union for conservation of nature s red list of threatened species as critically endangered species and vulnerable species respectively additionally these two benthic species are legally protected in china and classified as national top level and second class protected animals respectively zhou et al 2020 silver carp hypophthalmichthys molitrix one of the four major chinese carp species is an economically important endemic and representative pelagic fish emerging data from many years of field sampling have shown that the resources for this species have greatly declined in the study reach cao et al 2007 the xjb dam generally discharges flood from july to september during which time juveniles of these fish conduct foraging and fattening activities in this study river reach and they thus face the potential threat of tdgs wan et al 2021 wei 2012 therefore we selected juveniles of chinese sucker river sturgeon and silver carp as the target fish for assessment and protection in this study 2 3 assessment framework coupling hydrodynamics and tdgs during flood discharge periods the framework presented in this paper is built on existing knowledge concerning environmental flow management the effects of tdgs on fish and the ecohydrology literature the mechanistic framework can be conceptualized as the integration of a hydrodynamic model a tdgs generation model a tdgs transport model and a fish habitat assessment model the diagram in fig 2 a outlines the major methodology of habitat assessment in high dam flood discharge systems which can be summarized as follows 1 establishing a tdgs generation model to predict the tdgs level based on external forcing data obtained by the release discharge schemes of river management 2 developing a depth averaged 2d hydrodynamic model to predict the flow field 3 embedding the tdgs prediction model into the depth averaged 2d hydrodynamic model and tdgs transport model to predict the distribution of tdgs 4 obtaining the tolerances avoidance characteristics and swimming performance of fish in the tdg supersaturated water from laboratory field experiments or online datasets 5 linking the response of fish to tdgs to fish physical habitat preferences by the coupling dynamically adjustable habitat suitability index da hsi model 6 coupling tdgs generation 2d hydrodynamics 2d tdgs transport and da hsi models to establish a habitat evaluation model 7 applying the habitat evaluation model to quantitatively assess fish habitat quality 2 3 1 hydrodynamic model in this study a depth averaged 2d mathematical model for the study river reach was established based on mike 21 with unstructured triangular computational grids to calculate the hydrodynamics and evaluate fish habitats detailed information on the hydrodynamic model is described in appendix a detailed channel topography surveys of the bed elevations in 2018 at this study river reach were measured using a real time kinematic rtk gps system consisting of a mobile mapper 10 gis gps receiver and a spectra precision sp60 gnss receiver trimble inc usa a total of 43 013 geometric data points based on the 1985 chinese national height datum were obtained over the reach the study river reach was discretized into 49 564 flexible computational elements in the horizontal plane with local mesh refinements around hydraulic structures and tributary mouths the time step of the model was specified as a constant of 60 s to ensure a stable and quick run time upstream and downstream boundary conditions were given as measured inflows and water levels respectively the hydrodynamic model was calibrated by adjusting manning s coefficient values representing resistance due to bed roughness for the reach these values were initially assigned with a homogeneous roughness across the entire reach based on literature values and the values were then adjusted in local areas to obtain a good match between the simulated and observed results in addition the root mean square error rmse and relative rmse rrmse were introduced to evaluate all the model results the field velocity data were obtained with a propeller current meter ls25 3a xiangruide china for which the measurement range of velocity was 0 04 10 0 m s with an accuracy of 0 01 m s this device was deployed in the site of the xjb hydrometric station downstream of the dam s1 and in the site 31 km downstream of the dam s2 fig 1 depth averaged velocities were measured by taking measurements at 0 6 times the total water depth from the water surface thirty six velocities in the s1 site were obtained from january to august 2017 and 15 velocities in the s2 site were obtained from july to august 2020 in addition we collected 5 velocities in the section 10 km downstream of the dam s3 on may 30 2019 from the china three gorges corporation fig 1 furthermore water level data from january 1 to december 31 2016 were obtained in the s1 site and at sankuaishi hydrometric station s4 puan hydrometric station s5 and daxuetan hydrometric station s6 using an rtk gps unit with an accuracy of 0 02 m fig 1 the validation results for the hydrodynamic values including velocity and water level are illustrated in fig a1 after calibration the manning s coefficient values ranged from 0 023 to 0 045 in the validated model the rmse and rrmse between simulated and monitored velocity values in the sites of s1 s2 and s3 were 0 08 m s and 2 55 0 10 m s and 7 97 and 0 03 m s and 3 65 respectively indicating that the model was accurate and highly reliable liao et al 2022 tang et al 2018 in addition the rmse and rrmse between simulated and monitored water levels in the sites of s1 s4 s5 and s6 were 0 25 m and 2 62 0 22 m and 2 02 0 20 m and 1 91 and 0 11 m and 1 17 respectively the overall trend of the simulated water level was basically the same as that for the measured water level therefore the established hydrodynamic model displayed good calculation accuracy and could be used for subsequent research 2 3 2 tdgs generation prediction model in this study the tdgs downstream of the xjb dam during the spilling process was calculated based on the tdgs generation model developed by ma et al 2016 tdgs observations in the study area were obtained in 2014 and 2020 the tdgs levels were recorded at eight sites fig 1 along the reach on september 3 and 4 2014 including the dam front within the xjb reservoir 1 left tailwater 2 right tailwater 3 spill 4 xjb hydrometric station 5 right bank flood protection embankment 6 jinsha river bridge 7 and rainbow bridge 8 using point four tgp portable trackers point four systems inc canada for these trackers the measurement range of tdgs was 0 200 with an accuracy of 2 daily monitoring at the four sites including the right bank 2 km downstream of the xjb dam 9 the left bank 1 km upstream of the end of the study river reach 10 the middle point 1 km upstream of the end of the study river reach 11 and the right bank 1 km upstream of the end of the study river reach 12 was conducted for 34 days from july to august 2020 moreover the flood discharge data and operation scheduling of flood discharge facilities were from the operational conditions of xjb reservoir verification of the tdgs generation model was performed by utilizing field measurement data the parameters used in tdgs generation calculations for xjb reservoir are shown in table a1 the predicted tdgs at the spill site 4 was 142 1 with an absolute error of 0 3 compared with field observations this finding indicated that the model predicted tdgs generation values were in accordance with the observed data and were suitable for use in the xjb reservoir simulations 2 3 3 tdgs transport model in this study a depth averaged two dimensional model for tdgs transport and dissipation processes was developed to predict the tdgs distribution downstream of xjb reservoir details are given in appendix a the model was validated with tdgs level measurements obtained at sites 5 to 12 the upstream boundary conditions were set based on the measured tdgs and discharge at the left tailwater right tailwater and spill locations the downstream boundary conditions were set based on the measured water level and tdgs level using a neumann boundary condition the simulated values of the tdgs were compared with the observed data fig a2 after repeated adjustment the adopted value of ϕ g which is a coefficient in the tdgs transport model that considers the effects of molecular and turbulent diffusion and influences the tdgs dissipation rate was calibrated as 1 42 10 8 s the rmse value for tdgs during the field observation period in 2014 was 0 05 and the rrmse was 1 57 the rmse and rrmse for tdgs at sites of 9 10 11 and 12 in 2020 were 0 81 and 6 78 0 89 and 5 02 0 49 and 8 99 and 1 02 and 5 60 respectively these finding suggested that the tdgs levels obtained by the mathematical model agreed well with the real levels 2 3 4 dynamically adjusted habitat suitability index model fish habitat preferences are often assessed using si curves for flow velocity water depth and substrate composition developed following the approach of bovee 1986 the si values for a single factor are described as a continuous suitability curve ranging from 0 indicating that the factors negatively affect fish habitat to 1 indicating that they are highly suitable for fish life remarkably the above si variables are considered independent and unchanged for assessments however the interactive effects of environmental variables are present in river ecosystems with tdgs stressor as shown in fig 2b the tolerance of specific fish to tdgs is affected by their vertical avoidance ability to tdgs and the water depth provided by the local region the preferred velocity of fish is related to swimming performance which in turn is influenced by tdgs schiewe 1974 the dissipation of tdgs is simultaneously influenced by water depth and velocity the interactive effects of environmental variables were taken into consideration in this study when evaluating fish habitat quality in tdgs rivers a new dynamically adjusted hsi model based on improved si curves considering the interactions of tdgs and hydrodynamic stressors was thus proposed to quantify the changes in habitat availability for freshwater fish species during the flood season 2 3 4 1 si curve model the tolerance of fish to tdgs is often described by the median lethal time lt50 which refers to the time when fish mortality reaches 50 at a specific tdgs level pleizier et al 2020a a longer lt50 at a specific tdgs level indicates that fish have a stronger tolerance and thus have a higher suitability for tdgs the si value at a tdgs level is defined as 1 when no mortality for fish occurs the suitability distribution of the tdgs level with lethal effects can be transformed into a standardized number based on the relationship between the lt50 of fish and the tdgs level if there were multiple target fish in the same study area the tdgs suitability curves of the specific target fish could be calculated based on their lt50 curves first silver carp was determined to be the fish with the strongest tolerance to tdgs among the three target fish according to their lt50 curves cao et al 2016a cao et al 2016b song et al 2018 second the virtual lt50 value corresponding to the maximum nonlethal tdgs level for silver carp with an si value of 1 was calculated according to the obtained lt50 curve finally the si values of different fish at different lethal tdgs levels were obtained by dividing the lt50 of specific fish at different tdgs levels by the virtual lt50 the si curves of the target fish were calculated as shown in fig 2c 2 3 4 2 dynamically adjustable si curve model there is evidence that fish in tdgs waters exhibit depth compensation behaviors that can alleviate gas bubble disease as depth increases heggberget 1984 shrimpton et al 1990 the distribution of river water depth can to some extent influence the impact of tdgs on fish the safety compensation depth is a functional measure that can be used in fish protection assessments below this depth the impact of tdgs on fish will shift from a suitability below 1 to a suitability equal to 1 the safety compensation depth can be estimated with the compensation depth equation developed by pleizier et al 2020b to determine whether the compensation depth strategy can be used by different species to eliminate the biological effects of tdgs experiments can be performed or online datasets can be applied wang et al 2020 based on the studies of cao et al 2016a and 2016b chinese sucker and silver carp have the ability to exploit depth compensation to avoid the threat of tdgs the vertical avoidance ability of river sturgeon in tdgs water was examined in this study according to the instructions of wang et al 2015 and the results showed that river sturgeon could use a compensation depth strategy to avoid the threat of tdgs appendix b benefiting from the compensation depth the si value for tolerance will change during the evaluation specifically the adjustment of compensation depth in local regions of river is fed back to the tdgs level and then to the si curve of tolerance thus new si values of tolerance for target fish can be determined after the adjustment of compensation depth in local areas the swimming capabilities of fish are closely related to their evasive capabilities foraging behaviors and reproduction behaviors webb 1984 juvenile fish are particularly sensitive to water velocity which can be an important control for both fish growth and fish mortality fabris et al 2019 the critical swimming speed v c is a special category of prolonged swimming above which fish cannot hold stations or effectively feed or utilized habitat v c thus provides an objective index of whether a patch of habitat is likely to be useable for juvenile fish fabris et al 2017 it follows that si values equal to 1 contribute to fish survival when the water velocity is below v c whereas the si has a value of 0 when the water velocity is above v c it has been recognized that tdgs may contribute to swimming performance loss in fish species schiewe 1974 which reduces the ability of fish to use certain habitats and in turn influences the si of water velocity in river sections specifically the adjustment of tdgs in local areas is fed back to v c of fish and then to the si of v c after changes in tdgs in the entire river the new si values of v c for target fish in the study reach can be regulated the v c of specific fish can be determined from the relationship curve linking v c and tdgs levels which are available in the published literature or could be obtained from experiments a curve that described the relationship between the v c of the chinese sucker and the tdgs level was reported by wang et al 2018 while ji 2020 found that the v c of silver carp during the flood season was not affected by different tdgs levels in addition the v c of river sturgeon was tested in this study according to the instructions of wang et al 2018 and the results showed that the v c of river sturgeon was not affected by different tdgs levels appendix b 2 3 4 3 hsi model with dynamical adjustment the h s i in the flood discharge period is a function of four life requisite components water depth velocity substrate and tdgs in this study and was calculated eq 1 as a combined si by utilizing the geometric mean yi et al 2017 which provides a more conservative estimate of habitat suitability by allowing the h s i to approach zero if any of the si values incorporated in the geometric mean are zero 1 h s i s i v s i s s i t d g 1 3 where s i t d g is the si value of the tolerance of fish at which the compensation depth is considered unless the target fish cannot exploit the compensation depth strategy and s i v and s i s are the suitability of the flow velocity and substrate respectively in the tdgs environment previous studies tested hsi criteria by comparing predicted habitat quality patches with survey results and showed that most of the investigated suitable habitats were located in areas with hsi 0 8 indicating that hsi 0 8 can be used as an evaluation criterion for suitable habitat carnie et al 2015 muñoz mas et al 2012 reeder et al 2021 storch 2002 tang et al 2021 therefore suitable habitat in this study was defined as habitats with hsi 0 8 2 3 5 fish habitat assessment model coupled with the tdgs stressor in this study the concept of weighted usable area w u a bovee 1986 which is calculated by multiplying the hsi value of each computational grid by the relevant element area and aggregating all values for the entire study reach was introduced to characterize the habitat quality w u a represents the area of available habitat in a river reach in a given discharge scenario and a larger w u a value indicates better habitat quality in this study the w u a of target fish under tdgs and flow stressors was proposed to assess habitat quality eq 2 2 w u a i 1 n h s i i a i where i represents the order number of grids h s i i is the h s i value of grid i n is the total number of model grids within the wetted area of the river and a i is the area for grid i in the established 2d hydrodynamic model m2 2 4 scenario design and habitat quality evaluation 2 4 1 scenario design in this study two flood discharge scenarios with a 2 year flood of 16800 m3 s t1 and a 5 year flood of 21800 m3 s t2 were selected to assess the fish habitat quality during the flood discharge period the t1 scenario represents the flow discharged at the normal discharge frequency which often occurs during the xjb dam flood discharge period assessing t1 can provide insight into the common state of fish habitat in the study river reach during flood discharge period the t2 scenario represents the flow discharged at the extreme frequency and assessing t2 can aid in understanding the extreme impact of flood discharge from the xjb dam on fish habitat in the study river reach the tdgs events under both scenarios and their effects are of great concern to the river managers in total 6 habitat evaluation scenarios 2 flood discharge simulations 3 fish species are presented in this study 2 4 2 rate of habitat quality change and contributions of stressors to habitat quality change to better understand how much habitat quality relies on the interactions between hydrodynamic and tdgs stressors we explored the changes in habitat quality and habitat spatial distribution between different discharge scenarios and identified the main factors that drive changes in habitat quality when intensity of stressors changes we quantified the change in habitat quality under different scenarios using the rate of habitat quality change defined as shown in eq 3 and h s i spatial change h s i under t 2 h s i under t 1 which were calculated for each target fish 3 habitat quality change rate wu a t 2 wu a t 1 wu a t 1 100 where w u a t 1 is the habitat quality in the t1 scenario and w u a t 2 is the habitat quality in the t2 scenario we calculated the contributions of tdgs to habitat quality changes using the rate of change in wua between scenarios t1 and t2 that was calculated based on a fixed water velocity of scenario t1 eq 4 a similar method was also used to illustrate the contributions of water velocity to habitat quality changes namely the rate of change in wua between scenarios t1 and t2 was calculated based on a fixed tdgs level of scenario t1 eq 5 4 tdgs contribution wu a t 2 with velocity under t 1 wu a t 1 wu a t 1 100 5 velocity contribution wu a t 2 with tdgs under t 1 wu a t 1 wu a t 1 100 where wu a t 2 with velocity under t 1 represents the habitat quality in the t2 scenario based on the velocity in the t1 scenario and wu a t 2 with tdgs under t 1 represents the habitat quality in the t2 scenario based on the tdgs level in the t1 scenario 2 4 3 rams calculations the traditional rams only use the tdgs level to determine the suitable habitat and areas where the tdgs level is below 120 is treated as safe for fish species in the yangtze river basin ma et al 2016 wan et al 2020 based on the traditional rams we identified the areas with tdgs levels below 120 for chinese sucker and silver carp and below 110 for river sturgeon under two scenarios and compared the results with the suitable habitat areas obtained based on the new framework to illustrate the divergence between the traditional rams and the new framework 2 5 examination of restoration effectiveness restoration interventions were designed to focus on candidate sites with unfavorable survival conditions considering biological behavior responses and typical techniques for enhancing fish habitats based on the results of predictive ecological models were introduced to test whether restoration led to ecological benefits in cases with multiple stressors the proposed habitat restoration interventions are listed in table a2 habitat restoration effectiveness was quantified as the reduction in the potential extinction region due to multiple stressors following the implementation of interventions for restoration restoration effectiveness was calculated based on the difference in w u a between the base model scenario without restoration and the habitat restoration schemes with restoration in each scenario this calculation was defined as follows 6 restoration effectiveness wu a ti with restoration wu a ti without restoration wu a ti without restoration 100 where w u a t i with restoration represents the habitat quality in the ti scenario with habitat restoration where i 1 and 2 and w u a t i without restoration represents the habitat quality in the ti scenario without habitat restoration a positive change indicates positive restoration effectiveness while a negative change indicates negative restoration effectiveness 3 results 3 1 distribution of the tdgs level and hydrodynamics downstream of the xjb dam and verification of the habitat assessment model the tdgs levels at the xjb dam generated by spill discharge were 156 and 162 in the t1 and t2 scenarios respectively fig 3 a compares the spatial changes in the tdgs levels under the t1 scenario and t2 scenario benefitting from the tailwater discharged from the powerhouse 7144 m3 s and the hengjiang river 394 m3 s rapid tdgs mixing processes occurred two times along the river reach in each discharge scenario the cross sections in which the tdgs mixed completely the difference between the maximum concentration and minimum concentration in the section was less than 2 occurred for the first time were located 2 67 km downstream of the dam and 2 76 km downstream of the dam in the t1 scenario and t2 scenario respectively where the average tdgs levels were 131 8 and 141 3 respectively the cross section where complete tdgs mixing occurred for the second time was located 3 0 km downstream of the confluence of the hengjiang river and 3 4 km downstream of the confluence of the hengjiang river in the t1 scenario and t2 scenario respectively with average values of 131 3 and 140 5 respectively the tdgs level progressively decreased as the longitudinal river distance increased the average value of the tdgs level at the outlet section decreased to 129 9 for the t1 scenario and 139 1 for the t2 scenario illustrating that the dissipation rate of tdgs is extremely low in this reach fig 3b and c present the simulation results of velocity and water depth for each scenario in t1 the flow velocity ranged from 0 20 m s to 14 78 m s with an average value of 2 06 m s and the water depth ranged from 0 21 m to 27 33 m with an average value of 14 25 m compared to t1 due to increased discharge from flood discharge orifices the flow velocity in t2 increased to the range of 0 31 m s to 15 40 m s with an average value of 2 06 m s and the water depth ranged from 0 32 m to 28 54 m with an average value of 15 80 m the performance of the habitat assessment model with coupled tdgs and hydrodynamic stressors was tested by comparing the predicted patches of habitat suitability with the fish preferred habitat locations surveyed during the flood discharge season by wei 2012 and meng et al 2019 along the study reach and the in situ observations conducted by cao et al 2017 and xue et al 2019 as shown in fig 3d the preferred locations of target fish species were within the model simulated high quality patch areas where most h s i values were larger than 0 8 this result was consistent with the results of the field investigations meng et al 2019 wei 2012 in addition no fish died due to the effect of gas bubble disease at the site 24 km downstream of the xjb dam with tdgs of 128 and water depth of 3 m cao et al 2017 xue et al 2019 compared with the prediction from our habitat assessment model it is found that this site was located in an area with an hsi greater than 0 8 these results suggest that our habitat assessment model accurately predicts the available habitat distribution for all the target fish species during the flood discharge season 3 2 divergence between the wua based and ram based assessments spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of fish habitat suitability obtained from the w u a based model is presented in fig 4 but similar results for the h s i distribution of different fish species were obtained for both discharge scenarios fig 4 regions with high values of h s i were primarily observed within both sides of the river reach under all scenarios these locations include tailwater areas where the flow was discharged from powerhouses river bend rb 1 the confluence of the hengjiang river rb 2 rb 3 and rb 4 each of these regions displayed h s i values higher than 0 8 throughout most of their domain indicating that they were conducive to fish survival other regions also had high h s i values but were relatively small and fragmented overall these regions can provide temporary shelter for fish while the central area of the whole river is not suitable for fish survival the habitat quality for different target fish changed with different flood discharge scenarios specifically the habitat quality of chinese sucker was the best in both habitat evaluation schemes with w u a values of 1 05 106 m2 and 8 92 105 m2 for the t1 scenario and t2 scenario respectively river sturgeon exhibited the poorest habitat quality under all assessment scenarios with a w u a value of 8 36 105 m2 in the t1 scenario and a w u a value of 7 30 105 m2 in the t2 scenario as water discharge increased from t1 to t2 the available habitat in the river reach for all target fish species decreased indicating that the fish survival threat increased with increasing stressor intensity however under the same hydrodynamic and tdgs transport models the available habitat outputs based on the traditional ram ma et al 2016 wan et al 2020 were smaller than those based on the w u a based model with area reductions of 45 83 and 45 60 for chinese sucker 45 08 and 45 58 for river sturgeon and 40 70 and 43 28 for silver carp under the t1 scenario and t2 scenario respectively compared to that obtained with the w u a based model the spatial distribution of available habitats estimated with the ram decreased in both sides of the river reach especially in rb 2 rb 3 and rb 4 and increased in tailwater areas in addition the discrepancies in the habitat qualities and spatial habitat distributions for chinese sucker and silver carp were explicitly captured by the w u a based model even though the maximum nonlethal tdgs levels were the same however the rams could not identify this key information and showed that the habitat qualities and spatial distributions are the same for both species fig 4b accordingly w u a defined available habitat expands but also contracts in some regions for example tailwater areas compared to that from ram 3 3 change rate of habitat quality and distribution the lowest rate of w u a change between scenario t1 and scenario t2 was detected for silver carp in all target fish with a value of 11 2 while the highest rate of w u a change was 15 4 for chinese sucker suggesting that chinese sucker is more sensitive to multiple stressors than the two other species the differences in the h s i values of the three target fish species under the two scenarios are presented in fig 5 intriguingly although the overall habitat quality of the three fish species decreased the habitat suitability in some regions of the river reach increased that mainly includes both sides of the river reach except for rbs 2 3 and 4 overall the benefits derived from the areas of increased h s i cannot offset the negative impact of the decreases in h s i in other areas thereby causing a decrease in the total habitat quality values of the river for all target fish specifically the largest w u a corresponding to the regions with an h s i increase occurred in the habitat of silver carp with an increase of 16 45 followed by the habitat of chinese sucker with an increase of 13 35 and river sturgeon with an increase of 13 3 the largest w u a corresponding to regions with decreased h s i occurred in the habitat of chinese sucker with a decrease of 28 77 followed by the habitat of silver carp with a decrease of 27 65 and river sturgeon habitat with the smallest decrease of 25 92 3 4 drivers of changes in habitat quality the contributions of velocity and tdgs to the projected w u a variations between the two scenarios were quantified by controlling the variation in a single stressor intensity projections for the control simulations showed that the contributions of velocity eq 5 to w u a change were 12 91 7 67 and 8 00 for chinese sucker river sturgeon and silver carp respectively while the contributions of tdgs eq 4 to w u a change were 1 79 1 59 and 1 81 for chinese sucker river sturgeon and silver carp respectively this result indicated that an increase in flow velocity dominated the decrease in tdgs to result in a degradation of habitat quality for the three target fish fig 6 a however available habitats supported by tdgs still increased slightly on both sides of the river reach due to an increase in the compensation depth as a result of high flow fig 6b this result is contrary to that obtained with the ram i e the greater the intensity of the tdgs stressor is the less suitable a habitat is for fish 3 5 examination of the ecological effectiveness of river restoration the hsi maps can spatially and explicitly illustrate fish survival based on the habitat characteristics at different locations a low suitability area is a potential candidate location for restoration according to the tdgs suitability results velocity suitability results and hsi maps in the t1 and t2 scenarios for all three target fish species restoration scenarios were designed to address unfavorable tdgs and hydrodynamic conditions the tdgs suitability of the study river reach was low on both sides of the river in both scenarios due to insufficient compensation water depths and low velocity suitability was observed since the velocities in some areas on both sides of the river were large habitat restoration schemes of river dredging rs1 water retaining weir rs2 stone groups rs3 and ecological spur dike rs4 were designed to improve the hsi of these areas as shown in fig 7 a river dredging rs1 was employed 25 6 km downstream of the dam with a dredging depth of 1 m the dredging area was located on the left bank and was 1000 m long and 90 m wide this process decreased the current speed and increased the water depth to reduce the impact of tdgs a water retaining weir rs2 the unilateral width of the weir crest ww was 75 m with large pebbles was constructed 24 7 km downstream of the dam to increase the water depth and decrease the water velocity on both sides of the section to create available habitat the unilateral width of the weir crest ww was 75 m stone groups rs3 were placed on the riverbed of the left river bank 16 0 km downstream of the dam to decrease the flow velocity and to generate an appropriate flow depth behind the stones for fish inhabitants to avoid tdgs damage stones with a diameter of 17 5 m were staggered by 4 in the horizontal direction and 9 in the longitudinal direction the horizontal and longitudinal distances between each stone were 15 m and 16 m respectively an ecological spur dike rs4 was established 17 6 km downstream of the dam to create suitable velocity habitats with sufficient compensation depths for all target fish species the angle between the dam axis and the flow direction was 90 the dike crest elevation was higher than the water surface and the height of the spur dike was 17 5 m in total 24 habitat simulations were applied to ultimately predict the habitat suitability at each node of the computational mesh of the study area for each habitat restoration scheme the w u a values of the habitats of all target fish increased compared with the levels without intervention in both t1 and t2 fig 7b and c implying that implementation of all the interventions designed in this study had a positive effect on habitat suitability specifically the positive effectiveness of habitat quality restoration in the t1 scenario was rs1 rs4 rs2 rs3 for chinese sucker a similar result was obtained for the ecological effectiveness of the four types of interventions in the t1 scenario for river sturgeon unlike chinese sucker and river sturgeon the ecological effectiveness of the four types of interventions for silver carp was different and the corresponding ranking was rs4 rs1 rs2 rs3 the highest positive w u a change in the t1 scenario was found in the rs3 scheme for silver carp 7 79 while the lowest positive w u a change was observed in the rs1 scheme for chinese sucker 0 21 in addition the response of all biotic elements to all habitat restorations was rs1 rs4 rs2 rs3 in the t2 scenario the w u a of chinese sucker was positively influenced with changes ranging from 0 55 to 8 68 additionally the improvement in habitat quality benefiting from the implementation of interventions ranged from 0 27 to 6 17 for river sturgeon and from 0 24 to 5 80 for silver carp additionally the same intervention in the same location triggered contrasting ecological responses for different fish species specifically the effectiveness of measures based on the responses of all fish species was ranked as chinese sucker river sturgeon silver carp in rs1 and rs3 under the t1 scenario the result for rs4 under both scenarios was chinese sucker silver carp river sturgeon and the result for rs2 in t1 rs1 in t2 rs2 in t2 and rs3 in t2 was river sturgeon silver carp chinese sucker 4 discussion 4 1 wua based model a reliable predictor of river ecosystem response during periods of flood discharge from high dams habitat restoration is a key strategy for recovering imperilled species while the results of restoration are increasingly being evaluated with respect to biotic responses wohl et al 2015 various research results in terms of the quantitative shifts in the ecosystem responses to multiple stressors were examined however there is no uniform framework that can be universally applied for quantifying fish habitat quality during periods of flood discharge from high dams considering tdgs and hydrodynamic stressors jaiswal and pandey 2019 although several scenario studies based on the conventional ram have accounted for the effects of specific concentrations of tdgs on fish survival ma et al 2016 shen et al 2016 wan et al 2020 the rationale for directly using the concentration field of tdgs in ecological impact assessments to evaluate future habitat quality is controversial first the data limitations related to the biological response of fish species are no longer a concern when using tolerance data for specific fish species rather than a unified tdgs threshold such as the threshold of 110 previously used in the columbia river system fidler and miller 1994 united states environmental protection agency usepa 1986 second the tdgs level is a proxy for only the tolerance characteristics of fish and is disassociated from avoidance ability more ecologically significant measures of the effects of tdgs on the biochemistry and behaviors of fish individuals are directly available based on experimental observations pleizier et al 2020b yuan et al 2021 additionally none of the reviewed rams attempted to link the tdgs stressor to the quality of available suitable habitats with hydrodynamic stressor which are known to act as an important filter that critically regulates the local response of fish to habitats theodoropoulos et al 2020 the previous rams ma et al 2016 wan et al 2020 highlighted that areas with tdgs levels that were evenly mixed laterally have the same potential in terms of fish habitat if the concentration of tdgs was greater than the tolerance of the target fish the corresponding habitat was unsuitable however in contrast to previous claims based on rams the habitat suitability results for the t1 and t2 scenarios projected from our framework showed that the suitable habitats were located on both sides of the river along the study reach although the tdgs levels were evenly mixed laterally the discrepancy indicated that previous studies models may have overestimated the impact of dams with tdgs stressor on fish habitats during flood discharge periods in addition the results of this study suggested that the w u a decrease from t1 to t2 was not based on the contribution of the enhanced intensity of tdgs the interpretation is that greater increases in river water depth due to increasing flood discharge gave fish species more compensation and that more unsuitable areas were eventually transformed into suitable areas benefiting from the compensation water depth and the vertical avoidance ability of species pleizier et al 2020b that said the benefits derived from the compensation depth effect offset the negative impact caused by the enhanced intensity of tdgs thus providing conditions for constructing fish shelter areas this result suggests that the decrease in w u a is a response to flow variations and mediated largely by feedback from the interactive effects of environmental variables based on further assessments of the complex interaction processes in ecosystems under multiple stressors during periods of flood discharge from high dams our study calls for caution in the use of imprecise indicators in habitat assessment and for the careful definition of the variables analyzed in particular our study emphasizes the dangers of relying on a simple singular tdgs concentration as a proxy to assess the impacts of flood discharge on ecosystems since ram is actually a negatively biased estimator when predicting habitat distributions we stress that the interactive effects of environmental variables need to be considered when evaluating fish habitat quality in tdgs water during the flood season as opposed to rashly and independently dividing risk areas for fish based on the distribution of the tdgs concentration notably in the latter case the deviation information obtained is likely to be potentially less valuable for improving the viability of target species in degraded rivers abily 2021 4 2 habitat restoration in response to tdgs and hydrodynamic stressors the large scale restoration of ecosystems is seen as pivotal to limiting species extinction jakovac et al 2020 and involves decisions regarding where to undertake restoration and what type of restoration to perform building on rams an expanding body of literature that focuses on the distribution of tdgs advocates reshaping or expanding areas with low tdgs levels to provide suitable shelter areas for fish ma et al 2016 shen et al 2016 wan et al 2020 however our study demonstrated problems implementing restoration guidelines we argue that enough is known about the biological responses of fish to tdgs and that it is unreasonable to only rely on the concentration of tdgs as a basis for river restoration which cannot help identify potential locations for restoration in practice the success of restoration in a given river depends on how the restored location is specified in the restoration problem and on the nature of the intervention type fonner et al 2021 locations can be defined as areas with low evaluation values in terms of river restoration with the location specified choosing the intervention type e g ecological spur dikes stone groups underwater dams or river dredging depends on the hydraulic and biochemical conditions that focal species prefer at a given location and in a specific period zhang et al 2021 in this study w u a is used as an index of habitat quality to assess the ecological effectiveness of restoration with larger w u a values corresponding to more available habitats and vice versa in addition regions with low hsi values are associated with low survival rates and can be considered population bottleneck areas thus they can become targets for restoration consequently the outputs h s i and w u a determined by our approach can be applied as reliable indicators to guide habitat restoration for fish species during flood discharge periods and to develop strategies that focus on where to undertake restoration additionally the outputs can also help with decision making regarding which types of conservation interventions should be implemented to increase ecosystem resilience rose et al 2016 4 3 framework applicability and extension the framework presented in this study supports the accurate assessment of habitat quality for heavily managed fish species under multiple stressors and allows the implementation of restoration interventions with the aim of riverine conservation notably this framework can be applied to other freshwater river systems affected by damming such as the columbia river bragg and johnston 2016 nevertheless the data availability for different fish species is the major constraint for extending the use of this framework habitat quality assessments may not be consistent in different river basins since the preferences for hydrodynamics and the responses to tdgs among fish species are totally different geist et al 2013 thus for applications in other river basins the target fishes considered and the associated physical habitat preferences tolerances and biological behavioral responses to tdgs need to be adjusted and determined after sufficient research in addition instantaneous forcing values e g time varying flood discharge processes can be input into the framework model therefore the framework can be used to quantitatively predict and assess the impact of future flood discharge plans on river ecosystems to help reservoir or watershed managers achieve early diagnoses of riverine ecosystem health subsequent modeling efforts e g many other ecological implementations of multiobjective optimization models chen and olden 2017 wan et al 2020 will benefit from the incorporation of our newly characterized fish habitat availability variable in different flood discharge scenarios allowing decision makers to better implement water management strategies that balance multiple ecological objectives 5 conclusions in this study a novel robust transferable framework was developed by incorporating tdgs and hydrodynamic stressor interactions to assess fish habitat during high dam flood discharge periods and successfully applied to the xjb dam which provides a new perspective for biodiversity conservation and habitat restoration in yangtze river basin this work led to the following main conclusions the framework indicated that available habitats for the three target fish species were located on both sides of the river along the studied reach although the tdgs level was evenly mixed laterally during the flood discharge period the habitat quality identified by traditional models was lower than that estimated by our framework previous models based only on tdgs stressor may have overestimated the impact of dams on fish habitats accurate assessments of the quality and spatial distribution of habitat during periods of flood discharge from high dams must consider the interactions between hydrodynamic and tdgs stressors the hsi provided important clues regarding the locations and types of restoration interventions that could be implemented this index can guide policymakers regarding where and how to implement river restoration measures during periods of flood discharge from high dams it is possible to achieve long term ecological effectiveness for fish species under multiple stressor conditions but interventions should be carefully designed and preoptimized in conclusion the proposed framework supports the identification of priority areas for restoration and shifts the selection and implementation of interventions from passive to active which can increase the probability of river restoration success ethical statement the animal study proposal was approved by the ethics committee for animal experiments of sichuan

15796,water quality monitoring programs are essential planning and management tools but they face many challenges in the developing world the scarcity of financial and human resources and the unavailability of infrastructure often make it impossible to meet the legal requirements of water monitoring many approaches to optimizing water quality monitoring programs have already been proposed however few investigations have developed and tested data mining for this purpose this article has developed data based models to reduce the number of water quality parameters of monitoring programs using data mining the objective was to extract patterns from the database expressed by association rules which together with field parameters measured with automatic probes can estimate laboratory variables this approach was applied in 35 monitoring stations along 27 river basins throughout brazil the data are from fifty years of monitoring 1971 2021 constituting 6328 observations of 60 water quality parameters investigated in different environmental contexts water quality and the structuring of monitoring programs with the applied approach it was possible to estimate 56 of the laboratory parameters in the monitoring stations investigated the influence of environmental characteristics on the optimization capacity of monitoring programs was evident the methodology used was not influenced by different water quality levels and anthropogenic impacts however the number of parameters was the most influential element in optimization monitoring programs with 20 or more water quality variables have the highest potential 44 of optimization by this methodology results demonstrate that this approach is a promising alternative that can reduce the frequency of analyses measured in the laboratory and increase the spatial and temporal coverage of water quality monitoring networks graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water quality parameters data based model monitoring network mining association rules river basins environmental management data for reference our data was made available in the mendeley data repository and the doi can be found in the article 1 introduction water monitoring is a widespread practice worldwide essential for planning and management water quality is currently seen as a multidisciplinary study field because it is intrinsically linked to public health poverty reduction environmental protection and social and economic development behmel et al 2018 jha et al 2020 barcellos et al 2021a the study of water quality allows characterizing the present planning the future and identifying the externalities of the urban phenomenon therefore many decisions are based on water quality monitoring programs wqmps related to environmental management and socio economic development strobl and robillard 2008 alilou et al 2018 water monitoring is essential for identifying pollution sources and their subsequent control and fundamental for environmental and urban water planning strobl et al 2006 behmel et al 2016 jiang et al 2020 the advances in monitoring allowed identification of new environmental pollutants resulting from industrialization such as micropollutants santos et al 2010 barcellos et al 2022 opening new fields of study and indicating new environmental and sanitary threats colborn et al 1996 chen et al 2012 however there are still many challenges of monitoring even concerning traditional water quality parameters in developing regions of latin america africa and asia pollution of many rivers is critical and feasible technical and management options are needed vörösmarty et al 2010 zhang et al 2010 chen et al 2012 pérez et al 2017 in these regions in addition to scarce financial resources water quality analysis laboratories and technical equipment are limited kumpel et al 2016 barcellos et al 2021a practical effective and efficient methodologies that can be used in the optimization stage of wqmps are a necessity in the developed and developing world the optimization of wqmps is a fruitful field that has found an important place in the scientific literature camara et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 optimization is a periodic evaluation task that aims to review and improve wqmps behmel et al 2016 this activity verifies whether the monitoring objectives have been met whether new objectives need to be established and may imply a reduction in the number of monitoring stations sampling frequency and water quality parameters wqps strobl and robillard 2008 khalil and ouarda 2009 behmel et al 2016 luz and kumpel 2020 in the phase of optimization of wqmps studies have mainly emphasized methodologies to reduce the number of monitoring stations ouyang 2005 pérez et al 2017 alilou et al 2018 camara et al 2020 varekar et al 2021 and the reduction in the number of wqps khalil et al 2010 chen et al 2020 barcellos et al 2021a to reduce the number of monitoring stations the main methods used are topological methods e g sharp 1971 multivariate statistics e g ouyang 2005 geostatistics e g or et al 2012 entropy information e g nikoo et al 2016 and optimization framework e g pérez et al 2017 while for reducing the number of wqps the most widely used methodology is multivariate statistics khalil and ouarda 2009 behmel et al 2016 jiang et al 2020 the statistical analyzes generally used to reduce the number of variables are correlation regression and pca principal component analysis correlation regression techniques have the advantage over pca of allowing the reconstruction of information from discontinued variables khalil and ouarda 2009 nonetheless both methods have the disadvantage of depending on a linear relationship between water quality variables barcellos et al 2021a these two approaches also lack a criterion to identify the combination of variables to be measured continuously and those to be discontinued khalil and ouarda 2009 however other methods are emerging with the potential to revolutionize the optimization of wqmps such as data mining data mining formed a new branch of knowledge in the 1960s which pragmatically seeks to extract valuable knowledge implicit in the data using machine learning as the primary technical basis han et al 2011 liao et al 2012 witten et al 2017 however the multidisciplinarity of data mining combines different areas of knowledge that go beyond the field of machine learning such as statistics expert systems data visualization techniques and high performance computing evsukoff and ebecken 2003 in the search for hidden patterns in the database data mining uses four different learning styles that can be combined or used in individualized ways witten et al 2017 1 classification learning aims to learn how to classify predict a phenomenon from the data the 2 numeric prediction is a variation of classification learning where the goal is a numerical and not categorical value in 3 association learning there is no emphasis on a particular class looking for any association between database variables in 4 clustering seeks to separate the database variables into groups data mining has already been successfully used for decision making in various areas of scientific knowledge such as urban management del busto pinzón and souza 2016 duarte et al 2016 public health management kargarfard et al 2015 souza 2018 barcellos et al 2021b and environmental management souza et al 2011 souza 2013 souza et al 2015 barcellos et al 2021a specifically in water quality few studies explore the potential of these promising techniques for optimizing wqmps especially in the developing world facing structural and technical problems barcellos et al 2021a few recent studies are using data mining for management of water quality adopting these new computational tools and technologies is already discussed as a new perspective for the water industry providing better comprehension of contaminants in wastewater origin pathways and persistence romero et al 2017 the optimization of water and sewage treatments are also discussed in the scientific literature as promising and viable perspectives to reduce energy consumption and maintain water quality within the desired standards asadi et al 2017 qiu et al 2018 mondejar et al 2021 the approach of data mining points to the future of planning and management in cities where artificial intelligence will be a support tool in smart cities the processes related to water treatment and water quality monitoring will have some degree of automation following this trend the development of water quality monitoring data platforms which are processed with data mining has already occurred mondejar et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 a substantial data mining contribution to management is the discovery of hidden patterns in the time series of water quality data deng and wang 2017 however most studies addressing data mining in the field of water quality have focused on the predictive potential of these techniques babbar and babbar 2017 delpla et al 2018 chen et al 2020 zounemat kermani et al 2020 recently a new approach has been developed to use data mining for the optimization of wqmps barcellos et al 2021a this approach was only applied on a local scale in two river basins in southern brazil and demonstrated significant potential to reduce the number of laboratory water quality variables monitored these resulted in considerable cost reduction by estimating laboratory variables from sets of association rules classification rules and results of variables measured in the field using automatic probes ec ph oxygen temperature and turbidity however further studies on this methodology are needed to validate its application in diverse environmental contexts and a greater scope of water quality variables in this article using data mining we developed data based models to optimize the wqmps of 35 monitoring stations in 27 different watersheds spread throughout the south southeast and midwest regions of brazil the objective was to reduce the number of laboratory wqps from association rules and field variables that automatic probes can measure the potential of this methodology was evaluated by investigating 60 wqps in different spatial time and water quality contexts optimizing wqmps is an alternative to reduce spending and consequently increase monitoring networks spatial and temporal scope it is an essential strategy in technical unavailability and scarcity of financial and human resources contexts for developing countries such as brazil where water monitoring is ineffective this valuable possibility can greatly support wqmps managers 2 methodology the data from 35 water quality monitoring stations were collected from the brazilian water resources information system https portal1 snirh gov br ana home webmap viewer html webmap 5d16701f24dd4c1ba13feb874977f092 this platform provides data from more than 4000 monitoring stations throughout brazil the selection of the monitoring stations investigated was based on three criteria 1 spatial homogeneity fig 1 monitoring stations must be in different regions of brazil to be able to evaluate the scope of the methodology with good spatial representativeness 2 monitoring stations must have 90 or more observations of data collection table 1 values lower than this are inadequate for pattern extraction due to the low number of observations 3 the water quality of the stations should present different patterns of variability according to the national sanitation foundation water quality index nsf wqi to allow the evaluation of the scope of the methodology in different water quality contexts and anthropogenic influences fig 2 the 35 monitoring stations selected fig 1 include eight states são paulo sp rio de janeiro rj rio grande do sul rs paraná pr minas gerais mg góias go mato grosso mt and mato grosso do sul ms from the south southeast and midwest regions of brazil the areas with the country s most extensive water quality monitoring networks in the north and northeast regions monitoring stations with 90 or more observations were also identified but with few wqps that were analyzed within a laboratory which was inappropriate for this study the selected sample gathered a total of 6328 water quality observations over the fifty years 1971 2021 the water quality variables that covered this study and its units are listed in table 2 in all monitoring stations the following field parameters were measured sample temperature ph dissolved oxygen turbidity and electrical conductivity while in just a few wqmps the color was a monitored field parameter the other variables variables that are analyzed within a laboratory of the wqmps for each of the 35 monitoring stations investigated are found in appendix a the nsf wqi was adapted differently for each state in brazil with small differences in variables and values that limit quality levels in this study the adaptation of the state of paraná was used in the adaptation of the nsf wqi of the state of paraná 2011 the values of 91 100 represent an optimal 71 90 good 51 70 reasonable 26 50 bad and 0 25 water quality poor in brazil natural waters are classified by their quality by resolution 357 2005 of the national council of the environment conama which determines the periodic bi monthly monitoring of water bodies brasil 2005 this resolution establishes the conditions and quality standards materialized by the concentration limits of water quality parameters for five different classes according to their predominant uses a parallel between the nsf wqi and the quality classes of conama resolution 357 2005 was established by paraná 2011 fig 2 a water quality considered good for the nsf wqi is the equivalent of the conditions and quality standards for class 2 rivers class 3 would be the equivalent of an nsf wqi considered reasonable while a quality index considered bad would be the equivalent of class 4 of the conama resolution the rivers that by conama resolution 357 2005 do not present quality standards and conditions of one of the four classes established by the standard are considered as non classifiable class 5 and equivalent to poor quality in the nsf wqi most brazilian rivers at the water resources information system base have class 3 quality conditions and standards eight class 2 eighteen class 3 three class 4 and three non classifiable class 5 monitoring stations were selected fig 2 no class 1 monitoring station was identified within the criteria of the established sample clipping 2 1 associative rules mining the methodological path taken in this investigation was similar to that proposed and applied by barcellos et al 2021a in two river basins of a metropolis in southern brazil however the emphasis in this article was especially the extraction of association rules which was the methodological stage effectively capable of reducing the number of variables of wqmps the data extracted from the water resources information system were standardized cleaned and their outliers omitted in microsoft excel the standardization and cleaning steps included the removal of zeros not detected nd and lines and columns with information not referring to water quality e g time date legends and code of monitoring stations then the worksheets were organized so that their beginning and end always started in the same cell to facilitate the discretization step the first filtering of the data was performed by counting the values of each variable the variables with less than 31 observations were excluded from the database in statistical theory samples larger than 30 are commonly considered large enough large sample size then new terminology was assigned to the water quality variables and their maximum minimum and tertiles with frequencies were identified in each variable at this stage the maximum and minimum values made it possible to identify outliers by their order of magnitude and these were omitted the data from each watershed were discretized according to the concentration limits of the quality classes of resolution 357 2005 third column of table 2 the variables that do not reflect the conditions and quality standards of the conama resolution were discretized according to the variability of its statistical tertile 0 33 33 66 and 66 100 at that station the raw data from the 35 monitoring stations their geographic coordinates and the entire data preparation step processed data including equations for discretization of data in microsoft excel and the final format that the data must be to be accepted by the cba software at each of the monitoring stations are available at mendeley data http dx doi org 10 17632 rd38fspn8c 1 in the cba software the data were processed in their original settings the processing took place with the run with multiple support that adapts the minimum support chosen to the frequency of each variable the support and confidence chosen were 10 and 90 support s and confidence c are the two statistical parameters used for filter rules in cba confidence refers to the percentage of times the antecedent condition resulted in the consequent condition while support is the percentage of times the rule occurred given the consequent condition in relation to the total observations of the database the minimum accepted values for support and confidence were chosen considering the size of the data series support values 10 may not indicate a pattern while confidence values 90 may indicate a pattern with low reliability more extensive data series can accept lower support and confidence the discretized data were processed in the classification based on associations cba version 2 0 software of the school of computing national university of singapore liu et al 1998 cba is a tool capable of integrating association and classification rules association and classification rules depict cause and effect if then relationships occurring in the database classification rules are generated from the rules and have a predetermined target classification rules search within a dataset by associative patterns expressed by association rules capable of classifying a chosen variable a predetermined target this type of rule can also be used for creating prediction models if the data is organized on a regular timescale classification rules are knowledge acquired by a database about a phenomenon that is mathematically validated for classifying predicting that phenomenon in other datasets association rules extract existing association patterns throughout the database all variables without a predetermined target that cannot be used for prediction these rules reveal associative patterns between the variables elucidating cause and effect relationships studies have successfully used association explanatory models and classification predictive models rules in different areas of knowledge souza and ebecken 2011 souza 2013 kargarfard et al 2015 souza et al 2015 del busto pinzón and souza 2016 souza 2018 barcellos et al 2021b in this study the objective was to estimate the condition of water quality through explanatory models so that a parameter measured at that moment cause can explain other parameters effect and reduce the number of laboratory variables of the wqmps the emphasis in this paper was especially on association rules association rules suit the hegemonic context of wqmps in brazil and other developing countries in these regions monitoring is not periodic and there are many data gaps it is provided by law in brazil conama resolution 357 2005 that the monitoring of rivers should be bimonthly but in practice this does not happen the periodicity of water monitoring in brazil is irregular in this context the association rules are appropriate techniques because they do not need the data organization on a regular timescale and can generate helpful knowledge even with high rates of data gaps the small variability of some variables and many holes are challenges even for multivariate statistical techniques the rules have a consequent c and an antecedent a so if a 200 then c 50 therefore in this study the estimation of variables measured in the laboratory occurs from a mathematical model association rules which relates a known input variables measured by automatic probe or already estimated by other rules and categorizes the values of the output target variables measured in the laboratory first we sought rules to estimate the variables measured in the laboratory from intervals of variables measured with automatic probes when these rules were exhausted an attempt was made to identify by the already known intervals the parameters measured in the laboratory that were estimated the output of those variables measured in the laboratory that were still unknown the models have the categorical intervals of the brazilian water classification legislation or tertiles low medium and high as input and output in addition to the statistical criteria support and confidence of cba the selection of rules occurred considering the physical chemical and microbiological coherence of the pattern expressed by the rule to observe the coherence of the rules knowledge of relationships seen in the literature is necessary therefore in this study when we refer to variables estimated by monitoring station it means that acceptable association rules can be created for a percentage of variables based on the criteria of 10 support and 90 confidence 3 results and discussion the results of this investigation are presented in three steps first is contextualized an example of wqmp optimization by presenting and discussing the results of one of the river basins investigated by this study then the general optimization results are presented in the 35 monitoring stations and each station s estimated water quality variables finally the factors that interfere with the potential for optimization of wqmps are discussed 3 1 optimization of wqmps in tietê river basin we chose to contextualize the results of optimization of water quality monitoring programs by presenting the rules of the tiete river basin in southeastern brazil this basin was one of the 27 river basins selected and three monitoring stations along the tietê river were investigated the tietê river is more than 1100 km long crosses the entire state of são paulo practically from east to west and has different levels of water quality fig 3 this river basin is a tributary of the paraná river has a stretch used as a waterway several dams built in its course and is also an important urban river that marks the geography of the city of são paulo the largest metropolis in the americas the tietê river 1 monitoring station is the closest to the springs located in the serra do mar mountains and has a reasonable water quality level the tietê river ecologic park station is within the metropolis of são paulo as is typical of brazilian urban rivers it presents a poor water quality primarily due to the high rates of water pollution derived from domestic sewage fig 3 the tietê river station is downstream of the promissão hydroelectric power plant dam near its mouth on the paraná river where the river already has a large flow rate and a good water quality level it was possible to estimate 86 of the laboratory parameters at tietê river station 78 in tietê river 1 and 83 in tietê river ecologic park fig 3 in tables 3 5 there are a set of association rules selected for the three stations for monitoring the water quality of the tietê river the rules presented in the tables are a selection of the total rules extracted for those stations which can be found in appendix b for these three monitoring stations use of association rules and measure with automatic probes allow estimated value ranges for 80 of the laboratory values in the monitoring programs considered the field variables of these three stations are turbidity dissolved oxygen conductivity temperature and ph in tietê river ecologic park table 3 laboratory parameters that could not be estimated are sulfates copper total coliforms and phosphorus in tietê river station table 4 the laboratory parameters that could not be estimated are total coliforms nitrogen and cadmium while at tietê river 1 station table 5 the laboratory parameters that could not be estimated are cod nitrogen total coliforms and total solids it is necessary to measure cadmium sulfates copper and phosphorus to comply with the brazilian water monitoring legislation therefore in tietê river 1 station the association rules dispense with the need for laboratory analysis at tietê river and tietê river ecologic park stations it is necessary to measure cadmium in the first and sulfates copper and phosphorus in the second to comply with brazilian legislation the rules of tables 3 5 demonstrate the redundancy of variables that have their monitoring required by law as is the case of the rule of row 13 of these three tables the association between nitrate and nitrite is well known in the scientific literature and is part of a stage of the biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen ammonia in aquatic environments is converted by aerobic nitrification into nitrite and then converted to nitrate singh et al 2018 valencia castañeda et al 2020 in the case of the tietê river basin for compliance with brazilian legislation it is not necessary to measure nitrite if nitrate is measured this same associative pattern expressed by the rule was also identified in the monitoring stations of two river basins in southern brazil barcellos et al 2021a another highlight of the rules is the associated potential between field variables and important laboratory variables in the three monitoring stations it is possible to estimate nitrate and nitrite if water turbidity is known turbidity could be seen as a proxy for sediment and hence bound nutrients in the case of tables 5 and 6 it is possible with turbidity to estimate even ammoniacal nitrogen an this associative pattern is also already known in the scientific literature fresh or more concentrated sewage presents high levels of ammoniacal nitrogen and suspended solids in water increasing turbidity von sperling 2005 dissolved oxygen do and electrical conductivity are two other important parameters especially in tables 4 and 5 the concentration of dissolved oxygen in water is related to microbiological activity and the regulation of several biogeochemical cycles stajkowski et al 2020 thus it allows for an evaluation of the trophic state indicating biological changes in water and the availability of organic matter heddam and kisi 2018 electrical conductivity ec may indicate changes in the chemical composition of water and its increase presents a demonstrated inverse relationship with aquatic life thompson et al 2012 conductivity may reflect the geological composition of the river basin but it may also be related to ionic pollutants from anthropogenic sources kney and brandes 2007 with the help of the association rules these consolidated parameters of water quality such as turbidity oxygen and conductivity can be used more intelligently by the managers of the wqmps and allow the increase in the spacing of laboratory analyses saving financial and human resources 3 2 optimization of wqmps in south southeast and midwest regions of brazil the 35 monitoring stations studied reflect different contexts of water quality geography and structuring of monitoring programs however the methodology used was successful in optimizing monitoring programs a total of 2 142 139 association rules were generated and 1740 were selected the number of rules developed for each monitoring station was not correlated with the optimization capacity of monitoring programs monitoring stations with more rules generated did not always have a more significant optimization potential in their monitoring programs association rules represent patterns in the database and these are not always related to target variables table 6 shows the water quality variables that can be estimated in each monitoring station through the set of rules of association and the use of automatic probes appendix a contains detailed information on each monitoring station with the field and laboratory variables that could not be estimated the total rules generated for each monitoring station and the total number of rules selected the set of rules for each monitoring station to estimate the parameters of table 6 are in appendix b and can be used to estimate these parameters at these monitoring stations with this set of rules it is possible to comply with the requirements demanded by the brazilian legislation of monitoring water quality the use of the rules represents the minimization of human and financial resources and the possibility of increasing the temporal and spatial scope of the sampling networks the association rules approach should be permitted by law in developing regions that have difficulties carrying out their mandatory monitoring programs this strategy can be valuable especially for developing countries the variables estimated by association rules can be monitored with larger spacing this approach of discontinuing the measurement of some variables and estimating them from auxiliary variables was also proposed with other methodologies khalil et al 2010 but can discontinue a smaller number of variables bod was the laboratory variable with the highest optimization potential in the monitoring stations investigated it is possible to estimate bod in 33 monitoring stations through other parameters with automatic probes and association rules table 6 this variable was also estimated in three of the four stations in which this method was applied in southern brazil barcellos et al 2021a the correlation of this parameter with other physical chemical and microbiological characteristics of water is well reported in the scientific literature bod is associated with the biodegradable fraction of carbonaceous organic matter and also can be impacted by nitrogen species and reactions being very sensitive to indicate the presence of other substances in water e g chlorides von sperling 2005 lee et al 2016 christian et al 2017 bod involves characteristics at the threshold between the physical chemical and microbiological domains of water these interfaces ensured that bod could be estimated by physical chemical and microbiological parameters in this study likely using the association rules and the field parameters measured with the automatic probes is possible to estimate bod in most watersheds estimating bod means optimizing human and financial resources beyond saving time since your laboratory test requires five days 3 3 factors influencing the optimization of wqmps although this research covers different regions of brazil water quality levels and monitoring programs of different spatial and time dimensions the factor that seems to be more related to optimizing the association rules is the number of variables monitored more data typically leads to some increase in model performance in machine learning the selected monitoring stations showed different trends in optimizing monitoring programs according to the region of the country in which they are a part south southeast and midwest shown in fig 1 it is natural that environmental conditions such as climate soil and geological constitution change environmental meanings and variability of water quality parameters griffith et al 1999 kney and brandes 2007 thompson et al 2012 omernik et al 2016 the average percentage of laboratory parameters estimated by this approach in the monitoring stations of these three regions shows contrast in environmental conditions it was possible to estimate 72 of laboratory parameters in the southeast region in the midwest region 55 and only 20 in the south region the trend lines of fig 4 demonstrate the mean variability in the optimization potential between the estimated parameters and the total parameters in each monitoring program fig 4 shows that the slope of the trend lines of the monitoring stations of the three areas of the country studied is also remarkably different especially in the south region which indicates different potentials of optimization of monitoring programs by region however the southeast and midwest region trend lines represent a similar trend that can form the same group with a more extensive sample set the linear correlation coefficients of the three different regions studied denote a strong r 0 89 and positive correlation the influence of the different environmental conformations of these three regions on the optimization capacity of wqmps is a hypothesis that other studies should investigate it is noteworthy that the brazilian territory is divided into seven ecoregions according to the relief feature soil types vegetation forms and climatic hydrological conditions ab sáber 2021 which have no relation to the political boundaries established by the three regions studied these ecoregions are probably more suitable dividers to understand the environmental influence on the optimization capacity of wqmp the 35 monitoring stations investigated are located in four different brazilian ecoregions these seven ecoregions can also be partitioned into eighteen other ecoregions characterized by the uniformity of climate soil and vegetation coutinho 2016 it is necessary to study how the basal changes in the level of water quality and the variability of water quality parameters occur in these ecoregions in countries with a large continental area changes in environmental conditions are essential and can be responsible for large fluctuations in water quality griffith et al 1999 kney and brandes 2007 thompson et al 2012 omernik et al 2016 there are few investigations in brazil about this there is no evidence that the optimization capacity of monitoring programs is influenced by water quality fig 3 in the monitoring stations with good water quality it was possible to estimate on average 66 of laboratory parameters 65 in bad quality stations 55 in reasonable quality stations and 35 when the quality was poor the highlighted fall in optimization capacity when water quality is poor seems to be related to a low number of monitoring variables table 1 fig 3 and appendix a the small number of brazilian rivers in this quality range and the low number of sampling frequency make any generalization in this sense challenging however it is expected that there are a more significant number of associative patterns in waters that have the same primary source of variability such as urban rivers contaminated by domestic sewage andrianova et al 2019 salim et al 2019 baghanam et al 2020 barcellos et al 2021a therefore it is essential that in other studies a classification is also adopted that considers the different levels of water quality and evaluates these influences in the optimization of monitoring programs considering the entire sample set fig 5 there is an increasing relation between increasing the number of parameters of monitoring programs with increasing the optimization capacity of the sampling networks which becomes more pronounced the higher the total parameters in fig 5 it is possible to visualize the directly proportional correlation between the total parameters and the parameters that can be estimated with the aid of association rules r 0 86 the trend line is more inclined towards the x axis this is evident compared to the dashed line in fig 5 the 45 axis the point on the graph where the values of the dependent and independent variables vary proportionally this indicates a progressive increase in the ability to optimize monitoring programs as there is an increase in the number of variables the trend line of this graph shows that for monitoring programs with 18 parameters it is possible to estimate seven laboratory variables about 39 of the monitored parameters while for programs with 30 parameters it is possible to estimate 16 laboratory variables about 53 of the monitored parameters paradoxically these results suggest that the greater the number of variables of monitoring programs the greater their capacity to optimize investing in automatic probes capable of determining a more comprehensive range of variables can be a promising alternative that increases the number of field variables in monitoring programs and using rules further reduces the periodic need for more complex and costly laboratory analyses institutions responsible for managing and operating wqmps such as cetesb sp environmental company of the state of são paulo iat pr water and earth institute igam mg minas gerais institute for water management cprm geological service of brazil imasul ms environment institute of mato grosso do sul sema mt secretary of state for the environment of mato grosso and ana national water agency can benefit this approach on the other hand there was no significant influence of increased observations sampling frequency on the optimization capacity of monitoring programs the linear correlation coefficient between these variables was 0 45 in the two monitoring programs with the highest sampling frequency that are iguaçu river 1 with 509 and uruguay river with 464 table 1 it was possible to estimate one parameter 10 of laboratory variables and eight parameters about 27 of laboratory variables fig 3 while in the two stations with lower sampling frequency paranaíba river with 90 and do peixe river with 98 it was possible to estimate respectively 15 parameters about 83 of laboratory variables and 22 parameters 88 of laboratory variables table 1 and fig 3 these findings contradict the hypothesis of barcellos et al 2021a which with the increase of observations the rules could estimate a larger number of parameters however this can be the effect of many factors in the study conducted by barcellos et al 2021a the data were organized temporally and the number of samples taken over the period of record of monitoring in relation to time in the studied basins was similar to the average of this study the basins studied by this author are a very particular and rare case of high sample frequency without interruptions in monitoring water in brazil in this study barcellos et al 2021a in 11 years of monitoring the sampling frequency was bimonthly monitoring for 132 months simultaneously in four monitoring stations of two river basins in this article the average sampling frequency is 181 but the average monitoring period is 29 years with an interruption period in monitoring for a few years in several stations in sampling stations with more frequent and uninterrupted monitoring the increase in observations may result in a greater capacity for optimization another aspect of this study that seems to have influenced the optimization capacity of monitoring programs is the database s voids the variables with the highest regularity in the database were those that the rules were able to estimate such as the case of bod variables with constant monitoring but small variability were also challenging to estimate using the rules the average percentage of the estimate of laboratory variables in the 35 monitoring stations investigated was about 56 with a median of 61 values are slightly lower than those found by barcellos et al 2021a on a regional scale however these values are higher than those of other studies that sought to reduce the number of monitoring variables khalil et al 2010 noori et al 2010 pinto and maheshwari 2011 this can be explained by the association rules identifying nonlinear associative patterns different from traditional methodologies such as pca that are limited to linear patterns the variability of the percentage of estimation of laboratory variables was quite particular in each monitoring station and can be observed in fig 3 these findings show the great potential of this methodology that was applied extensively throughout the brazilian territory in different environmental and water quality contexts in this study even in a context of low sample frequency as is the reality in brazil and many other developing countries the association rules are viable tools reducing the frequency of laboratory analyses can reduce the costs of monitoring using the association rules as a support tool the use of association rules to optimize monitoring programs is a promising methodology especially for developing countries thus it is feasible that there are cutting criteria in the scope of monitoring programs so that the association rules can more substantially assist the monitoring of water our findings suggest that monitoring that measures a number lower than 20 variables seems to have a less promising optimization capability fig 6 some monitoring stations such as uruguay river paraná river ribeirão piracicamirim and ribeirão dos toledos are exceptions as shown in fig 6 the first two have many monitoring variables but a low percentage of the estimate of laboratory variables while the latter two had a percentage of parameters estimated bigger or equal to 50 but had a small number of variables without considering the exceptions monitoring stations with more than 20 variables with the lowest optimization potential were dourados river with 44 and cuiabá river 1 with 47 some limitations of this study should be considered by other investigations and even weighted for the application of this approach this methodology can only be applied in basins where there is a long standing wqmp the cost of adding monitoring to be able to estimate a wider range of parameters can also be of nil benefit discretization based on legislation allows legal meeting requirements but changes the variability of the data and hides some patterns thereby when applying this approach to a wqmp or a watershed it is important to understand the variability of the data correlation variance clustering i g and the context topography hydrography land use anthropogenic influence i g as was done for example in barcellos et al 2021a moreover the reduction in parameters could lead to the non detection of new sources of water quality issues therefore explanatory models based on association rules cannot be considered a substitute approach for traditional wqmp optimization methods but another tool capable of offering assistance 4 conclusion the study demonstrates that this methodology is feasible and can make a valuable contribution to the wqmps the explanatory models developed can be used by managers to optimize the wqmp in these stations laboratory parameters can be estimated and their measurement in the laboratory can be further spaced with the use of this methodology the set of monitoring stations investigated allowed us to conclude that 1 the environmental characteristics of monitoring stations influence the optimization capacity of wqmps 2 in the optimization of wqmps using association rule mining different levels of water quality and anthropogenic influence be not influential factors in optimization capacity 3 the amount of wqps is the most influential aspect in optimizing wqmps using association rule mining 4 the number of 20 or more wqps has been identified as the recommended for wqmps that use association rule mining for their optimization credit authorship contribution

15796,water quality monitoring programs are essential planning and management tools but they face many challenges in the developing world the scarcity of financial and human resources and the unavailability of infrastructure often make it impossible to meet the legal requirements of water monitoring many approaches to optimizing water quality monitoring programs have already been proposed however few investigations have developed and tested data mining for this purpose this article has developed data based models to reduce the number of water quality parameters of monitoring programs using data mining the objective was to extract patterns from the database expressed by association rules which together with field parameters measured with automatic probes can estimate laboratory variables this approach was applied in 35 monitoring stations along 27 river basins throughout brazil the data are from fifty years of monitoring 1971 2021 constituting 6328 observations of 60 water quality parameters investigated in different environmental contexts water quality and the structuring of monitoring programs with the applied approach it was possible to estimate 56 of the laboratory parameters in the monitoring stations investigated the influence of environmental characteristics on the optimization capacity of monitoring programs was evident the methodology used was not influenced by different water quality levels and anthropogenic impacts however the number of parameters was the most influential element in optimization monitoring programs with 20 or more water quality variables have the highest potential 44 of optimization by this methodology results demonstrate that this approach is a promising alternative that can reduce the frequency of analyses measured in the laboratory and increase the spatial and temporal coverage of water quality monitoring networks graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water quality parameters data based model monitoring network mining association rules river basins environmental management data for reference our data was made available in the mendeley data repository and the doi can be found in the article 1 introduction water monitoring is a widespread practice worldwide essential for planning and management water quality is currently seen as a multidisciplinary study field because it is intrinsically linked to public health poverty reduction environmental protection and social and economic development behmel et al 2018 jha et al 2020 barcellos et al 2021a the study of water quality allows characterizing the present planning the future and identifying the externalities of the urban phenomenon therefore many decisions are based on water quality monitoring programs wqmps related to environmental management and socio economic development strobl and robillard 2008 alilou et al 2018 water monitoring is essential for identifying pollution sources and their subsequent control and fundamental for environmental and urban water planning strobl et al 2006 behmel et al 2016 jiang et al 2020 the advances in monitoring allowed identification of new environmental pollutants resulting from industrialization such as micropollutants santos et al 2010 barcellos et al 2022 opening new fields of study and indicating new environmental and sanitary threats colborn et al 1996 chen et al 2012 however there are still many challenges of monitoring even concerning traditional water quality parameters in developing regions of latin america africa and asia pollution of many rivers is critical and feasible technical and management options are needed vörösmarty et al 2010 zhang et al 2010 chen et al 2012 pérez et al 2017 in these regions in addition to scarce financial resources water quality analysis laboratories and technical equipment are limited kumpel et al 2016 barcellos et al 2021a practical effective and efficient methodologies that can be used in the optimization stage of wqmps are a necessity in the developed and developing world the optimization of wqmps is a fruitful field that has found an important place in the scientific literature camara et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 optimization is a periodic evaluation task that aims to review and improve wqmps behmel et al 2016 this activity verifies whether the monitoring objectives have been met whether new objectives need to be established and may imply a reduction in the number of monitoring stations sampling frequency and water quality parameters wqps strobl and robillard 2008 khalil and ouarda 2009 behmel et al 2016 luz and kumpel 2020 in the phase of optimization of wqmps studies have mainly emphasized methodologies to reduce the number of monitoring stations ouyang 2005 pérez et al 2017 alilou et al 2018 camara et al 2020 varekar et al 2021 and the reduction in the number of wqps khalil et al 2010 chen et al 2020 barcellos et al 2021a to reduce the number of monitoring stations the main methods used are topological methods e g sharp 1971 multivariate statistics e g ouyang 2005 geostatistics e g or et al 2012 entropy information e g nikoo et al 2016 and optimization framework e g pérez et al 2017 while for reducing the number of wqps the most widely used methodology is multivariate statistics khalil and ouarda 2009 behmel et al 2016 jiang et al 2020 the statistical analyzes generally used to reduce the number of variables are correlation regression and pca principal component analysis correlation regression techniques have the advantage over pca of allowing the reconstruction of information from discontinued variables khalil and ouarda 2009 nonetheless both methods have the disadvantage of depending on a linear relationship between water quality variables barcellos et al 2021a these two approaches also lack a criterion to identify the combination of variables to be measured continuously and those to be discontinued khalil and ouarda 2009 however other methods are emerging with the potential to revolutionize the optimization of wqmps such as data mining data mining formed a new branch of knowledge in the 1960s which pragmatically seeks to extract valuable knowledge implicit in the data using machine learning as the primary technical basis han et al 2011 liao et al 2012 witten et al 2017 however the multidisciplinarity of data mining combines different areas of knowledge that go beyond the field of machine learning such as statistics expert systems data visualization techniques and high performance computing evsukoff and ebecken 2003 in the search for hidden patterns in the database data mining uses four different learning styles that can be combined or used in individualized ways witten et al 2017 1 classification learning aims to learn how to classify predict a phenomenon from the data the 2 numeric prediction is a variation of classification learning where the goal is a numerical and not categorical value in 3 association learning there is no emphasis on a particular class looking for any association between database variables in 4 clustering seeks to separate the database variables into groups data mining has already been successfully used for decision making in various areas of scientific knowledge such as urban management del busto pinzón and souza 2016 duarte et al 2016 public health management kargarfard et al 2015 souza 2018 barcellos et al 2021b and environmental management souza et al 2011 souza 2013 souza et al 2015 barcellos et al 2021a specifically in water quality few studies explore the potential of these promising techniques for optimizing wqmps especially in the developing world facing structural and technical problems barcellos et al 2021a few recent studies are using data mining for management of water quality adopting these new computational tools and technologies is already discussed as a new perspective for the water industry providing better comprehension of contaminants in wastewater origin pathways and persistence romero et al 2017 the optimization of water and sewage treatments are also discussed in the scientific literature as promising and viable perspectives to reduce energy consumption and maintain water quality within the desired standards asadi et al 2017 qiu et al 2018 mondejar et al 2021 the approach of data mining points to the future of planning and management in cities where artificial intelligence will be a support tool in smart cities the processes related to water treatment and water quality monitoring will have some degree of automation following this trend the development of water quality monitoring data platforms which are processed with data mining has already occurred mondejar et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 a substantial data mining contribution to management is the discovery of hidden patterns in the time series of water quality data deng and wang 2017 however most studies addressing data mining in the field of water quality have focused on the predictive potential of these techniques babbar and babbar 2017 delpla et al 2018 chen et al 2020 zounemat kermani et al 2020 recently a new approach has been developed to use data mining for the optimization of wqmps barcellos et al 2021a this approach was only applied on a local scale in two river basins in southern brazil and demonstrated significant potential to reduce the number of laboratory water quality variables monitored these resulted in considerable cost reduction by estimating laboratory variables from sets of association rules classification rules and results of variables measured in the field using automatic probes ec ph oxygen temperature and turbidity however further studies on this methodology are needed to validate its application in diverse environmental contexts and a greater scope of water quality variables in this article using data mining we developed data based models to optimize the wqmps of 35 monitoring stations in 27 different watersheds spread throughout the south southeast and midwest regions of brazil the objective was to reduce the number of laboratory wqps from association rules and field variables that automatic probes can measure the potential of this methodology was evaluated by investigating 60 wqps in different spatial time and water quality contexts optimizing wqmps is an alternative to reduce spending and consequently increase monitoring networks spatial and temporal scope it is an essential strategy in technical unavailability and scarcity of financial and human resources contexts for developing countries such as brazil where water monitoring is ineffective this valuable possibility can greatly support wqmps managers 2 methodology the data from 35 water quality monitoring stations were collected from the brazilian water resources information system https portal1 snirh gov br ana home webmap viewer html webmap 5d16701f24dd4c1ba13feb874977f092 this platform provides data from more than 4000 monitoring stations throughout brazil the selection of the monitoring stations investigated was based on three criteria 1 spatial homogeneity fig 1 monitoring stations must be in different regions of brazil to be able to evaluate the scope of the methodology with good spatial representativeness 2 monitoring stations must have 90 or more observations of data collection table 1 values lower than this are inadequate for pattern extraction due to the low number of observations 3 the water quality of the stations should present different patterns of variability according to the national sanitation foundation water quality index nsf wqi to allow the evaluation of the scope of the methodology in different water quality contexts and anthropogenic influences fig 2 the 35 monitoring stations selected fig 1 include eight states são paulo sp rio de janeiro rj rio grande do sul rs paraná pr minas gerais mg góias go mato grosso mt and mato grosso do sul ms from the south southeast and midwest regions of brazil the areas with the country s most extensive water quality monitoring networks in the north and northeast regions monitoring stations with 90 or more observations were also identified but with few wqps that were analyzed within a laboratory which was inappropriate for this study the selected sample gathered a total of 6328 water quality observations over the fifty years 1971 2021 the water quality variables that covered this study and its units are listed in table 2 in all monitoring stations the following field parameters were measured sample temperature ph dissolved oxygen turbidity and electrical conductivity while in just a few wqmps the color was a monitored field parameter the other variables variables that are analyzed within a laboratory of the wqmps for each of the 35 monitoring stations investigated are found in appendix a the nsf wqi was adapted differently for each state in brazil with small differences in variables and values that limit quality levels in this study the adaptation of the state of paraná was used in the adaptation of the nsf wqi of the state of paraná 2011 the values of 91 100 represent an optimal 71 90 good 51 70 reasonable 26 50 bad and 0 25 water quality poor in brazil natural waters are classified by their quality by resolution 357 2005 of the national council of the environment conama which determines the periodic bi monthly monitoring of water bodies brasil 2005 this resolution establishes the conditions and quality standards materialized by the concentration limits of water quality parameters for five different classes according to their predominant uses a parallel between the nsf wqi and the quality classes of conama resolution 357 2005 was established by paraná 2011 fig 2 a water quality considered good for the nsf wqi is the equivalent of the conditions and quality standards for class 2 rivers class 3 would be the equivalent of an nsf wqi considered reasonable while a quality index considered bad would be the equivalent of class 4 of the conama resolution the rivers that by conama resolution 357 2005 do not present quality standards and conditions of one of the four classes established by the standard are considered as non classifiable class 5 and equivalent to poor quality in the nsf wqi most brazilian rivers at the water resources information system base have class 3 quality conditions and standards eight class 2 eighteen class 3 three class 4 and three non classifiable class 5 monitoring stations were selected fig 2 no class 1 monitoring station was identified within the criteria of the established sample clipping 2 1 associative rules mining the methodological path taken in this investigation was similar to that proposed and applied by barcellos et al 2021a in two river basins of a metropolis in southern brazil however the emphasis in this article was especially the extraction of association rules which was the methodological stage effectively capable of reducing the number of variables of wqmps the data extracted from the water resources information system were standardized cleaned and their outliers omitted in microsoft excel the standardization and cleaning steps included the removal of zeros not detected nd and lines and columns with information not referring to water quality e g time date legends and code of monitoring stations then the worksheets were organized so that their beginning and end always started in the same cell to facilitate the discretization step the first filtering of the data was performed by counting the values of each variable the variables with less than 31 observations were excluded from the database in statistical theory samples larger than 30 are commonly considered large enough large sample size then new terminology was assigned to the water quality variables and their maximum minimum and tertiles with frequencies were identified in each variable at this stage the maximum and minimum values made it possible to identify outliers by their order of magnitude and these were omitted the data from each watershed were discretized according to the concentration limits of the quality classes of resolution 357 2005 third column of table 2 the variables that do not reflect the conditions and quality standards of the conama resolution were discretized according to the variability of its statistical tertile 0 33 33 66 and 66 100 at that station the raw data from the 35 monitoring stations their geographic coordinates and the entire data preparation step processed data including equations for discretization of data in microsoft excel and the final format that the data must be to be accepted by the cba software at each of the monitoring stations are available at mendeley data http dx doi org 10 17632 rd38fspn8c 1 in the cba software the data were processed in their original settings the processing took place with the run with multiple support that adapts the minimum support chosen to the frequency of each variable the support and confidence chosen were 10 and 90 support s and confidence c are the two statistical parameters used for filter rules in cba confidence refers to the percentage of times the antecedent condition resulted in the consequent condition while support is the percentage of times the rule occurred given the consequent condition in relation to the total observations of the database the minimum accepted values for support and confidence were chosen considering the size of the data series support values 10 may not indicate a pattern while confidence values 90 may indicate a pattern with low reliability more extensive data series can accept lower support and confidence the discretized data were processed in the classification based on associations cba version 2 0 software of the school of computing national university of singapore liu et al 1998 cba is a tool capable of integrating association and classification rules association and classification rules depict cause and effect if then relationships occurring in the database classification rules are generated from the rules and have a predetermined target classification rules search within a dataset by associative patterns expressed by association rules capable of classifying a chosen variable a predetermined target this type of rule can also be used for creating prediction models if the data is organized on a regular timescale classification rules are knowledge acquired by a database about a phenomenon that is mathematically validated for classifying predicting that phenomenon in other datasets association rules extract existing association patterns throughout the database all variables without a predetermined target that cannot be used for prediction these rules reveal associative patterns between the variables elucidating cause and effect relationships studies have successfully used association explanatory models and classification predictive models rules in different areas of knowledge souza and ebecken 2011 souza 2013 kargarfard et al 2015 souza et al 2015 del busto pinzón and souza 2016 souza 2018 barcellos et al 2021b in this study the objective was to estimate the condition of water quality through explanatory models so that a parameter measured at that moment cause can explain other parameters effect and reduce the number of laboratory variables of the wqmps the emphasis in this paper was especially on association rules association rules suit the hegemonic context of wqmps in brazil and other developing countries in these regions monitoring is not periodic and there are many data gaps it is provided by law in brazil conama resolution 357 2005 that the monitoring of rivers should be bimonthly but in practice this does not happen the periodicity of water monitoring in brazil is irregular in this context the association rules are appropriate techniques because they do not need the data organization on a regular timescale and can generate helpful knowledge even with high rates of data gaps the small variability of some variables and many holes are challenges even for multivariate statistical techniques the rules have a consequent c and an antecedent a so if a 200 then c 50 therefore in this study the estimation of variables measured in the laboratory occurs from a mathematical model association rules which relates a known input variables measured by automatic probe or already estimated by other rules and categorizes the values of the output target variables measured in the laboratory first we sought rules to estimate the variables measured in the laboratory from intervals of variables measured with automatic probes when these rules were exhausted an attempt was made to identify by the already known intervals the parameters measured in the laboratory that were estimated the output of those variables measured in the laboratory that were still unknown the models have the categorical intervals of the brazilian water classification legislation or tertiles low medium and high as input and output in addition to the statistical criteria support and confidence of cba the selection of rules occurred considering the physical chemical and microbiological coherence of the pattern expressed by the rule to observe the coherence of the rules knowledge of relationships seen in the literature is necessary therefore in this study when we refer to variables estimated by monitoring station it means that acceptable association rules can be created for a percentage of variables based on the criteria of 10 support and 90 confidence 3 results and discussion the results of this investigation are presented in three steps first is contextualized an example of wqmp optimization by presenting and discussing the results of one of the river basins investigated by this study then the general optimization results are presented in the 35 monitoring stations and each station s estimated water quality variables finally the factors that interfere with the potential for optimization of wqmps are discussed 3 1 optimization of wqmps in tietê river basin we chose to contextualize the results of optimization of water quality monitoring programs by presenting the rules of the tiete river basin in southeastern brazil this basin was one of the 27 river basins selected and three monitoring stations along the tietê river were investigated the tietê river is more than 1100 km long crosses the entire state of são paulo practically from east to west and has different levels of water quality fig 3 this river basin is a tributary of the paraná river has a stretch used as a waterway several dams built in its course and is also an important urban river that marks the geography of the city of são paulo the largest metropolis in the americas the tietê river 1 monitoring station is the closest to the springs located in the serra do mar mountains and has a reasonable water quality level the tietê river ecologic park station is within the metropolis of são paulo as is typical of brazilian urban rivers it presents a poor water quality primarily due to the high rates of water pollution derived from domestic sewage fig 3 the tietê river station is downstream of the promissão hydroelectric power plant dam near its mouth on the paraná river where the river already has a large flow rate and a good water quality level it was possible to estimate 86 of the laboratory parameters at tietê river station 78 in tietê river 1 and 83 in tietê river ecologic park fig 3 in tables 3 5 there are a set of association rules selected for the three stations for monitoring the water quality of the tietê river the rules presented in the tables are a selection of the total rules extracted for those stations which can be found in appendix b for these three monitoring stations use of association rules and measure with automatic probes allow estimated value ranges for 80 of the laboratory values in the monitoring programs considered the field variables of these three stations are turbidity dissolved oxygen conductivity temperature and ph in tietê river ecologic park table 3 laboratory parameters that could not be estimated are sulfates copper total coliforms and phosphorus in tietê river station table 4 the laboratory parameters that could not be estimated are total coliforms nitrogen and cadmium while at tietê river 1 station table 5 the laboratory parameters that could not be estimated are cod nitrogen total coliforms and total solids it is necessary to measure cadmium sulfates copper and phosphorus to comply with the brazilian water monitoring legislation therefore in tietê river 1 station the association rules dispense with the need for laboratory analysis at tietê river and tietê river ecologic park stations it is necessary to measure cadmium in the first and sulfates copper and phosphorus in the second to comply with brazilian legislation the rules of tables 3 5 demonstrate the redundancy of variables that have their monitoring required by law as is the case of the rule of row 13 of these three tables the association between nitrate and nitrite is well known in the scientific literature and is part of a stage of the biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen ammonia in aquatic environments is converted by aerobic nitrification into nitrite and then converted to nitrate singh et al 2018 valencia castañeda et al 2020 in the case of the tietê river basin for compliance with brazilian legislation it is not necessary to measure nitrite if nitrate is measured this same associative pattern expressed by the rule was also identified in the monitoring stations of two river basins in southern brazil barcellos et al 2021a another highlight of the rules is the associated potential between field variables and important laboratory variables in the three monitoring stations it is possible to estimate nitrate and nitrite if water turbidity is known turbidity could be seen as a proxy for sediment and hence bound nutrients in the case of tables 5 and 6 it is possible with turbidity to estimate even ammoniacal nitrogen an this associative pattern is also already known in the scientific literature fresh or more concentrated sewage presents high levels of ammoniacal nitrogen and suspended solids in water increasing turbidity von sperling 2005 dissolved oxygen do and electrical conductivity are two other important parameters especially in tables 4 and 5 the concentration of dissolved oxygen in water is related to microbiological activity and the regulation of several biogeochemical cycles stajkowski et al 2020 thus it allows for an evaluation of the trophic state indicating biological changes in water and the availability of organic matter heddam and kisi 2018 electrical conductivity ec may indicate changes in the chemical composition of water and its increase presents a demonstrated inverse relationship with aquatic life thompson et al 2012 conductivity may reflect the geological composition of the river basin but it may also be related to ionic pollutants from anthropogenic sources kney and brandes 2007 with the help of the association rules these consolidated parameters of water quality such as turbidity oxygen and conductivity can be used more intelligently by the managers of the wqmps and allow the increase in the spacing of laboratory analyses saving financial and human resources 3 2 optimization of wqmps in south southeast and midwest regions of brazil the 35 monitoring stations studied reflect different contexts of water quality geography and structuring of monitoring programs however the methodology used was successful in optimizing monitoring programs a total of 2 142 139 association rules were generated and 1740 were selected the number of rules developed for each monitoring station was not correlated with the optimization capacity of monitoring programs monitoring stations with more rules generated did not always have a more significant optimization potential in their monitoring programs association rules represent patterns in the database and these are not always related to target variables table 6 shows the water quality variables that can be estimated in each monitoring station through the set of rules of association and the use of automatic probes appendix a contains detailed information on each monitoring station with the field and laboratory variables that could not be estimated the total rules generated for each monitoring station and the total number of rules selected the set of rules for each monitoring station to estimate the parameters of table 6 are in appendix b and can be used to estimate these parameters at these monitoring stations with this set of rules it is possible to comply with the requirements demanded by the brazilian legislation of monitoring water quality the use of the rules represents the minimization of human and financial resources and the possibility of increasing the temporal and spatial scope of the sampling networks the association rules approach should be permitted by law in developing regions that have difficulties carrying out their mandatory monitoring programs this strategy can be valuable especially for developing countries the variables estimated by association rules can be monitored with larger spacing this approach of discontinuing the measurement of some variables and estimating them from auxiliary variables was also proposed with other methodologies khalil et al 2010 but can discontinue a smaller number of variables bod was the laboratory variable with the highest optimization potential in the monitoring stations investigated it is possible to estimate bod in 33 monitoring stations through other parameters with automatic probes and association rules table 6 this variable was also estimated in three of the four stations in which this method was applied in southern brazil barcellos et al 2021a the correlation of this parameter with other physical chemical and microbiological characteristics of water is well reported in the scientific literature bod is associated with the biodegradable fraction of carbonaceous organic matter and also can be impacted by nitrogen species and reactions being very sensitive to indicate the presence of other substances in water e g chlorides von sperling 2005 lee et al 2016 christian et al 2017 bod involves characteristics at the threshold between the physical chemical and microbiological domains of water these interfaces ensured that bod could be estimated by physical chemical and microbiological parameters in this study likely using the association rules and the field parameters measured with the automatic probes is possible to estimate bod in most watersheds estimating bod means optimizing human and financial resources beyond saving time since your laboratory test requires five days 3 3 factors influencing the optimization of wqmps although this research covers different regions of brazil water quality levels and monitoring programs of different spatial and time dimensions the factor that seems to be more related to optimizing the association rules is the number of variables monitored more data typically leads to some increase in model performance in machine learning the selected monitoring stations showed different trends in optimizing monitoring programs according to the region of the country in which they are a part south southeast and midwest shown in fig 1 it is natural that environmental conditions such as climate soil and geological constitution change environmental meanings and variability of water quality parameters griffith et al 1999 kney and brandes 2007 thompson et al 2012 omernik et al 2016 the average percentage of laboratory parameters estimated by this approach in the monitoring stations of these three regions shows contrast in environmental conditions it was possible to estimate 72 of laboratory parameters in the southeast region in the midwest region 55 and only 20 in the south region the trend lines of fig 4 demonstrate the mean variability in the optimization potential between the estimated parameters and the total parameters in each monitoring program fig 4 shows that the slope of the trend lines of the monitoring stations of the three areas of the country studied is also remarkably different especially in the south region which indicates different potentials of optimization of monitoring programs by region however the southeast and midwest region trend lines represent a similar trend that can form the same group with a more extensive sample set the linear correlation coefficients of the three different regions studied denote a strong r 0 89 and positive correlation the influence of the different environmental conformations of these three regions on the optimization capacity of wqmps is a hypothesis that other studies should investigate it is noteworthy that the brazilian territory is divided into seven ecoregions according to the relief feature soil types vegetation forms and climatic hydrological conditions ab sáber 2021 which have no relation to the political boundaries established by the three regions studied these ecoregions are probably more suitable dividers to understand the environmental influence on the optimization capacity of wqmp the 35 monitoring stations investigated are located in four different brazilian ecoregions these seven ecoregions can also be partitioned into eighteen other ecoregions characterized by the uniformity of climate soil and vegetation coutinho 2016 it is necessary to study how the basal changes in the level of water quality and the variability of water quality parameters occur in these ecoregions in countries with a large continental area changes in environmental conditions are essential and can be responsible for large fluctuations in water quality griffith et al 1999 kney and brandes 2007 thompson et al 2012 omernik et al 2016 there are few investigations in brazil about this there is no evidence that the optimization capacity of monitoring programs is influenced by water quality fig 3 in the monitoring stations with good water quality it was possible to estimate on average 66 of laboratory parameters 65 in bad quality stations 55 in reasonable quality stations and 35 when the quality was poor the highlighted fall in optimization capacity when water quality is poor seems to be related to a low number of monitoring variables table 1 fig 3 and appendix a the small number of brazilian rivers in this quality range and the low number of sampling frequency make any generalization in this sense challenging however it is expected that there are a more significant number of associative patterns in waters that have the same primary source of variability such as urban rivers contaminated by domestic sewage andrianova et al 2019 salim et al 2019 baghanam et al 2020 barcellos et al 2021a therefore it is essential that in other studies a classification is also adopted that considers the different levels of water quality and evaluates these influences in the optimization of monitoring programs considering the entire sample set fig 5 there is an increasing relation between increasing the number of parameters of monitoring programs with increasing the optimization capacity of the sampling networks which becomes more pronounced the higher the total parameters in fig 5 it is possible to visualize the directly proportional correlation between the total parameters and the parameters that can be estimated with the aid of association rules r 0 86 the trend line is more inclined towards the x axis this is evident compared to the dashed line in fig 5 the 45 axis the point on the graph where the values of the dependent and independent variables vary proportionally this indicates a progressive increase in the ability to optimize monitoring programs as there is an increase in the number of variables the trend line of this graph shows that for monitoring programs with 18 parameters it is possible to estimate seven laboratory variables about 39 of the monitored parameters while for programs with 30 parameters it is possible to estimate 16 laboratory variables about 53 of the monitored parameters paradoxically these results suggest that the greater the number of variables of monitoring programs the greater their capacity to optimize investing in automatic probes capable of determining a more comprehensive range of variables can be a promising alternative that increases the number of field variables in monitoring programs and using rules further reduces the periodic need for more complex and costly laboratory analyses institutions responsible for managing and operating wqmps such as cetesb sp environmental company of the state of são paulo iat pr water and earth institute igam mg minas gerais institute for water management cprm geological service of brazil imasul ms environment institute of mato grosso do sul sema mt secretary of state for the environment of mato grosso and ana national water agency can benefit this approach on the other hand there was no significant influence of increased observations sampling frequency on the optimization capacity of monitoring programs the linear correlation coefficient between these variables was 0 45 in the two monitoring programs with the highest sampling frequency that are iguaçu river 1 with 509 and uruguay river with 464 table 1 it was possible to estimate one parameter 10 of laboratory variables and eight parameters about 27 of laboratory variables fig 3 while in the two stations with lower sampling frequency paranaíba river with 90 and do peixe river with 98 it was possible to estimate respectively 15 parameters about 83 of laboratory variables and 22 parameters 88 of laboratory variables table 1 and fig 3 these findings contradict the hypothesis of barcellos et al 2021a which with the increase of observations the rules could estimate a larger number of parameters however this can be the effect of many factors in the study conducted by barcellos et al 2021a the data were organized temporally and the number of samples taken over the period of record of monitoring in relation to time in the studied basins was similar to the average of this study the basins studied by this author are a very particular and rare case of high sample frequency without interruptions in monitoring water in brazil in this study barcellos et al 2021a in 11 years of monitoring the sampling frequency was bimonthly monitoring for 132 months simultaneously in four monitoring stations of two river basins in this article the average sampling frequency is 181 but the average monitoring period is 29 years with an interruption period in monitoring for a few years in several stations in sampling stations with more frequent and uninterrupted monitoring the increase in observations may result in a greater capacity for optimization another aspect of this study that seems to have influenced the optimization capacity of monitoring programs is the database s voids the variables with the highest regularity in the database were those that the rules were able to estimate such as the case of bod variables with constant monitoring but small variability were also challenging to estimate using the rules the average percentage of the estimate of laboratory variables in the 35 monitoring stations investigated was about 56 with a median of 61 values are slightly lower than those found by barcellos et al 2021a on a regional scale however these values are higher than those of other studies that sought to reduce the number of monitoring variables khalil et al 2010 noori et al 2010 pinto and maheshwari 2011 this can be explained by the association rules identifying nonlinear associative patterns different from traditional methodologies such as pca that are limited to linear patterns the variability of the percentage of estimation of laboratory variables was quite particular in each monitoring station and can be observed in fig 3 these findings show the great potential of this methodology that was applied extensively throughout the brazilian territory in different environmental and water quality contexts in this study even in a context of low sample frequency as is the reality in brazil and many other developing countries the association rules are viable tools reducing the frequency of laboratory analyses can reduce the costs of monitoring using the association rules as a support tool the use of association rules to optimize monitoring programs is a promising methodology especially for developing countries thus it is feasible that there are cutting criteria in the scope of monitoring programs so that the association rules can more substantially assist the monitoring of water our findings suggest that monitoring that measures a number lower than 20 variables seems to have a less promising optimization capability fig 6 some monitoring stations such as uruguay river paraná river ribeirão piracicamirim and ribeirão dos toledos are exceptions as shown in fig 6 the first two have many monitoring variables but a low percentage of the estimate of laboratory variables while the latter two had a percentage of parameters estimated bigger or equal to 50 but had a small number of variables without considering the exceptions monitoring stations with more than 20 variables with the lowest optimization potential were dourados river with 44 and cuiabá river 1 with 47 some limitations of this study should be considered by other investigations and even weighted for the application of this approach this methodology can only be applied in basins where there is a long standing wqmp the cost of adding monitoring to be able to estimate a wider range of parameters can also be of nil benefit discretization based on legislation allows legal meeting requirements but changes the variability of the data and hides some patterns thereby when applying this approach to a wqmp or a watershed it is important to understand the variability of the data correlation variance clustering i g and the context topography hydrography land use anthropogenic influence i g as was done for example in barcellos et al 2021a moreover the reduction in parameters could lead to the non detection of new sources of water quality issues therefore explanatory models based on association rules cannot be considered a substitute approach for traditional wqmp optimization methods but another tool capable of offering assistance 4 conclusion the study demonstrates that this methodology is feasible and can make a valuable contribution to the wqmps the explanatory models developed can be used by managers to optimize the wqmp in these stations laboratory parameters can be estimated and their measurement in the laboratory can be further spaced with the use of this methodology the set of monitoring stations investigated allowed us to conclude that 1 the environmental characteristics of monitoring stations influence the optimization capacity of wqmps 2 in the optimization of wqmps using association rule mining different levels of water quality and anthropogenic influence be not influential factors in optimization capacity 3 the amount of wqps is the most influential aspect in optimizing wqmps using association rule mining 4 the number of 20 or more wqps has been identified as the recommended for wqmps that use association rule mining for their optimization credit authorship contribution

15797,as urban communities continue to grow demand for recreational access including swimming in drinking water sources have increased yet relatively little is understood about the public health implications this poses for drinking water consumers preventative risk based approaches to catchment management informed by quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra requires accurate input data to effectively model risks a sound understanding of the knowledge gaps is also important to comprehend levels of uncertainty and help prioritise research needs cryptosporidium is one of the most important causes of waterborne outbreaks of gastroenteritis globally due to its resistance to chlorine this review was undertaken by water research australia to provide the most up to date information on current cryptosporidium epidemiological data and underlying assumptions for exposure assessment dose response and risk assessment for generic components of qmra for cryptosporidium and highlights priorities for common research key interim recommendations and guidelines for numerical values for relatively simple screening level qmra modelling are provided to help support prospective studies of risks to drinking water consumers from cryptosporidium due to body contact recreation in source water the review does not cover site specific considerations such as the levels of activity in the

occur via contact with infected persons or animals and via contaminated recreational water drinking water or food yang et al 2021 currently at least 44 species are recognised ryan et al 2021 and

milwaukee which resulted in 400 000 cases of cryptosporidiosis 90 deaths and cost the community us 96 million mackenzie et al 1994 corso et al 2003 recreational water associated outbreaks are increasing and comprise the majority of waterborne outbreaks in industrialised countries in the unites states us a review of 444 cryptosporidiosis outbreaks resulting in 7 465 cases between 2009 2017

recreational water associated outbreaks increased by 14 per year between 2009 to 2016 gharpure et al 2019 in australia a review of waterborne outbreaks of gastrointestinal disease in australia between 2001 and 2007 identified that 78 42 54 were attributed to recreational water and of these 98 41 42 were caused by cryptosporidium dale et al 2010 secure drinking water catchments and source water reservoirs are an essential component of a multi barrier approach to minimising the risk of cryptosporidium contamination and providing safe drinking water globally increasing urbanisation however has resulted in growing pressure to allow a range of recreational activities including swimming in water supply catchments miller et al 2006 chakravarthy et al 2019 while recreational activities in catchments have many health and cultural benefits these activities can also negatively impact water quality in australia the australian drinking water guidelines adwg stresses that protection of catchments from human and animal wastes is a priority to avoid waterborne disease outbreaks nhmrc 2011 there are nevertheless considerable variation in the extent of recreational access permitted in water supply catchments across australia and globally with some water supply catchments fully closed to all forms of legal recreational access while others allow a wide variety of recreational activity the purpose of this review is to assess current information and knowledge gaps and where possible make recommendations for numerical values based on the most current data to improve quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra of the risks to drinking water consumers from source water polluted with cryptosporidium by recreational activities in australia this review drew heavily on previous work undertaken in other countries and many of these recommendations and the approach adopted could provide a useful template to undertake more in depth risk assessments across all drinking water sources that allow recreational activities 2 quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra is a statistical modelling framework used to help provide a quantitative estimate of health risk due to pathogens and is used in a range of contexts including exposures to pathogens in drinking recycled and recreational water page et al 2010 soller et al 2010 who 2016 amoueyan et al 2017 federigi et al 2019 owens et al 2020 derx et al 2021 petterson et al 2021 thus qmra estimates the public health risk e g infection illness or death following exposure to doses of a given pathogen or pathogens in combination with a mathematical dose response model qmra is typically structured according to multiple steps 1 hazard identification in this case cryptosporidium 2 exposure assessment includes data on affected populations and frequency and length of time of exposure etc 3 dose response the probability of infection illness and disease burden for a given cryptosporidium dose 4 risk characterisation analysis of both exposure assessment and dose response data to estimate the levels of risks and uncertainty and 5 risk management targeted control strategies based on the risks identified a limitation of qmra modelling however is that it relies on primary data collection as well as assumptions based on existing data in the literature and is therefore subject to the same general limitations of any modelling approach as box and draper 1987 famously put it essentially all models are wrong but some are useful because of the reliance on assumptions there is uncertainty in the estimates of health risk arising from the use of qmra the levels of uncertainty are particularly high for complex systems involving numerous diffuse inputs i e recreators releasing varying quantities of cryptosporidium oocysts into environmental systems i e water catchments and reservoirs resulting in many orders of magnitude difference in oocyst concentrations at the point of water consumption between exposed persons at different time points while some of the assumptions in a qmra model are generic the majority are site and context specific these include the nature and extent of recreational activities that might take place the age and demographics of recreators and local climate catchment source water geospatial hydrodynamic and water treatment characteristics thus there are many variables and much uncertainty about the public health risk from cryptosporidium contamination resulting from recreational activity in waterways that are sources of drinking water and these uncertainties and variabilities of qmra must be taken into account when making public health decisions in spite of these limitations qmra can be useful to help to map out the pathways by which pathogens can enter water and be transferred to drinking water consumers enabling risk factors and controls to be identified even when input data are subject to high levels of uncertainty resulting in qmra predicting extreme levels of variability the estimates of risk can be better than pure guesswork and can provide a best evidence based estimate of risk within the timeframe and resourcing available a relatively simple screening level reasonable worst case risk assessment provides a good starting point to begin assessing the potential public health impacts of recreation in drinking water sources as noted above many of the components of a qmra model require site specific assumptions to be made such as the types and levels of activity occurring their location and the influence of dilution and water treatment however some of the model components are fairly generic and there is value in using common values as points of reference for those the benefit of agreeing common values comes from reducing tensions between stakeholder groups involved in often tense decision making processes as well as providing more consistency between assessments ideally epidemiology studies would be used to measure health risks however most epidemiological studies simply cannot practicably measure risks down to the levels considered acceptable and or cannot separate the contribution of pathogens resulting from recreation in the water source from other sources of pathogens in addition there are many sites and situations where there is insufficient time or budget to undertake epidemiology studies and qmra is considerably cheaper simpler and more rapid and can be used to predict future or potential risks in situations that do not yet exist whereas epidemiology is used retrospectively 2 1 currently available qmra studies on recreational activities in source drinking water limitations and knowledge gaps remarkably little research has been conducted on the public health risks resulting from recreational activities in source drinking water a literature search of scholarly databases including pubmed scopus and web of science using a boolean search with the keywords drinking water and quantitative microbial risk assessment and recreation identified 640 articles but almost all referred to the assessment of risks to recreational water users not risks to drinking water consumers from recreational activity occurring in their water sources despite many water supplies being open to recreational activity very few refereed journal articles describe the use of qmra to estimate risks to the health of drinking water consumers due to recreational activities in those waters the first and most widely cited relevant and modern qmra study identified i e one that used hydrodynamic modelling of the reservoir along with probabilistic risk assessment was published by anderson et al 1998 the other widely cited studies are gerba 2000 and stewart et al 2002 all three studies are very similar involving common authors and drawing upon largely the same primary literature and making basically the same assumptions these studies were principally undertaken as proof of concept exercises and the authors openly identified many of the limitations in these studies which have also been highlighted by soller et al 2003 some of the limitations and assumptions of these studies are as follows empirical evidence from field studies concerning the impact of recreational use of water sources that are also used as drinking water sources are limited and have mostly relied on the concentration of faecal indicators and not specific pathogens which makes it impossible to reliably estimate the loading of specific pathogens from bathers gerba 2000 there is insufficient data regarding the frequency of accidental faecal releases afrs in the study by anderson et al 1998 the frequency of afrs was assumed to be 1 afr per 1 000 recreators however this was based on a single unpublished grey literature study from 1997 which reported an assumed value from discussions with pool staff therefore a credible evidence based value for afr frequency needs to be determined soller et al 2003 information regarding transport and survival of cryptosporidium in bodies of water is relatively scarce leading to values from the literature being extrapolated stewart et al 2002 and these values will be increasingly impacted by climate change the extent to which faecal material entering the water column disaggregates and disperses or remains aggregated is unknown but has implications for pathogen transport inactivation treatment and peak event concentrations anderson et al 1998 thus as summarised by soller et al 2003 rigorous uncertainty analyses and clearly stating the explicit assumptions and validity of these assumptions are essential before any data generated can be used in policy or management decisions despite this critique by soller et al 2003 it has been commonplace for subsequent technical grey literature reports completed since that time to have used exactly or predominantly the same underlying assumptions based on citing one or more of those same three studies anderson et al 1998 gerba 2000 stewart et al 2002 the limitations noted within the above studies anderson et al 1998 gerba 2000 stewart et al 2002 and the soller et al 2003 review remain largely relevant today since there have been very few empirical studies undertaken over the past 20 years several additional limitations have been identified some due to changes in evidence and others simply due to them not having been noted in earlier critiques for example the estimates of masses of faecal matter shed during recreation in previous studies were estimated based largely on measurements of faecal coliforms from greywater from showers baths and washing machines by rose et al 1991 using data benchmarked against other similar studies from which the shedding of faecal masses was inferred gerba 2000 these represented the best available evidence at the time but was not based on an active sporting recreational water environment and are not direct measurements of faecal or pathogen shedding 2 2 exposure assessment 2 2 1 seasonality and demographics of infection since recreational water activity is highly seasonal peaking during holiday seasons and warmer months in most drinking water sources and primarily involving younger people it is important to understand the seasonal and or age demographic patterns in cryptosporidium prevalence that might in turn influence the risk profile to drinking water consumers globally cryptosporidiosis in humans has long been known to exhibit a strong and consistent seasonality with a main summer early autumn peak due predominantly to c hominis and associated with recreational water activity and a smaller spring peak associated with the zoonotic c parvum jagai et al 2009 yoder and beach 2010 cacciò and chalmers 2016 gharpure et al 2019 the seasonality in water detections appears to match the clinical notifications keeley and faulkner 2008 lapen et al 2016 in australia cryptosporidiosis is a national notifiable disease data from the national notifiable diseases surveillance system nndss http www health gov au as well as publications based on analysis of clinical data waldron et al 2011a lal et al 2015 ng hublin et al 2017 greenwood and reid 2020 and the monitoring of sewage deere and khan 2016 king et al 2017 zahedi et al 2018a supports the summer early autumn peak in cryptosporidiosis cases the difference between the summer peaks and winter troughs in notified clinically diagnosed cases is typically several fold and is more than an order of magnitude in sewage sampling deere and khan 2016 zahedi et al 2018a the majority of cryptosporidiosis cases globally including australia occur in children with the highest peak in children 4 years of age followed by the 5 9 age group ng et al 2010a b waldron et al 2011a lal et al 2015 ng hublin et al 2017 braima et al 2019 gharpure et al 2019 dong et al 2020 the higher incidence in children is due to their immunological immaturity and in developed countries is linked with water related recreational activities as children are more likely to participate in swimming activities such as splashing and diving that lead to water ingestion and children also have less bowel control suppes et al 2016 gharpure et al 2019 a second smaller peak after the 0 9 age group in cryptosporidiosis notifications predominantly in females in the 21 40 age group is common in australia ng et al 2010b waldron et al 2011a lal et al 2015 ng hublin et al 2017 braima et al 2019 and overseas hunter et al 2004 painter et al 2015 2016 and is attributed to secondary transmission from infected children to care givers this is supported by case control studies including a united kingdom uk study that identified changing children s nappies as a specific risk factor for infection with c hominis hunter et al 2004 data from a large cross sectional study in the uk to determine secondary transmission rates in households revealed that an average of two mostly undiagnosed cryptosporidiosis cases were identified in 25 of homes with a diagnosed index case mckerr et al 2022 female care givers and siblings in the household were most at risk of secondary infection and transmission rates were higher for c hominis compared with c parvum and other species mckerr et al 2022 whilst it is widely understood that secondary person to person spread of pathogens can occur following primary infections arising in recreational waters baron et al 1982 such cases have not previously been factored into qmra and are sometimes considered unimportant e g messner and berger 2016 this may lead to an underestimate of the true risk to drinking water consumers since only the primary infections are simulated for example as a result of the milwaukee waterborne outbreak in 1993 elevated secondary person to person transmission was reported amongst elderly individuals which are at an increased risk of severe disease during outbreaks naumova et al 2003 thus secondary transmission from infected children to care givers and vulnerable groups such as the elderly should be factored into qmra analysis 2 2 2 prevalence of infection estimating risk from persons recreating in water catchments and source water reservoirs requires estimating the prevalence of cryptosporidium in potential recreators to determine the probability of a person being infected with cryptosporidium at any point in time this is also a function of the probability of becoming infected in the first place and the duration of the infection until it is cleared by the host the global prevalence of cryptosporidium has been estimated at 7 6 with an average prevalence of 4 3 in developed countries and 10 4 in developing countries dong et al 2020 asymptomatic carriage is usually low particularly in developed countries and has been reported at prevalences ranging from 0 4 davies et al 2009 enserink et al 2015 reh et al 2019 in australia the nndss reports an average notification rate of 12 8 cases 100 000 population however notification rates amongst vulnerable populations can be much higher for example in western australia notification rates in aboriginal children were 20 5 times higher than non aboriginal children in the same age group over an 11 year period 2002 to 2012 ng hublin et al 2017 cryptosporidiosis notifications from 2001 2020 show distinct peaks in various years with the highest number of notifications in 2016 n 5 421 followed by 2017 n 4 694 and then 2009 4 623 reported cryptosporidium case numbers however likely represent only a small proportion of the actual numbers of both sporadic and outbreak cases of cryptosporidiosis as current surveillance methods lack sensitivity for example approximately 1 in 137 individuals who develop gastroenteritis will present to the doctor and be asked to supply a faecal specimen for screening and not all of these samples will be tested for microorganisms tam et al 2012 mchardy et al 2014 ryan et al 2017b the type of testing conducted is also relevant as although pathology laboratories are moving towards or have moved to pcr based detection methods which have been shown to be up to 10 times more sensitive than microscopy morgan et al 1998 ryan et al 2005 mergen et al 2020 many pathology laboratories still rely on microscopy studies in the uk have suggested that for every single general case of gastroenteritis reported there are 147 unreported cases tam et al 2012 while a study in australia suggested a ratio on one notified case of gastroenteritis to 500 community cases hall et al 2006 in the uk analysis has shown that sporadic cryptosporidiosis cases are frequently part of unrecognised outbreaks briggs et al 2014 with 8 2 community cases of cryptosporidiosis for every reported case based on pcr testing tam et al 2012 in a canadian study an under reporting factor of 48 5 was calculated for cryptosporidium detection rates thomas et al 2013 determining the prevalence of cryptosporidium infections in australia is therefore problematic however one study estimated that in 2010 cryptosporidium was responsible for 195 495 acute gastroenteritis age cases 4 718 hospitalisation and 333 disability adjusted life years dalys based on collated evidence from a range of published and unpublished data and government databases gibney et al 2014 this is compared to only 1 481 actual notifications for that year which equates to 1 notification for every 132 cases of age due to cryptosporidium and an incidence of 8 8 cases per 1 000 880 per 100 000 cases or 0 9 per person gibney et al 2014 in australia at least 26 recreational water associated outbreaks have been reported in the literature between 1995 and 2021 table 1 however this is also likely an underestimate as in addition to under reporting of gastroenteritis cases waterborne diseases are particularly difficult to identify due to the long incubation period for cryptosporidium 1 week and the difficulty associating symptoms with water exposure subsequent analysis of the milwaukee outbreak in 1993 indicated that a smaller outbreak had occurred a few weeks prior and had surveillance systems detected the earlier outbreak up to 85 of the cases in the subsequent main outbreak might have been prevented eisenberg et al 1998 recently petterson et al 2021 calculated a point prevalence of 0 11 for cryptosporidium in alberta canada based on the following formula r u d 7 n 1 a applying this to australia where r is the reported number of cases per week e g in australia this is 3 760 cryptosporidiosis cases based on estimates by gibney et al 2014 u is the underreporting factor e g 8 2 as reported by tam et al 2012 or 1 d is the mean duration of excretion days 6 days using the data from the c hominis human feeding trial hft trial by chappell et al 2006 n is the population size e g population of australia is 25 6 m and a is the asymptomatic infection rate 0 01 this gives a conservative point prevalence of cryptosporidium for australia of 0 01 to 0 1 0 28 6 95 confidence interval depending on whether a multiplier under reporting factor of 1 or 8 2 is used a summer spike in prevalence should also be considered due to the very seasonal nature of c hominis infections note the under reporting factor of 48 5 as reported by thomas et al 2013 was not used as this resulted in an unrealistically high point prevalence 0 6 when applied to the gibney et al 2014 prevalence data 2 2 3 amplification of c hominis by animals in water catchments there is also emerging evidence of amplification of c hominis in animals residing in water catchments following its introduction by humans ng et al 2011 koehler et al 2016 zahedi et al 2016a and b 2018b for example c hominis has been detected in kangaroos and cattle in a sydney drinking water catchment ng et al 2011 zahedi et al 2016a 2018b cattle in western australian catchments zahedi et al 2018b and in deer and marsupials in melbourne catchments koehler et al 2016 in the studies by zahedi et al 2016a the mean number of oocysts g 1 for kangaroos and cattle that were positive for c hominis was 6 041 range 26 16 890 g 1 as determined by quantitative pcr qpcr suggesting that the animals were infected and not just mechanically transmitting oocysts the same marsupial population in the sydney catchment was first screened for cryptosporidium species in 2004 and only the marsupial associated species c fayeri and c macropodum were detected power et al 2004 in 2011 c hominis was detected in marsupials inhabiting this catchment for the first time but the shedding levels were thought to be very low as evidenced by the inability to amplify cryptosporidium dna at additional loci ng et al 2011 the identification of higher levels of oocyst shedding in 2016 by zahedi et al zahedi et al 2016a coupled with the identification of a single gp60 subtype 1ba10g2 by next generation amplicon sequencing suggests a very recent introduction of c hominis into the marsupial population via spillback from humans zahedi et al 2017 the identification of identical c fayeri gp60 subtypes in humans and marsupials in sydney and wa further support increased interaction between humans and wildlife in drinking water catchments waldron et al 2010 braima et al 2021b globally there has also been an increase in the detection and amplification of c hominis in animal hosts and it is recognised that c hominis is now endemic in equine populations widmer et al 2020 the effect of c hominis amplification within cattle and marsupials and other fauna in catchments from camping activities in addition to recreational activities in water has not previously been factored into the qmra studies and this leads to an underestimate of the risk when comparing protected with open catchment scenarios 2 2 4 release of faecal matter cryptosporidiosis results in profuse watery diarrhoea carter et al 2020 which can promote the accidental or unprevented release of significant quantities of faecal material during recreational water activity the consistency of diarrhoea also makes anal and hand hygiene practices less effective increasing the potential for smeared faecal material to be retained on the skin following bowel movements which can subsequently be shed during recreational water activity in understanding cryptosporidium inputs to water sources there is a need to estimate variables such as the use of toilet facilities in the catchment area combined with their rate of failure open defecation in connectivity with water accidental faecal releases afr directly into water and release of faecal matter via shedding from small quantities of material remaining from earlier defecation events or being expelled alongside flatulence evidence to estimate such inputs come from a range of sources studies by elmir et al 2007 2009 which examined concentrations of enterococci released by bathers n 10 in an inflatable pool 4700 l showed that mean concentration of enterococci shed per subject was 3 105 cfu in an australian study bathroom water greywater from toilets and showers was found to contain on average 3 2 and up to 4 3 log10 e coli per 100 ml o toole et al 2012 this is similar to the 3 8 log10 faecal coliform average reported by rose et al 1991 in studies on bath and shower water these levels of faecal indicators are approximately 3 to 4 log10 below those found in sewage based on typical values for e coli concentrations in sewage and stools and volumes of water used in baths and showers this is consistent with the amount of faecal matter shed during bathing and showering activities being of the order 0 1 to 1 g rose et al 1991 noted that households with children had significantly more microbial faecal indicators in their greywater than those without as discussed children are more likely than adults in general to be partaking in higher levels of body contact recreational activity in addition those partaking in recreational water activity would entail more physically active movement than bathing and thus be more likely to mobilise more faecal matter than showering or bathing therefore in estimating faecal shedding during recreational water activity it is recommended that an estimate of 1 g be made accidental faecal releases afr s are the uncontrolled or accidental release of faecal material directly into water and which are thought to frequently go undetected who 2006 2011 as discussed however the evidence of the extent of afr inputs is still based largely on purely anecdotal evidence from pool operators and industry practitioners soller et al 2003 and this continues to be the case today although there is a requirement for swimming pool owners to keep incident logs in some jurisdictions and such data could readily be mined to provide some statistical evidence there is a strong disincentive to report and respond to afr s as typically this leads to pool closures often for many hours and potentially full drainage and super chlorination an objective prospective process is required to determine the frequency of afr s in pools as there is not a highly credible evidence based value an afr frequency of 50 has been assumed for symptomatic individuals for diarrhoea further clinical research is required to test those assumptions the mass of an afr has been assumed to be 200 g based on the definition of diarrhoea in volunteers infected with c hominis chappell et al 2006 2 2 5 cryptosporidium shedding the extent of faecal shedding during recreation is a function of the concentration of cryptosporidium present in faeces and the quantity of faeces shed to date nine human feeding trials hft have been conducted on four cryptosporidium species c parvum isolates ucp iowa tamu and moredun dupont et al 1995 okhuysen et al 1998 1999 chappell et al 1996 1999 messner et al 2001 okhuysen et al 2002 c hominis isolate tu502 chappell et al 2006 c meleagridis isolate tu1867 chappell et al 2011 and c muris isolate rn66 chappell et al 2015 cryptosporidium meleagridis is the third most common cryptosporidium species in humans and while in developing countries it can sometimes be the dominant species in humans in developed countries including australia it usually accounts for only 1 4 of human infections ng hublin et al 2017 braima et al 2019 chappell et al 2011 yang et al 2021 cryptosporidium muris is a gastric species and has been reported in humans in a few studies in developing countries but has not been reported in humans in australia yang et al 2021 in addition the c muris hft was a proof of concept study that used a very large oocyst dose 1 106 which greatly exceeds the 50 infectious dose id50 of previous hfts chappell et al 2015 so is unlikely to be representative of actual exposures via water cryptosporidium hominis and c parvum are the dominant species in humans but the distribution of c hominis in human populations differs between different countries yang et al 2021 in australia c hominis accounts for 66 90 of human cryptosporidial infections jex et al 2007 jex et al 2008 o brien et al 2008 pangasa et al 2009 ng et al 2010a 2010b waldron et al 2011a 2011b koehler et al 2013 2014 ebner et al 2015 ng hublin et al 2015 ng hublin et al 2017 2018 braima et al 2019 importantly all recreational water associated outbreaks typed to date in australia have been due to c hominis table 1 similarly globally recreational water associated outbreaks have also predominantly been caused by c hominis causer et al 2006 chalmers 2012 cope et al 2015 hlavsa et al 2017 chalmers et al 2019 zahedi and ryan 2020 as with other countries in addition to c parvum a wide variety of mostly wildlife and livestock associated cryptosporidium species have been identified in australian source water including c ubiquitum c cuniculus c ryanae c bovis c tyzzeri c muris c fayeri and c andersoni swaffer et al 2014 king et al 2015 swaffer et al 2018 however few studies have compared the incidence and species of cryptosporidium in recreational versus non recreational catchments a study by loganthan et al 2012 in wa reported a much higher overall prevalence of cryptosporidium in recreational catchments 44 7 v 16 7 with c hominis detected in recreational sites that allowed swimming and camping but not in non recreational sites loganthan et al 2012 thus qmra infectivity assumptions based on c hominis hft are likely more representative of the risk associated with oocysts shed by humans in recreational water environments symptoms experienced during the c hominis hft included diarrhoea defined as 200 g unformed stool day 3 unformed stools over an 8 hour period or 4 unformed stool s over a 24 hour period and symptomatic illness was defined as 2 concurrent symptoms e g diarrhoea vomiting faecal urgency or faecal incontinence chappell et al 2006 where symptoms were observed the incubation period from inoculation to onset was from 2 to 10 days mean and median 5 and 4 days the duration of symptoms ranged from 2 to 22 days mean and median 6 and 3 days between 0 28 and 2 3 kg of unformed stool was passed during each episode of diarrhoea median and mean of 1 1 and 0 9 kg respectively inoculum doses were 30 100 300 500 1000 10 000 100 000 and 1 000 000 oocysts and infections occurred at all doses including 4 5 doses of 10 oocysts chappell et al 2006 furthermore whilst the inoculum was given up to six weeks following oocyst production excystation and dye staining viability levels of 67 83 and 66 87 respectively were recorded chappell et al 2006 these clinical observations are largely similar to those for c parvum infection iowa isolate described in an earlier hft by du pont et al 1995 inoculum doses were 10 30 100 and 500 oocysts and the incubation period from inoculation to onset was from 4 to 22 days with a mean of 9 days the duration of symptoms ranged from 2 5 to 3 5 days with a mean of 3 days between 0 4 and 2 1 kg of unformed stool was passed during each episode of cryptosporidiosis mean of 1 23 kg the age of the c parvum inoculum used in that study iowa isolate which was derived from a calf was between 10 to 40 days old and had excystation and dye staining viability levels of 79 89 and 64 84 respectively dupont et al 1995 the concentration of c parvum oocysts detected in faecal material from this hft was analysed further by chappell et al 1996 the total output of oocysts during infection expressed in log10 units ranged between 4 5 and 9 5 the shedding of oocysts during infection was highest 7 to 9 log10 among the groups of volunteers exposed to more realistic dose ranges 30 to 500 oocysts dose converting those to oocysts per unit mass predicts an average concentration in oocyst g faeces expressed in log10 units as ranging from 1 4 to 6 5 chappell et al 1996 these studies show that cryptosporidium is a highly infectious pathogen and can retain its infectivity over time hence it is not unreasonable to assume that at least for the oocysts shed during the peak of the shedding they would be as infectious as the primary inoculum the hft s were all conducted on healthy adult volunteers however more significant and extended oocyst shedding can occur in immune compromised persons and in immunologically immature children for example a study of cryptosporidiosis in aids patients reported that oocyst excretion ranged from 6 0 106 to 1 2 109 oocysts day with an average stool weight of 1 2 kg day goodgame et al 1993 and in hiv patients oocyst shedding was persistent over the 60 day monitoring period tam et al 2021 a study in the us reported a median duration of diarrhoea of 11 5 days range 1 44 days in children aged 5 years or less infected with cryptosporidium and that duration of oocyst shedding ranged from 8 50 days stehr green et al 1987 in brazil young children 2 7 42 6 months old infected with c hominis shed significantly more oocysts ml of stool compared to c parvum infected children 3 5 106 vs 1 7 106 per ml and had a longer duration of diarrhoea means of 20 9 days v 13 3 days bushen et al 2007 in addition several studies have shown that oocyst shedding can continue after cessation of symptoms for up to 2 months jokipii and jokipii 1986 stehr green et al 1987 mcmurry et al 2021 it also is important to note that symptomatic infections result in the passage of more than the normal quantity of faecal material consequently simply multiplying the concentration of pathogens in faeces by a typical faecal mass may underestimate the pathogen load shed by a symptomatic individual for whom the faecal mass would be expected to be larger therefore for estimating the oocyst shedding in faeces a mass of at least 200 g per faecal release and a peak concentration of at least 6 5 log10 oocysts g is a reasonable evidence based estimate this yields a daily peak shedding rate of 9 log10 oocysts day 2 2 6 volume of water consumed the volume of water consumed by drinking water customers from the source water contaminated by recreational activity once it reaches households must be accessed in general an assumption is made that 1 litre of unboiled water is consumed per day in undertaking qmra for microorganisms nhmrc 2011 studies have shown that mean daily consumption of unboiled tap water varies from 0 10 litre to 1 55 litres with a large variability between countries and studies mons et al 2007 for australia a conservative estimate of 900 ml is suggested mons et al 2007 a more recent study of water intake in australia provided estimates ranging from 1 2 to 3 6 l from the sum of foods and liquids although the contribution from tap water was not singled out mallett et al 2021 the latter study noted that water intake was higher in warmer conditions recreational activity in water catchments is likely to be temporally associated with periods of increased unboiled water consumption e g during warmer or drier times of year therefore it is recommended that 1 5 litres of unboiled tap water be assumed for the purposes of assessing risks associated with recreation which is at the upper end of the range indicated by mons et al 2007 and more consistent with the range indicated by mallett et al 2021 2 3 dose response assessment data and analysis from the nine hft s discussed above have revealed that cryptosporidium infectivity shows very significant differences according to species and type and the age and immune status of the hosts as well as previous exposure to the parasite messner and berger 2016 schmidt and chappell 2016 earlier recreational water qmra studies haas et al 1996 based on the dupont et al 1995 hft using the c parvum iowa strain with a 50 infectious dose id50 of 132 were interpreted to give an infection probability per ingested oocyst of 0 0042 more recently the c hominis hft using the c hominis tu502 isolate with an id50 of 10 oocysts chappell et al 2006 was interpreted by schijven et al 2014 to give an infection probability per ingested oocyst of 0 76 this suggests that c hominis is over two orders of magnitude more infectious to humans than c parvum more recently messner and berger 2016 suggested that the infection probability may be even lower for low doses and that future hft s should focus on low doses of oocysts 5 or less the c hominis tu502 strain that was used in the study by chappell et al 2006 was originally isolated from a child with cryptosporidiosis in uganda but has subsequently been propagated extensively in a gnotobiotic pig model and also calves akiyoshi et al 2002 in 2012 however a different strain appeared in the pig model possibly due to a contaminating isolate outcompeting the original tu502 strain isaza et al 2015 widmer et al 2015 the original c hominis tu502 genome sequenced in 2004 has been typed as gp60 subtype iaa25r3 chalmers et al 2008 while the new c hominis tu502 strain belongs to the ib subtype family isaza et al 2015 it is likely that the c hominis hft conducted by chappell et al 2006 used the iaa25r3 c hominis tu502 strain however as the majority of waterborne outbreaks typed to date have been due to c hominis subtype iba10g2 chalmers et al 2012 2019 zahedi and ryan 2020 yang et al 2021 a hft on this subtype would be very valuable within c parvum dose response studies have shown that the median id50 of three different us c parvum strains ucp iowa tamu varied considerably 12 1 2 066 oocysts and consequently had very different infection probabilities per ingested oocyst ucp 0 00038 iowa 0 0054 tamu 0 048 okhuysen et al 1999 messner et al 2001 another hft study was conducted on a uk moredun isolate originally isolated from red deer calf cervus elaphus and subsequently passaged in sheep and was presumed to be c parvum okhuysen et al 2002 the id50 was similar to the c parvum iowa isolate 375 oocysts but subjects had an earlier illness onset 3 vs 7 days and longer median duration of diarrhea compared with the iowa exposed subjects 169h vs 93 h okhuysen et al 2002 data on the infectivity of different c hominis strains using hfts are not available but such studies need to be conducted some qmra studies have based their dose response analysis on both c parvum and c hominis hft on the basis that these two species combined are responsible for 95 of human infections e g lapen et al 2016 however as discussed c hominis is responsible for the majority of recreational waterborne outbreaks and has much higher infectivity for humans than c parvum therefore the infection probability per ingested c hominis oocyst of 0 76 derived by schijven et al 2014 is the dose response model recommended for estimating health risks to drinking water consumers from cryptosporidium oocysts shed by persons engaged in recreational activities in drinking water sources host immunity also plays a major role in pathogen dose response and shedding teunis et al 2002 re infection of the same volunteers 12 months later with 500 oocysts in the c parvum hft by dupont et al 1995 resulted in significantly lower rates of pathogen shedding among individuals 16 v 68 although the rates of diarrhoea were similar okhuysen et al 1998 a subsequent study challenged healthy adults with pre existing serum igg antibodies to cryptosporidium with 500 50 000 c parvum oocysts chappell et al 1999 results revealed that the id50 was 20 fold higher than in seronegative volunteers 1 880 v 132 oocysts and oocyst shedding was only detected in 54 13 17 chappell et al 1999 seroprevalence of antibodies to cryptosporidium is usually conducted based on igg responses to low molecular weight proteins including 15 17 and 27 kda sporozoite antigens studies in the us have reported 2 21 seroprevalence to cryptosporidium igg antibodies with the highest prevalence in lower socioeconomic communities becker et al 2015 bradbury et al 2020 in australia no recent studies are available which is an important knowledge gap but the prevalence of paired igm and igg antibodies has been reported as 8 in children and 5 in adults groves et al 1994 serum igg responses to 15 and 17 kda sporozoite antigens peaked within 60 92 days of symptom onset and decreased over time groves et al 1994 priest et al 2001 chalmers et al 2013 response to the 27 kda antigen appeared to be much lower but was detectable up to 12 months post infection muller et al 2001 chalmers et al 2013 a better understanding of both the prevalence and titre levels of anti cryptosporidium igg is essential to better understand the variation of susceptibility to infection with cryptosporidium in the australian population 2 4 risk characterisation the key purpose of qmra is to estimate risks to health based on exposure and dose response assessments and compare those estimates to some target or benchmark usually termed the tolerable risk within australia although not mandated many water utilities have adopted a tolerable risk of 1 infection per 10 000 people per year however australia like many countries is now adopting a tolerable risk of 1 micro disability adjusted life year µdaly o toole et al 2015 the daly is a unit originally devised to compare health outcomes from different diseases or health conditions and modified to develop health based targets for drinking water quality havelaar and melse 2003 the daly is quantified as the sum of the years of life lost yll and the years lived with a disability yld or lost personal utility due to a particular agent the daly per case is the average burden of a single case of disease and thus is different for each pathogen based on the daly per case data generated for cryptosporidium cases in australia by gibney et al 2014 analysis revealed that 1 µdaly allows for 6 of diarrhoeal disease caused by cryptosporidium to be associated with consumption of drinking water o toole et al 2015 currently the 1 µdaly health based target is not based on risks from recreation but on risks to water consumers from all pollution sources hence it is necessary to add the risks from recreation to the baseline risk to understand how much recreation changes the risk and whether it pushes risk beyond a benchmark level when completing a screening level qmra to initially estimate risks to the health of drinking water consumers from cryptosporidium associated with recreation within source waters a set of proposed generic interim assumptions along with the associated evidence base has been set out in table 2 as part of this analysis the potential for waterborne disease outbreaks that may occur during peak periods of recreational water use and the endemic disease burden also needs to be estimated as averaging risks over time can potentially miss significant risks therefore for screening level assessments as a minimum the reasonably foreseeable upper bound risks that arise during peak periods of recreational water use should be estimated in addition to the generic interim assumptions given in table 2 site specific assumptions need to be developed these include estimating the nature and extent of recreational activities in specific source water catchments to permit quantitative estimates of persons that might be present in specific catchments and source waters information on their age and other demographic variables and the availability of sanitation facilities which may influence the likelihood of afrs in the source waters needs to be considered controls on visitor numbers activities locations and behaviours need to be understood and realistically estimated these site specific variables cannot be assigned generic values as risks from cryptosporidium will increase as the level of usage of the specific site increases since more people would collectively shed more oocysts there is empirical epidemiological evidence that is consistent with this assumption a study of 3 805 bathers at three beaches found a statistically significant increased risk of gastrointestinal illness among bathers in areas with higher bather density compared with beaches with a lower bather density papastergiou et al 2011 2012 similarly the concentration of cryptosporidium oocysts detected at recreational beaches in the us was significantly correlated with bather density graczyk et al 2007 2010 sunderland et al 2007 therefore local evidence on recreator activity behaviour and density needs to be taken into account in site specific studies when applying this evidence to a specific setting best practice involves predicting the whole range of risks using probabilistic risk assessment methods including hydrodynamic modelling of the fate of oocysts in the water column as well as the performance of water treatment processes betancourt and rose 2004 a detailed assessment is beyond the scope of this review but are relevant to any qmra for a drinking water supply briefly oocyst sedimentation resuspension aggregation and transport as well as inactivating factors such as temperature salinity pressure solar radiation visible and uv predation by zooplankton within the water body and future climate variability need to be assessed e g brookes et al 2004 hipsey et al 2004 king and monis 2007 hoyer et al 2015 tolouei et al 2019 there is wide variability however with studies reporting settling rates ranging from 0 03 10 m day 1 depending on levels of oocyst aggregation with other particles and or organic material brookes et al 2004 king and monis 2007 oocysts are rapidly inactivated at temperatures 37 c and are very susceptible to solar inactivation 3 log inactivation day during an australian summer king and monis 2007 an interactive computational tool qmracatch has been developed to simulate the transport and fate of cryptosporidium and other microorganisms in water which should prove useful schijven et al 2015 best practice involves quantification or at least estimation of the infectious fraction of oocysts as incorrect assumptions can overestimate or underestimate risk and associated estimates of source water protection and or water treatment requirements source water studies of the proportion of infectious oocysts using cell culture infectivity assays have shown that this is highly variable 0 65 4 swaffer et al 2014 king et al 2017 guidelines for wastewater usually specify log10 reduction value lrv targets however removal of cryptosporidium from wastewater is highly variable and heavily influenced by the type of treatment plant those with lagoon systems have higher inactivation rates as well as seasonality of cryptosporidiosis burdens in the community and seasonal increases in the volume and flow of raw effluent king et al 2017 as with drinking water inclusion of assumptions of the remaining infectious oocyst fraction after wastewater treatment is crucial for accurate risk assessment infectivity studies have shown that the infectious oocyst fraction in wastewater varied between 28 50 in secondary effluent between different plants and surprisingly the infectious oocyst fraction was generally higher than that of the oocysts in raw sewage king et al 2017 analysis also revealed that while oocyst infectivity was highly variable between plants within plants infectivity did not appear to be linked to season or with increased community levels of cryptosporidiosis king et al 2017 an important knowledge gap is the fate of c hominis in the environment and drinking water treatment process as the majority of research to date has been conducted on c parvum or indicator organisms king and monis 2007 and while it is assumed that the fate of c hominis would be similar to c parvum specific research on this topic is needed 3 conclusions the epidemiology of cryptosporidium and its public health impacts needs to be kept in mind when conducting qmra on body contact recreation in source water the highest prevalence of cryptosporidium is in children who are also most likely to be engaged in higher risk swimming activities and have less bowel control secondary spread of cryptosporidiosis to care givers of children and the elderly should be considered in the qmra cryptosporidium exhibits a strong seasonality with peaks in summer and early autumn which influences the risk profile to drinking water consumers as c hominis is the dominant species in humans and is responsible for the majority of recreational water associated outbreaks dose response and exposure assessment should be based primarily on available data for this species spill back of cryptosporidium including c hominis from recreators into animals in catchments and subsequent amplification in those hosts may in turn increase the human infectious cryptosporidium concentrations in the source way beyond the levels directly attributable to recreators over time new evidence will emerge that will support or invalidate the assumptions and recommendations provided in this review the data presented is not a probabilistic risk assessment but rather a practical simple risk model to provide a more evidence based starting point to undertake in depth risk assessments for recreational water qmra studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

15797,as urban communities continue to grow demand for recreational access including swimming in drinking water sources have increased yet relatively little is understood about the public health implications this poses for drinking water consumers preventative risk based approaches to catchment management informed by quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra requires accurate input data to effectively model risks a sound understanding of the knowledge gaps is also important to comprehend levels of uncertainty and help prioritise research needs cryptosporidium is one of the most important causes of waterborne outbreaks of gastroenteritis globally due to its resistance to chlorine this review was undertaken by water research australia to provide the most up to date information on current cryptosporidium epidemiological data and underlying assumptions for exposure assessment dose response and risk assessment for generic components of qmra for cryptosporidium and highlights priorities for common research key interim recommendations and guidelines for numerical values for relatively simple screening level qmra modelling are provided to help support prospective studies of risks to drinking water consumers from cryptosporidium due to body contact recreation in source water the review does not cover site specific considerations such as the levels of activity in the source water the influence of dilution and inactivation in reservoirs or water treatment although the focus is australia the recommendations and numerical values developed in this review and the highlighted research priorities are broadly applicable across all drinking source water sources that allow recreational activities keywords cryptosporidium recreational water use drinking water

occur via contact with infected persons or animals and via contaminated recreational water drinking water or food yang et al 2021 currently at least 44 species are recognised ryan et al 2021 and although 19 species and 4 genotypes have been reported in humans c hominis and c parvum are responsible for 95 of human infections chalmers et al 2019 ryan et al 2021 cryptosporidium hominis in

to their small size 5 µm are not readily removed by media filtration in the absence of fully effective prior coagulation and flocculation ryan et al 2017a from the start of the last century to 2016 the parasite was responsible for 524 waterborne outbreaks karanis et al 2007 baldursson and karanis 2011 efstratiou et al 2017 with the largest waterborne cryptosporidiosis outbreak in march 1993 in milwaukee which resulted in 400 000 cases of cryptosporidiosis 90 deaths and cost the community us 96 million mackenzie et al 1994 corso et al 2003 recreational water associated outbreaks are increasing and comprise the majority of waterborne outbreaks in industrialised countries in the unites states us a review of 444 cryptosporidiosis outbreaks resulting in 7 465 cases between 2009 2017 revealed that contaminated recreational water treated and untreated was responsible for 60 4495 7 465 of cases 38 of outbreaks and 64 n 186 of hospitalisations gharpure et al 2019 in addition treated recreational water associated outbreaks increased by 14 per year between 2009 to 2016 gharpure et al 2019 in australia a review of waterborne outbreaks of gastrointestinal disease in australia between 2001 and 2007 identified that 78 42 54 were attributed to recreational water and of these 98 41 42 were caused by cryptosporidium dale et al 2010 secure drinking water catchments and source water reservoirs are an essential component of a multi barrier approach to minimising the risk of cryptosporidium contamination and providing safe drinking water globally increasing urbanisation however has resulted in growing pressure to allow a range of recreational activities including swimming in water supply catchments miller et al 2006 chakravarthy et al 2019 while recreational activities in catchments have many health and cultural benefits these activities can also negatively impact water quality in australia the australian drinking water guidelines adwg stresses that protection of catchments from human and animal wastes is a priority to avoid waterborne disease outbreaks nhmrc 2011 there are nevertheless considerable variation in the extent of recreational access permitted in water supply catchments across australia and globally with some water supply catchments fully closed to all forms of legal recreational access while others allow a wide variety of recreational activity the purpose of this review is to assess current information and knowledge gaps and where possible make recommendations for numerical values based on the most current data to improve quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra of the risks to drinking water consumers from source water polluted with cryptosporidium by recreational activities in australia this review drew heavily on previous work undertaken in other countries and many of these recommendations and the approach adopted could provide a useful template to undertake more in depth risk assessments across all drinking water sources that allow recreational activities 2 quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra is a statistical modelling framework used to help provide a quantitative estimate of health risk due to pathogens and is used in a range of contexts including exposures to pathogens in drinking recycled and recreational water page et al 2010 soller et al 2010 who 2016 amoueyan et al 2017 federigi et al 2019 owens et al 2020 derx et al 2021 petterson et al 2021 thus qmra estimates the public health risk e g infection illness or death following exposure to doses of a given pathogen or pathogens in combination with a mathematical dose response model qmra is typically structured according to multiple steps 1 hazard identification in this case cryptosporidium 2 exposure assessment includes data on affected populations and frequency and length of time of exposure etc 3 dose response the probability of infection illness and disease burden for a given cryptosporidium dose 4 risk characterisation analysis of both exposure assessment and dose response data to estimate the levels of risks and uncertainty and 5 risk management targeted control strategies based on the risks identified a limitation of qmra modelling however is that it relies on primary data collection as well as assumptions based on existing data in the literature and is therefore subject to the same general limitations of any modelling approach as box and draper 1987 famously put it essentially all models are wrong but some are useful because of the reliance on assumptions there is uncertainty in the estimates of health risk arising from the use of qmra the levels of uncertainty are particularly high for complex systems involving numerous diffuse inputs i e recreators releasing varying quantities of cryptosporidium oocysts into environmental systems i e water catchments and reservoirs resulting in many orders of magnitude difference in oocyst concentrations at the point of water consumption between exposed persons at different time points while some of the assumptions in a qmra model are generic the majority are site and context specific these include the nature and extent of recreational activities that might take place the age and demographics of recreators and local climate catchment source water geospatial hydrodynamic and water treatment characteristics thus there are many variables and much uncertainty about the public health risk from cryptosporidium contamination resulting from recreational activity in waterways that are sources of drinking water and these uncertainties and variabilities of qmra must be taken into account when making public health decisions in spite of these limitations qmra can be useful to help to map out the pathways by which pathogens can enter water and be transferred to drinking water consumers enabling risk factors and controls to be identified even when input data are subject to high levels of uncertainty resulting in qmra predicting extreme levels of variability the estimates of risk can be better than pure guesswork and can provide a best evidence based estimate of risk within the timeframe and resourcing available a relatively simple screening level reasonable worst case risk assessment provides a good starting point to begin assessing the potential public health impacts of recreation in drinking water sources as noted above many of the components of a qmra model require site specific assumptions to be made such as the types and levels of activity occurring their location and the influence of dilution and water treatment however some of the model components are fairly generic and there is value in using common values as points of reference for those the benefit of agreeing common values comes from reducing tensions between stakeholder groups involved in often tense decision making processes as well as providing more consistency between assessments ideally epidemiology studies would be used to measure health risks however most epidemiological studies simply cannot practicably measure risks down to the levels considered acceptable and or cannot separate the contribution of pathogens resulting from recreation in the water source from other sources of pathogens in addition there are many sites and situations where there is insufficient time or budget to undertake epidemiology studies and qmra is considerably cheaper simpler and more rapid and can be used to predict future or potential risks in situations that do not yet exist whereas epidemiology is used retrospectively 2 1 currently available qmra studies on recreational activities in source drinking water limitations and knowledge gaps remarkably little research has been conducted on the public health risks resulting from recreational activities in source drinking water a literature search of scholarly databases including pubmed scopus and web of science using a boolean search with the keywords drinking water and quantitative microbial risk assessment and recreation identified 640 articles but almost all referred to the assessment of risks to recreational water users not risks to drinking water consumers from recreational activity occurring in their water sources despite many water supplies being open to recreational activity very few refereed journal articles describe the use of qmra to estimate risks to the health of drinking water consumers due to recreational activities in those waters the first and most widely cited relevant and modern qmra study identified i e one that used hydrodynamic modelling of the reservoir along with probabilistic risk assessment was published by anderson et al 1998 the other widely cited studies are gerba 2000 and stewart et al 2002 all three studies are very similar involving common authors and drawing upon largely the same primary literature and making basically the same assumptions these studies were principally undertaken as proof of concept exercises and the authors openly identified many of the limitations in these studies which have also been highlighted by soller et al 2003 some of the limitations and assumptions of these studies are as follows empirical evidence from field studies concerning the impact of recreational use of water sources that are also used as drinking water sources are limited and have mostly relied on the concentration of faecal indicators and not specific pathogens which makes it impossible to reliably estimate the loading of specific pathogens from bathers gerba 2000 there is insufficient data regarding the frequency of accidental faecal releases afrs in the study by anderson et al 1998 the frequency of afrs was assumed to be 1 afr per 1 000 recreators however this was based on a single unpublished grey literature study from 1997 which reported an assumed value from discussions with pool staff therefore a credible evidence based value for afr frequency needs to be determined soller et al 2003 information regarding transport and survival of cryptosporidium in bodies of water is relatively scarce leading to values from the literature being extrapolated stewart et al 2002 and these values will be increasingly impacted by climate change the extent to which faecal material entering the water column disaggregates and disperses or remains aggregated is unknown but has implications for pathogen transport inactivation treatment and peak event concentrations anderson et al 1998 thus as summarised by soller et al 2003 rigorous uncertainty analyses and clearly stating the explicit assumptions and validity of these assumptions are essential before any data generated can be used in policy or management decisions despite this critique by soller et al 2003 it has been commonplace for subsequent technical grey literature reports completed since that time to have used exactly or predominantly the same underlying assumptions based on citing one or more of those same three studies anderson et al 1998 gerba 2000 stewart et al 2002 the limitations noted within the above studies anderson et al 1998 gerba 2000 stewart et al 2002 and the soller et al 2003 review remain largely relevant today since there have been very few empirical studies undertaken over the past 20 years several additional limitations have been identified some due to changes in evidence and others simply due to them not having been noted in earlier critiques for example the estimates of masses of faecal matter shed during recreation in previous studies were estimated based largely on measurements of faecal coliforms from greywater from showers baths and washing machines by rose et al 1991 using data benchmarked against other similar studies from which the shedding of faecal masses was inferred gerba 2000 these represented the best available evidence at the time but was not based on an active sporting recreational water environment and are not direct measurements of faecal or pathogen shedding 2 2 exposure assessment 2 2 1 seasonality and demographics of infection since recreational water activity is highly seasonal peaking during holiday seasons and warmer months in most drinking water sources and primarily involving younger people it is important to understand the seasonal and or age demographic patterns in cryptosporidium prevalence that might in turn influence the risk profile to drinking water consumers globally cryptosporidiosis in humans has long been known to exhibit a strong and consistent seasonality with a main summer early autumn peak due predominantly to c hominis and associated with recreational water activity and a smaller spring peak associated with the zoonotic c parvum jagai et al 2009 yoder and beach 2010 cacciò and chalmers 2016 gharpure et al 2019 the seasonality in water detections appears to match the clinical notifications keeley and faulkner 2008 lapen et al 2016 in australia cryptosporidiosis is a national notifiable disease data from the national notifiable diseases surveillance system nndss http www health gov au as well as publications based on analysis of clinical data waldron et al 2011a lal et al 2015 ng hublin et al 2017 greenwood and reid 2020 and the monitoring of sewage deere and khan 2016 king et al 2017 zahedi et al 2018a supports the summer early autumn peak in cryptosporidiosis cases the difference between the summer peaks and winter troughs in notified clinically diagnosed cases is typically several fold and is more than an order of magnitude in sewage sampling deere and khan 2016 zahedi et al 2018a the majority of cryptosporidiosis cases globally including australia occur in children with the highest peak in children 4 years of age followed by the 5 9 age group ng et al 2010a b waldron et al 2011a lal et al 2015 ng hublin et al 2017 braima et al 2019 gharpure et al 2019 dong et al 2020 the higher incidence in children is due to their immunological immaturity and in developed countries is linked with water related recreational activities as children are more likely to participate in swimming activities such as splashing and diving that lead to water ingestion and children also have less bowel control suppes et al 2016 gharpure et al 2019 a second smaller peak after the 0 9 age group in cryptosporidiosis notifications predominantly in females in the 21 40 age group is common in australia ng et al 2010b waldron et al 2011a lal et al 2015 ng hublin et al 2017 braima et al 2019 and overseas hunter et al 2004 painter et al 2015 2016 and is attributed to secondary transmission from infected children to care givers this is supported by case control studies including a united kingdom uk study that identified changing children s nappies as a specific risk factor for infection with c hominis hunter et al 2004 data from a large cross sectional study in the uk to determine secondary transmission rates in households revealed that an average of two mostly undiagnosed cryptosporidiosis cases were identified in 25 of homes with a diagnosed index case mckerr et al 2022 female care givers and siblings in the household were most at risk of secondary infection and transmission rates were higher for c hominis compared with c parvum and other species mckerr et al 2022 whilst it is widely understood that secondary person to person spread of pathogens can occur following primary infections arising in recreational waters baron et al 1982 such cases have not previously been factored into qmra and are sometimes considered unimportant e g messner and berger 2016 this may lead to an underestimate of the true risk to drinking water consumers since only the primary infections are simulated for example as a result of the milwaukee waterborne outbreak in 1993 elevated secondary person to person transmission was reported amongst elderly individuals which are at an increased risk of severe disease during outbreaks naumova et al 2003 thus secondary transmission from infected children to care givers and vulnerable groups such as the elderly should be factored into qmra analysis 2 2 2 prevalence of infection estimating risk from persons recreating in water catchments and source water reservoirs requires estimating the prevalence of cryptosporidium in potential recreators to determine the probability of a person being infected with cryptosporidium at any point in time this is also a function of the probability of becoming infected in the first place and the duration of the infection until it is cleared by the host the global prevalence of cryptosporidium has been estimated at 7 6 with an average prevalence of 4 3 in developed countries and 10 4 in developing countries dong et al 2020 asymptomatic carriage is usually low particularly in developed countries and has been reported at prevalences ranging from 0 4 davies et al 2009 enserink et al 2015 reh et al 2019 in australia the nndss reports an average notification rate of 12 8 cases 100 000 population however notification rates amongst vulnerable populations can be much higher for example in western australia notification rates in aboriginal children were 20 5 times higher than non aboriginal children in the same age group over an 11 year period 2002 to 2012 ng hublin et al 2017 cryptosporidiosis notifications from 2001 2020 show distinct peaks in various years with the highest number of notifications in 2016 n 5 421 followed by 2017 n 4 694 and then 2009 4 623 reported cryptosporidium case numbers however likely represent only a small proportion of the actual numbers of both sporadic and outbreak cases of cryptosporidiosis as current surveillance methods lack sensitivity for example approximately 1 in 137 individuals who develop gastroenteritis will present to the doctor and be asked to supply a faecal specimen for screening and not all of these samples will be tested for microorganisms tam et al 2012 mchardy et al 2014 ryan et al 2017b the type of testing conducted is also relevant as although pathology laboratories are moving towards or have moved to pcr based detection methods which have been shown to be up to 10 times more sensitive than microscopy morgan et al 1998 ryan et al 2005 mergen et al 2020 many pathology laboratories still rely on microscopy studies in the uk have suggested that for every single general case of gastroenteritis reported there are 147 unreported cases tam et al 2012 while a study in australia suggested a ratio on one notified case of gastroenteritis to 500 community cases hall et al 2006 in the uk analysis has shown that sporadic cryptosporidiosis cases are frequently part of unrecognised outbreaks briggs et al 2014 with 8 2 community cases of cryptosporidiosis for every reported case based on pcr testing tam et al 2012 in a canadian study an under reporting factor of 48 5 was calculated for cryptosporidium detection rates thomas et al 2013 determining the prevalence of cryptosporidium infections in australia is therefore problematic however one study estimated that in 2010 cryptosporidium was responsible for 195 495 acute gastroenteritis age cases 4 718 hospitalisation and 333 disability adjusted life years dalys based on collated evidence from a range of published and unpublished data and government databases gibney et al 2014 this is compared to only 1 481 actual notifications for that year which equates to 1 notification for every 132 cases of age due to cryptosporidium and an incidence of 8 8 cases per 1 000 880 per 100 000 cases or 0 9 per person gibney et al 2014 in australia at least 26 recreational water associated outbreaks have been reported in the literature between 1995 and 2021 table 1 however this is also likely an underestimate as in addition to under reporting of gastroenteritis cases waterborne diseases are particularly difficult to identify due to the long incubation period for cryptosporidium 1 week and the difficulty associating symptoms with water exposure subsequent analysis of the milwaukee outbreak in 1993 indicated that a smaller outbreak had occurred a few weeks prior and had surveillance systems detected the earlier outbreak up to 85 of the cases in the subsequent main outbreak might have been prevented eisenberg et al 1998 recently petterson et al 2021 calculated a point prevalence of 0 11 for cryptosporidium in alberta canada based on the following formula r u d 7 n 1 a applying this to australia where r is the reported number of cases per week e g in australia this is 3 760 cryptosporidiosis cases based on estimates by gibney et al 2014 u is the underreporting factor e g 8 2 as reported by tam et al 2012 or 1 d is the mean duration of excretion days 6 days using the data from the c hominis human feeding trial hft trial by chappell et al 2006 n is the population size e g population of australia is 25 6 m and a is the asymptomatic infection rate 0 01 this gives a conservative point prevalence of cryptosporidium for australia of 0 01 to 0 1 0 28 6 95 confidence interval depending on whether a multiplier under reporting factor of 1 or 8 2 is used a summer spike in prevalence should also be considered due to the very seasonal nature of c hominis infections note the under reporting factor of 48 5 as reported by thomas et al 2013 was not used as this resulted in an unrealistically high point prevalence 0 6 when applied to the gibney et al 2014 prevalence data 2 2 3 amplification of c hominis by animals in water catchments there is also emerging evidence of amplification of c hominis in animals residing in water catchments following its introduction by humans ng et al 2011 koehler et al 2016 zahedi et al 2016a and b 2018b for example c hominis has been detected in kangaroos and cattle in a sydney drinking water catchment ng et al 2011 zahedi et al 2016a 2018b cattle in western australian catchments zahedi et al 2018b and in deer and marsupials in melbourne catchments koehler et al 2016 in the studies by zahedi et al 2016a the mean number of oocysts g 1 for kangaroos and cattle that were positive for c hominis was 6 041 range 26 16 890 g 1 as determined by quantitative pcr qpcr suggesting that the animals were infected and not just mechanically transmitting oocysts the same marsupial population in the sydney catchment was first screened for cryptosporidium species in 2004 and only the marsupial associated species c fayeri and c macropodum were detected power et al 2004 in 2011 c hominis was detected in marsupials inhabiting this catchment for the first time but the shedding levels were thought to be very low as evidenced by the inability to amplify cryptosporidium dna at additional loci ng et al 2011 the identification of higher levels of oocyst shedding in 2016 by zahedi et al zahedi et al 2016a coupled with the identification of a single gp60 subtype 1ba10g2 by next generation amplicon sequencing suggests a very recent introduction of c hominis into the marsupial population via spillback from humans zahedi et al 2017 the identification of identical c fayeri gp60 subtypes in humans and marsupials in sydney and wa further support increased interaction between humans and wildlife in drinking water catchments waldron et al 2010 braima et al 2021b globally there has also been an increase in the detection and amplification of c hominis in animal hosts and it is recognised that c hominis is now endemic in equine populations widmer et al 2020 the effect of c hominis amplification within cattle and marsupials and other fauna in catchments from camping activities in addition to recreational activities in water has not previously been factored into the qmra studies and this leads to an underestimate of the risk when comparing protected with open catchment scenarios 2 2 4 release of faecal matter cryptosporidiosis results in profuse watery diarrhoea carter et al 2020 which can promote the accidental or unprevented release of significant quantities of faecal material during recreational water activity the consistency of diarrhoea also makes anal and hand hygiene practices less effective increasing the potential for smeared faecal material to be retained on the skin following bowel movements which can subsequently be shed during recreational water activity in understanding cryptosporidium inputs to water sources there is a need to estimate variables such as the use of toilet facilities in the catchment area combined with their rate of failure open defecation in connectivity with water accidental faecal releases afr directly into water and release of faecal matter via shedding from small quantities of material remaining from earlier defecation events or being expelled alongside flatulence evidence to estimate such inputs come from a range of sources studies by elmir et al 2007 2009 which examined concentrations of enterococci released by bathers n 10 in an inflatable pool 4700 l showed that mean concentration of enterococci shed per subject was 3 105 cfu in an australian study bathroom water greywater from toilets and showers was found to contain on average 3 2 and up to 4 3 log10 e coli per 100 ml o toole et al 2012 this is similar to the 3 8 log10 faecal coliform average reported by rose et al 1991 in studies on bath and shower water these levels of faecal indicators are approximately 3 to 4 log10 below those found in sewage based on typical values for e coli concentrations in sewage and stools and volumes of water used in baths and showers this is consistent with the amount of faecal matter shed during bathing and showering activities being of the order 0 1 to 1 g rose et al 1991 noted that households with children had significantly more microbial faecal indicators in their greywater than those without as discussed children are more likely than adults in general to be partaking in higher levels of body contact recreational activity in addition those partaking in recreational water activity would entail more physically active movement than bathing and thus be more likely to mobilise more faecal matter than showering or bathing therefore in estimating faecal shedding during recreational water activity it is recommended that an estimate of 1 g be made accidental faecal releases afr s are the uncontrolled or accidental release of faecal material directly into water and which are thought to frequently go undetected who 2006 2011 as discussed however the evidence of the extent of afr inputs is still based largely on purely anecdotal evidence from pool operators and industry practitioners soller et al 2003 and this continues to be the case today although there is a requirement for swimming pool owners to keep incident logs in some jurisdictions and such data could readily be mined to provide some statistical evidence there is a strong disincentive to report and respond to afr s as typically this leads to pool closures often for many hours and potentially full drainage and super chlorination an objective prospective process is required to determine the frequency of afr s in pools as there is not a highly credible evidence based value an afr frequency of 50 has been assumed for symptomatic individuals for diarrhoea further clinical research is required to test those assumptions the mass of an afr has been assumed to be 200 g based on the definition of diarrhoea in volunteers infected with c hominis chappell et al 2006 2 2 5 cryptosporidium shedding the extent of faecal shedding during recreation is a function of the concentration of cryptosporidium present in faeces and the quantity of faeces shed to date nine human feeding trials hft have been conducted on four cryptosporidium species c parvum isolates ucp iowa tamu and moredun dupont et al 1995 okhuysen et al 1998 1999 chappell et al 1996 1999 messner et al 2001 okhuysen et al 2002 c hominis isolate tu502 chappell et al 2006 c meleagridis isolate tu1867 chappell et al 2011 and c muris isolate rn66 chappell et al 2015 cryptosporidium meleagridis is the third most common cryptosporidium species in humans and while in developing countries it can sometimes be the dominant species in humans in developed countries including australia it usually accounts for only 1 4 of human infections ng hublin et al 2017 braima et al 2019 chappell et al 2011 yang et al 2021 cryptosporidium muris is a gastric species and has been reported in humans in a few studies in developing countries but has not been reported in humans in australia yang et al 2021 in addition the c muris hft was a proof of concept study that used a very large oocyst dose 1 106 which greatly exceeds the 50 infectious dose id50 of previous hfts chappell et al 2015 so is unlikely to be representative of actual exposures via water cryptosporidium hominis and c parvum are the dominant species in humans but the distribution of c hominis in human populations differs between different countries yang et al 2021 in australia c hominis accounts for 66 90 of human cryptosporidial infections jex et al 2007 jex et al 2008 o brien et al 2008 pangasa et al 2009 ng et al 2010a 2010b waldron et al 2011a 2011b koehler et al 2013 2014 ebner et al 2015 ng hublin et al 2015 ng hublin et al 2017 2018 braima et al 2019 importantly all recreational water associated outbreaks typed to date in australia have been due to c hominis table 1 similarly globally recreational water associated outbreaks have also predominantly been caused by c hominis causer et al 2006 chalmers 2012 cope et al 2015 hlavsa et al 2017 chalmers et al 2019 zahedi and ryan 2020 as with other countries in addition to c parvum a wide variety of mostly wildlife and livestock associated cryptosporidium species have been identified in australian source water including c ubiquitum c cuniculus c ryanae c bovis c tyzzeri c muris c fayeri and c andersoni swaffer et al 2014 king et al 2015 swaffer et al 2018 however few studies have compared the incidence and species of cryptosporidium in recreational versus non recreational catchments a study by loganthan et al 2012 in wa reported a much higher overall prevalence of cryptosporidium in recreational catchments 44 7 v 16 7 with c hominis detected in recreational sites that allowed swimming and camping but not in non recreational sites loganthan et al 2012 thus qmra infectivity assumptions based on c hominis hft are likely more representative of the risk associated with oocysts shed by humans in recreational water environments symptoms experienced during the c hominis hft included diarrhoea defined as 200 g unformed stool day 3 unformed stools over an 8 hour period or 4 unformed stool s over a 24 hour period and symptomatic illness was defined as 2 concurrent symptoms e g diarrhoea vomiting faecal urgency or faecal incontinence chappell et al 2006 where symptoms were observed the incubation period from inoculation to onset was from 2 to 10 days mean and median 5 and 4 days the duration of symptoms ranged from 2 to 22 days mean and median 6 and 3 days between 0 28 and 2 3 kg of unformed stool was passed during each episode of diarrhoea median and mean of 1 1 and 0 9 kg respectively inoculum doses were 30 100 300 500 1000 10 000 100 000 and 1 000 000 oocysts and infections occurred at all doses including 4 5 doses of 10 oocysts chappell et al 2006 furthermore whilst the inoculum was given up to six weeks following oocyst production excystation and dye staining viability levels of 67 83 and 66 87 respectively were recorded chappell et al 2006 these clinical observations are largely similar to those for c parvum infection iowa isolate described in an earlier hft by du pont et al 1995 inoculum doses were 10 30 100 and 500 oocysts and the incubation period from inoculation to onset was from 4 to 22 days with a mean of 9 days the duration of symptoms ranged from 2 5 to 3 5 days with a mean of 3 days between 0 4 and 2 1 kg of unformed stool was passed during each episode of cryptosporidiosis mean of 1 23 kg the age of the c parvum inoculum used in that study iowa isolate which was derived from a calf was between 10 to 40 days old and had excystation and dye staining viability levels of 79 89 and 64 84 respectively dupont et al 1995 the concentration of c parvum oocysts detected in faecal material from this hft was analysed further by chappell et al 1996 the total output of oocysts during infection expressed in log10 units ranged between 4 5 and 9 5 the shedding of oocysts during infection was highest 7 to 9 log10 among the groups of volunteers exposed to more realistic dose ranges 30 to 500 oocysts dose converting those to oocysts per unit mass predicts an average concentration in oocyst g faeces expressed in log10 units as ranging from 1 4 to 6 5 chappell et al 1996 these studies show that cryptosporidium is a highly infectious pathogen and can retain its infectivity over time hence it is not unreasonable to assume that at least for the oocysts shed during the peak of the shedding they would be as infectious as the primary inoculum the hft s were all conducted on healthy adult volunteers however more significant and extended oocyst shedding can occur in immune compromised persons and in immunologically immature children for example a study of cryptosporidiosis in aids patients reported that oocyst excretion ranged from 6 0 106 to 1 2 109 oocysts day with an average stool weight of 1 2 kg day goodgame et al 1993 and in hiv patients oocyst shedding was persistent over the 60 day monitoring period tam et al 2021 a study in the us reported a median duration of diarrhoea of 11 5 days range 1 44 days in children aged 5 years or less infected with cryptosporidium and that duration of oocyst shedding ranged from 8 50 days stehr green et al 1987 in brazil young children 2 7 42 6 months old infected with c hominis shed significantly more oocysts ml of stool compared to c parvum infected children 3 5 106 vs 1 7 106 per ml and had a longer duration of diarrhoea means of 20 9 days v 13 3 days bushen et al 2007 in addition several studies have shown that oocyst shedding can continue after cessation of symptoms for up to 2 months jokipii and jokipii 1986 stehr green et al 1987 mcmurry et al 2021 it also is important to note that symptomatic infections result in the passage of more than the normal quantity of faecal material consequently simply multiplying the concentration of pathogens in faeces by a typical faecal mass may underestimate the pathogen load shed by a symptomatic individual for whom the faecal mass would be expected to be larger therefore for estimating the oocyst shedding in faeces a mass of at least 200 g per faecal release and a peak concentration of at least 6 5 log10 oocysts g is a reasonable evidence based estimate this yields a daily peak shedding rate of 9 log10 oocysts day 2 2 6 volume of water consumed the volume of water consumed by drinking water customers from the source water contaminated by recreational activity once it reaches households must be accessed in general an assumption is made that 1 litre of unboiled water is consumed per day in undertaking qmra for microorganisms nhmrc 2011 studies have shown that mean daily consumption of unboiled tap water varies from 0 10 litre to 1 55 litres with a large variability between countries and studies mons et al 2007 for australia a conservative estimate of 900 ml is suggested mons et al 2007 a more recent study of water intake in australia provided estimates ranging from 1 2 to 3 6 l from the sum of foods and liquids although the contribution from tap water was not singled out mallett et al 2021 the latter study noted that water intake was higher in warmer conditions recreational activity in water catchments is likely to be temporally associated with periods of increased unboiled water consumption e g during warmer or drier times of year therefore it is recommended that 1 5 litres of unboiled tap water be assumed for the purposes of assessing risks associated with recreation which is at the upper end of the range indicated by mons et al 2007 and more consistent with the range indicated by mallett et al 2021 2 3 dose response assessment data and analysis from the nine hft s discussed above have revealed that cryptosporidium infectivity shows very significant differences according to species and type and the age and immune status of the hosts as well as previous exposure to the parasite messner and berger 2016 schmidt and chappell 2016 earlier recreational water qmra studies haas et al 1996 based on the dupont et al 1995 hft using the c parvum iowa strain with a 50 infectious dose id50 of 132 were interpreted to give an infection probability per ingested oocyst of 0 0042 more recently the c hominis hft using the c hominis tu502 isolate with an id50 of 10 oocysts chappell et al 2006 was interpreted by schijven et al 2014 to give an infection probability per ingested oocyst of 0 76 this suggests that c hominis is over two orders of magnitude more infectious to humans than c parvum more recently messner and berger 2016 suggested that the infection probability may be even lower for low doses and that future hft s should focus on low doses of oocysts 5 or less the c hominis tu502 strain that was used in the study by chappell et al 2006 was originally isolated from a child with cryptosporidiosis in uganda but has subsequently been propagated extensively in a gnotobiotic pig model and also calves akiyoshi et al 2002 in 2012 however a different strain appeared in the pig model possibly due to a contaminating isolate outcompeting the original tu502 strain isaza et al 2015 widmer et al 2015 the original c hominis tu502 genome sequenced in 2004 has been typed as gp60 subtype iaa25r3 chalmers et al 2008 while the new c hominis tu502 strain belongs to the ib subtype family isaza et al 2015 it is likely that the c hominis hft conducted by chappell et al 2006 used the iaa25r3 c hominis tu502 strain however as the majority of waterborne outbreaks typed to date have been due to c hominis subtype iba10g2 chalmers et al 2012 2019 zahedi and ryan 2020 yang et al 2021 a hft on this subtype would be very valuable within c parvum dose response studies have shown that the median id50 of three different us c parvum strains ucp iowa tamu varied considerably 12 1 2 066 oocysts and consequently had very different infection probabilities per ingested oocyst ucp 0 00038 iowa 0 0054 tamu 0 048 okhuysen et al 1999 messner et al 2001 another hft study was conducted on a uk moredun isolate originally isolated from red deer calf cervus elaphus and subsequently passaged in sheep and was presumed to be c parvum okhuysen et al 2002 the id50 was similar to the c parvum iowa isolate 375 oocysts but subjects had an earlier illness onset 3 vs 7 days and longer median duration of diarrhea compared with the iowa exposed subjects 169h vs 93 h okhuysen et al 2002 data on the infectivity of different c hominis strains using hfts are not available but such studies need to be conducted some qmra studies have based their dose response analysis on both c parvum and c hominis hft on the basis that these two species combined are responsible for 95 of human infections e g lapen et al 2016 however as discussed c hominis is responsible for the majority of recreational waterborne outbreaks and has much higher infectivity for humans than c parvum therefore the infection probability per ingested c hominis oocyst of 0 76 derived by schijven et al 2014 is the dose response model recommended for estimating health risks to drinking water consumers from cryptosporidium oocysts shed by persons engaged in recreational activities in drinking water sources host immunity also plays a major role in pathogen dose response and shedding teunis et al 2002 re infection of the same volunteers 12 months later with 500 oocysts in the c parvum hft by dupont et al 1995 resulted in significantly lower rates of pathogen shedding among individuals 16 v 68 although the rates of diarrhoea were similar okhuysen et al 1998 a subsequent study challenged healthy adults with pre existing serum igg antibodies to cryptosporidium with 500 50 000 c parvum oocysts chappell et al 1999 results revealed that the id50 was 20 fold higher than in seronegative volunteers 1 880 v 132 oocysts and oocyst shedding was only detected in 54 13 17 chappell et al 1999 seroprevalence of antibodies to cryptosporidium is usually conducted based on igg responses to low molecular weight proteins including 15 17 and 27 kda sporozoite antigens studies in the us have reported 2 21 seroprevalence to cryptosporidium igg antibodies with the highest prevalence in lower socioeconomic communities becker et al 2015 bradbury et al 2020 in australia no recent studies are available which is an important knowledge gap but the prevalence of paired igm and igg antibodies has been reported as 8 in children and 5 in adults groves et al 1994 serum igg responses to 15 and 17 kda sporozoite antigens peaked within 60 92 days of symptom onset and decreased over time groves et al 1994 priest et al 2001 chalmers et al 2013 response to the 27 kda antigen appeared to be much lower but was detectable up to 12 months post infection muller et al 2001 chalmers et al 2013 a better understanding of both the prevalence and titre levels of anti cryptosporidium igg is essential to better understand the variation of susceptibility to infection with cryptosporidium in the australian population 2 4 risk characterisation the key purpose of qmra is to estimate risks to health based on exposure and dose response assessments and compare those estimates to some target or benchmark usually termed the tolerable risk within australia although not mandated many water utilities have adopted a tolerable risk of 1 infection per 10 000 people per year however australia like many countries is now adopting a tolerable risk of 1 micro disability adjusted life year µdaly o toole et al 2015 the daly is a unit originally devised to compare health outcomes from different diseases or health conditions and modified to develop health based targets for drinking water quality havelaar and melse 2003 the daly is quantified as the sum of the years of life lost yll and the years lived with a disability yld or lost personal utility due to a particular agent the daly per case is the average burden of a single case of disease and thus is different for each pathogen based on the daly per case data generated for cryptosporidium cases in australia by gibney et al 2014 analysis revealed that 1 µdaly allows for 6 of diarrhoeal disease caused by cryptosporidium to be associated with consumption of drinking water o toole et al 2015 currently the 1 µdaly health based target is not based on risks from recreation but on risks to water consumers from all pollution sources hence it is necessary to add the risks from recreation to the baseline risk to understand how much recreation changes the risk and whether it pushes risk beyond a benchmark level when completing a screening level qmra to initially estimate risks to the health of drinking water consumers from cryptosporidium associated with recreation within source waters a set of proposed generic interim assumptions along with the associated evidence base has been set out in table 2 as part of this analysis the potential for waterborne disease outbreaks that may occur during peak periods of recreational water use and the endemic disease burden also needs to be estimated as averaging risks over time can potentially miss significant risks therefore for screening level assessments as a minimum the reasonably foreseeable upper bound risks that arise during peak periods of recreational water use should be estimated in addition to the generic interim assumptions given in table 2 site specific assumptions need to be developed these include estimating the nature and extent of recreational activities in specific source water catchments to permit quantitative estimates of persons that might be present in specific catchments and source waters information on their age and other demographic variables and the availability of sanitation facilities which may influence the likelihood of afrs in the source waters needs to be considered controls on visitor numbers activities locations and behaviours need to be understood and realistically estimated these site specific variables cannot be assigned generic values as risks from cryptosporidium will increase as the level of usage of the specific site increases since more people would collectively shed more oocysts there is empirical epidemiological evidence that is consistent with this assumption a study of 3 805 bathers at three beaches found a statistically significant increased risk of gastrointestinal illness among bathers in areas with higher bather density compared with beaches with a lower bather density papastergiou et al 2011 2012 similarly the concentration of cryptosporidium oocysts detected at recreational beaches in the us was significantly correlated with bather density graczyk et al 2007 2010 sunderland et al 2007 therefore local evidence on recreator activity behaviour and density needs to be taken into account in site specific studies when applying this evidence to a specific setting best practice involves predicting the whole range of risks using probabilistic risk assessment methods including hydrodynamic modelling of the fate of oocysts in the water column as well as the performance of water treatment processes betancourt and rose 2004 a detailed assessment is beyond the scope of this review but are relevant to any qmra for a drinking water supply briefly oocyst sedimentation resuspension aggregation and transport as well as inactivating factors such as temperature salinity pressure solar radiation visible and uv predation by zooplankton within the water body and future climate variability need to be assessed e g brookes et al 2004 hipsey et al 2004 king and monis 2007 hoyer et al 2015 tolouei et al 2019 there is wide variability however with studies reporting settling rates ranging from 0 03 10 m day 1 depending on levels of oocyst aggregation with other particles and or organic material brookes et al 2004 king and monis 2007 oocysts are rapidly inactivated at temperatures 37 c and are very susceptible to solar inactivation 3 log inactivation day during an australian summer king and monis 2007 an interactive computational tool qmracatch has been developed to simulate the transport and fate of cryptosporidium and other microorganisms in water which should prove useful schijven et al 2015 best practice involves quantification or at least estimation of the infectious fraction of oocysts as incorrect assumptions can overestimate or underestimate risk and associated estimates of source water protection and or water treatment requirements source water studies of the proportion of infectious oocysts using cell culture infectivity assays have shown that this is highly variable 0 65 4 swaffer et al 2014 king et al 2017 guidelines for wastewater usually specify log10 reduction value lrv targets however removal of cryptosporidium from wastewater is highly variable and heavily influenced by the type of treatment plant those with lagoon systems have higher inactivation rates as well as seasonality of cryptosporidiosis burdens in the community and seasonal increases in the volume and flow of raw effluent king et al 2017 as with drinking water inclusion of assumptions of the remaining infectious oocyst fraction after wastewater treatment is crucial for accurate risk assessment infectivity studies have shown that the infectious oocyst fraction in wastewater varied between 28 50 in secondary effluent between different plants and surprisingly the infectious oocyst fraction was generally higher than that of the oocysts in raw sewage king et al 2017 analysis also revealed that while oocyst infectivity was highly variable between plants within plants infectivity did not appear to be linked to season or with increased community levels of cryptosporidiosis king et al 2017 an important knowledge gap is the fate of c hominis in the environment and drinking water treatment process as the majority of research to date has been conducted on c parvum or indicator organisms king and monis 2007 and while it is assumed that the fate of c hominis would be similar to c parvum specific research on this topic is needed 3 conclusions the epidemiology of cryptosporidium and its public health impacts needs to be kept in mind when conducting qmra on body contact recreation in source water the highest prevalence of cryptosporidium is in children who are also most likely to be engaged in higher risk swimming activities and have less bowel control secondary spread of cryptosporidiosis to care givers of children and the elderly should be considered in the qmra cryptosporidium exhibits a strong seasonality with peaks in summer and early autumn which influences the risk profile to drinking water consumers as c hominis is the dominant species in humans and is responsible for the majority of recreational water associated outbreaks dose response and exposure assessment should be based primarily on available data for this species spill back of cryptosporidium including c hominis from recreators into animals in catchments and subsequent amplification in those hosts may in turn increase the human infectious cryptosporidium concentrations in the source way beyond the levels directly attributable to recreators over time new evidence will emerge that will support or invalidate the assumptions and recommendations provided in this review the data presented is not a probabilistic risk assessment but rather a practical simple risk model to provide a more evidence based starting point to undertake in depth risk assessments for recreational water qmra studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

15798,organic phosphorus op is one of the main forms of phosphorus in lake ecosystems mounting evidence has shown that sediment op has become a major but underestimated issue in addressing lake eutrophication and algal bloom however a holistic view of sediment op remains missing this review aims to provide an overview of progress on the studies of op in lake sediments focusing on the contribution of op to internal p loading its potential role in algal bloom and the migration and transformation in addition this work systematically summarized current methods for characterizing op content chemical fraction composition bioavailability and assessment of op release in sediment with the pros and cons of each method being discussed in the end this work pointed out following efforts needed to deepen the understanding of sediment op namely 1 in depth literature review from a global perspective regarding the contribution of sediment op to internal p loading with further summary

challenge for human health and ecological protection brookes and carey 2011 mccrackin et al 2017 phosphorus p has been regarded as a limiting factor for eutrophication and is responsible for the large scale burst of cyanobacteria growth carpenter 2008 conley et al 2009 sediment is the major p pool in lake systems which can significantly affect water quality by p releasing nürnberg et al 2013 markovic et al 2019 efficient p reduction from sediments has become a major research topic in lake management as strict external p discharge limits have been implemented the release and diffusion flux of p calculated by thermodynamics and kinetics model of soluble reactive p srp are the basis for assessing the risk of sediment p release tohru et al 1989 fan et al 2002 by comparison organic p op has a similar magnitude as inorganic p ip in many aquatic ecosystems björkman and karl 2003 ding et al 2010 feng et al 2018 but it is usually ignored due to the complexity regarding its composition bioavailability environmental processes and effects bai et al 2009 shinohara et al 2017 in recent years there is an increasing emphasis on the importance of op to lake eutrophication water quality and algal blooms with numerous studies on op composition bioavailability fate behavior and environmental impacts dyhrman et al 2006 bünemann 2008 duhamel et al 2021 ni et al 2021 since 1980s 181 articles on sediment op have been published on the web of science the number is about a quarter of published works on soil op and about 8 3 of works on p with approximately ten new articles per year since 2010 fig 1 op contains a variety of different compounds ranging from nucleotide phospholipids phosphates phosphor sugar phosphoprotein inositol phosphate to organic complex phosphate worsfold et al 2008 venkatesan et al 2018 the other components with no distinct chemical formulae or cannot be dissolved by chemicals are usually referred to as refractory op op represents an important bridge between the biogeochemical cycles of p and biological processes duhamel et al 2021 for example phytoplankton can directly use low molecular weight lmw op for reproduction zou et al 2005 while plants e g clover barley oats and wheat are able to utilize op efficiently as they do with inorganic sources tarafdar and claassen 1988 for nutritional utilization dissolved organic phosphorus dop is much more labile than dissolved organic carbon doc and nitrogen don in the marine environments lønborg and álvarez salgado 2012 with the mineralization rate of dop being nearly twice as rapidly as doc and don in the ocean letscher and moore 2015 in lake sediments op is usually closely related to lake trophic level and is considered a better indicator than total p for trophic level and sediment pollution level vaalgamaa 2004 liao et al 2010 ni et al 2019a in particular the bioavailable op is found to regulate eutrophic status and facilitate algal bloom of lakes zhu et al 2013 ni et al 2019b darch et al 2013 those studies imply that op might have an ecological and environmental impact on aquatic systems therefore lake management and protection plans must consider the role contribution and potential risks of op in water quality and eco environment in recent years the development of analytical techniques for op structure composition and bioavailability has received a great attention to better understand the degradability and the release of op in sediments nonetheless no systematic studies have been performed to investigate the characteristics of op and a substantial portion of op components remains unresolved mclaren et al 2015 2020 furthermore the biogeochemical cycle and key pathways of op such as adsorption desorption ligand exchange mineralization humification photolysis enzymatic hydrolysis and molecular diffusion have not received comprehensive measures as a result in depth discussions about the importance and the potential role of sediment op in lake eutrophication and algal bloom are lacking with inconclusive or even controversial findings about the content chemical fraction composition bioavailability migration and transformation of op several review literature have summarized studies which look into the determination of aquatic op worsfold et al 2008 darch et al 2013 chemical nature of soil op mclaren et al 2020 soil op mineralization rates bünemann 2015 martínez 1968 as well as the distribution circulation of op and its ecological significance to the aquatic environments baldwin 2013 however studies on the potential role of sediment op in lake eutrophication algal blooms the migration and transformation pathways remain inadequate with few works focusing on improving the characterization methods of op using multiple methods despite that they might provide critical insights for fathoming the biogeochemical behavior of sediment op this review aims to fill those gaps by 1 elaborating the contribution of op to sediment internal p loading and its potential role in algal blooms 2 updating the latest progress on the studies about migration and transformation pathways and mechanisms of sediment op and 3 summarizing and critically discussing the state of art characterization methods for sediment op built on those basis we further put forward the challenges issues and opportunities that might shed light on further research this work is expected to broaden our understanding on the characteristics and environmental impact of op in lake sediments and deliver new perspectives about the characterization methods of op 2 contribution of op to sediment internal p loading as a major component in lake p biogeochemistry op exists widely in water body macrophytes phytoplankton particulate matter atmospheric deposits and sediments fig 2 in rivers it was found that dop contributed up to 38 68 42 on average 4 2 100 60 on average and 39 69 52 on average of the total dissolved p dtp in erhai lake ji et al 2017 dianchi lake he et al 2014 and the great lakes yang et al 2021 respectively in water bodies the concentration of dop accounts for more than 55 of dtp in taihu lake dianchi lake and baltic sea nausch and nausch 2006 gao et al 2006 he et al 2014 and it was also reported that the dop pool was often 5 8 times larger than the measured srp pool in water bodies 0 100 m below the surface in the north pacific subtropical gyre björkman and karl 2003 the particulate op pop in fox river and the great bay of the great lakes accounts for 47 87 67 on average of total particulate p yang et al 2021 the dop in atmospheric deposits on average accounts on average for 55 and 59 of dtp in erhai lake and dianchi lake of china respectively ji et al 2017 he et al 2014 for aquatic plants op could account on average for 56 and 47 of total p in algae and aquatic macrophytes respectively feng et al 2016 two surveys have showed that for chinese lakes the content of op to total p can vary from 12 to 60 ding et al 2010 ni et al 2016 in addition the water extractable op was found to be the dominant part in dtp 74 5 on average of the sediments from ten chinese lakes ni et al 2022a these results indicate the high proportion of op in aquatic systems thus the contribution of sediment op to internal p loading cannot be ignored it is worth to notice that during past decades the drastic recessions of aquatic vegetations zhang et al 2017 and increased phytoplankton bloom events ho et al 2019 has led to the vast amount of aquatic vegetations and phytoplankton debris which accelerate the accumulation of op in lake sediments worldwide wastewater from residential areas and agricultural activities e g domestic sewage treatment application of chemical fertilizers and manure livestock farming is another factor that contribute to op loading on lakes lü et al 2016 ni et al 2020 the accelerated p loss from agricultural activities and residential wastewater in the past decades liu et al 2016 yuan et al 2018 especial in developing countries would enhance op accumulation in lake sediments and thus cause water quality issue and aquatic biodiversity losses studies have shown that the enhanced lake eutrophication level will significantly increase the content of enzymatic hydrolysable op in sediments ni et al 2016 while hypereutrophic lakes with high algal biomass will accelerate op hydrolysis and mineralization yuan et al 2020 which indicates that with the continuously intensified lake eutrophication the accumulated op in sediments might become a ticking time bomb that will jarpordize lake water quality in future wang et al 2008 reported that polluted sediments correspondent to high release of dop from sediments furthermore the contribution from op mineralization in sediments to eutrophication is found to be greater than that of ip in macrophyte dominated eutrophic lakes and the mineralization process plays a critical role in the release of internal p yu et al 2022 these results reflect that with global accelerated lake eutrophication and enhanced anthropogenic p inputs it is urgent to investigate the accumulation and the contribution of sediment op to internal loading to prevent the deterioration of lake ecosystems 3 potential role of sediment op in algal blooms and eutrophication algae act as a primary link between p circulation and lake ecosystems zou et al 2020 it is known that algal blooms could enhance the release of fe bound p from sediments which in turn provide srp to support algal blooms xie et al 2003 chen et al 2018 wang et al 2019a yao et al 2022 forming a positive feedback loop between sediment p flux and algal blooms so called biological pump for op some research reported that algae e g prorocentrum donghaiense lu and bacterial e g m aeruginosa can use dop compounds efficiently via alkaline phosphatase apa to sustain its growth under srp depletion huang et al 2005 harke et al 2012 that is dop utilization is also vital in shaping phytoplankton community in p deficient waters ma et al 2019 apa plays an important role in regulating algal blooms and p dynamics in aquatic environments wang et al 2021 the activity of apa in sediments is usually influenced by the outbreak and perishing of algae with apa being more active during algal blooms xu et al 2013 bao et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 the enhanced transformation of srp from dop by elevated cell associated apa activity and quantity in eutrophic water and sediment would replenish bioavailable p to further promote algal blooms yuan et al 2019 wang et al 2021 and the capacity of op hydrolysis is close to that of srp uptake under p starvation moorleghem et al 2013 furthermore the remineralization of dop can increase the niche for diazotrophs and facilitate nitrogen fixation letscher and moore 2015 thus providing more nitrogen source for algae lake eutrophication processes and algal bloom can also significantly alter aquatic conditions such as ph and dissolved oxygen do zuo 2015 reported that the release of op from sediments significantly increased under ph from 7 to 9 5 and do level appeared to be the most influential in terms of op release from sediments with sediments under anoxic conditions generally releasing more op than that of aerobic environment zuo 2015 zhang et al 2017 this suggests that high ph and low do level during algal blooms would promote the release of op from sediments the settled algae residues could enhance the accumulation of fe p and bioavailable op in sediments which in turn replenish available p pools to further facilitate algal growth ni et al 2019b wang et al 2019a like sediment ip this positive feedback between the accumulation and release of sediment op and algal growth would sustain algal blooms persistently even under controlled external p loading or low level of srp in water however the quantitative relationship between algal blooms and the replenishment of op in sediments remains unclear therefore better mathematical models or methods for describing the linkage between the biological pump of algal bloom processes i e cyanobacteria formation aggregation and decay processes and the replenishment i e dynamic process of degradation transformation and diffusion of op in sediments would be an impending issue fig 3 4 migration and transformation of op in sediments the migration and transformation of op in sediments mainly include adsorption desorption deposition diffusion biological assimilation mineralization humification and the transformation of chemical composition and molecular size fig 4 like adsorption desorption mechanism of orthophosphate op can absorb with minerals e g iron aluminum oxide through ligand exchange olsson et al 2010 yan et al 2014a 2014b some species of op e g denosine monophosphate adenosine triphosphate glucose 6 phosphate and aminoethylphosphonic acid showed lower efficiency in sorption with iron oxide than that of orthophosphate ruttenberg and sulak 2011 indicating that the mobility of these dop compounds may exceed that of orthophosphate in sediments under certain conditions in contrast the adsorption quantity of iron aluminum oxide and clay mineral with inositol hexaphosphate are much larger than that of orthophosphate due to the abundant phosphate groups of inositol hexaphosphate yan et al 2012 which might explain its high stability in sediments the migration of op from sediments to overlying water involves four pathways 1 chemical process namely the degradation of op releases through chemical hydrolysis li et al 2011 and photolysis li et al 2019 2 biological process namely biomineralization wang and pant 2010 3 the kinetic process namely the resuspension of pop and dop under the action of wind hydrodynamic force benthic activities li et al 2019 and 4 the diffusion of dop between water sediment interface guan et al 2013 the dynamic change of chemical composition is the most important indicator for op transformation previous studies suggested that the compositional transformation of op in sediments is usually accompanied by the degradation release and burial of p compounds for example yu et al 2022 found that the mineralization of sediment op can result into p combination fe al fe mn phospholipid is usually degraded into α glycerophosphate and β glycerophosphate doolette et al 2009 while rna p can turn into nucleotide bünemann et al 2008 by microorganisms under alkaline conditions also some op species such as phytate myo inositol l 2 3 4 5 6 hexakisphosphate could be transformed into orthophosphate by phytase hydrolysis zhu et al 2013 or by precipitation as metal complexes form into insoluble and stable metal phytate thus buried in sediments permanently jørgensen et al 2011 therefore elucidating the transformation of op chemical composition would provide critical information for understanding the biogeochemical cycle of op and for assessing its potential risk from sediments another under explored area is about the molecular size transformation of op recent research revealed that the compositional transformation of organic molecules is usually accompanied by changes of molecular size while the intrinsic transformation and degradation of organic molecules is usually regulated by both molecular size and organic compositions xu and guo 2018 for instance the concentrations of total organic carbon carbohydrates and protein like substances decrease during dissolved organic matter dom incubation while the mw of dom would transform from lmw dom 1 kda to high mw dom hmw dom colloids 1 kda 0 45 μm and further transform into microparticles 0 45 μm xu and guo 2018 liberated or freshly photosynthesized dom and dop generated by assimilation and uptake of srp via phytoplankton would be mainly composed by hmw substances or colloids qu et al 2012 benner and amon 2015 yang et al 2021 while the hmw organic molecules are usually have higher biological reactivity and degradation rates than its lmw counterparts benner and amon 2015 ni et al 2022a this might be explained by the fact that hmw dom colloids can either be aggregated into particles by colloidal pumping and self assembly honeyman and santschi 1989 xu and guo 2018 or be decomposed into smaller molecules through photolysis enzymatic hydrolysis or chemical reactions santschi et al 2006 santschi 2018 the transformation of molecular size exerts a profound impact on adsorption desorption as well as the bioavailability of op which impose the potential risk of p release from sediments for instance the maximum sorption of dop with iron oxyhydr oxides decreases with the increasing mw of p compounds ruttenberg and sulak 2011 yan et al 2014a shinohara et al 2017 argued that the large molecular size of molybdenum unreactive p in pore water hampers its diffusion from sediments into overlying water therefore the composition and the dynamic changes of molecular size of op shall be taken into account to better explore the transformation mechanism and the potential environmental impact of op in sediments 5 advances in characterization methods of sediment op characterizing sediment op is a key to understand its properties and to determine its environmental behavior fate as well as potential environmental risk this section reviewed the state of the art characterization methods and technologies for content chemical fraction composition structure bioavailability and release in sediment op 5 1 op contents typically the content of op in sediments is determined by chemical extraction and burning methods anderson 1960 the content is calculated as the difference between dtp and srp after extracted by chemical extracts however srp usually includes inorganic p and acid hydrolysable organics duhamel et al 2021 which would underestimate the content of op if extraction method is used in comparison during the digestion procedure the pyrophosphate metaphosphate and polyphosphate in dtp would transform into orthophosphate leading to the over estimation of the op for example turner et al 2006 found that molybdate colorimetry significantly overestimated the content of op by between 30 and 54 relative to nmr spectroscopy results due to the influence of association of inorganic phosphate with organic matter furthermore some op species might be chemically hydrolyzed with strong acidic or alkaline solutions during extraction process degroot and golterman 1993 worsfold et al 2008 turner et al 2003 or be volatilized during thermal hydrolysis and burning processes huang et al 2017 especially for compounds with high op content lu 2000 therefore developing direct and high sensitivity methods are essential to better quantify the contents of op in sediments 5 2 op chemical fractionation fractionation is a useful approach for separating complex organic compounds into homogeneous fractions he and hur 2015 such that one can analyze the geochemical reactivity of each fraction and their roles in environment traditional sequential extraction scheme presumes that chemical extractants can dissolve specific species of op and it remains a major approach to estimate the fractions of op compounds in sediments table 1 summarized the development of extraction schemes for op in soils and sediments sommers et al 1972 first raised the method for identifying hcl op cold naoh op and hot naoh op in op later a systematical fractionation procedure was proposed by bowman and cole 1978 to further identify labile moderately labile moderately resistant and highly resistant op fractions respectively built upon these basis various other fractionation methods have been put forward hedley et al 1982 tissen and moir 1993 ivanoff et al 1998 golterman 1996 golterman et al 1998 zhu et al 2013 the common extractants in op fractionation include h2o nahco3 hcl and naoh in general h2o and nahco3 can be used to extract microbially labile organic molecules cross and schlesinger 1995 guigue et al 2016 zhang et al 2008 textor et al 2019 while alkali solution can extract humics and fulvic acids combined p ivanoff et al 1998 chen and hur 2015 during acidification fulvic acids remain soluble but humics will precipitate when the ph is below 2 ivanoff et al 1998 mcdonald et al 2004 sequential op fractionation presumes that h2oop and nahco3 op fractions can represent labile op while hcl op and naohop fulvic acid op are usually correspondent to moderately labile op ivanoff et al 1998 however zhu et al 2013 and ni et al 2019b demonstrated that in lake sediments the bioavailability enzymatic hydrolysis rate of h2oop and nahco3 op were less than that of hcl op and naohop which suggested that the assessment of op activity with sequential fractionation may be inaccurate furthermore some studies have shown that strong naoh is not an accurate extractant as its concentration and duration influence the quantity of op via chemical hydrolysis golterman et al 1998 while the tedious and complex extraction process will also introduce large errors in results last but not least the mutual interference and poor specificity among different extractants make it difficult to assign the environmental significance to p fractions turner and leytem 2004 liu et al 2013 therefore the results derived from traditional sequential fractionation schemes should be interpreted with cautions and it is urgent to implement novel fractionation methods based on modern characterization techniques 5 3 op composition and structure the characterization of op composition and structure is critical in studying sediment op thanks to the recent development of modern spectroscopy mass spectrometry and chromatography there have been encouraging results in characterizing the op s composition and structure at molecular levels fig 5 theses analytical techniques include inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms shah and caruso 2005 31p nuclear magnetic resonance 31p nmr spectroscopy carman et al 2000 fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy yang et al 2015 soft x ray fluorescence spectromicroscopy brandes et al 2007 x ray absorption near edge structure xanes spectroscopy hurtarte et al 2019 and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms brooker et al 2018 solution 31p nmr spectroscopy is the most frequently used one because its non destructive feature cade menun 2005 which allows to identify monoester p e g α β glycerophosphate nucleotide d glucose 6 phosphate phytate and choline phosphate diester p e g dna p rna p and phospholipids and phosphonate etc however the ethylenediaminetetraacetate edta naoh extraction and the enrichment process in the 31p nmr pretreatment would cause chemical degradation of op compounds leading to the underestimation of op content in sediments ni et al 2022b ft ir spectroscopy is another non destructive method which provides real time information regarding the vibration of p chemical bond and the functional groups of doms yang et al 2015 for instance the principal peaks of the ft ir spectra at 1033 1030 876 873 and 797 779 usually associate with phospholipids dna and rna p p o bond aromatic p o c bond and aliphatic p o c bond respectively ni et al 2019a however if samples contain complex compounds with a similar structure their spectroscopy peaks will be overlapped and the compounds will be indistinguishable he et al 2006 x ray fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy are used for element abundance analysis and speciation characterization with up to parts per trillion level sensitivities twining et al 2003 2004 which holds the promise for analyzing sediment op brandes et al 2007 examined a range of p containing organic phases in marine sediments using x ray fluorescence spectroscopy the identified op species includes phytic acid phosphatidylethanolamine adenosine 5 triphosphate o phosphorylethanolamine phenyl phosphate 2 aminoethylphosphonic acid phenylphosphonic acid propylenediphosphonic acid tri 1 naphthylphosphine xanes spectroscopy allows direct identification of organic and mineral p species with no pre extraction and minimal sample pretreatment hesterberg 2010 kizewski et al 2011 the op compounds featuring energy location of p l2 3 edge xanes spectra mainly include o phosphorylethanolamine 2 aminoethylphosphonic acid n phosphonomethyl glycine β glycerol phosphate disodium salt pentahydrate l α phosphatidyl choline l α phosphatidylethanolamine asolectin adenosine 5 monophosphate disodium salt cytidine 5 triphosphoric acid disodium salt inosine 5 monophosphate disodium salt ribonucleic acid phytic acid sodium salt hydrate and phytic acid calcium salt kruse et al 2009 a limitation of xanes spectroscopy is that many op compounds spectra are indistinguishable eriksson et al 2015 ft icr ms is a new and robust method for characterizing the composition and structure of dom which allows the detection of various dom components up to thousand species based on their molecular formulas ohno et al 2014 the identified parameters include double bond equivalent dbe molecular formula molecular mass o c and h c ratio as well as the relative abundance of op compounds e g condensed aromatic structures tannin unsaturated hydrocarbons lignin lipid proteins and carbohydrates however due to the low element abundance of p in dom and the interference of inorganic salts there are only a few studies to date that attempt to apply ft icr ms method to investigate the molecular composition and structural characteristics of dop in environment brooker et al 2018 ni et al 2021 gao et al 2021 kurek et al 2020 the limitation of each method indicates that one technique alone cannot adequately characterize op instead combined analytical techniques might offer a promising way liu et al 2013 adopted sequential fractionation solution 31p nmr and p k edge xanes spectroscopy together to investigate soil op species and provided comprehensive information about p species kurek et al 2020 analyzed sediment op constitutes using different chemical extractants in combination with ft icr ms and suggested that milder extractants resulted in better op formulae assignments than stronger extractants venkatesan et al 2018 employed size exclusion chromatography coupled with icp ms to characterize the mw distribution of op in water he found that the size exclusion chromatography in combination with icp ms and doc offers a powerful and easy way for identifying many unknown p fractions liu et al 2015 is the first one to determine the variations of legacy p species in soils using sequential fractionation 31p nmr and xanes spectroscopic techniques mclaren et al 2015 and ni et al 2022b used solution 31p nmr spectroscopy and mw ultrafiltration to reveal the dynamics of the mw distribution of op components which provided more detailed information about op composition and bioreactivity in soil sediments wang et al 2019b proposed a method that combined liquid chromatography in tandem with mass spectrometry to quantitatively determine six most important phosphonates species in effluent of wastewater treatment plant thus future studies should focus on establishing multiple combined analytical systems to characterize sediment op from various perspectives 5 4 op bioavailability the bioavailability of op is an important indicator for assessing the potential contribution of op to lake eutrophication bioavailability refers to the relative ease of a specific op to be biologically degraded and assimilated into microbial biomass duhamel et al 2021 it is closely related to the microbial capacity of uptake assimilation and sorption as well as theapa activities berg and joern 2006 popular methods for op bioavailability include bio culture i e bacteria algae and hydrophyte and enzymatic hydrolysis in practice some researchers found that the environmental conditions of bacteria and algae culture are difficult to control and the results contain a large uncertainty due to biological differences and the high heterogeneity of time and space duhamel et al 2021 in addition most of the culture experiment chose a specific biological species as a tester which cannot reflect actual environmental conditions enzymatic hydrolysis has been widely used to estimate the potential bioavailability of op since most op must be hydrolyzed into srp before it is utilized by organisms bünemann 2008 although this method is easy to apply it suffers from poor precision and reproducibility due to the complexity in environmental conditions as well as in species and the quantity of enzymes moreover the enzymatic hydrolysis method may not reflect actual biodegradation in natural environment because 1 apa can be strongly adsorbed by minerals e g montmorillonite and goethite in sediments under natural conditions zhu et al 2016 and thus decrease the activity of apa 2 apa activities may be inhibited by humic acids fluoride metal ions and polyvalent anions in natural environment wang and pant 2010 freitas et al 2014 and 3 the commonly used enzymes are derived from terrestrial organisms e g bovine intestinal mucosa alkaline phosphatase crotalus atrox phosphodiesterase and wheat phytase which cannot reflect actual enzymatic activities in real aquatic environment instead using more diversified aquatic enzymes will be more representative and thus can better assess aquatic op bioavailability duhamel et al 2021 molecular properties are the primary control on the microbial utilization of dissolved organic molecules in aquatic systems shen and benner 2020 2022 an understanding of the relationship between op molecular characteristics and its availability will be beneficial for evaluating the response of natural communities to different op compounds fig 6 molecular characteristics usually involve composition structure hydrophobicity hydrophilicity mw humification degree the number of functional groups and stoichiometric ratio etc for example labile op species e g diester p phospholipids and teichoic acids are mineralized within a short period of approximately 3 days while other op e g monoester p and phosphonates with in 4 and 13 weeks darch et al 2014 qin et al 2015 found that the hydrophobic dop fraction with a low c p ratio was more bioavailable to algal growth in effluent dop gao et al 2021 reported that dop species with low oxygen content low aromaticity and low unsaturation were preferentially degraded by biological treatments in wastewater treatment plant ohno et al 2014 found that the dom components with h c 1 2 and o c 0 5 are strongly correlated with biodegradability in forest soil yang et al 2022 reported that within the less available dop compounds in runoff and surface waters lignin like compounds are dominant ni et al 2022a found that the bioavailable dop were closely related to mw with the contents of dop from enzymatic hydrolysis decreased with decreasing molecular weight which is consistent with the findings by amon and benner 1996 and benner and amon 2015 who reported that hmw dom are more bio reactive crecchio and stotzky 1998 and zhu et al 2015 reported that humics combined op is usually resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis indicating that the higher degree of humification dom in sediments the less enzymatic hydrolysis of dop it will be letscher and moore 2015 found that dop is remineralized about twice as rapidly with respect to enriched c n stoichiometry of marine dom therefore to further understand the bioavailability of op it is necessary to establish the response of molecular properties and the chemical reactivity to biodegradation of op and the construction of a more comprehensive and accurate composite index that account key molecular characteristics and biodegradation parameters to estimate the bioavailability of op would be a promising topic to explore 5 5 quantitative assessment of op release in sediments reducing the release of p from sediments to water is one of the major approaches in ecological restoration of lakes due to its low cost and simplicity horppila 2019 while how to assess the performance is a key at present different methods have been developed focusing on assessing the release and exchange of p in sediment water interface swi those methods include mass balance models kelderman et al 2005 sediment incubation du et al 2018 wang et al 2018a benthic chamber experiment buchholtz ten brink et al 1989 molecular diffusion models lavery et al 2001 reaction and transformation models doan et al 2018 and adsorption desorption kinetics models wang et al 2018b etc although op is abundant in sediments current methods for p release and diffusion in swi only focus on srp where op is usually ignored mandal et al 2015 shinohara et al 2017 the difficulty in modeling sediment op release can be attributed to its complex composition bioavailability and transformation processes shinohara et al 2017 constructed a model of op release from sediments according to the mathematical relationships among the degradation and mineralization of op as well as the adsorption desorption and diffusion of ip in swi they pointed out that the model needs to further consider the concentration and flux of preferentially degradable op components e g diester p and some mono p species key environmental factors affecting enzyme activity and p release and the effect of molecular size on the release rate of p given the importance of op to sediment p loading op need to be integrated within current models of p release and exchange in swi possible elements include 1 the mineralization and degradation coefficient of op with different components mw and hydrophobicity 2 the diffusion coefficient of dop in pore water with different mw and 3 the estimation of bioavailability of op that from direct gradient diffusion as well as 4 the key environmental conditions e g ph value do level temperature sunlight irradiation apa activity microorganisms a holistic consideration of these elements will deepen our understanding of the methods and approaches for op release and is conducive to further improve the accuracy in assessing op release in sediments 6 conclusion and outlook this review provides an overview of current studies with respect to op in lake sediments with a focus on the contribution of op to internal p loading its potential role in algal blooms the migration and transformation as well as its characterization methods op has a predominant role in the migration and transformation of p in lake ecosystems while the enhanced accumulation of sediment op and its increased contribution to the internal p loading appears to be a major concern under global accelerated lake eutrophication and anthropogenic p inputs the positive feedbacks among the degradation and release of op to algal blooms might act as important reasons to explain the persistence of algal bloom events investigating the migration and transformation paths of op in swi using combined methodologies and multiple perspectives is a key to studying the biogeochemical cycle of op in addition this work systematically summarized current characterization methods for op content chemical fraction composition bioavailability and quantitative assessment of op release in sediments with the pros and cons of each method being discussed to sum up following efforts are needed to deepen the understanding of op in lake sediments fig 7 1 in depth literature review from a global perspective regarding the contribution of sediment op to internal p loading with further summary about its pattern of content distribution accumulation historical changes in addition future studies should provide predictions about the accumulation and potential risk of op release from sediments under the background of the global and regional trends of lake eutrophication anthropogenic activities and climate 2 better mathematical models for describing the linkage between the biological pump of algal blooms and the replenishment of op in sediments one should explore the drivers of the positive feedback loop among algal blooms the migration transformation and partition of op in swi the coupling effect of multiple factors on the replenishment of sediment op during algal bloom period should also be better illustrated 3 fully accounting the composition and molecular size of op is conducive for better understanding its transformation process and mechanism 4 developing direct and high sensitivity techniques to improve the precision for identifying op content in sediments the assessment of op chemical activity by traditional sequential fractionation may be inaccurate and it is urgent to implement novel methods for characterizing sediments op fractions based on modern characterization techniques a single technique cannot provide comprehensive assessment of op composition and structure due to the limit of each method while combined techniques can offer new insights 5 deepening the understanding for the bioavailability of op requires establishing the response of op molecular properties and chemical reactivity to op biodegradability while a comprehensive and accurate composite index would be a promising approach 6 current models need to integrate fundamentals of op to better describe the release and exchange of p in swi those elements include the mineralization and degradation coefficient of different op the diffusion coefficient of dop the bioavailability of op

15798,organic phosphorus op is one of the main forms of phosphorus in lake ecosystems mounting evidence has shown that sediment op has become a major but underestimated issue in addressing lake eutrophication and algal bloom however a holistic view of sediment op remains missing this review aims to provide an overview of progress on the studies of op in lake sediments focusing on the contribution of op to internal p loading its potential role in algal bloom and the migration and transformation in addition this work systematically summarized current methods for characterizing op content chemical fraction composition bioavailability and assessment of op release in sediment with the pros and cons of each method being discussed in the end this work pointed out following efforts

challenge for human health and ecological protection brookes and carey 2011 mccrackin et al 2017 phosphorus p has been regarded as a limiting factor for eutrophication and is responsible for the large scale burst of cyanobacteria growth carpenter 2008 conley et al 2009 sediment is the major p pool in lake systems which can significantly affect water quality by p releasing nürnberg et al 2013 markovic et al 2019 efficient p reduction from sediments has become a major research topic in lake management as strict external p discharge limits have been implemented the release and diffusion flux of p calculated by thermodynamics and kinetics model of soluble reactive p srp are the basis for assessing the risk of sediment p release tohru et al 1989 fan et al 2002 by comparison organic p op has a similar magnitude as inorganic p ip in many aquatic ecosystems björkman and karl 2003 ding et al 2010 feng et al 2018 but it is usually ignored due to the complexity regarding its composition bioavailability environmental processes and effects bai et al 2009 shinohara et al 2017 in recent years there is an increasing emphasis on the importance of op to lake eutrophication water quality and algal blooms with numerous studies on op composition bioavailability fate behavior and environmental impacts dyhrman et al 2006 bünemann 2008 duhamel et al 2021 ni et al 2021 since 1980s 181 articles on sediment op have been published on the web of science the number is about a quarter of published works on soil op and about 8 3 of works on p with approximately ten new articles per year since 2010 fig 1 op contains a variety of different compounds ranging from nucleotide phospholipids phosphates phosphor sugar phosphoprotein inositol phosphate to organic complex phosphate worsfold et al 2008 venkatesan et al 2018 the other components with no distinct chemical formulae or cannot be dissolved by chemicals are usually referred to as refractory op op represents an important bridge between the biogeochemical cycles of p and biological processes duhamel et al 2021 for example phytoplankton can directly use low molecular weight lmw op for reproduction zou et al 2005 while plants e g clover barley oats and wheat are able to utilize op efficiently as they do with inorganic sources tarafdar and claassen 1988 for nutritional utilization dissolved organic phosphorus dop is much more labile than dissolved organic carbon doc and nitrogen don in the marine environments lønborg and álvarez salgado 2012 with the mineralization rate of dop being nearly twice as rapidly as doc and don in the ocean letscher and moore 2015 in lake sediments op is usually closely related to lake trophic level and is considered a better indicator than total p for trophic level and sediment pollution level vaalgamaa 2004 liao et al 2010 ni et al 2019a in particular the bioavailable op is found to regulate eutrophic status and facilitate algal bloom of lakes zhu et al 2013 ni et al 2019b darch et al 2013 those studies imply that op might have an ecological and environmental impact on aquatic systems therefore lake management and protection plans must consider the role contribution and potential risks of op in water quality and eco environment in recent years the development of analytical techniques for op structure composition and bioavailability has received a great attention to better understand the degradability and the release of op in sediments nonetheless no systematic studies have been performed to investigate the characteristics of op and a substantial portion of op components remains unresolved mclaren et al 2015 2020 furthermore the biogeochemical cycle and key pathways of op such as adsorption desorption ligand exchange mineralization humification photolysis enzymatic hydrolysis and molecular diffusion have not received comprehensive measures as a result in depth discussions about the importance and the potential role of sediment op in lake eutrophication and algal bloom are lacking with inconclusive or even controversial findings about the content chemical fraction composition bioavailability migration and transformation of op several review literature have summarized studies which look into the determination of aquatic op worsfold et al 2008 darch et al 2013 chemical nature of soil op mclaren et al 2020 soil op mineralization rates bünemann 2015 martínez 1968 as well as the distribution circulation of op and its ecological significance to the aquatic environments baldwin 2013 however studies on the potential role of sediment op in lake eutrophication algal blooms the migration and transformation pathways remain inadequate with few works focusing on improving the characterization methods of op using multiple methods despite that they might provide critical insights for fathoming the biogeochemical behavior of sediment op this review aims to fill those gaps by 1 elaborating the contribution of op to sediment internal p loading and its potential role in algal blooms 2 updating the latest progress on the studies about migration and transformation pathways and mechanisms of sediment op and 3 summarizing and critically discussing the state of art characterization methods for sediment op built on those basis we further put forward the challenges issues and opportunities that might shed light on further research this work is expected to broaden our understanding on the characteristics and environmental impact of op in lake sediments and deliver new perspectives about the characterization methods of op 2 contribution of op to sediment internal p loading as a major component in lake p biogeochemistry op exists widely in water body macrophytes phytoplankton particulate matter atmospheric deposits and sediments fig 2 in rivers it was found that dop contributed up to 38 68 42 on average 4 2 100 60 on average and 39 69 52 on average of the total dissolved p dtp in erhai lake ji et al 2017 dianchi lake he et al 2014 and the great lakes yang et al 2021 respectively in water bodies the concentration of dop accounts for more than 55 of dtp in taihu lake dianchi lake and baltic sea nausch and nausch 2006 gao et al 2006 he et al 2014 and it was also reported that the dop pool was often 5 8 times larger than the measured srp pool in water bodies 0 100 m below the surface in the north pacific subtropical gyre björkman and karl 2003 the particulate op pop in fox river and the great bay of the great lakes accounts for 47 87 67 on average of total particulate p yang et al 2021 the dop in atmospheric deposits on average accounts on average for 55 and 59 of dtp in erhai lake and dianchi lake of china respectively ji et al 2017 he et al 2014 for aquatic plants op could account on average for 56 and 47 of total p in algae and aquatic macrophytes respectively feng et al 2016 two surveys have showed that for chinese lakes the content of op to total p can vary from 12 to 60 ding et al 2010 ni et al 2016 in addition the water extractable op was found to be the dominant part in dtp 74 5 on average of the sediments from ten chinese lakes ni et al 2022a these results indicate the high proportion of op in aquatic systems thus the contribution of sediment op to internal p loading cannot be ignored it is worth to notice that during past decades the drastic recessions of aquatic vegetations zhang et al 2017 and increased phytoplankton bloom events ho et al 2019 has led to the vast amount of aquatic vegetations and phytoplankton debris which accelerate the accumulation of op in lake sediments worldwide wastewater from residential areas and agricultural activities e g domestic sewage treatment application of chemical fertilizers and manure livestock farming is another factor that contribute to op loading on lakes lü et al 2016 ni et al 2020 the accelerated p loss from agricultural activities and residential wastewater in the past decades liu et al 2016 yuan et al 2018 especial in developing countries would enhance op accumulation in lake sediments and thus cause water quality issue and aquatic biodiversity losses studies have shown that the enhanced lake eutrophication level will significantly increase the content of enzymatic hydrolysable op in sediments ni et al 2016 while hypereutrophic lakes with high algal biomass will accelerate op hydrolysis and mineralization yuan et al 2020 which indicates that with the continuously intensified lake eutrophication the accumulated op in sediments might become a ticking time bomb that will jarpordize lake water quality in future wang et al 2008 reported that polluted sediments correspondent to high release of dop from sediments furthermore the contribution from op mineralization in sediments to eutrophication is found to be greater than that of ip in macrophyte dominated eutrophic lakes and the mineralization process plays a critical role in the release of internal p yu et al 2022 these results reflect that with global accelerated lake eutrophication and enhanced anthropogenic p inputs it is urgent to investigate the accumulation and the contribution of sediment op to internal loading to prevent the deterioration of lake ecosystems 3 potential role of sediment op in algal blooms and eutrophication algae act as a primary link between p circulation and lake ecosystems zou et al 2020 it is known that algal blooms could enhance the release of fe bound p from sediments which in turn provide srp to support algal blooms xie et al 2003 chen et al 2018 wang et al 2019a yao et al 2022 forming a positive feedback loop between sediment p flux and algal blooms so called biological pump for op some research reported that algae e g prorocentrum donghaiense lu and bacterial e g m aeruginosa can use dop compounds efficiently via alkaline phosphatase apa to sustain its growth under srp depletion huang et al 2005 harke et al 2012 that is dop utilization is also vital in shaping phytoplankton community in p deficient waters ma et al 2019 apa plays an important role in regulating algal blooms and p dynamics in aquatic environments wang et al 2021 the activity of apa in sediments is usually influenced by the outbreak and perishing of algae with apa being more active during algal blooms xu et al 2013 bao et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 the enhanced transformation of srp from dop by elevated cell associated apa activity and quantity in eutrophic water and sediment would replenish bioavailable p to further promote algal blooms yuan et al 2019 wang et al 2021 and the capacity of op hydrolysis is close to that of srp uptake under p starvation moorleghem et al 2013 furthermore the remineralization of dop can increase the niche for diazotrophs and facilitate nitrogen fixation letscher and moore 2015 thus providing more nitrogen source for algae lake eutrophication processes and algal bloom can also significantly alter aquatic conditions such as ph and dissolved oxygen do zuo 2015 reported that the release of op from sediments significantly increased under ph from 7 to 9 5 and do level appeared to be the most influential in terms of op release from sediments with sediments under anoxic conditions generally releasing more op than that of aerobic environment zuo 2015 zhang et al 2017 this suggests that high ph and low do level during algal blooms would promote the release of op from sediments the settled algae residues could enhance the accumulation of fe p and bioavailable op in sediments which in turn replenish available p pools to further facilitate algal growth ni et al 2019b wang et al 2019a like sediment ip this positive feedback between the accumulation and release of sediment op and algal growth would sustain algal blooms persistently even under controlled external p loading or low level of srp in water however the quantitative relationship between algal blooms and the replenishment of op in sediments remains unclear therefore better mathematical models or methods for describing the linkage between the biological pump of algal bloom processes i e cyanobacteria formation aggregation and decay processes and the replenishment i e dynamic process of degradation transformation and diffusion of op in sediments would be an impending issue fig 3 4 migration and transformation of op in sediments the migration and transformation of op in sediments mainly include adsorption desorption deposition diffusion biological assimilation mineralization humification and the transformation of chemical composition and molecular size fig 4 like adsorption desorption mechanism of orthophosphate op can absorb with minerals e g iron aluminum oxide through ligand exchange olsson et al 2010 yan et al 2014a 2014b some species of op e g denosine monophosphate adenosine triphosphate glucose 6 phosphate and aminoethylphosphonic acid showed lower efficiency in sorption with iron oxide than that of orthophosphate ruttenberg and sulak 2011 indicating that the mobility of these dop compounds may exceed that of orthophosphate in sediments under certain conditions in contrast the adsorption quantity of iron aluminum oxide and clay mineral with inositol hexaphosphate are much larger than that of orthophosphate due to the abundant phosphate groups of inositol hexaphosphate yan et al 2012 which might explain its high stability in sediments the migration of op from sediments to overlying water involves four pathways 1 chemical process namely the degradation of op releases through chemical hydrolysis li et al 2011 and photolysis li et al 2019 2 biological process namely biomineralization wang and pant 2010 3 the kinetic process namely the resuspension of pop and dop under the action of wind hydrodynamic force benthic activities li et al 2019 and 4 the diffusion of dop between water sediment interface guan et al 2013 the dynamic change of chemical composition is the most important indicator for op transformation previous studies suggested that the compositional transformation of op in sediments is usually accompanied by the degradation release and burial of p compounds for example yu et al 2022 found that the mineralization of sediment op can result into p combination fe al fe mn phospholipid is usually degraded into α glycerophosphate and β glycerophosphate doolette et al 2009 while rna p can turn into nucleotide bünemann et al 2008 by microorganisms under alkaline conditions also some op species such as phytate myo inositol l 2 3 4 5 6 hexakisphosphate could be transformed into orthophosphate by phytase hydrolysis zhu et al 2013 or by precipitation as metal complexes form into insoluble and stable metal phytate thus buried in sediments permanently jørgensen et al 2011 therefore elucidating the transformation of op chemical composition would provide critical information for understanding the biogeochemical cycle of op and for assessing its potential risk from sediments another under explored area is about the molecular size transformation of op recent research revealed that the compositional transformation of organic molecules is usually accompanied by changes of molecular size while the intrinsic transformation and degradation of organic molecules is usually regulated by both molecular size and organic compositions xu and guo 2018 for instance the concentrations of total organic carbon carbohydrates and protein like substances decrease during dissolved organic matter dom incubation while the mw of dom would transform from lmw dom 1 kda to high mw dom hmw dom colloids 1 kda 0 45 μm and further transform into microparticles 0 45 μm xu and guo 2018 liberated or freshly photosynthesized dom and dop generated by assimilation and uptake of srp via phytoplankton would be mainly composed by hmw substances or colloids qu et al 2012 benner and amon 2015 yang et al 2021 while the hmw organic molecules are usually have higher biological reactivity and degradation rates than its lmw counterparts benner and amon 2015 ni et al 2022a this might be explained by the fact that hmw dom colloids can either be aggregated into particles by colloidal pumping and self assembly honeyman and santschi 1989 xu and guo 2018 or be decomposed into smaller molecules through photolysis enzymatic hydrolysis or chemical reactions santschi et al 2006 santschi 2018 the transformation of molecular size exerts a profound impact on adsorption desorption as well as the bioavailability of op which impose the potential risk of p release from sediments for instance the maximum sorption of dop with iron oxyhydr oxides decreases with the increasing mw of p compounds ruttenberg and sulak 2011 yan et al 2014a shinohara et al 2017 argued that the large molecular size of molybdenum unreactive p in pore water hampers its diffusion from sediments into overlying water therefore the composition and the dynamic changes of molecular size of op shall be taken into account to better explore the transformation mechanism and the potential environmental impact of op in sediments 5 advances in characterization methods of sediment op characterizing sediment op is a key to understand its properties and to determine its environmental behavior fate as well as potential environmental risk this section reviewed the state of the art characterization methods and technologies for content chemical fraction composition structure bioavailability and release in sediment op 5 1 op contents typically the content of op in sediments is determined by chemical extraction and burning methods anderson 1960 the content is calculated as the difference between dtp and srp after extracted by chemical extracts however srp usually includes inorganic p and acid hydrolysable organics duhamel et al 2021 which would underestimate the content of op if extraction method is used in comparison during the digestion procedure the pyrophosphate metaphosphate and polyphosphate in dtp would transform into orthophosphate leading to the over estimation of the op for example turner et al 2006 found that molybdate colorimetry significantly overestimated the content of op by between 30 and 54 relative to nmr spectroscopy results due to the influence of association of inorganic phosphate with organic matter furthermore some op species might be chemically hydrolyzed with strong acidic or alkaline solutions during extraction process degroot and golterman 1993 worsfold et al 2008 turner et al 2003 or be volatilized during thermal hydrolysis and burning processes huang et al 2017 especially for compounds with high op content lu 2000 therefore developing direct and high sensitivity methods are essential to better quantify the contents of op in sediments 5 2 op chemical fractionation fractionation is a useful approach for separating complex organic compounds into homogeneous fractions he and hur 2015 such that one can analyze the geochemical reactivity of each fraction and their roles in environment traditional sequential extraction scheme presumes that chemical extractants can dissolve specific species of op and it remains a major approach to estimate the fractions of op compounds in sediments table 1 summarized the development of extraction schemes for op in soils and sediments sommers et al 1972 first raised the method for identifying hcl op cold naoh op and hot naoh op in op later a systematical fractionation procedure was proposed by bowman and cole 1978 to further identify labile moderately labile moderately resistant and highly resistant op fractions respectively built upon these basis various other fractionation methods have been put forward hedley et al 1982 tissen and moir 1993 ivanoff et al 1998 golterman 1996 golterman et al 1998 zhu et al 2013 the common extractants in op fractionation include h2o nahco3 hcl and naoh in general h2o and nahco3 can be used to extract microbially labile organic molecules cross and schlesinger 1995 guigue et al 2016 zhang et al 2008 textor et al 2019 while alkali solution can extract humics and fulvic acids combined p ivanoff et al 1998 chen and hur 2015 during acidification fulvic acids remain soluble but humics will precipitate when the ph is below 2 ivanoff et al 1998 mcdonald et al 2004 sequential op fractionation presumes that h2oop and nahco3 op fractions can represent labile op while hcl op and naohop fulvic acid op are usually correspondent to moderately labile op ivanoff et al 1998 however zhu et al 2013 and ni et al 2019b demonstrated that in lake sediments the bioavailability enzymatic hydrolysis rate of h2oop and nahco3 op were less than that of hcl op and naohop which suggested that the assessment of op activity with sequential fractionation may be inaccurate furthermore some studies have shown that strong naoh is not an accurate extractant as its concentration and duration influence the quantity of op via chemical hydrolysis golterman et al 1998 while the tedious and complex extraction process will also introduce large errors in results last but not least the mutual interference and poor specificity among different extractants make it difficult to assign the environmental significance to p fractions turner and leytem 2004 liu et al 2013 therefore the results derived from traditional sequential fractionation schemes should be interpreted with cautions and it is urgent to implement novel fractionation methods based on modern characterization techniques 5 3 op composition and structure the characterization of op composition and structure is critical in studying sediment op thanks to the recent development of modern spectroscopy mass spectrometry and chromatography there have been encouraging results in characterizing the op s composition and structure at molecular levels fig 5 theses analytical techniques include inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms shah and caruso 2005 31p nuclear magnetic resonance 31p nmr spectroscopy carman et al 2000 fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy yang et al 2015 soft x ray fluorescence spectromicroscopy brandes et al 2007 x ray absorption near edge structure xanes spectroscopy hurtarte et al 2019 and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms brooker et al 2018 solution 31p nmr spectroscopy is the most frequently used one because its non destructive feature cade menun 2005 which allows to identify monoester p e g α β glycerophosphate nucleotide d glucose 6 phosphate phytate and choline phosphate diester p e g dna p rna p and phospholipids and phosphonate etc however the ethylenediaminetetraacetate edta naoh extraction and the enrichment process in the 31p nmr pretreatment would cause chemical degradation of op compounds leading to the underestimation of op content in sediments ni et al 2022b ft ir spectroscopy is another non destructive method which provides real time information regarding the vibration of p chemical bond and the functional groups of doms yang et al 2015 for instance the principal peaks of the ft ir spectra at 1033 1030 876 873 and 797 779 usually associate with phospholipids dna and rna p p o bond aromatic p o c bond and aliphatic p o c bond respectively ni et al 2019a however if samples contain complex compounds with a similar structure their spectroscopy peaks will be overlapped and the compounds will be indistinguishable he et al 2006 x ray fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy are used for element abundance analysis and speciation characterization with up to parts per trillion level sensitivities twining et al 2003 2004 which holds the promise for analyzing sediment op brandes et al 2007 examined a range of p containing organic phases in marine sediments using x ray fluorescence spectroscopy the identified op species includes phytic acid phosphatidylethanolamine adenosine 5 triphosphate o phosphorylethanolamine phenyl phosphate 2 aminoethylphosphonic acid phenylphosphonic acid propylenediphosphonic acid tri 1 naphthylphosphine xanes spectroscopy allows direct identification of organic and mineral p species with no pre extraction and minimal sample pretreatment hesterberg 2010 kizewski et al 2011 the op compounds featuring energy location of p l2 3 edge xanes spectra mainly include o phosphorylethanolamine 2 aminoethylphosphonic acid n phosphonomethyl glycine β glycerol phosphate disodium salt pentahydrate l α phosphatidyl choline l α phosphatidylethanolamine asolectin adenosine 5 monophosphate disodium salt cytidine 5 triphosphoric acid disodium salt inosine 5 monophosphate disodium salt ribonucleic acid phytic acid sodium salt hydrate and phytic acid calcium salt kruse et al 2009 a limitation of xanes spectroscopy is that many op compounds spectra are indistinguishable eriksson et al 2015 ft icr ms is a new and robust method for characterizing the composition and structure of dom which allows the detection of various dom components up to thousand species based on their molecular formulas ohno et al 2014 the identified parameters include double bond equivalent dbe molecular formula molecular mass o c and h c ratio as well as the relative abundance of op compounds e g condensed aromatic structures tannin unsaturated hydrocarbons lignin lipid proteins and carbohydrates however due to the low element abundance of p in dom and the interference of inorganic salts there are only a few studies to date that attempt to apply ft icr ms method to investigate the molecular composition and structural characteristics of dop in environment brooker et al 2018 ni et al 2021 gao et al 2021 kurek et al 2020 the limitation of each method indicates that one technique alone cannot adequately characterize op instead combined analytical techniques might offer a promising way liu et al 2013 adopted sequential fractionation solution 31p nmr and p k edge xanes spectroscopy together to investigate soil op species and provided comprehensive information about p species kurek et al 2020 analyzed sediment op constitutes using different chemical extractants in combination with ft icr ms and suggested that milder extractants resulted in better op formulae assignments than stronger extractants venkatesan et al 2018 employed size exclusion chromatography coupled with icp ms to characterize the mw distribution of op in water he found that the size exclusion chromatography in combination with icp ms and doc offers a powerful and easy way for identifying many unknown p fractions liu et al 2015 is the first one to determine the variations of legacy p species in soils using sequential fractionation 31p nmr and xanes spectroscopic techniques mclaren et al 2015 and ni et al 2022b used solution 31p nmr spectroscopy and mw ultrafiltration to reveal the dynamics of the mw distribution of op components which provided more detailed information about op composition and bioreactivity in soil sediments wang et al 2019b proposed a method that combined liquid chromatography in tandem with mass spectrometry to quantitatively determine six most important phosphonates species in effluent of wastewater treatment plant thus future studies should focus on establishing multiple combined analytical systems to characterize sediment op from various perspectives 5 4 op bioavailability the bioavailability of op is an important indicator for assessing the potential contribution of op to lake eutrophication bioavailability refers to the relative ease of a specific op to be biologically degraded and assimilated into microbial biomass duhamel et al 2021 it is closely related to the microbial capacity of uptake assimilation and sorption as well as theapa activities berg and joern 2006 popular methods for op bioavailability include bio culture i e bacteria algae and hydrophyte and enzymatic hydrolysis in practice some researchers found that the environmental conditions of bacteria and algae culture are difficult to control and the results contain a large uncertainty due to biological differences and the high heterogeneity of time and space duhamel et al 2021 in addition most of the culture experiment chose a specific biological species as a tester which cannot reflect actual environmental conditions enzymatic hydrolysis has been widely used to estimate the potential bioavailability of op since most op must be hydrolyzed into srp before it is utilized by organisms bünemann 2008 although this method is easy to apply it suffers from poor precision and reproducibility due to the complexity in environmental conditions as well as in species and the quantity of enzymes moreover the enzymatic hydrolysis method may not reflect actual biodegradation in natural environment because 1 apa can be strongly adsorbed by minerals e g montmorillonite and goethite in sediments under natural conditions zhu et al 2016 and thus decrease the activity of apa 2 apa activities may be inhibited by humic acids fluoride metal ions and polyvalent anions in natural environment wang and pant 2010 freitas et al 2014 and 3 the commonly used enzymes are derived from terrestrial organisms e g bovine intestinal mucosa alkaline phosphatase crotalus atrox phosphodiesterase and wheat phytase which cannot reflect actual enzymatic activities in real aquatic environment instead using more diversified aquatic enzymes will be more representative and thus can better assess aquatic op bioavailability duhamel et al 2021 molecular properties are the primary control on the microbial utilization of dissolved organic molecules in aquatic systems shen and benner 2020 2022 an understanding of the relationship between op molecular characteristics and its availability will be beneficial for evaluating the response of natural communities to different op compounds fig 6 molecular characteristics usually involve composition structure hydrophobicity hydrophilicity mw humification degree the number of functional groups and stoichiometric ratio etc for example labile op species e g diester p phospholipids and teichoic acids are mineralized within a short period of approximately 3 days while other op e g monoester p and phosphonates with in 4 and 13 weeks darch et al 2014 qin et al 2015 found that the hydrophobic dop fraction with a low c p ratio was more bioavailable to algal growth in effluent dop gao et al 2021 reported that dop species with low oxygen content low aromaticity and low unsaturation were preferentially degraded by biological treatments in wastewater treatment plant ohno et al 2014 found that the dom components with h c 1 2 and o c 0 5 are strongly correlated with biodegradability in forest soil yang et al 2022 reported that within the less available dop compounds in runoff and surface waters lignin like compounds are dominant ni et al 2022a found that the bioavailable dop were closely related to mw with the contents of dop from enzymatic hydrolysis decreased with decreasing molecular weight which is consistent with the findings by amon and benner 1996 and benner and amon 2015 who reported that hmw dom are more bio reactive crecchio and stotzky 1998 and zhu et al 2015 reported that humics combined op is usually resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis indicating that the higher degree of humification dom in sediments the less enzymatic hydrolysis of dop it will be letscher and moore 2015 found that dop is remineralized about twice as rapidly with respect to enriched c n stoichiometry of marine dom therefore to further understand the bioavailability of op it is necessary to establish the response of molecular properties and the chemical reactivity to biodegradation of op and the construction of a more comprehensive and accurate composite index that account key molecular characteristics and biodegradation parameters to estimate the bioavailability of op would be a promising topic to explore 5 5 quantitative assessment of op release in sediments reducing the release of p from sediments to water is one of the major approaches in ecological restoration of lakes due to its low cost and simplicity horppila 2019 while how to assess the performance is a key at present different methods have been developed focusing on assessing the release and exchange of p in sediment water interface swi those methods include mass balance models kelderman et al 2005 sediment incubation du et al 2018 wang et al 2018a benthic chamber experiment buchholtz ten brink et al 1989 molecular diffusion models lavery et al 2001 reaction and transformation models doan et al 2018 and adsorption desorption kinetics models wang et al 2018b etc although op is abundant in sediments current methods for p release and diffusion in swi only focus on srp where op is usually ignored mandal et al 2015 shinohara et al 2017 the difficulty in modeling sediment op release can be attributed to its complex composition bioavailability and transformation processes shinohara et al 2017 constructed a model of op release from sediments according to the mathematical relationships among the degradation and mineralization of op as well as the adsorption desorption and diffusion of ip in swi they pointed out that the model needs to further consider the concentration and flux of preferentially degradable op components e g diester p and some mono p species key environmental factors affecting enzyme activity and p release and the effect of molecular size on the release rate of p given the importance of op to sediment p loading op need to be integrated within current models of p release and exchange in swi possible elements include 1 the mineralization and degradation coefficient of op with different components mw and hydrophobicity 2 the diffusion coefficient of dop in pore water with different mw and 3 the estimation of bioavailability of op that from direct gradient diffusion as well as 4 the key environmental conditions e g ph value do level temperature sunlight irradiation apa activity microorganisms a holistic consideration of these elements will deepen our understanding of the methods and approaches for op release and is conducive to further improve the accuracy in assessing op release in sediments 6 conclusion and outlook this review provides an overview of current studies with respect to op in lake sediments with a focus on the contribution of op to internal p loading its potential role in algal blooms the migration and transformation as well as its characterization methods op has a predominant role in the migration and transformation of p in lake ecosystems while the enhanced accumulation of sediment op and its increased contribution to the internal p loading appears to be a major concern under global accelerated lake eutrophication and anthropogenic p inputs the positive feedbacks among the degradation and release of op to algal blooms might act as important reasons to explain the persistence of algal bloom events investigating the migration and transformation paths of op in swi using combined methodologies and multiple perspectives is a key to studying the biogeochemical cycle of op in addition this work systematically summarized current characterization methods for op content chemical fraction composition bioavailability and quantitative assessment of op release in sediments with the pros and cons of each method being discussed to sum up following efforts are needed to deepen the understanding of op in lake sediments fig 7 1 in depth literature review from a global perspective regarding the contribution of sediment op to internal p loading with further summary about its pattern of content distribution accumulation historical changes in addition future studies should provide predictions about the accumulation and potential risk of op release from sediments under the background of the global and regional trends of lake eutrophication anthropogenic activities and climate 2 better mathematical models for describing the linkage between the biological pump of algal blooms and the replenishment of op in sediments one should explore the drivers of the positive feedback loop among algal blooms the migration transformation and partition of op in swi the coupling effect of multiple factors on the replenishment of sediment op during algal bloom period should also be better illustrated 3 fully accounting the composition and molecular size of op is conducive for better understanding its transformation process and mechanism 4 developing direct and high sensitivity techniques to improve the precision for identifying op content in sediments the assessment of op chemical activity by traditional sequential fractionation may be inaccurate and it is urgent to implement novel methods for characterizing sediments op fractions based on modern characterization techniques a single technique cannot provide comprehensive assessment of op composition and structure due to the limit of each method while combined techniques can offer new insights 5 deepening the understanding for the bioavailability of op requires establishing the response of op molecular properties and chemical reactivity to op biodegradability while a comprehensive and accurate composite index would be a promising approach 6 current models need to integrate fundamentals of op to better describe the release and exchange of p in swi those elements include the mineralization and degradation coefficient of different op the diffusion coefficient of dop the bioavailability of op

freshwater suspended particulate matter spm is an integral part of global geological geochemical and biological cycles in the aquatic environment due to ubiquitous presence mobility and its physicochemical properties eisma 1993 about 109 1013 tons of spm are discharged into the oceans every year beusen et al 2005 meybeck 1982 viers et al 2009 walling and webb 1987 supplying loads of inorganic martin and meybeck 1979 and organic meybeck 1982 matter to the marine ecosystem for most elements particulate loads by far exceed dissolved ones jeandel and oelkers 2015 meybeck 1976 making riverine spm the major nutrient supply to the oceans beusen et al 2005 eisma 1993 jeandel and oelkers 2015 substantial particulate carbon loads meybeck 1982 indicate the importance of spm in global carbon cycling about 44 of the annual terrestrial c flux into rivers is returned to the atmosphere 22 is buried in lake and reservoir sediments and about one third reaches the ocean aufdenkampe et al 2011 where salinity boosts aggregation and sedimentation eisma 1993 both freshwater and marine sediments constitute important carbon sinks and burial may subject spm to diagenesis or hydrocarbon formation processes closing the geological cycle eisma 1993 leithold et al 2016 freshwater co2 release is partly attributed to colonized spm flocs functioning as bioreactors fig 1 spm pools elemental

floc formation continues in sediments wotton 2007 zimmermann timm 2002 until increased shear through high discharge in rivers tidal impact in estuaries or temperature wind driven mixing in lakes re mobilizes spm eisma 1993 high concentrations of spm can physically impair aquatic ecosystems increased turbidity hampers bioproduction due to reduced light and increased mechanical stress and mineralization of deposited organic rich spm can induce oxygen shortage in poorly mixed waters bilotta and brazier 2008 inundations supply spm to riparian zones and floodplains adair et al 2004 brunet

nutrient discharge into the oceans leithold et al 2016 spm can as well act as vector for contaminants due to its physicochemical properties it accumulates various dissolved organic guo et al 2007 he

material that does not sediment under the given hydrodynamic and hydrochemical conditions and is retained by filtration over 0 45 or 0 22 µm pore size membranes eisma 1993 the filtrate is considered dissolved and is sometimes further separated into colloidal 0 45 µm and 1 kda and truly dissolved fractions 1 kda e g guo et al 2004 2007 spm is highly complex and dynamic fig 1 it typically exhibits floc or aggregate like structures that integrate inorganic and organic components of allochthonous aquagenic and autochthonous mainly pedogenic origins droppo 2001 henning et al 2001 zimmermann timm

pollution land use eisma 1993 viers et al 2009 zimmermann timm 2002 different conceptions of spm are reflected in the diversity of terms across disciplines the most common ones are suspended sediments droppo et al 1998 hillier 2001 mcconnachie and petticrew 2006 pont et al 2002 suspended particulate matter baalousha et al 2019 breitenbach et al 1999 le meur et al 2016 ran et al 2000 and total suspended solids berger et al 1996 bilotta et al 2012 droppo and ongley 1994 which share the idea of a material suspended under given conditions suspended sediments stresses sedimentation and resuspension as a major spm control but falls short of implying material inputs by runoff soil erosion and pelagic bioproduction suspended solids underlines the distinction from the dissolved phase but dissolved substances are building blocks incorporated by adsorption or diffusion into spm pores consequently suspended matter seems most comprehensive some less common terms are seston kernegger et al 2009 kondratieff and simmons 1985 mcconnachie and petticrew 2006 peduzzi and luef 2008 from greek strain or filter which reflects the operational definition of spm and composite suspended

river snow böckelmann 2000 neu 2000 was introduced by microbial ecologists analogously to marine snow and emphasizes microbial activity yielding organic rich fluffy structures just as the term floc aggregate in turn describes mineral dominated structures associated with soil origin so far spm in river systems has received much less attention as compared to estuarine and marine systems in the light of recent research addressing particulate pollutants a fundamental understanding of freshwater spm is a prerequisite to assess the fate of these emerging contaminants in river systems knowledge about freshwater spm is found in publications from various disciplines ranging from geosciences through microbiology and ecology to environmental sciences and modeling there is no comprehensive review available on the formation of spm in river systems which analyzed the plethora of information from these different disciplines many studies have considered spm as substrate for contaminant interactions controlling behavior fate and bioavailability of pollutants in most cases spm was treated as a black box constituting the particle bound fraction of pollutants here we abandon this contaminant centered view and focus on the characteristics and dynamics of spm flocs as pivotal micro reactors in freshwater chemistry and ecology the aim of this review is to analyze the complexity of freshwater spm composition and identify the key components and mechanisms governing physicochemical floc formation processes with a focus on river systems we elucidate the quantitative and qualitative mineralogical and organic composition of riverine spm and identify components that play crucial structural functional roles in spm formation the origins flocculation relevant properties and dynamic interactions of these spm components are discussed in detail and spatiotemporal dynamics affecting floc formation morphology and composition are explained fig 1 2 composition and structural features of riverine spm with about 1 30 wt organic matter content riverine spm mass not necessarily volume is overall dominated by minerals mainly phyllosilicates carbonates quartz and feldspars the organic matter content and its composition underlie seasonal and discharge related dynamics generally less bioavailable fulvic and humic like substances dominate but during periods of substantial bioproduction easily biodegradable substances can constitute up to 70 wt of the organic matter in spm 2 1 phyllosilicates dominate the mineral fraction phyllosilicates and quartz are omnipresent in riverine spm around the world table 1 followed by feldspars and carbonates reported in 24 and 21 out of 25 rivers respectively by mass table 1 a phyllosilicates contribute 22 72 wt and carbonates up to 61 wt the carbonates fraction is more variable and sometimes absent as carbonates might dissolve with distance from the lithological source their presence is often related to an increased microbial activity breitenbach et al 1999 eidam et al 1997 sigleo and helz 1981 and artefacts from sample preparation e g precipitation can distort the picture bibby and webster brown 2005 mcguire and herman 2015 quartz represents 8 35 wt and feldspars 4 41 wt with increasing discharge coarse grain size classes increase their shares in the spm size distribution often resulting in higher fractions of quartz up to 50 wt slomberg et al 2016 feldspar or carbonates buffle et al 1998 henning et al 2001 hillier 2001 kravchishina et al 2010 lučić et al 2021 pont et al 2002 slomberg et al 2016 subramanian 1979 wall and wilding 1976 this grain size dependence is reflected in particle number based spm composition data table 1 c where phyllosilicates amount to 66 89 n and quartz only up to 9 n clays e g illite kaolinite smectite montmorillonite are the prevalent phyllosilicates with illite constituting 48 wt of phyllosilicates and 24 wt of the total minerals si table 1 a furthermore chlorite mica muscovite biotite and mixed layer silicates are common si table 1 finally oxides and oxy hydroxide minerals predominantly those of iron feox are frequently reported but typically in low mass or number concentrations table 1 other oxide and oxy hydroxide minerals e g mn or alox exhibit similar properties but are less prominent feox appear to be mainly present as patchy coatings on aluminosilicates and sometimes on other minerals as evidenced by electron microscopy henning et al 2001 hirst et al 2017 le meur et al 2016 poulton and raiswell 2005 or by a co occurrence of fe with

includes other fe sources than feox e g fe in phyllosilicates regarding mineralogy amorphous phases and ferrihydrite dominate but also goethite and hematite are frequently identified baken et al 2013

except for the mentioned grain size relation higher quartz feldspar carbonate concentrations in larger size fractions 2 2 particulate organic matter pom fraction mostly below one third particulate organic matter pom denotes the organic mass fraction in spm distinguished from dissolved organic matter dom by filtration pom 0 2 or 0 45 µm sometimes colloidal organic matter 0 45 µm and 1 kda is separated as well this distinction is solely operational since natural organic matter nom constitutes a continuum from molecules via detrital matter up to microorganisms and the pom fraction integrates parts of all size fractions pom is typically determined as mass loss on ignition or applying conversion factors to particulate organic carbon poc the reported pom fractions in spm of 9 rivers range from a few percent to above 30 wt with a median of 15 wt table 2 employing the reported conversion factors 1 7 2 5 guo and macdonald 2006 hillier 2001 wall and wilding 1976 to poc data si fig 1 95 of the reviewed 54 rivers fall within the range of 1 2 40 wt pom with a median of 6 5 9 5 wt the pom content was found to be inversely correlated with spm size and reached its maximum in the smallest 1 0 2 µm spm subfraction ran et al 2000 this is confirmed by 55 of the total organic carbon load being colloidal 0 45 µm 1 kda and 6 20 particulate 0 45 µm leaving 15 28 in the truly dissolved fraction 1 kda guo et al 2003 guo and macdonald 2006 due to the low density of organic matter the given mass fractions will translate to much higher volume fractions of organic matter in spm with clear implications for floc density sedimentation and transport behavior quantitative data on the composition of pom is scarce typically easily biodegradable labile and hardly degradable refractory organic matter are distinguished the labile fraction mainly comprises carbohydrates and protein like substances and the refractory fraction mainly pedogenic but also aquagenic fulvic or humic like substances the poc composition depends on the total spm load ittekkot 1988 table 3 overall refractory substances dominate with about 29 96 average labile poc fractions of 13 major world

substances eps mainly originate from aquatic microbial production droppo et al 2004 flemming and wingender 2010 lee et al 2019 zimmermann timm 2002 fig 1 consequently pom content and composition are

ittekkot and laane 1991 le meur et al 2016 lučić et al 2019 meybeck 1981 onstad et al 2000 this is explained by dilution of the poc fraction in spm with eroded or resuspended minerals bibby and

however can increase poc by mobilizing sedimented organic detritus bibby and webster brown 2005 chanudet and filella 2007 guo and macdonald 2006 henning et al 2001 discharge also affects organic matter quality during storm flow conditions soil derived hs increase the refractory poc portion chanudet and filella 2007 hillier 2001 ittekkot and laane 1991 whereas under low flow conditions bioproduction increases the labile poc portion besemer et al 2009 hillier 2001 panagiotopoulos et al 2012 servais and garnier 2006 the maximum poc values are frequently measured from spring to early summer chanudet and filella 2007 henning et al 2001 servais and garnier 2006 at intermediate discharge low runoff to precipitation ratios and increased temperatures besemer et al 2009 onstad et al 2000 in such conditions inputs of soil derived carbon and inorganic nutrients meet the onset of increasing bioproduction while the shear suffices to resuspend and avoid sedimentation of light organic rich fractions but not to mobilize minerals from the riverbed or banks 2 4 floc like aggregates are the dominant spm structure the primary mineral and organic constituents of spm are hardly found isolated but assembled in complex floc or aggregate like structures bibby and webster brown 2005 droppo 2001 henning et al 2001 kravchishina et al 2010 lučić et al 2019 nomizu et al 1987 wilkinson et al 1997 zimmermann timm 2002 which constitute more than 90 of the total spm volume 10 60 by number droppo and ongley 1994 droppo and stone 1994 and about 60 by mass woodward and walling 2007 droppo and ongley 1994 summarized three possible origins of floc or aggregate like structures 1 soil erosion supplying some water stable aggregates 2 flocculation within the river by physical chemical and biological means and 3 hybrids combining both traditionally flocs implied a riverine origin whereas aggregates were considered soil borne also structural differences were inferred aggregates show higher density and compactness lower porosity and rounder shape droppo et al 2005 woodward et al 2002 a distinction within a river water sample was however not possible droppo et al 2005 most soil aggregates partially disaggregate in rivers grangeon et al 2014 heavier factions are incorporated into sediments or organic rich sediment surface layers from where they can be resuspended as flocs droppo and stone 1994 whereas light fractions stay suspended and form flocs or aggregate floc hybrids in the water column droppo et al 2005 biofilm fragments that detach from their substratum also contribute to spm wotton 2011 2007 and may capture minerals within their organic matrix while suspended fig 1 in this work the term floc refers to any complex spm structures the formation and stability of flocs depends on the constituents physicochemical surface properties which give rise to short range interaction forces based on particle aggregation theory elimelech et al 1995 gregory 2005 electrostatic forces arising from the constituents structural charge or ionized functional groups as well as van der waals and hydrophobic attractions are most relevant organic molecules may also favor flocculation acting as bridges between particles or inducing surface charge heterogeneities or neutralization upon adsorption buffle et al 1998 3 structural functional key components in spm the major physicochemical processes driving spm floc formation can be established around three structural functional components due to their physicochemical properties eps feox and phyllosilicates fig 1 it is important to note that hydrochemical parameters such as electrolyte type and concentration or ph can modify the properties of mineral surfaces and of organic molecules impacting on flocculation details are beyond the scope of this work but for a good overview we refer the reader to the following articles abdolahpur monikh et al 2018 baalousha 2016 grasso et al 2002 gregory 2005 kunhi mouvenchery et al 2012 philippe and schaumann 2014 preocanin et al 2016 walsch and dultz 2010 wang et al 2017 briefly specific adsorption of electrolyte ions especially multivalent ones and protonation or deprotonation of functional groups modifies the charge and hydrophobicity of particle surfaces and nom molecules in rivers ca2 mg2 average concentration 4 times lower than ca2 and so4 2 are the most relevant ions to consider regarding their concentrations potency to affect flocculation and their affinity for different mineral surfaces ca2 and so4 2 or nom mainly ca2 the electrostatic charge of spm components will be increasingly shielded with increasing electrolyte concentration and valency favoring flocculation moreover multivalent ions can act as bridges between mineral surfaces between nom and minerals and between nom and nom the latter can affect nom conformation and structural flexibility rigidity 3 1 microbial eps type nom is the glue in spm flocs nom is omnipresent in aquatic systems and no solely mineral associations are found in riverine spm samples droppo 2001 droppo et al 1997 different types of nom exhibit different flocculation potentials buffle et al 1998 wilkinson et al 1997 depending on their molecular characteristics and the degree of particle surface coverage buffle et al 1998 philippe and schaumann 2014 wang et al 2015 adsorbed high mw rigid molecules i e molecules the structure of which does not allow changes in conformation may form bridges to other particles while low mw and flexible molecules flatten on the particle surface but may induce flocculation via charge neutralization or patchy particle surface coverage electrostatic patches particles are stabilized against flocculation if full coating by highly charged low mw molecules or by large rigid molecules induces steric hindrance an early conceptual model of complex spm flocs greiser 1988 cited in henning et al 2001 already stressed the importance of organic gels binding other particles evidence of network like and fibrillar organic structures was found in numerous electron microscopy images of natural spm buffle and leppard 1995 chanudet and filella 2007 droppo et al 1997 filella et al 1993 henning et al 2001 2000 lartiges et al 2001 liss et al 1996 neu 2000 perret et al 1994 and a relation between the seasonal increase of microbial activity and increased network density involving thicker longer more branched organic fibrils was observed chanudet and filella 2007 henning et al 2001 these fibrils were concluded to consist of macromolecular microbial eps filella et al 1993 leppard 1997 and pores in spm were found mostly filled with eps liss et al 1996 neu 2000 wheatland et al 2017 at times of high microbial activity a matrix of macromolecular eps integrates mineral particles yielding large fluffy flocs while in winter when pedogenic hs is the major nom source spm is dominated by small compact mineral rich flocs and single mineral grains böckelmann 2000 droppo and ongley 1994 henning et al 2001 sigleo and helz 1981 walling and phillips 2004 fig 1 although certain eps e g highly charged alginate could stabilize particles microbial eps overall enhance flocculation lee et al 2019 srivastava et al 2018 stone and droppo 1994 wotton 2011 eps comprise a diverse mix of substances mainly polysaccharides proteins lipids dna with highly heterogeneous physicochemical properties that allow for various interactions with mineral surfaces and with each other different eps preferentially sorb to different mineral surfaces resulting in fractionation

nano scaled patches enriched in different subfractions proteins lipids polysaccharides suggesting that patches exhibit distinct physicochemical properties xinran liu et al 2013 3 1 1 microbial eps are a diverse mix of substances the origin of eps is mostly linked to microbes such as bacteria and microalgae fig 1 but also fungi and archaea droppo et al 2004 flemming and wingender 2010 zimmermann timm 2002 or larger organisms contribute from insect silk up to fish mucus wotton 2011 eps are dominated by polysaccharides and a previously underestimated share of proteins flemming and wingender 2010 laspidou 2002 and complemented by some extracellular dna lipids and fragments of all these peptides amino and nucleic acids sugars flemming and wingender 2010 here we consider eps the sum of biopolymers released by microorganisms a actively as part of their metabolic activities exudates or b passively upon cell lysis intracellular substances or during cell decomposition structural biopolymers laspidou 2002 active exudation serves purposes of attachment detachment to from surfaces or each other protection from toxic components uv radiation oxidation desiccation or mechanical stress nutrition through exoenzymes capture of nutrients and particles in the eps matrix or use of eps as substrate and establishment of microenvironments with physicochemical gradients flemming and wingender 2010 most exudates are either matrix forming polysaccharides e g xanthan pullulan dextran alginate buffle et al 1998 or enzymatic proteins flemming and wingender 2010 2001 matrix polysaccharides are long molecular chains that may associate to form fine strands attached to cells or complex networks surrounding cells sutherland 2001 and are comparatively resistant to degradation flemming and wingender 2001 enzymatic proteins cleave organic matter yielding bioavailable low mw products or degrade the eps matrix allowing detachment flemming and wingender 2010 some lipopeptides are exuded as well flemming and wingender 2010 they render surfaces more hydrophobic e g serrawettin or hydrophilic e g surfactin viscosin aiding attachment or detachment neu 1996 more recently the active exudation of dna which forms grid or network like filament structures was attributed an attachment function flemming and wingender 2010 upon cell death or lysis intracellular substances including reserve polysaccharides e g glycogen proteins and dna are set free and are mostly subject to quick degradation buffle et al 1998 flemming and wingender 2010 cell hulls decay more slowly and release structural biopolymers mainly polysaccharidic cell wall components cellulose hemicellulose pectin mucopolysaccharides peptidoglycan buffle et al 1998 and non enzymatic proteins from cytoskeleton filaments fimbria pili flagella or cell wall components but also cell wall associated lipids phospholipids glycolipids or lipopolysaccharides and some extracellular cell surface bound substances e g proteins such as carbohydrate binding lectins or amyloids which aid cell to surface attachment flemming and wingender 2010 3 1 2 heterogeneous molecular characteristics confer stickiness to eps there are neutral as well as charged eps anionic character mostly results from carboxyl groups in uronic acid and ketal linked pyruvate and partly from inorganic groups such as phosphate e g in dna or phospholipids or sulfate e g in cyanobacterial eps while cationic character arises mostly from amino groups most polysaccharides are polyanionic heteropolysaccharides e g alginate xanthan colonic acid while homopolysaccharides such as fructans and glucans are usually neutral e g cellulose pullulan dextran levan proteins are ampholytic as they consist of basic and acidic amino acids carrying carboxyl and amino groups flemming and wingender 2010 sutherland 2001 polycationic eps exuded by some gram positive bacteria vu et al 2009 are rare an example being adhesin and the hydrophilic moieties of lipid type amphophiles phospholipids glycolipids and lipopolysaccharides can exhibit either charge condition neu 1996 charged eps interact with particle surfaces through electrostatic interactions h bonding or ion bridging mainly ca2 philippe and schaumann 2014 cationic amino groups for example sorb to negatively charged basal planes of montmorillonite illite or kaolinite while anionic carboxyl groups and phosphate groups on phospholipids phosphorylated proteins or dna prefer mostly positive fe or al hydr oxide surfaces and phyllosilicate edges or require cation bridges cao et al 2011 gu 1992 hedges and hare 1987 lin et al 2016 xinran liu et al 2013 yeasmin et al 2014 compared to carboxyl rich pedogenic hs negative charge densities of most aquagenic eps are low which eases interactions with mostly negative mineral surfaces buffle et al 1998 and charge heterogeneities within the eps mix or even on single eps molecules e g proteins favor flocculation another relevant property is hydrophobicity philippe and schaumann 2014 most polysaccharides and proteins as well as dna are hydrophilic hydrophobicity increases with increasing acyl groups e g acetyl lactyl succinyl propionyl alkyl groups e g methyl ethyl hydrophobic amine and benzyl groups flemming and wingender 2010 hong et al 2018 neu 1996 sutherland 2001 hydrophobic fractions are preferentially adsorbed to many particle surfaces filella 2007 philippe and schaumann 2014 and modify their hydrophobicity favoring hydrophobic interactions between particles at full coating if not hindered by steric effects luo et al 2018 millour et al 2021 nason et al 2012 some eps are amphiphilic with proteins constituting the major fraction amphiphiles exhibit hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions or moieties e g emulsan a highly acetylated polysaccharide aiding microbe detachment from hydrophobic surfaces phospho glycolipids or lipopolysaccharides neu 1996 and proteins being composed of polar and apolar amino acids kleber et al 2007 hydrophobic interactions let hydrophobic parts of polysaccharidic eps molecules flatten on clay basal planes as modeled for montmorillonite henao and mazeau 2008 while hydrophilic side chains e g carrying charged carboxyl or hydroxyl groups extend and may induce ca2 assisted flocculation henao and mazeau 2008 labille et al 2005 when hydrophilic eps groups adsorb to mineral surface hydroxyl groups e g on clay edges or feox hydrophobic parts are available for hydrophobic interactions with further eps bilayer formation or hydrophobic particle surfaces proteins unfold upon adsorption and exhibit their amphiphilic character conditioning the surface for various further interactions kleber et al 2007 this reveals the importance of structural eps features like molecular weight structural flexibility rigidity and conformation rigid high mw eps have a higher chance to induce ca2 assisted bridging flocculation as they extend from the particle surface into the water where electrostatic forces become negligible a full coating by rigid biopolymers however can prevent flocculation through steric hindrance buffle et al 1998 rigid high mw eps mainly comprise structural biopolymers e g cell wall components and polysaccharidic exudates but also dna buffle et al 1998 polysaccharide primary structures are long molecular chains either branched for most heteropolysaccharides or linear for many homopolysaccharides sutherland 1990 their rigidity depends on the types of linkages between their monomers 1 3 β or 1 4 β linkages confer rigidity e g the cellulosic backbone in xanthan while other linkages may yield more flexible structures e g 1 2 α or 1 6 α linkages in dextran sletmoen et al 2003 sutherland 2001 highly charged eps behave rigid because they strongly bind water sometimes up to 80 buffle et al 1998 some eps can also self assemble in rigid supramolecular structures via 1 h bonding as between hydroxyl or methyl groups 2 electrostatic or cation induced ionic interactions as on carboxyl or sulfate groups 3 molecular chain chain van der waals interactions kunhi mouvenchery et al 2012 sutherland 2001 the most common secondary conformation of polysaccharidic exudates and dna in environmental conditions are rigid double or triple helices yielding long thin fibrous structures in single strands or networks sutherland 2001 with a mw of 104 105 g mol 1 fibrils reach a thickness of a few nm and a length up to the µm range nano sized minerals can attach to fibril segments with favorable characteristics and act as connectors between fibrils yielding large loose flocs buffle et al 1998 polysaccharides can also form gels which can bind particles gelling is favored by carboxyl groups that allow bridging by multivalent cations e g in gellan or alginate increasing acylation in turn renders polysaccharides more hydrophobic which inhibits interactions with ions weakening gels and promoting flexible random coil structures weak gels will not persist in rivers as they dissolve in excess solvent sutherland 2001 flexible polymers often exhibit globular appearance and easily change conformation which lets them flatten on the particle surface and excludes bridging but they may induce aggregation via electrostatic patch formation or charge neutralization and hydrophobic interactions buffle et al 1998 gregory 2005 flexible eps comprise proteins intracellular reserve polysaccharides and aquagenic refractory organic matter i e recalcitrant fragments and recombinations of degradation products of microbial cells buffle et al 1998 3 1 3 colonization favors flocculation and vice versa spm is enriched in eps as evidenced by low c n ratios n rich microbially derived organic matter is highest in the fine spm fraction 63 µm hatten et al 2012 spencer et al 2016 and decreases from the colloidal 1 kda 0 45 µm to the truly dissolved 1 kda fractions as shares of c rich pedogenic hs and aquagenic refractory organic matter increase besemer et al 2009 guo et al 2003 guo and macdonald 2006 mannino and harvey 2000 in coarser spm fractions 250 µm or 63 µm c n ratios increase with increasing vascular plant detritus hatten et al 2012 johnson et al 2018 rowland et al 2017 spencer et al 2016 accumulation of eps in spm can result from 1 colonizing biofilm forming microbes releasing eps into

spm evidences floc internal presence of microbes liss et al 1996 neu 2000 wheatland et al 2017 with bacteria and microalgae dominating neu 2000 the most prominent microalgae in spm are green algae and diatoms bacteria are mainly β proteobacteria accounting for 70 of the dapi stained cells throughout the year followed by γ and α proteobacteria cytophaga and flavobacteria mainly in spring some sulfate reducers and planctomycetes böckelmann 2000 as well as cyanobacteria lee et al 2017 both bacteria and algae were attributed a positive effect on spm floc size berger et al 1996 droppo and ongley 1994 grossart and simon 1998 kondratieff and simmons 1985 wörner et al 2002 zimmermann 1997 bacteria exhibited the strongest correlation with floc size and were also correlated to phytoplankton concentrations wörner et al 2002 zimmermann 1997 associations between bacteria and algae are mutualistic bacteria use labile algal eps as substrate and algae benefit from inorganic n fixation and reductive dissolution of fe by bacteria flemming and wingender 2001 srivastava et al 2018 and refs therein since free living and attached bacteria are equally correlated to spm floc size zimmermann 1997 attachment is not a prerequisite for microbially induced flocculation fig 1 on average up to 50 and 60 by number of the particles in the danube and danube channel were non colonized berger et al

compact floc structures böckelmann 2000 in winter bacteria sustain themselves on pedogenic hs besemer et al 2009 at increasing temperatures phytoplankton blooms and related algal eps release foster free living and attached bacteria besemer et al 2009 crump et al 2017 wörner et al 2002 zimmermann timm 2002 zimmermann 1997 and consequently the formation of large fluffy highly colonized spm flocs böckelmann 2000 fig 1 as dissolved labile eps quickly get depleted by preferential adsorption to mineral surfaces aufdenkampe et al 2001 cao et al 2011 lin et al 2016 and by mineralization through free living bacteria consequent nutrient limitation makes particle attachment beneficial hoppe 1984 sutherland 2001 motile microbes actively colonize spm others attach passively upon collision

higher growth rates than free living ones hoppe 1984 luef et al 2009 servais and garnier 2006 allowing fast biofilm formation once the substrate becomes refractory aging of spm grossart and ploug 2000 nutrient limitation induces further eps release and flocculation fig 1 he et al 2017 sutherland 2001 that way colonization and biofilm formation accelerates spm floc growth preferential adsorption of dissolved eps also yields enrichment within spm aufdenkampe et al 2001 cao et al 2011 lin et al 2016 xinran liu et al 2013 with increasing microbial activity in spring or during algal blooms eps

simultaneously the potential of filtered 1 2 µm river water to flocculate kaolinite suspensions was found to increase lee et al 2017 2019 the fine spm fraction is coined by aluminosilicate and feox primary particles with a high specific surface area markussen et al 2016 poulton and raiswell 2005 phyllosilicates e g illite montmorillonite and kaolinite enrich n from basic proteins while feox

lin et al 2016 xinran liu et al 2013 omoike et al 2004 yeasmin et al 2014 zhang et al 2021 eps induced flocculation generates a favorable substrate for pioneering bacteria flemming and wingender 2001 wotton 2011 and refs therein indeed small aggregates of clay sized minerals exhibit the highest bacterial density and activity berger et al 1996 crump and baross 2000 edwards 1987 kondratieff and simmons 1985 which again promotes flocculation 3 1 4 pedogenic hs counteract eps flocculation by dissolved eps is in competition with stabilization by soil derived hs guo et al 2003 guo and macdonald 2006 fig 1 pedogenic hs typically constitute the largest nom fraction in fresh waters with 40 80 of nom being fulvic acids and 5 10 humic acids fulvic compounds exhibit a low mw 0 5 5 kg mol 1 and a high maximum charge density 6 to 11 meq g 1 humics are larger with lower charge density higher hydrophobicity higher c o and c h ratios but else similar buffle et al 1998 the highly negative charge of hs results from many carboxyl groups which are deprotonated at environmental ph values hs are generally thought to electrostatically stabilize colloids against aggregation as adsorption increases negative charge of mineral surfaces or induces charge reversal of positively charged surfaces buffle et al 1998 reinhardt and wilkinson 2004 srivastava et al 2018 adsorption of low mw hs is kinetically favorable but their hydrophilicity eases desorption and hs will be replaced by higher mw aromatic hydrophobic nom the adsorption of which is thermodynamically favored philippe and schaumann 2014 therefore the flocculation potential of river water decreases after rain events when soil derived hs increase their share compared to eps lee et al 2017 2019 the addition of eps like substances to hs stabilized montmorillonite in turn triggered slow aggregation of hs coated montmorillonite wilkinson et al 1997 3 2 iron oxides and oxy hydroxides feox are the cement in spm flocs due to their physicochemical properties feox play an important role in spm floc formation praetorius et al 2020 acting as aggregating agent or cementing agent analogously to their role in soil aggregates filella 2007 feox can be of soil origin reaching rivers with soil aggregates or as crusts on mineral surfaces or form and transform in situ through redox driven dissolution and precipitation reactions davison and de vitre 2019 fig 1 precipitation initially yields amorphous and poorly crystalline feox like ferrihydrite or lepidocrocite guo and barnard 2013 vindedahl et al 2016 this so called labile feox fraction was found positively correlated to spm floc size markussen et al 2016 as it exhibits a high specific surface area and reactivity davison and de vitre 2019 hirst et al 2017 jilbert et al 2018 dissolution and reprecipitation however can transform labile feox into more crystalline goethite while hematite requires dry and warm conditions to form and indicates soil origin davison and de vitre 2019 guo and barnard 2013 with points of zero charge mostly above ph 7 up to 9 kosmulski 2014 bare feox surfaces are expected to be positively charged in many rivers salminen et al 2005 favoring association with negatively charged minerals and nom indeed only 3 8 of the total fe in four river water samples were discrete positively charged feox colloids filtration 1 µm and most fe was associated with spm 1 10 µm and with colloidal 1 µm hs or aluminosilicates hiraide et al 1988b the morphology of feox also plays a role on electron microscopy images of spm feox appear as patchy precipitates rather than uniform coatings on clay mineral basal planes and fill surface pits on coarser aluminosilicates baalousha et al 2019 hirst et al 2017 le meur et al 2016 poulton and raiswell 2005 isolated discrete larger feox are rarely observed hirst et al 2017 le meur et al 2016 poulton and raiswell 2005 however small nano sized spherical particles as related to ferrihydrite davison and de vitre 2019 guo and barnard 2013 are common allard et al 2004 buffle et al 1998 hirst et al 2017 perret et al 2000 poulton and raiswell 2005 tipping et al 1981 those occur in the colloidal fraction associated with nom allard et al 2004 hiraide et al 1988b perret et al 2000 and in the spm fraction as homoaggregates or heteroaggregates with aluminosilicates carbonates sulfates or quartz baalousha et al 2019 buffle et al 1998 hiraide et al 1988a hirst et al 2017 neubauer et al 2013a nomizu et al 1987 moreover hair like fe rich structures were reported le meur et al 2016 as nano sized precipitates or particles attached to other mineral surfaces increase surface heterogeneities the typical feox morphologies support spm floc formation 3 2 1 reactivity of feox surfaces favors aggregation and flocculation processes due to 1 the dominance of labile feox phases and 2 a high density in positively charged surface hydroxyl groups most feox surfaces are highly reactive the transformation of amorphous and poorly crystalline feox into crystalline phases is limited by stabilization through ligation and by relatively short residence times in rivers as compared to soils davison and de vitre 2019 guo and barnard 2013 consequently labile reactive feox phases with a high specific surface area predominate guo and barnard 2013 hirst et al 2017 vindedahl et al 2016 and refs therein labile feox can be stabilized fig 1 by nom and inorganic ligands like silicates or phosphates baalousha et al 2019 cameron and liss 1984 or by precipitation or attachment onto phyllosilicates arias 1995 schwertmann 1988 wei et al 2011 the surface chemistry of feox is governed by hydroxyl groups exhibiting ph dependent variable charge vindedahl et al 2016 and refs therein due to their high points of zero charge feox surfaces are a major contributor of positive surface charge in spm at low doc concentrations positively charged bare feox tend to heteroaggregate with negatively charged minerals like phyllosilicates or quartz fig 1 hiraide et al 1988b tombácz et al 2004 vindedahl et al 2016 composites may exhibit overall negative charge hiraide et al 1988b but attached feox particles just as feox surface precipitates can constitute positively charged patches arias 1995 baalousha et al 2019 hirst et al 2017 le meur et al 2016 poulton and raiswell 2005 that favor further aggregation through surface charge heterogeneities arias 1995 elimelech et al 2000 smith et al 2015 yates et al 2005 nano sized feox particles may distribute on negative surfaces smith et al 2015 and act as adhesives between them tombácz et al 2004 wang et al 2021 whereby size differences allow optimal particle bridging and clustering smith et al 2015 yates et al 2005 feox strongly interact with nom nano sized feox can connect large rigid eps fibrils to loose networks buffle et al 1998 similar to structures observed in natural freshwaters allard et al 2004 hirst et al 2017 perret et al 2000 patchy distributions of nom blebs or smears on mineral surfaces were attributed to underlying feox patches poulton and raiswell 2005 analogously feox patches or nanoparticles sitting on mineral surfaces may be favorable interaction sites for nom induced flocculation fig 1 the major adsorption mechanisms include electrostatic interactions and ligand exchange reactions between feox hydroxyl groups and nom carboxyl groups gu et al 1995 due to a higher hydroxyl group density feox adsorb nom more strongly than aluminosilicates kaolinite or quartz hiraide et al 1988a meier et al 1999 moreover nom exhibits a higher affinity for fe oh and al oh groups than for si oh meier et al 1999 tombácz et al 2004 vázquez ortega et al 2014 adsorption of nom to feox can affect the quality of nom as feox catalyze abiotic fenton reactions and thus oxidation and degradation of nom to more refractory and carboxyl rich nom types which feeds back on flocculation processes however biotic or biotically mediated transformation of nom is typically more prominent yu and kuzyakov 2021 the high density of positive hydroxyl groups allows feox to induce aggregation even in the presence of highly negative hs baalousha et al 2008 mylon et al 2004 low concentrations of which suffice to fully stabilize phyllosilicates kretzschmar et al 1998 tarchitzky et al 1993 governed by the degree of feox surface covered aggregation occurs when patchy hs coverage induces surface charge heterogeneities or when increased coverage yields charge neutralization at very high hs concentrations charge reversal results in electrostatic stabilization baalousha 2009 tombácz et al 2004 vindedahl et al 2016 stabilization yields negatively charged humic feox colloids hiraide et al 1988b tipping et al 1981 tipping and heaton 1983 fig 1 aggregation by hs proceeds slowly and yields small compact aggregate structures baalousha et al 2008 buffle et al 1998 mylon et al 2004 tipping et al 1981 slow aggregation driven by feox can thus explain smaller and more compact spm aggregate structures observed in winter when hs are the dominant nom source fig 1 3 2 2 feox precipitation and morphology are governed by heterogeneous oxidation autochthonous feox form when waters rich in dissolved fe get supersaturated upon hydrochemical transitions guo and barnard 2013 generally abiotic oxidation dominates over

the surface water ingri et al 2006 van der grift et al 2014 the dominance of nano sized feox and patchy coatings results from heterogeneous oxidation teutsch et al 2005 which involves adsorption of fe

layers generates fe ii which diffuses and adsorbs to surface sediments in most rivers and oligotrophic lakes reducing conditions start below the sediment surface in eutrophic systems or stratified lakes anoxia may extend into the water davison and de vitre 2019 where suspended minerals and nom offer further adsorption sites when the groundwater table drops or surface sediments get resuspended adsorbed fe ii is oxidized and precipitates gerhardt and schink 2005 some oxidation even proceeds under anoxic conditions as catalyzed by the sorbate e g nom daugherty et al 2017 or phyllosilicates van groeningen et al 2020 or by microorganisms bryce et al 2018 the affinity of dissolevd fe for al oh groups and nom favors feox patches on aluminosilicates baalousha et al 2019 hirst et al 2017 le meur et al 2016 poulton and raiswell 2005 and organic rich feox colloids buffle et al 1989 hiraide et al 1988b perret et al 2000 tipping et al 1981 fig 3 the morphology and surface properties of the latter are influenced by the nom type fe c ratios inorganic ligands and ionic strength ahmad et al 2020 cismasu et al 2011 liao et al 2017 mikutta et al 2014 perret et al 2000 feox granules 10 50 nm on eps networks benedetti et al 2003 hirst et al 2017 perret et al 2000 may nucleate at low fe c and high ionic strength when fe cannot fully coat eps as other ions compete for complexation perret et al 2000 hair like or fibrous feox fortin et al 1993 le meur et al 2017 can be related to biotic origin fleming et al 2014 or feox coated eps formed at high fe c and low ionic strength perret et al 2000 nucleation of feox on clay attached nom provides an alternative explanation for feox granules 10 20 nm seaming clay edges attached via nom poulton and raiswell 2005 which the authors attributed to aggregation of nom coated feox with positively charged clay edges larger 100 500 nm c rich feox globules buffle et al 1989 mavrocordatos et al 2000 perret et al 2000 tipping et al 1981 were related to hs type nom a high fe c ratio and low ionic strength perret et al 2000 they result from co precipitatation with nom guénet et al 2017 mikutta et al 2014 neubauer et al 2013b and subsequent homoaggregation of 10 nm ferrihydrite fig 3 cismasu et al 2011 fortin et al 1993 hirst et al 2017 von gunten and schneider 1991 incorporation of hs or negatively charged inorganic ligands e g silicates phosphates can lower the point of zero charge or even impose negative charge to feox liao et al 2017 mikutta et al 2014 saleh and jones 1984 affecting their reactivity and aggregation behavior liao et al 2017 von gunten and schneider 1991 the same is true for the adsorption of so4 2 walsch and dultz 2010 3 3 phyllosilicates are a major substrate for floc formation processes being one of the most abundant spm constituents phyllosilicates constitute the scaffold for floc formation processes fig 1 five interaction mechanisms can be discerned fig 4 in which phyllosilicates play a key role through intrinsic surface heterogeneities and a high affinity for nom as a preferential substrate for reactive feox coatings and as substrate for microbial growth 3 3 1 phyllosilicate surface heterogeneities favor aggregation and eps flocculation at the edges or surface defects phyllosilicates carry reactive surface hydroxyl groups mostly si oh and al oh but also some mg oh those exhibit ph dependent variable surface charge while unimpaired basal planes exhibit permanent negative charge due to isomorphic substitution of si4 with al3 and fe3 or of al3 with mg2 and fe2 in the crystal lattice preocanin et al 2016 zero charge conditions for phyllosilicate edges were reported at ph 7 5 for chlorite kaolinite talc muscovite kosmulski 2001 yin et al 2013 a higher density of mg oh and al oh groups at the edges favors positive edge charge as they are more easily protonated than si oh xiandong liu et al 2013 tournassat et al 2016 yin et al 2013 the intrinsic surface charge heterogeneities of phyllosilicates favor edge to face aggregation fig 4 especially at lower ph when edge group protonation is more pronounced a close correlation of the organic c content in spm with al contents and specific surface area poulton and raiswell 2005 indicates interactions of nom with phyllosilicates phyllosilicate hydroxyl groups are prone to adsorb nom negatively charged low mw hs coat positive edge groups and stabilize phyllosilicates kretzschmar et al 1998 tarchitzky et al 1993 while eps typically induce flocculation labille et al 2005 lee et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 due to their heterogeneous properties phyllosilicates preferentially interact with similarly diverse eps surface charge heterogeneity allows electrostatic interactions of anionic nom groups e g carboxyl or phosphate with phyllosilicate edges and of cationic amino groups with phyllosilicate basal planes cao et al 2011 hedges and hare 1987 lin et al 2016 yeasmin et al 2014 since the basal planes exhibit increasing hydrophobicity with lower degrees of isomorphic substitution e g montmorillonite illite kaolinite talc while the edges are usually hydrophilic yin 2012 hydrophobic interactions with nom occur on basal planes henao and mazeau 2008 the high specific surface area and cation exchange capacity of phyllosilicates additionally supports weaker nom interactions like h bonding at lower ph and cation bridging in the presence of divalent cations mainly ca2 cao et al 2011 philippe and schaumann 2014 3 3 2 phyllosilicates are a preferential substrate for reactive feox coatings the visual evidence of frequent feox coatings on aluminosilicates mentioned earlier is supported by positive correlations of reactive fe contents with al contents with decreasing spm constituent particle size and with increasing specific surface area markussen et al 2016 poulton and raiswell 2005 aluminosilicates constitute a preferential substrate for a patchy precipitation or attachment of feox and support formation and persistence of labile reactive feox feox patches yield surface charge heterogeneities and reactivity enhances nom interactions favoring incorporation of feox carrying aluminosilicates into spm ligation by reactive mineral surface groups can catalyze oxidation of adsorbed fe ii by water géhin et al 2007 van groeningen et al 2020 allowing for oxidative precipitation of adsorbed fe ii even below saturation and under strictly anoxic conditions géhin et al 2007 mikutta et al 2009 van groeningen et al 2020 al oh or mg oh groups at edges or surface defects of phyllosilicates e g montmorillonite constitute such catalysts géhin et al 2007 due to a limited availability of these sites low fe ii surface loadings yielded higher oxidized fe iii fractions than high loadings van groeningen et al 2020 aluminosilicate surface pits filled by feox provide visual evidence poulton and raiswell 2005 below saturation precipitation of feox in anoxic conditions also occurred on al and fe oxides goethite but not on quartz and a stronger adsorption of fe ii suggests a higher affinity for al oh and fe oh than si oh mikutta et al 2009 as phyllosilicates are way more abundant than metal hydr oxides they will be the relevant substrates for surface catalyzed feox precipitation but feox patches themselves may facilitate further precipitation attachment of feox to phyllosilicates behaves similarly as indicated by ferrihydrite granules sitting in surface defects of montmorillonite after mixing yan et al 2021 electrostatic interactions favor attachment of feox ferrihydrite to phyllosilicate basal planes at low to circumneutral ph yong and ohtsubo 1987 only high loadings yielded a full coating else ferrihydrite distributed in patches of particles or aggregates centered around certain kaolinite surface sites jones and saleh 1987 again specific interactions with high affinity sites can be concluded as shown for feox surface precipitates on kaolinite arias 1995 wei et al 2011 as well as for ferrihydrite particles being mixed with different clay minerals schwertmann 1988 phyllosilicates as opposed to quartz increase liability reactivity and specific surface area of feox and inhibit or slow their crystallization the authors hypothesized that 1 dissolved si or al released from phyllosilicates inhibits or retards feox crystallization 2 reactive clay surfaces hamper feox crystallization more than silicates in line with the above 3 the cementing action between phyllosilicates and amorphous feox inhibits dissolution precipitation reactions and structural rearrangement of feox into crystalline forms arias 1995 schwertmann 1988 wei et al 2011 3 3 3 phyllosilicates support microbial nutrition due to their high specific surface areas and ion exchange capacities phyllosilicates adsorb nutrients and organic substrates supporting microbial growth cuadros 2017 henning et al 2001 liss et al 1996 phyllosilicates offer hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces easing microbe attachment and microbes exude eps to attach and access nutrients fostering typical organo mineral aggregates cuadros 2017 3d nanotomography imaging of riverine spm shows complex porous structures of clay minerals and few larger grains being colonized by microorganisms wheatland et al 2017 so called house of cards structures are actively constructed from phyllosilicates eps and some feox constituting the microbial minimal nutritional sphere lunsdorf et al 2000 in this context phyllosilicates are also thought to eliminate harmful waste products by adsorption microbes prefer nutrient rich e g smectite and easily leachable clays montmorillonite benefitted microbial activity more than kaolinite as probably related to their adsorption capacity cuadros 2017 and refs therein moreover microbes can mediate precipitation of low crystallinity si al fe containing clay minerals functional groups on cell walls and eps negative carboxyl hydroxyl phosphoryl and positive amino groups thereby provide sorption and nucleation sites a detailed review of these and other microbe mineral interactions e g transformation weathering dissolution leaching of clays is given in cuadros 2017 4 conclusion analyzing the scientific wealth of more than 220 publications from several decades of research and various scientific disciplines it could be shown that freshwater floc formation processes and structural dynamics involve three key components phyllosilicates feox and nom eps associations of these components constitute a fertile base spm type present throughout the year even at low temperatures during rain events spm flocs are diluted by eroded minerals which upon recovery of bioproduction are flocculated by dissolved eps to form fresh spm base units with increasing temperatures and microbial growth spm is colonized and flocculated to large fluffy eps rich flocs microhabitats which provide multiple crucial services to the global element cycles phyllosilicates feox and eps contribute to an overall heterogeneity in physicochemical surface properties which favors their association to complex flocs or aggregates other materials are rather inert e g quartz or play similar roles but are less abundant like mn or al oxides oxy hydroxides 4 1 flocculating eps counteract stabilizing hs eps as opposed to hs promote heterogeneity in physicochemical surface properties upon adsorption they comprise substances spanning a wide range of molecular weights various degrees of rigidity and hydrophobicity and diverse functional groups and charge densities heterogeneity favors eps induced flocculation through multivalent ion assisted bridging by large rigid eps charge heterogeneities within coatings through fractionated sorption or patchy coatings charge neutralization allowing predominance of weak interaction forces such as van der waals and hydrophobic forces highly degraded hs are more homogeneous regarding flocculation relevant properties they mainly comprise low mw fulvic and to a lesser extent high mw humic acids exhibiting high densities in negatively charged carboxyl groups which yield homogeneous highly negative coatings that electrostatically stabilize minerals against flocculation due to their antagonistic roles flocculation or stabilization depend on the relative concentrations of hs and eps 4 2 phyllosilicates constitute the base for spm floc formation phyllosilicates dominate the mineral mass fraction in spm due to their heterogeneous surface properties they provide the base for feox and eps enhanced floc formation processes both fe and organic c contents in spm are closely correlated to phyllosilicates phyllosilicates exhibit intrinsic surface charge heterogeneities with structural permanent negative charge on the basal planes and ph dependent variable charge at the edges and surface defects edges are hydrophilic while basal planes are more hydrophobic and edges as well as surface pits exhibit increased densities of reactive hydroxyl groups these properties allow phyllosilicates to undergo electrostatic edge to face aggregation to interact with nom preferentially eps and to act as preferential substrate for feox attachment or surface precipitation 4 3 feox increase surface charge heterogeneities and reactivity of phyllosilicates interactions between feox and phyllosilicates increase phyllosilicate surface charge heterogeneity and feox reactivity favoring flocculation attachment or precipitation of feox yields patchy coatings on phyllosilicates since dissolved fe as well as feox particles are preferentially ligated by surface pit or edge hydroxyl groups additionally bare feox can electrostatically interact with phyllosilicate basal planes due to mostly positive surface charge at circumneutral ph association with phyllosilicates stabilizes labile feox phases against crystallization keeping them reactive and their specific surface area high consequently feox carrying phyllosilicates enhance flocculation through surface charge heterogeneities arising from patchy distributions of feox precipitates or granules through a phyllosilicate mediated increased reactivity of feox favoring interactions with nom and mineral surfaces 4 4 nom strongly interacts with both feox and phyllosilicates phyllosilicates and feox strongly adsorb nom whereby eps are preferentially adsorbed negatively charged and hydrophobic phyllosilicate basal planes preferentially adsorb cationic amino groups on basic amino acids and hydrophobic parts e g acyl groups feox and clay edges strongly interact with anionic carboxyl groups on polysaccharides acidic amino acids or hs and phosphate groups on phospholipids phosphorylated proteins or nucleic acids preferential adsorption of eps on feox and phyllosilicates supports flocculation mechanisms involving eps at high concentrations of hs however the affinity of hs carboxyl groups for hydroxyl groups on feox and phyllosilicate edges yields full coating and electrostatic stabilization due to their high hydroxyl group density feox can still allow for some degree of flocculation at elevated hs concentrations the high affinity between nom and fe can induce co precipitation whereby nom type and concentration impact morphology and reactivity of feox precipitates fully fe coated eps yield elongated fibrous feox while at lower fe eps ratios nano sized feox granules nucleate on eps hs promote globular co precipitates with negative surface charge due to the high density of carboxyl groups in hs 4 5 phyllosilicate feox nom associations form a fertile base floc unit favorable interactions between the single components entail association of all three components to a fertile base floc unit processes favoring phyllosilicate feox nom associations include small feox granules connecting nom or phyllosilicate attached nom feox precipitates nucleating directly on phyllosilicate attached nom reactive feox precipitates granules on phyllosilicates favoring nom interactions nom coated feox attaching to phyllosilicate edges phyllosilicate feox nom associations are a favorable substrate for microbial colonization they pool essential inorganic nutrients and organic substrates as their high specific surface area and cation exchange capacity favor adsorption microbial colonization and biofilm formation triggers flocculation through eps release at different stages adhesive eps aid attachment attached microbes exude ligands or enzymatic eps to access nutrients and when the substrate becomes refractory starvation induces further eps release additionally dissolved eps preferentially interact with feox and phyllosilicates and flocculate new phyllosilicate feox nom associations that provide fresh substrate for microbial colonization 4 6 flocculation in rivers is favored by eps and feox large fluffy flocs form at times of high bioproduction when eps release is high and colonization and active biofilm formation accelerates eps release and flocculation a loose floc structure is supported by high contents of fibril or network like organic eps generated by colonizing bacteria and microalgae at low temperatures or after rain events high fractions of soil leached hs decrease the flocculation potential of river waters small compact aggregate like spm sometimes inhabited by few bacteria and single mineral grains are dominant feox may induce slow formation of compact aggregates despite elevated hs concentrations the content of labile reactive feox is positively related to spm floc size as they constitute aggregating and cementing agents as well as an essential fe source to microbes authigenic feox formation also exhibits seasonal fluctuations depending on the dominant fe source at winter baseflow higher shares of fe ii rich anoxic groundwater may increase precipitation while soil derived fe nom complexes increase after rain events 4 7 riverine spm dynamics are in a feedback loop with global processes spm is an important part of many biogeochemical cycles and provides multiple ecosystem services it functions as habitat and feed as bioreactor involved in element cycling impacting aquatic food chains up to climate change and as transport vehicle for nutrients and pollutants affecting freshwaters sediments inundation zones and the ocean in the light of climate change 1 rising temperatures and 2 higher frequencies of extreme events will modify riverine spm dynamics which feed back into global change increasing temperatures stimulate bioproduction even in climatic regions where it was negligible before e g periglacial waters rich in elemental nutrients may constitute favorable grounds for a microbial conquest increasing bioproduction implies more eps release fueling flocculation but also quicker turnover of substrates and probably faster nutrient limitation which may coincide with lower resupply of nutrients by soil leachate and erosion due to an expansion of dry periods microbial blooms and consequent starvation likely increase deposited spm amounts with sedimentation being facilitated by low shear forces during dry periods which may increase interim carbon storage in lake or river sediments however reduced mixing at low discharge may as well foster anoxia and methanogenesis with consequences on aquatic life and greenhouse gas emissions an extension of the redox cline into the water column potentially favors feox formation as oxidation rates increase with temperature similarly the significance of anoxic groundwater contributions to discharge may increase during extended dry periods and with it fe ii supply this may yield more feox formation during the warm season whereas during the cold season an absence of frost i e higher runoff contribution to discharge and warmer temperatures may reduce fe ii based feox formation enhanced weathering of soils together with more intense rain events however may entail more release of fe iii nom complexes as well as secondary minerals phyllosilicates into the rivers frequent storm events in turn counteract carbon storage in freshwater sediments as intense flushes will clear riverbeds which likely yields a higher transfer of organic rich spm to inundation zones and the oceans additionally soil erosion as promoted by extended droughts will enhance sediment yields during storms contributing to an increased discharge of suspended load into the oceans in estuaries salinity as well as nutrient fueled bioproduction will enhance flocculation and sedimentation likely making the oceans even more important carbon sinks these are just a few approaches on how freshwater spm dynamics could feed back into global processes as converse processes exist further research on how climate change impacts on riverine eps feox and phyllosilicate budgets is required to establish spm mass and carbon balances that allow to assess the net effects on global

freshwater suspended particulate matter spm is an integral part of global geological geochemical and biological cycles in the aquatic environment due to ubiquitous presence mobility and its physicochemical properties eisma 1993 about 109 1013 tons of spm are discharged into the oceans every year beusen et al 2005 meybeck 1982 viers et al 2009 walling and webb 1987 supplying loads of inorganic martin and meybeck 1979 and organic meybeck 1982 matter to the marine ecosystem for most elements particulate loads by far exceed dissolved ones jeandel and oelkers 2015 meybeck 1976 making riverine spm the major nutrient supply to the oceans beusen et al 2005 eisma 1993 jeandel and oelkers 2015 substantial particulate carbon loads meybeck 1982 indicate the importance of spm in global carbon cycling about 44 of the annual terrestrial c flux into rivers is returned to the atmosphere 22 is buried in lake and reservoir sediments and about one third reaches the ocean aufdenkampe et al 2011 where salinity boosts aggregation and sedimentation eisma 1993 both freshwater and marine sediments constitute important carbon sinks and burial may subject spm to diagenesis or hydrocarbon formation processes closing the geological cycle eisma 1993 leithold et al 2016 freshwater co2 release is partly attributed to colonized spm flocs functioning as bioreactors fig 1 spm pools elemental

nutrients are recycled and partly released to the water together with labile organic substances feeding free living organisms grossart and simon 1998 simon et al 2002 microbial biomass improves the

floc formation continues in sediments wotton 2007 zimmermann timm 2002 until increased shear through high discharge in rivers tidal impact in estuaries or temperature wind driven mixing in lakes re mobilizes spm eisma 1993 high concentrations of spm can physically impair aquatic ecosystems increased turbidity hampers bioproduction due to reduced light and increased mechanical stress and mineralization of deposited organic rich spm can induce oxygen shortage in poorly mixed waters bilotta and brazier 2008 inundations supply spm to riparian zones and floodplains adair et al 2004 brunet

nutrient discharge into the oceans leithold et al 2016 spm can as well act as vector for contaminants due to its physicochemical properties it accumulates various dissolved organic guo et al 2007 he

bioavailability and accumulation more recently spm interactions with particulate contaminants like engineered nanoparticles micro nanoplastics tire break road wear or soot received increased attention

material that does not sediment under the given hydrodynamic and hydrochemical conditions and is retained by filtration over 0 45 or 0 22 µm pore size membranes eisma 1993 the filtrate is considered dissolved and is sometimes further separated into colloidal 0 45 µm and 1 kda and truly dissolved fractions 1 kda e g guo et al 2004 2007 spm is highly complex and dynamic fig 1 it typically exhibits floc or aggregate like structures that integrate inorganic and organic components of allochthonous aquagenic and autochthonous mainly pedogenic origins droppo 2001 henning et al 2001 zimmermann timm

pollution land use eisma 1993 viers et al 2009 zimmermann timm 2002 different conceptions of spm are reflected in the diversity of terms across disciplines the most common ones are suspended sediments

suspended solids berger et al 1996 bilotta et al 2012 droppo and ongley 1994 which share the idea of a material suspended under given conditions suspended sediments stresses sedimentation and resuspension as a major spm control but falls short of implying material inputs by runoff soil erosion and pelagic bioproduction suspended solids underlines the distinction from the dissolved phase but dissolved substances are building blocks incorporated by adsorption or diffusion into spm pores consequently suspended matter seems most comprehensive some less common terms are seston kernegger et al 2009 kondratieff and simmons 1985 mcconnachie and petticrew 2006 peduzzi and luef 2008 from greek strain or filter which reflects the operational definition of spm and composite suspended

river snow böckelmann 2000 neu 2000 was introduced by microbial ecologists analogously to marine snow and emphasizes microbial activity yielding organic rich fluffy structures just as the term floc aggregate in turn describes mineral dominated structures associated with soil origin so far spm in river systems has received much less attention as compared to estuarine and marine systems in the light of recent research addressing particulate pollutants a fundamental understanding of freshwater spm is a prerequisite to assess the fate of these emerging contaminants in river systems knowledge about freshwater spm is found in publications from various disciplines ranging from geosciences through microbiology and ecology to environmental sciences and modeling there is no comprehensive review available on the formation of spm in river systems which analyzed the plethora of information from these different disciplines many studies have considered spm as substrate for contaminant interactions controlling behavior fate and bioavailability of pollutants in most cases spm was treated as a black box constituting the particle bound fraction of pollutants here we abandon this contaminant centered view and focus on the characteristics and dynamics of spm flocs as pivotal micro reactors in freshwater chemistry and ecology the aim of this review is to analyze the complexity of freshwater spm composition and identify the key components and mechanisms governing physicochemical floc formation processes with a focus on river systems we elucidate the quantitative and qualitative mineralogical and organic composition of riverine spm and identify components that play crucial structural functional roles in spm formation the origins flocculation relevant properties and dynamic interactions of these spm components are discussed in detail and spatiotemporal dynamics affecting floc formation morphology and composition are explained fig 1 2 composition and structural features of riverine spm with about 1 30 wt organic matter content riverine spm mass not necessarily volume is overall dominated by minerals mainly phyllosilicates carbonates quartz and feldspars the organic matter content and its composition underlie seasonal and discharge related dynamics generally less bioavailable fulvic and humic like substances dominate but during periods of substantial bioproduction easily biodegradable substances can constitute up to 70 wt of the organic matter in spm 2 1 phyllosilicates dominate the mineral fraction phyllosilicates and quartz are omnipresent in riverine spm around the world table 1 followed by feldspars and carbonates reported in 24 and 21 out of 25 rivers respectively by mass table 1 a phyllosilicates contribute 22 72 wt and carbonates up to 61 wt the carbonates fraction is more variable and sometimes absent as carbonates might dissolve with distance from the lithological source their presence is often related to an increased microbial activity breitenbach et al 1999 eidam et al 1997 sigleo and helz 1981 and artefacts from sample preparation e g precipitation can distort the picture bibby and webster brown 2005 mcguire and herman 2015 quartz represents 8 35 wt and feldspars 4 41 wt with increasing discharge coarse grain size classes increase their shares in the spm size distribution often resulting in higher fractions of quartz up to 50 wt slomberg et al 2016 feldspar or carbonates buffle et al 1998 henning et al 2001 hillier 2001 kravchishina et al 2010 lučić et al 2021 pont et al 2002 slomberg et al 2016 subramanian 1979 wall and wilding 1976 this grain size dependence is reflected in particle number based spm composition data table 1 c where phyllosilicates amount to 66 89 n and quartz only up to 9 n clays e g illite kaolinite smectite montmorillonite are the prevalent phyllosilicates with illite constituting 48 wt of phyllosilicates and 24 wt of the total minerals si table 1 a furthermore

except for the mentioned grain size relation higher quartz feldspar carbonate concentrations in larger size fractions 2 2 particulate organic matter pom fraction mostly below one third particulate organic matter pom denotes the organic mass fraction in spm distinguished from dissolved organic matter dom by filtration pom 0 2 or 0 45 µm sometimes colloidal organic matter 0 45 µm and 1 kda is separated as well this distinction is solely operational since natural organic matter nom constitutes a continuum from molecules via detrital matter up to microorganisms and the pom fraction integrates parts of all size fractions pom is typically determined as mass loss on ignition or applying conversion factors to particulate organic carbon poc the reported pom fractions in spm of 9 rivers range from a few percent to above 30 wt with a median of 15 wt table 2 employing the reported conversion factors 1 7 2 5 guo and macdonald 2006 hillier 2001 wall and wilding 1976 to poc data si fig 1 95 of the reviewed 54 rivers fall within the range of 1 2 40 wt pom with a median of 6 5 9 5 wt the pom content was found to be inversely correlated with spm size and reached its maximum in the smallest 1 0 2 µm spm subfraction ran et al 2000 this is confirmed by 55 of the total organic carbon load being colloidal 0 45 µm 1 kda and 6 20 particulate 0 45 µm leaving 15 28 in the truly dissolved fraction 1 kda guo et al 2003 guo and macdonald 2006 due to the low density of organic matter the given mass fractions will translate to much higher volume fractions of organic matter in spm with clear implications for floc density sedimentation and transport behavior quantitative data on the composition of pom is scarce typically easily biodegradable labile and hardly degradable refractory organic matter are distinguished the labile fraction mainly comprises carbohydrates and protein like substances and the refractory fraction mainly pedogenic but also aquagenic fulvic or humic like substances the poc composition depends on the total spm load ittekkot 1988 table 3 overall refractory substances dominate with about 29 96 average labile poc fractions of 13 major world rivers amount to 4 3 46 6 but local or seasonal maxima can be higher e g 71 in river lütschine chanudet and filella 2007 in the labile fraction protein like substances mostly prevail over carbohydrates 2 3 pom content and composition are dynamic whether the quality of pom is rather refractory or labile is related to the source of nom refractory substances are mostly pedogenic humic substances hs predominantly fulvic acids retrieved from catchment soils by leaching or erosion buffle et al 1998 while labile carbohydrates and proteins referred to as extracellular polymeric substances eps mainly originate from aquatic microbial production droppo et al 2004 flemming and wingender 2010 lee et al 2019 zimmermann timm 2002 fig 1 consequently pom content and composition are linked to seasonal variations in primary production and discharge fig 2 related to the dominant source of nom contrary seasonal patterns exist temperate low land rivers exhibit increased autochthonous microbial production and eps release from spring through autumn yielding high labile aquagenic poc fractions bukaveckas et al 2019 henning et al 2001 lučić et al 2019 servais and garnier 2006 sigleo and helz 1981 allochthonous e g periglacial or arctic systems are mainly fed by hs type nom leached from soils during wet seasons or snowmelt and exhibit organic carbon minima during dry summers chanudet and filella 2007 guo et al 2003 guo and macdonald 2006 onstad et al 2000 with increasing discharge the spm load increases and poc decreases bibby and webster brown 2005 henning et al 2001 ittekkot and laane 1991 le meur et al 2016 lučić et al 2019 meybeck 1981 onstad et al 2000 this is explained by dilution of the poc fraction in spm with eroded or resuspended minerals bibby and webster brown 2005 hillier 2001 together with a reduced bioproduction through increased turbidity chanudet and filella 2007 ittekkot and laane 1991 the first moderate flushes in spring or autumn however can increase poc by mobilizing sedimented organic detritus bibby and webster brown 2005 chanudet and filella 2007 guo and macdonald 2006 henning et al 2001 discharge also affects organic matter quality during storm flow conditions soil derived hs increase the refractory poc portion chanudet and filella 2007 hillier 2001 ittekkot and laane 1991 whereas under low flow conditions bioproduction increases the labile poc portion besemer et al 2009 hillier 2001 panagiotopoulos et al 2012 servais and garnier 2006 the maximum poc values are frequently measured from spring to early summer chanudet and filella 2007 henning et al 2001 servais and garnier 2006 at intermediate discharge low runoff to precipitation ratios and increased temperatures besemer et al 2009 onstad et al 2000 in such conditions inputs of soil derived carbon and inorganic nutrients meet the onset of increasing bioproduction while the shear suffices to resuspend and avoid sedimentation of light organic rich fractions but not to mobilize minerals from the riverbed or banks 2 4 floc like aggregates are the dominant spm structure the primary mineral and organic constituents of spm are hardly found isolated but assembled in complex floc or aggregate like structures bibby and webster brown 2005 droppo 2001 henning et al 2001 kravchishina et al 2010 lučić et al 2019 nomizu et al 1987 wilkinson et al 1997 zimmermann timm 2002 which constitute more than 90 of the total spm volume 10 60 by number droppo and ongley 1994 droppo and stone 1994 and about 60 by mass woodward and walling 2007 droppo and ongley 1994 summarized three possible origins of floc or aggregate like structures 1 soil erosion supplying some water stable aggregates 2 flocculation within the river by physical chemical and biological means and 3 hybrids combining both traditionally flocs implied a riverine origin whereas aggregates were considered soil borne also structural differences were inferred aggregates show higher density and compactness lower porosity and rounder shape droppo et al 2005 woodward et al 2002 a distinction within a river water sample was however not possible droppo et al 2005 most soil aggregates partially disaggregate in rivers grangeon et al 2014 heavier factions are incorporated into sediments or organic rich sediment surface layers from where they can be resuspended as flocs droppo and stone 1994 whereas light fractions stay suspended and form flocs or aggregate floc hybrids in the water column droppo et al 2005 biofilm fragments that detach from their substratum also contribute to spm wotton 2011 2007 and may capture minerals within their organic matrix while suspended fig 1 in this work the term floc refers to any complex spm structures the formation and stability of flocs depends on the constituents physicochemical surface properties which give rise to short range interaction forces based on particle aggregation theory elimelech et al 1995 gregory 2005 electrostatic forces arising from the constituents structural charge or ionized functional groups as well as van der waals and hydrophobic attractions are most relevant organic molecules may also favor flocculation acting as bridges between particles or inducing surface charge heterogeneities or neutralization upon adsorption buffle et al 1998 3 structural functional key components in spm the major physicochemical processes driving spm floc formation can be established around three structural functional components due to their physicochemical properties eps feox and phyllosilicates fig 1 it is important to note that hydrochemical parameters such as electrolyte type and concentration or ph can modify the properties of mineral surfaces and of organic molecules impacting on flocculation details are beyond the scope of this work but for a good overview we refer the reader to the following articles abdolahpur monikh et al 2018 baalousha 2016 grasso et al 2002 gregory 2005 kunhi mouvenchery et al 2012 philippe and schaumann 2014 preocanin et al 2016 walsch and dultz 2010 wang et al 2017 briefly specific adsorption of electrolyte ions especially multivalent ones and protonation or deprotonation of functional groups modifies the charge and hydrophobicity of particle surfaces and nom molecules in rivers ca2 mg2 average concentration 4 times lower than ca2 and so4 2 are the most relevant ions to consider regarding their concentrations potency to affect flocculation and their affinity for different mineral surfaces ca2 and so4 2 or nom mainly ca2 the electrostatic charge of spm components will be increasingly shielded with increasing electrolyte concentration and valency favoring flocculation moreover multivalent ions can act as bridges between mineral surfaces between nom and minerals and between nom and nom the latter can affect nom conformation and structural flexibility rigidity 3 1 microbial eps type nom is the glue in spm flocs nom is omnipresent in aquatic systems and no solely mineral associations are found in riverine spm samples droppo 2001 droppo et al 1997 different types of nom exhibit different flocculation potentials buffle et al 1998 wilkinson et al 1997 depending on their molecular characteristics and the degree of particle surface coverage buffle et al 1998 philippe and schaumann 2014 wang et al 2015 adsorbed high mw rigid molecules i e molecules the structure of which does not allow changes in conformation may form bridges to other particles while low mw and flexible molecules flatten on the particle surface but may induce flocculation via charge neutralization or patchy particle surface coverage electrostatic patches particles are stabilized against flocculation if full coating by highly charged low mw molecules or by large rigid molecules induces steric hindrance an early conceptual model of complex spm flocs greiser 1988 cited in henning et al 2001 already stressed the importance of organic gels binding other particles evidence of network like and fibrillar organic structures was found in numerous electron microscopy images of natural spm buffle and leppard 1995 chanudet and filella 2007 droppo et al 1997 filella et al 1993 henning et al 2001 2000 lartiges et al 2001 liss et al 1996 neu 2000 perret et al 1994 and a relation between the seasonal increase of microbial activity and increased network density involving thicker longer more branched organic fibrils was observed chanudet and filella 2007 henning et al 2001 these fibrils were concluded to consist of macromolecular microbial eps filella et al 1993 leppard 1997 and pores in spm were found mostly filled with eps liss et al 1996 neu 2000 wheatland et al 2017 at times of high microbial activity a matrix of macromolecular eps integrates mineral particles yielding large fluffy flocs while in winter when pedogenic hs is the major nom source spm is dominated by small compact mineral rich flocs and single mineral grains böckelmann 2000 droppo and ongley 1994 henning et al 2001 sigleo and helz 1981 walling and phillips 2004 fig 1 although certain eps e g highly charged alginate could stabilize particles microbial eps overall enhance flocculation lee et al 2019 srivastava et al 2018 stone and droppo 1994 wotton 2011 eps comprise a diverse mix of substances mainly polysaccharides proteins lipids dna with highly heterogeneous physicochemical properties that allow for various interactions with mineral surfaces and with each other different eps preferentially sorb to different mineral surfaces resulting in fractionation

nano scaled patches enriched in different subfractions proteins lipids polysaccharides suggesting that patches exhibit distinct physicochemical properties xinran liu et al 2013 3 1 1 microbial eps are a diverse mix of substances the origin of eps is mostly linked to microbes such as bacteria and microalgae fig 1 but also fungi and archaea droppo et al 2004 flemming and wingender 2010 zimmermann timm 2002 or larger organisms contribute from insect silk up to fish mucus wotton 2011 eps are dominated by polysaccharides and a previously underestimated share of proteins flemming and wingender 2010 laspidou 2002 and complemented by some extracellular dna lipids and fragments of all these peptides amino and nucleic acids sugars flemming and wingender 2010 here we consider eps the sum of biopolymers released by microorganisms a actively as part of their metabolic activities exudates or b passively upon cell lysis intracellular substances or during cell decomposition structural biopolymers laspidou 2002 active exudation serves purposes of attachment detachment to from surfaces or each other protection from toxic components uv radiation oxidation desiccation or mechanical stress nutrition through exoenzymes capture of nutrients and particles in the eps matrix or use of eps as substrate and establishment of microenvironments with physicochemical gradients flemming and wingender 2010 most exudates are either matrix forming polysaccharides e g xanthan pullulan dextran alginate buffle et al 1998 or enzymatic proteins flemming and wingender 2010 2001 matrix polysaccharides are long molecular chains that may associate to form fine strands attached to cells or complex networks surrounding cells sutherland 2001 and are comparatively resistant to degradation flemming and wingender 2001 enzymatic proteins cleave organic matter yielding bioavailable low mw products or degrade the eps matrix allowing detachment flemming and wingender 2010 some lipopeptides are exuded as well flemming and wingender 2010 they render surfaces more hydrophobic e g serrawettin or hydrophilic e g surfactin viscosin aiding attachment or detachment neu 1996 more recently the active exudation of dna which forms grid or network like filament structures was attributed an attachment function flemming and wingender 2010 upon cell death or lysis intracellular substances including reserve polysaccharides e g glycogen proteins and dna are set free and are mostly subject to quick degradation buffle et al 1998 flemming and wingender 2010 cell hulls decay more slowly and release structural biopolymers mainly polysaccharidic cell wall components cellulose hemicellulose pectin mucopolysaccharides peptidoglycan buffle et al 1998 and non enzymatic proteins from cytoskeleton filaments fimbria pili flagella or cell wall components but also cell wall associated lipids phospholipids glycolipids or lipopolysaccharides and some extracellular cell surface bound substances e g proteins such as carbohydrate binding lectins or amyloids which aid cell to surface attachment flemming and wingender 2010 3 1 2 heterogeneous molecular characteristics confer stickiness to eps there are neutral as well as charged eps anionic character mostly results from carboxyl groups in uronic acid and ketal linked pyruvate and partly from inorganic groups such as phosphate e g in dna or phospholipids or sulfate e g in cyanobacterial eps while cationic character arises mostly from amino groups most polysaccharides are polyanionic heteropolysaccharides e g alginate xanthan colonic acid while homopolysaccharides such as fructans and glucans are usually neutral e g cellulose pullulan dextran levan proteins are ampholytic as they consist of basic and acidic amino acids carrying carboxyl and amino groups flemming and wingender 2010 sutherland 2001 polycationic eps exuded by some gram positive bacteria vu et al 2009 are rare an example being adhesin and the hydrophilic moieties of lipid type amphophiles phospholipids glycolipids and lipopolysaccharides can exhibit either charge condition neu 1996 charged eps interact with particle surfaces through electrostatic interactions h bonding or ion bridging mainly ca2 philippe and schaumann 2014 cationic amino groups for example sorb to negatively charged basal planes of montmorillonite illite or kaolinite while anionic carboxyl groups and phosphate groups on phospholipids phosphorylated proteins or dna prefer mostly positive fe or al hydr oxide surfaces and phyllosilicate edges or require cation bridges cao et al 2011 gu 1992 hedges and hare 1987 lin et al 2016 xinran liu et al 2013 yeasmin et al 2014 compared to carboxyl rich pedogenic hs negative charge densities of most aquagenic eps are low which eases interactions with mostly negative mineral surfaces buffle et al 1998 and charge heterogeneities within the eps mix or even on single eps molecules e g proteins favor flocculation another relevant property is hydrophobicity philippe and schaumann 2014 most polysaccharides and proteins as well as dna are hydrophilic hydrophobicity increases with increasing acyl groups e g acetyl lactyl succinyl propionyl alkyl groups e g methyl ethyl hydrophobic amine and benzyl groups flemming and wingender 2010 hong et al 2018 neu 1996 sutherland 2001 hydrophobic fractions

not hindered by steric effects luo et al 2018 millour et al 2021 nason et al 2012 some eps are amphiphilic with proteins constituting the major fraction amphiphiles exhibit hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions or moieties e g emulsan a highly acetylated polysaccharide aiding microbe detachment from hydrophobic surfaces phospho glycolipids or lipopolysaccharides neu 1996 and proteins being composed of polar and apolar amino acids kleber et al 2007 hydrophobic interactions let hydrophobic parts of polysaccharidic eps molecules flatten on clay basal planes as modeled for montmorillonite henao and mazeau 2008 while hydrophilic side chains e g carrying charged carboxyl or hydroxyl groups extend and may induce ca2 assisted flocculation henao and mazeau 2008 labille et al 2005 when hydrophilic eps groups adsorb to mineral surface hydroxyl groups e g on clay edges or feox hydrophobic parts are available for hydrophobic interactions with further eps bilayer formation or hydrophobic particle surfaces proteins unfold upon adsorption and exhibit their amphiphilic character conditioning the surface for various further interactions kleber et al 2007 this reveals the importance of structural eps features like molecular weight structural flexibility rigidity and conformation rigid high mw eps have a higher chance to induce ca2 assisted bridging flocculation as they extend from the particle surface into the water where electrostatic forces become negligible a full coating by rigid biopolymers however can prevent flocculation through steric hindrance buffle et al 1998 rigid high mw eps mainly comprise structural biopolymers e g cell wall components and polysaccharidic exudates but also dna buffle et al 1998 polysaccharide primary structures are long molecular chains either branched for most heteropolysaccharides or linear for many homopolysaccharides sutherland 1990 their rigidity depends on the types of linkages between their monomers 1 3 β or 1 4 β linkages confer rigidity e g the cellulosic backbone in xanthan while other linkages may yield more flexible structures e g 1 2 α or 1 6 α linkages in dextran sletmoen et al 2003 sutherland 2001 highly charged eps behave rigid because they strongly bind water sometimes up to 80 buffle et al 1998 some eps can also self assemble in rigid supramolecular structures via 1 h bonding as between hydroxyl or methyl groups 2 electrostatic or cation induced ionic interactions as on carboxyl or sulfate groups 3 molecular chain chain van der waals interactions kunhi mouvenchery et al 2012 sutherland 2001 the most common secondary conformation of polysaccharidic exudates and dna in environmental conditions are rigid double or triple helices yielding long thin fibrous structures in single strands or networks sutherland 2001 with a mw of 104 105 g mol 1 fibrils reach a thickness of a few nm and a length up to the µm range nano sized minerals can attach to fibril segments with favorable characteristics and act as connectors between fibrils yielding large loose flocs buffle et al 1998 polysaccharides can also form gels which can bind particles gelling is favored by carboxyl groups that allow bridging by multivalent cations e g in gellan or alginate increasing acylation in turn renders polysaccharides more hydrophobic which inhibits interactions with ions weakening gels and promoting flexible random coil structures weak gels will not persist in rivers as they dissolve in excess solvent sutherland 2001 flexible polymers often exhibit globular appearance and easily change conformation which lets them flatten on the particle surface and excludes bridging but they may induce aggregation via electrostatic patch formation or charge neutralization and hydrophobic interactions buffle et al 1998 gregory 2005 flexible eps comprise proteins intracellular reserve polysaccharides and aquagenic refractory organic matter i e recalcitrant fragments and recombinations of degradation products of microbial cells buffle et al 1998 3 1 3 colonization favors flocculation and vice versa spm is enriched in eps as evidenced by low c n ratios n rich microbially derived organic matter is highest in

high maximum charge density 6 to 11 meq g 1 humics are larger with lower charge density higher hydrophobicity higher c o and c h ratios but else similar buffle et al 1998 the highly negative charge of hs results from many carboxyl groups which are deprotonated at environmental ph values hs are generally thought to electrostatically stabilize colloids against aggregation as adsorption increases negative charge of mineral surfaces or induces charge reversal of positively charged surfaces buffle et al 1998 reinhardt and wilkinson 2004 srivastava et al 2018 adsorption of low mw hs is

association with negatively charged minerals and nom indeed only 3 8 of the total fe in four river water samples were discrete positively charged feox colloids filtration 1 µm and most fe was associated with spm 1 10 µm and with colloidal 1 µm hs or aluminosilicates hiraide et al 1988b the morphology of feox also plays a role on electron microscopy images of spm feox appear as patchy precipitates rather than uniform coatings on clay mineral basal planes and fill surface pits on coarser aluminosilicates baalousha et al 2019 hirst et al 2017 le meur et al 2016 poulton and raiswell 2005 isolated discrete larger feox are rarely observed hirst et al 2017 le meur et al 2016 poulton and raiswell 2005 however small nano sized spherical particles as related to ferrihydrite davison and de vitre 2019 guo and barnard 2013 are common allard et al 2004 buffle et al 1998 hirst et al 2017 perret et al 2000 poulton and raiswell 2005 tipping et al 1981 those occur in the colloidal fraction associated with nom allard et al 2004 hiraide et al 1988b perret et al 2000 and in the spm fraction as homoaggregates or heteroaggregates with aluminosilicates carbonates sulfates or quartz baalousha et al 2019 buffle et al 1998 hiraide et al 1988a hirst et al 2017 neubauer et al 2013a nomizu et al 1987 moreover hair like fe rich structures were reported le meur et al 2016 as nano sized precipitates or particles attached to other mineral surfaces increase surface heterogeneities the typical feox morphologies support spm floc formation 3 2 1 reactivity of feox surfaces favors aggregation and flocculation processes due to 1 the dominance of labile feox phases and 2 a high density in positively charged surface hydroxyl groups most feox surfaces are highly reactive the transformation of amorphous and poorly crystalline feox into crystalline phases is limited by stabilization through ligation and by relatively short residence times in rivers as compared to soils davison and de vitre 2019 guo and barnard 2013 consequently labile reactive feox phases with a high specific surface area predominate guo and barnard 2013 hirst et al 2017 vindedahl et al 2016 and refs therein labile feox can be stabilized fig 1 by nom and inorganic ligands like silicates or phosphates baalousha et al 2019 cameron and liss 1984 or by precipitation or attachment onto phyllosilicates arias 1995 schwertmann 1988 wei et al 2011 the surface chemistry of feox is governed by hydroxyl groups exhibiting ph dependent variable charge vindedahl et al 2016 and refs therein due to their high points of zero charge feox surfaces are a major contributor of positive surface charge in spm at low doc concentrations positively charged bare feox tend to heteroaggregate with negatively charged minerals like phyllosilicates or quartz fig 1 hiraide et al 1988b tombácz et al 2004 vindedahl et al 2016 composites may exhibit overall negative charge hiraide et al 1988b but attached feox particles just as feox surface precipitates can constitute positively charged patches arias 1995 baalousha et al 2019 hirst et al 2017 le meur et al 2016 poulton and raiswell 2005 that favor further aggregation through surface charge heterogeneities arias 1995 elimelech et al 2000 smith et al 2015 yates et al 2005 nano sized feox particles may distribute on negative surfaces smith et al 2015 and act as adhesives between them tombácz et al 2004 wang et al 2021 whereby size differences allow optimal particle bridging and clustering smith et al 2015 yates et al 2005 feox strongly interact with nom nano sized feox can connect large rigid eps fibrils to loose networks buffle et al 1998 similar to structures observed in natural freshwaters allard et al 2004 hirst et al 2017 perret et al 2000 patchy distributions of nom blebs or smears on mineral surfaces were attributed to underlying feox patches poulton and raiswell 2005 analogously feox patches or nanoparticles sitting on mineral surfaces may be favorable interaction sites for nom induced flocculation fig 1 the major adsorption mechanisms include electrostatic interactions and ligand exchange reactions between feox hydroxyl groups and nom carboxyl groups gu et al 1995 due to a higher hydroxyl group density feox adsorb nom more strongly than aluminosilicates kaolinite or quartz hiraide et al 1988a meier et al 1999 moreover nom exhibits a higher affinity for fe oh and al oh groups than for si oh meier et al 1999 tombácz et al 2004 vázquez ortega et al 2014 adsorption of nom to feox can affect the quality of nom as feox catalyze abiotic fenton reactions and thus oxidation and degradation of nom to more refractory and carboxyl rich nom types which feeds back on flocculation processes however biotic or biotically mediated transformation of nom is typically more prominent yu and kuzyakov 2021 the high density of positive hydroxyl groups allows feox to induce aggregation even in the presence of highly negative hs baalousha et al 2008 mylon et al 2004 low concentrations of which suffice to fully stabilize phyllosilicates kretzschmar et al 1998 tarchitzky et al 1993 governed by the degree of feox surface covered aggregation occurs when patchy hs coverage induces surface charge heterogeneities or when increased coverage yields charge neutralization at very high hs concentrations charge reversal results in electrostatic stabilization baalousha 2009 tombácz et al 2004 vindedahl et al 2016 stabilization yields negatively charged humic feox colloids hiraide et al 1988b tipping et al 1981 tipping and heaton 1983 fig 1 aggregation by hs proceeds slowly and yields small compact aggregate structures baalousha et al 2008 buffle et al 1998 mylon et al 2004 tipping et al 1981 slow aggregation driven by feox can thus explain smaller and more compact spm aggregate structures observed in winter when hs are the dominant nom source fig 1 3 2 2 feox precipitation and morphology are governed by heterogeneous oxidation autochthonous feox form when waters rich in dissolved fe get supersaturated upon hydrochemical transitions guo and barnard 2013 generally abiotic oxidation dominates over biotic or biotically mediated oxidation baken et al 2013 bullen et al 2001 davison and de vitre 2019 the latter proceeds in floc microenvironments or sediment redox transitions where at low ph biota may outcompete abiotic oxidation davison and de vitre 2019 high amounts of feox form when 1 anoxic fe ii rich groundwaters or soil porewaters discharge into oxic rivers allard et al 2011 baken et al 2013 bullen et al 2001 or 2 waters rich in nom complexed fe iii e g draining wetlands or forest areas mix with higher ph low doc waters allard et al 2011 hirst et al 2017 neubauer et al 2013a fig 3 inflowing anoxic waters supply dissolved fe ii which quickly oxidizes hydrolyzes and precipitates bullen et al 2001 van der grift et al 2014 and refs therein at low ph and high doc fe ii oxidation is slow and fe iii is strongly complexed by nom suppressing precipitation allard et al 2011 karlsson and persson 2012 neubauer et al 2013a van der grift et al 2014 doc decrease and ph increase however induce hydrolysis and precipitation fig 3 neubauer et al 2013a 2013b season and discharge can control the source of dissolved fe soil derived fe iii nom complexes increase after rain events guan et al 2015 herzog et al 2020 ingri et al 2006 and contributions of fe ii rich groundwater can increase at winter baseflow when slower oxidation at lower temperatures favors extension of the redox cline into the surface water ingri et al 2006 van der grift et al 2014 the dominance of nano sized feox and patchy coatings results from heterogeneous oxidation teutsch et al 2005 which involves adsorption of fe ii subsequent oxidation creates an unstable fe iii surface complex which hydrolyzes and precipitates when anoxic groundwater enters a river anoxia extends into the hyporheic zone baken et al 2013 ingri et al 2006 teutsch et al 2005 van der grift et al 2014 supplying fe ii to the sediments where it sorbs to minerals and nom fig 3 similarely microbial reduction in organic rich anoxic sediment layers generates fe ii which diffuses and adsorbs to surface sediments in most rivers and oligotrophic lakes reducing conditions start below the sediment surface in eutrophic systems or stratified lakes anoxia may extend into the water davison and de vitre 2019 where suspended minerals and nom offer further adsorption sites when the groundwater table drops or surface sediments get resuspended adsorbed fe ii is oxidized and precipitates gerhardt and schink 2005 some oxidation even proceeds under anoxic conditions as catalyzed by the sorbate e g nom daugherty et al 2017 or phyllosilicates van groeningen et al 2020 or by microorganisms bryce et al 2018 the affinity of dissolevd fe for al oh groups and nom favors feox patches on aluminosilicates baalousha et al 2019 hirst et al 2017 le meur et al 2016 poulton and raiswell 2005 and organic rich feox colloids buffle et al 1989 hiraide et al 1988b perret et al 2000 tipping et al 1981 fig 3 the morphology and surface properties of the latter are influenced by the nom type fe c ratios inorganic ligands and ionic strength ahmad et al 2020 cismasu et al 2011 liao et al 2017 mikutta et al 2014 perret et al 2000 feox granules 10 50 nm on eps networks benedetti et al 2003 hirst et al 2017 perret et al 2000 may nucleate at low fe c and high ionic strength when fe cannot fully coat eps as other ions compete for complexation perret et

2000 nucleation of feox on clay attached nom provides an alternative explanation for feox granules 10 20 nm seaming clay edges attached via nom poulton and raiswell 2005 which the authors attributed to aggregation of nom coated feox with positively charged clay edges larger 100 500 nm c rich feox globules buffle et al 1989 mavrocordatos et al 2000 perret et al 2000 tipping et al 1981 were related to hs type nom a high fe c ratio and low ionic strength perret et al 2000 they result from co precipitatation with nom guénet et al 2017 mikutta et al 2014 neubauer et al 2013b and subsequent homoaggregation of 10 nm ferrihydrite fig 3 cismasu et al 2011 fortin et al 1993 hirst et al 2017 von gunten and schneider 1991 incorporation of hs or negatively charged inorganic ligands e g silicates phosphates can lower the point of zero charge or even impose negative charge to feox liao et al 2017 mikutta et al 2014 saleh and jones 1984 affecting their reactivity and aggregation behavior liao et al 2017 von gunten and schneider 1991 the same is true for the adsorption of so4 2 walsch and dultz 2010 3 3 phyllosilicates are a major substrate for floc formation processes being one of the most abundant spm constituents phyllosilicates constitute the scaffold for floc formation processes fig 1 five interaction mechanisms can be discerned fig 4 in which phyllosilicates play a key role through intrinsic surface heterogeneities and a high affinity for nom as a preferential substrate for reactive feox coatings and as substrate for microbial growth 3 3 1 phyllosilicate surface heterogeneities favor aggregation and eps flocculation at the edges or surface defects phyllosilicates carry reactive surface hydroxyl groups mostly si oh and al oh but also some mg oh those exhibit ph dependent variable surface charge while unimpaired basal planes exhibit permanent negative charge due to isomorphic substitution of si4 with al3 and fe3 or of al3 with mg2 and fe2 in the crystal lattice preocanin et al 2016 zero charge conditions for phyllosilicate edges were reported at ph 7 5 for chlorite kaolinite talc muscovite kosmulski 2001 yin et al 2013 a higher density of mg oh and al oh groups at the edges favors positive edge charge as they are more easily protonated than si oh xiandong liu et al 2013 tournassat et al 2016 yin et al 2013 the intrinsic surface charge heterogeneities of phyllosilicates favor edge to face aggregation fig 4 especially at lower ph when edge group protonation is more pronounced a close correlation of the organic c content in spm with al contents and specific surface area poulton and raiswell 2005 indicates interactions of nom with phyllosilicates phyllosilicate hydroxyl groups are prone to adsorb nom negatively charged low mw hs coat positive edge groups and stabilize phyllosilicates kretzschmar et al 1998 tarchitzky et al 1993 while eps typically induce flocculation labille et al 2005 lee et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 due to their heterogeneous properties phyllosilicates preferentially interact with similarly diverse eps surface charge heterogeneity allows electrostatic interactions of anionic nom groups e g carboxyl or phosphate with phyllosilicate edges and of cationic amino groups with phyllosilicate basal planes cao et al 2011 hedges and hare 1987 lin et al 2016 yeasmin et al 2014 since the basal planes exhibit increasing hydrophobicity with lower degrees of isomorphic substitution e g montmorillonite illite kaolinite talc while the edges are usually hydrophilic yin 2012 hydrophobic interactions with nom occur on basal planes henao and mazeau 2008 the high specific surface area and cation exchange capacity of phyllosilicates additionally supports weaker nom interactions like h bonding at lower ph and cation bridging in the presence of divalent cations mainly ca2 cao et al 2011 philippe and schaumann 2014 3 3 2 phyllosilicates are a preferential substrate for reactive feox coatings the visual evidence of frequent feox coatings on aluminosilicates mentioned earlier is supported by positive correlations of reactive fe contents with al contents with decreasing spm constituent particle size and with increasing specific surface area markussen et al 2016 poulton and raiswell 2005 aluminosilicates constitute a preferential substrate for a patchy precipitation or attachment of feox and support formation and persistence of labile reactive feox feox patches yield surface charge heterogeneities and reactivity enhances nom interactions favoring incorporation of feox carrying aluminosilicates into spm ligation by reactive mineral surface groups can catalyze oxidation of adsorbed fe ii by water géhin et al 2007 van groeningen et al 2020 allowing for oxidative precipitation of adsorbed fe ii even below saturation and under strictly anoxic conditions géhin et al 2007 mikutta et al 2009 van groeningen et al 2020 al oh or mg oh groups at edges or surface defects of phyllosilicates e g montmorillonite constitute such catalysts géhin et al 2007 due to a limited availability of these sites low fe ii surface loadings yielded higher oxidized fe iii fractions than high loadings van groeningen et al 2020 aluminosilicate surface pits filled by feox provide visual evidence poulton and raiswell 2005 below saturation precipitation of feox in anoxic conditions also occurred on al and fe oxides goethite but not on quartz and a stronger adsorption of fe ii suggests a higher affinity for al oh and fe oh than si oh mikutta et al 2009 as phyllosilicates are way more abundant than metal hydr oxides they will be the relevant substrates for surface catalyzed feox precipitation but feox patches themselves may facilitate further precipitation attachment of feox to phyllosilicates behaves similarly as indicated by ferrihydrite granules sitting in surface defects of montmorillonite after mixing yan et al 2021 electrostatic interactions favor attachment of feox ferrihydrite to phyllosilicate basal planes at low to circumneutral ph yong and ohtsubo 1987 only high loadings yielded a full coating else ferrihydrite distributed in patches of particles or aggregates centered around certain kaolinite surface sites jones and saleh 1987 again specific interactions with high affinity sites can be concluded as shown for feox surface precipitates on kaolinite arias 1995 wei et al 2011 as well as for ferrihydrite particles being mixed with different clay minerals schwertmann 1988 phyllosilicates as opposed to quartz increase liability reactivity and specific surface area of feox and inhibit or slow their crystallization the authors hypothesized that 1 dissolved si or al released from phyllosilicates inhibits or retards feox crystallization 2 reactive clay surfaces hamper feox crystallization more than silicates in line with the above 3 the cementing action between phyllosilicates and amorphous feox inhibits dissolution precipitation reactions and structural rearrangement of feox into crystalline forms arias 1995 schwertmann 1988 wei et al 2011 3 3 3 phyllosilicates support microbial nutrition due to their high specific surface areas and ion exchange capacities phyllosilicates adsorb nutrients and organic substrates supporting microbial growth cuadros 2017 henning et al 2001 liss et al 1996 phyllosilicates offer hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces easing microbe attachment and microbes exude eps to attach and access nutrients fostering typical organo mineral aggregates cuadros 2017 3d nanotomography imaging of riverine spm shows complex porous structures of clay minerals and few larger grains being colonized by microorganisms wheatland et al 2017 so called house of cards structures are actively constructed from phyllosilicates eps and some feox constituting the microbial minimal nutritional sphere lunsdorf et al 2000 in this context phyllosilicates are also thought to eliminate harmful waste products by adsorption microbes prefer nutrient rich e g smectite and easily leachable clays montmorillonite benefitted microbial activity more than kaolinite as probably related to their adsorption capacity cuadros 2017 and refs therein moreover microbes can mediate precipitation of low crystallinity si al fe containing clay minerals functional groups on cell walls and eps negative carboxyl hydroxyl phosphoryl and positive amino groups thereby provide sorption and nucleation sites a detailed review of these and other microbe mineral interactions e g transformation weathering dissolution leaching of clays is given in cuadros 2017 4 conclusion analyzing the scientific wealth of more than 220 publications from several decades of research and various scientific disciplines it could be shown that freshwater floc formation processes and structural dynamics involve three key components phyllosilicates feox and nom eps associations of these components constitute a fertile base spm type present throughout the year even at low temperatures during rain events spm flocs are diluted by eroded minerals which upon recovery of bioproduction are flocculated by dissolved eps to form fresh spm base units with increasing temperatures and microbial growth spm is colonized and flocculated to large fluffy eps rich flocs microhabitats which provide multiple crucial services to the global element cycles phyllosilicates feox and eps contribute to an overall heterogeneity in physicochemical surface properties which favors their association to complex flocs or aggregates other materials are rather inert e g quartz or play similar roles but are less abundant like mn or al oxides oxy hydroxides 4 1 flocculating eps counteract stabilizing hs eps as opposed to hs promote heterogeneity in physicochemical surface properties upon adsorption they comprise substances spanning a wide range of molecular weights various degrees of rigidity and hydrophobicity and diverse functional groups and charge densities heterogeneity favors eps induced flocculation through multivalent ion assisted bridging by large rigid eps charge heterogeneities within coatings through fractionated sorption or patchy coatings charge neutralization allowing predominance of weak interaction forces such as van der waals and hydrophobic forces highly degraded hs are more homogeneous regarding flocculation relevant properties they mainly comprise low mw fulvic and to a lesser extent high mw humic acids exhibiting high densities in negatively charged carboxyl groups which yield homogeneous highly negative coatings that electrostatically stabilize minerals against flocculation due to their antagonistic roles flocculation or stabilization depend on the relative concentrations of hs and eps 4 2 phyllosilicates constitute the base for spm floc formation phyllosilicates dominate the mineral mass fraction in spm due to their heterogeneous surface properties they provide the base for feox and eps enhanced floc formation processes both fe and organic c contents in spm are closely correlated to phyllosilicates phyllosilicates exhibit intrinsic surface charge heterogeneities with structural permanent negative charge on the basal planes and ph dependent variable charge at the edges and surface defects edges are hydrophilic while basal planes are more hydrophobic and edges as well as surface pits exhibit increased densities of reactive hydroxyl groups these properties allow phyllosilicates to undergo electrostatic edge to face aggregation to interact with nom preferentially eps and to act as preferential substrate for feox attachment or surface precipitation 4 3 feox increase surface charge heterogeneities and reactivity of phyllosilicates interactions between feox and phyllosilicates increase phyllosilicate surface charge heterogeneity and feox reactivity favoring flocculation attachment or precipitation of feox yields patchy coatings on phyllosilicates since dissolved fe as well as feox particles are preferentially ligated by surface pit or edge hydroxyl groups additionally bare feox can electrostatically interact with phyllosilicate basal planes due to mostly positive surface charge at circumneutral ph association with phyllosilicates stabilizes labile feox phases against crystallization keeping them reactive and their specific surface area high consequently feox carrying phyllosilicates enhance flocculation through surface charge heterogeneities arising from patchy distributions of feox precipitates or granules through a phyllosilicate mediated increased reactivity of feox favoring interactions with nom and mineral surfaces 4 4 nom strongly interacts with both feox and phyllosilicates phyllosilicates and feox strongly adsorb nom whereby eps are preferentially adsorbed negatively charged and hydrophobic phyllosilicate basal planes preferentially adsorb cationic amino groups on basic amino acids and hydrophobic parts e g acyl groups feox and clay edges strongly interact with anionic carboxyl groups on polysaccharides acidic amino acids or hs and phosphate groups on phospholipids phosphorylated proteins or nucleic acids preferential adsorption of eps on feox and phyllosilicates supports flocculation mechanisms involving eps at high concentrations of hs however the affinity of hs carboxyl groups for hydroxyl groups on feox and phyllosilicate edges yields full coating and electrostatic stabilization due to their high hydroxyl group density feox can still allow for some degree of flocculation at elevated hs concentrations the high affinity between nom and fe can induce co precipitation whereby nom type and concentration impact morphology and reactivity of feox precipitates fully fe coated eps yield elongated fibrous feox while at lower fe eps ratios nano sized feox granules nucleate on eps hs promote globular co precipitates with negative surface charge due to the high density of carboxyl groups in hs 4 5 phyllosilicate feox nom associations form a fertile base floc unit favorable interactions between the single components entail association of all three components to a fertile base floc unit processes favoring phyllosilicate feox nom associations include small feox granules connecting nom or phyllosilicate attached nom feox precipitates nucleating directly on phyllosilicate attached nom reactive feox precipitates granules on phyllosilicates favoring nom interactions nom coated feox attaching to phyllosilicate edges phyllosilicate feox nom associations are a favorable substrate for microbial colonization they pool essential inorganic nutrients and organic substrates as their high specific surface area and cation exchange capacity favor adsorption microbial colonization and biofilm formation triggers flocculation through eps release at different stages adhesive eps aid attachment attached microbes exude ligands or enzymatic eps to access nutrients and when the substrate becomes refractory starvation induces further eps release additionally dissolved eps preferentially interact with feox and phyllosilicates and flocculate new phyllosilicate feox nom associations that provide fresh substrate for microbial colonization 4 6 flocculation in rivers is favored by eps and feox large fluffy flocs form at times of high bioproduction when eps release is high and colonization and active biofilm formation accelerates eps release and flocculation a loose floc structure is supported by high contents of fibril or network like organic eps generated by colonizing bacteria and microalgae at low temperatures or after rain events high fractions of soil leached hs decrease the flocculation potential of river waters small compact aggregate like spm sometimes inhabited by few bacteria and single mineral grains are dominant feox may induce slow formation of compact aggregates despite elevated hs concentrations the content of labile reactive feox is positively related to spm floc size as they constitute aggregating and cementing agents as well as an essential fe source to microbes authigenic feox formation also exhibits seasonal fluctuations depending on the dominant fe source at winter baseflow higher shares of fe ii rich anoxic groundwater may increase precipitation while soil derived fe nom complexes increase after rain events 4 7 riverine spm dynamics are in a feedback loop with global processes spm is an important part of many biogeochemical cycles and provides multiple ecosystem services it functions as habitat and feed as bioreactor involved in element cycling impacting aquatic food chains up to climate change and as transport vehicle for nutrients and pollutants affecting freshwaters sediments inundation zones and the ocean in the light of climate change 1 rising temperatures and 2 higher frequencies of extreme events will modify riverine spm dynamics which feed back into global change increasing temperatures stimulate bioproduction even in climatic regions where it was negligible before e g periglacial waters rich in elemental nutrients may constitute favorable grounds for a microbial conquest increasing bioproduction implies more eps release fueling flocculation but also quicker turnover of substrates and probably faster nutrient limitation which may coincide with lower resupply of nutrients by soil leachate and erosion due to an expansion of dry periods microbial blooms and consequent starvation likely increase deposited spm amounts with sedimentation being facilitated by low shear forces during dry periods which may increase interim carbon storage in lake or river sediments however reduced mixing at low discharge may as well foster anoxia and methanogenesis with consequences on aquatic life and greenhouse gas emissions an extension of the redox cline into the water column potentially favors feox formation as oxidation rates increase with temperature similarly the significance of anoxic groundwater contributions to discharge may increase during extended dry periods and with it fe ii supply this may yield more feox formation during the warm season whereas during the cold season an absence of frost i e higher runoff contribution to discharge and warmer temperatures may reduce fe ii based feox formation enhanced weathering of soils together with more intense rain events however may entail more release of fe iii nom complexes as well as secondary minerals phyllosilicates into the rivers frequent storm events in turn counteract carbon storage in freshwater sediments as intense flushes will clear riverbeds which likely yields a higher transfer of organic rich spm to inundation zones and the oceans additionally soil erosion as promoted by extended droughts will enhance sediment yields during storms contributing to an increased discharge of suspended load into the oceans in estuaries salinity as well as nutrient fueled bioproduction will enhance flocculation and sedimentation likely making the oceans even more important carbon sinks these are just a few approaches on how freshwater spm dynamics could feed back into global processes as converse processes exist further research on how climate change impacts on riverine eps feox and phyllosilicate budgets is required to establish spm mass and carbon balances that allow to assess the net effects on global
