4645,profile soil moisture psm which represents soil moisture content over the whole soil layer depth is a key variable to control plant growth biological interactions and streamflow generation and its information plays a crucial role in hydrological analysis and agricultural water management recent studies have assimilated multi source satellite psm information into hydrological modelling to more accurately estimate real psm however the psm estimated from these studies are normally at coarse spatial resolution i e larger than 25 25 km2 in this study the high resolution 1 1 km2 psm are generated by assimilating multiple remote sensed psm data of coarse resolution into the digital elevation model dem based distributed rainfall runoff model ddrm in three catchments two humid catchments and one semiarid catchment in china with the grid scale of 1 1 km2 the remote sensed psm data are pre processed from two remote sensed surface soil moisture datasets i e the multi satellite retrieved soil moisture dataset released by the europe space agency climate change initiative esa cci and the soil moisture product from the soil moisture active passive smap satellite the influence of remote sensed datasets selection schemes i e only esa cci only smap and esa cci and smap combined on assimilation results are investigated in the assimilation process two updating schemes are considered one is to only update the ddrm s state variable i e psm and the other updating both the parameters and psm variable of the ddrm thus six assimilation scenarios are set in the study whose performances are compared with the ddrm without assimilation for different time periods including the whole period the dormant period and the growing period results indicate that in any periods for any of remote sensed datasets used for assimilation either the state update or the parameter state update can improve the accuracy of high resolution 1 1 km2 psm simulations by the ddrm besides assimilating the smap psm dataset into the ddrm has the potential to improve streamflow simulations for the three catchments this study has shown that by assimilating multi source remote sensed psm into a high spatial resolution distributed hydrological model i e ddrm estimation of psm can be improved over both the original remote sensed psm and the ddrm simulated psm keywords profile soil moisture distributed rainfall runoff model data assimilation parameter state update 1 introduction soil moisture is one of the most important components in hydrological cycle and agricultural management as it controls the available water and energy exchange among the atmosphere hydrosphere and biosphere wang et al 2011 hoerling et al 2014 yuan et al 2015 it can be observed at different depths of the soil layer van loon and laaha 2015 roudier et al 2016 surface soil moisture ssm generally represents the soil moisture content only at the top 0 10 cm of the soil it has been extensively studied at different temporal and spatial scales since the development of satellite skills and retrieval algorithms over the decades provides various surface soil moisture products van loon 2015 an et al 2016 spennemann et al 2015 barker et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 profile soil moisture psm represents the soil moisture content of the whole soil layer including surface and sub surface soil moisture it is the key variable in hydrological studies and agricultural water management since it controls major process related to plant growth biological interactions and streamflow generation dracup et al 1980 wilhite and glantz 1985 mishra and singh 2010 huang et al 2014 liu et al 2019 thus it is necessary to pay more attention to psm studies traditionally the psm information is acquired from ground measurements or estimated through hydrological modelling van loon 2015 ground measurements are the most accurate records but are costly with small coverage areas and short time span and are mostly discontinuous wang et al 2011 besides the spotty pattern of ground measurements leads to the poor representativeness of areal soil moisture information an et al 2016 liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a 2019b comparing to ground measurements hydrological models have the ability to provide consistent long term psm simulations at various temporal and spatial scales lumped and semi distributed hydrological models can provide hourly or daily psm simulations at catchment and sub catchment scales and dem digital elevation model based distributed hydrological model can provide hourly or daily psm simulations at grid scales xiong et al 2018 yang et al 2019 however the accuracy of psm simulations in these models is limited by uncertainties in input meteorological data normally precipitation and evapotranspiration model parameters and model structures jin et al 2010 brigode et al 2013 thus psm estimated from hydrological models are usually biased they are insufficient to provide optimal psm information apart from ground measurements and hydrological model simulations psm information can also be obtained from the remote sensed surface soil moisture ssm products since there is inherent relationship between ssm and psm parajka et al 2009 xiong et al 2018 for instance the exponential filter proposed by wagner et al 1999 is used to acquire psm information from ssm data based on the assumption that the temporal variation of psm is linearly related to the difference between ssm and psm the remote sensed ssm products are nearly globally available and continuous in time having advantages in capturing spatial distribution and temporal dynamics liu et al 2019 however they are normally at a low spatial resolution most are larger than 25 25 km2 and their accuracy has been suspicious since ssm information acquired from satellites can be affected by the satellite designs the retrieval algorithms the vegetation and the topography xiong et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 liu et al 2019 besides there are large uncertainties during the simple transformation from ssm to psm thus there are also bias in psm directly acquired from the satellites ssm products recently in order to estimate more accurate psm remote sensed soil moisture products have been utilized in hydrological modelling by multi objective calibration or data assimilation chakrabarti et al 2014 kumar et al 2014 yan et al 2018 for instance parajka et al 2009 calibrated a conceptual dual layer hydrological model by both ers scatterometer based soil moisture and streamflow yang et al 2019 transformed remote sensed ssm to psm and using psm information and observed streamflow to calibrate a distributed hydrological model in these multi objective calibration studies whether it is reasonable to use the biased remote sensed data as the calibration objective remains controversial more studies choose data assimilation to merge remote sensed information with model simulations chen et al 2014 kumar et al 2014 yan et al 2018 blyverket et al 2019 nair and indu 2019 these studies show the potential of remote sensed information in improving performances of psm simulations of hydrological models previous studies generally estimate psm at coarse spatial resolutions i e larger than 25 25 km2 blyverket et al 2019 nair and indu 2019 zhang et al 2019a 2019b these psm simulations are too coarse to support local divisional hydrological analysis and agricultural water management among a catchment naz et al 2019 has provided soil moisture at 3 km over europe using land surface data assimilation this study aims to improve the accuracy of psm simulations at a higher resolution 1 1 km2 by assimilating multiple remote sensed soil moisture datasets into the digital elevation model dem based distributed rainfall runoff model ddrm which is developed by xiong et al 2004 with the grid scale of 1 1 km2 in three catchments two humid catchments and one semiarid catchment in china two remote sensed datasets are considered including ssm products from the europe space agency climate change initiative esa cci and the soil moisture active passive smap satellite in the choice of remote sensed datasets three different inputs i e only esa cci only smap and esa cci and smap combined are assimilated respectively into the ddrm in the assimilation process the influence of selecting updating schemes i e only update the ddrm s state variable psm and update both the parameters and psm variable of ddrm on assimilation results are investigated overall this study sets six assimilation scenarios in the remaining of the study study area and datasets are presented in the section 2 followed by the methodology of assimilating the remote sensed soil moisture information into the ddrm in section 3 section 4 assesses the performances of the six assimilation scenarios by comparing them with the ddrm without assimilation finally section 5 makes conclusions 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area three catchments including two humid catchments i e the upper xijiang uxj catchment the sub catchment of the zhu river basin and the qujiang qj catchment the sub catchment of the yangtze river basin and a semiarid catchment i e the yiluohe ylh catchment the sub catchment of the yellow river basin are chosen in this study fig 1 the two humid catchments are both characterized by the subtropical monsoon climate the uxj catchment is located in the upper reaches of the zhu river with a drainage area of 41715 km2 its elevation increases from southeast to northwest ranging from 664 to 2741 m a s l in this catchment the most area is covered by the forest land with relatively low temperature the annual precipitation ranges from 1200 to 1700 mm its outlet hydrological station is the tianyi station at which the mean annual runoff is 32 billion m3 it is nearly 10 of the xijiang s total discharge the qujiang qj catchment is located in the upper and middle reaches of the yangtze river with a drainage area of 39211 km2 its elevation increases from southwest to northeast ranging from 128 to 2 684 m a s l in this catchment the northern forest land has the low temperature and the large proportion of precipitation while the southern plateau covered mostly by cultivated and dry land has moderate temperature its annual precipitation is around 1200 mm the hydrological station at the qujiang catchment outlet is the luoduxi station at which the mean annual runoff is about 23 billion m3 is about the 30 jialing river s total discharge the yiluohe ylh catchment is located in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river with the drainage area of 18560 km2 it is characterized by the continental monsoon climate with the annual precipitation around 500 mm to 700 mm the elevation of this catchment increases from southwest to northeast ranging from 154 m a s l to 2387 m a s l in the ylh catchment the western mountain area is covered by the vegetation and the eastern plateau is covered by the loess the hydrological station at this catchment outlet is the heishiguan station whose mean annual runoff is around 15 billion m3 2 2 hydro meteorological data precipitation and mean temperature data from meteorological stations as shown in fig 1 are used as the input hydro meteorological data for the ddrm and streamflow data from the outlet hydrological station for each catchment are used for calibration and validation for the ddrm considering the availability of the data the study period is 2013 2017 among which the data of 2013 are used for warming up the model the data from 2014 to 2015 are used for calibration and the data from 2016 to 2017 are used for the ddrm modelling with or without assimilation according to the different climate characteristics of the two humid catchments and the one semiarid catchment the dormant period and the growing period of the uxj and the qj catchments are set to be april to september and october to march respectively while those of the ylh catchment are set to be june to november and december to may the potential evapotranspiration for both catchments are calculated by the blaney criddle method with the mean temperature data hargreaves and samani 1982 to match the 1 1 km2 grid of the ddrm the inverse distance weighted idw method is used to interpolate the input data for the distributed model tomczak 1998 2 3 remote sensed soil moisture data two remote sensed surface soil moisture ssm products are selected to be assimilated into the ddrm one is acquired from the european space agency climate change initiative esa cci the version 04 4 of esa cci soil moisture product released on november 2018 consists of three ssm datasets including the active dataset blending advanced microwave instrument ami and advanced scatterometer ascat metop a and metop b the passive dataset blending scanning multichannel microwave radiometer smmr special sensor microwave imager ssm i tropical rainfall measure mission microwave imager tmi advanced microwave scanning radiometer for earth observing system amsr e windsat advanced microwave scanning radiometer amsr2 and the soil moisture ocean salinity smos and the combined dataset blending all ten satellite products mentioned above liu et al 2011 dorigo et al 2017 all these three datasets have a spatial resolution of nearly 25 25 km2 within a measuring depth of 10 cm the active dataset provides daily global surface saturation degree from 1991 to 2018 and the passive and combined datasets provide daily global surface volumetric soil moisture m3m 3 from 1978 to 2018 the combined dataset of esa cci has been validated in china and results showed its error is within a reasonable range an et al 2016 in this study the combined dataset of esa cci soil moisture product is chosen for the assimilation although the combined dataset of esa cci soil moisture product merges active and passive soil moisture information the newly remote sensed ssm dataset from the national aeronautics and space administration s nasa soil moisture active passive smap mission has not been included this satellite initially designed to provide a combined dataset of a 1 41 ghz l band passive radiometer and a 1 26 ghz l band active radar entekhabi et al 2010 unfortunately the active broke down in 2015 the smap level 3 l3 product provides global ssm dataset spl3smp e in m3m 3 within a measuring depth of about 5 cm and it is available in the national snow and ice data center nsidc it covers the period after april 2015 the spatial resolution of this dataset is 9 9 km2 this smap soil moisture dataset has been validated in southwestern china and results show that it has the potential to be utilized in hydrology agriculture and ecology in china sun et al 2017 xiong et al 2018 yang et al 2019 in this study this smap product is chosen for the assimilation 3 methodology in this study two remote sensed soil moisture datasets esa cci and smap are assimilated into the distributed hydrological model ddrm to improve the accuracy of high resolution 1 1 km2 profile soil moisture psm simulations by ddrm in this section the distributed model ddrm is first described followed by the data assimilation method ensemble kalman filter enkf and details of assimilation implementation then the pre processing for remote sensed data is described experimental design and performance assessment of assimilation are shown in the last 3 1 the dem based distributed rainfall runoff model ddrm in this study the dem based distributed rainfall runoff model ddrm is applied to simulate profile soil moisture psm this model is a conceptual distributed model developed by xiong et al 2004 and has been widely used in the southern china for streamflow and psm simulations and predictions xiong et al 2007 2018 long et al 2012 yang et al 2019 in the ddrm dem grids are the basic simulation units for the psm simulations in this study the scale of dem grids in the ddrm is 1 1 km2 in each dem grid i as shown in fig 2 a the simulation of s i is under the saturation excess runoff generation mechanism which assumes the water infiltrated or percolated to soil profile is redistributed with gridded soil moisture storage capacity sm c i as a threshold from fig 2 a it can be seen that where the soil is unsaturated s i s m c i s i is updated and there is no excess rainfall where the soil is saturated excess rainfall is generated in the ddrm sm c i is linked to the grid topographic index after the excess rainfall generation the ddrm routes excess rainfall in each grid from upstream to the sub catchment outlet and furtherly to the outlet of the whole catchment to get the streamflow values as shown in fig 2 b the muskingum method is used for the routing there are 11 model parameters for the ddrm including 7 saturation excess runoff generation parameters sm a b s 0 n t s t p and 4 routing parameters c 0 c 1 h c 0 h c 1 details of these parameters can be found in xiong et al 2018 and yang et al 2019 according to the sensitivity analysis of parameters in yang et al 2019 range of water storage capacity across the catchment sm proportion of residual groundwater in soil water storage capacity a and empirical parameter b that reflecting the characteristic of ground outflow are sensitive to psm simulations the vector of these three sensitive parameters is shown as θ s m a b in the study the vector of other non sensitive ddrm parameters to psm is shown as φ thus the vector ξ of all the ddrm parameters is composed of all the elements in θ and φ this study chooses the sensitive parameter vector θ to be updated by the remote sensed information at each time step shown as θ t s m t a t b t while the non sensitive parameter vector φ is not updated both sensitive and non sensitive parameters are initially acquired by calibration before the assimilation for all catchments model parameters are calibrated in the calibration period 2014 2015 to match the observed streamflow and the objective function is the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse which is the most widely used performance criteria for model calibration the calibrated parameter values for the uxj catchment the qj catchment and the ylh catchment are shown in table 1 it can be seen that values of some parameters are quite different in these three catchments there are three reasons for that the first reason is that the catchment characteristics are different for the three catchments leading to different parameter values for different catchments for instance most areas of the middle and lower reaches in the uxj catchment and the qj catchment are covered by the vegetation but those in the ylh catchment are covered by loess the second reason is that despite the ddrm is a distributed hydrological model rather than a lumped model its model parameters still cannot be regarded as fully physically based thirdly just like any other hydrological models there still exist uncertainties in the structure and parameters of the ddrm thus resulting in the equifinality phenomenon in calibrating model parameters beven 2006 since s i and sm c i represent moisture depth given in mm which cannot be compared directly to remote sensed data the model simulated psm given in saturation degree at time t is calculated as 1 ps m i t s i t sm c i 3 2 the ensemble kalman filter enkf the ensemble kalman filter enkf is selected in this study for data assimilation burgers et al 1998 evensen 2003 wikle and berliner 2007 this algorithm has been widely used to assimilate remote sensed data into hydrological models and proven relatively efficient and robust loizu et al 2018 blyverket et al 2019 naz et al 2019 in this study the parameters and states obtained by the hydrological model ddrm are denoted by the superscript m while remote sensed data are denoted by the superscript r and the updated parameters and states by merging model simulated and remote sensed information are represented by the superscript mr since the enkf utilizes model simulated ensembles to approximate the error of model state and parameters the second superscript j j 1 2 j is used to indicate one of the ensemble members generally parameter state vector x t m j x 1 t m j x 2 t m j x m t m j of the hydrological model for each ensemble member j j 1 2 j where x 1 t m j x 2 t m j x m t m j can be parameters and states is acquired as 2 x t m j g x t 1 mr j ς t 1 j it indicates that parameter state vector x t m j r m 1 at time t is acquired by the function g with updated parameter state vector x t 1 mr j r m 1 at the last time step t 1 and auxiliary data at the same time the observation vector y t r y 1 t r y 2 t r y n t r from the remote sensing is perturbed to obtain 3 y t r j y t r ψ t r j where ψ t r j r n 1 is the random realization of the distribution that the error of y t r r n 1 obeys to update the parameter state vector x t m j 4 x t mr j x t m j k t y t r j h t x t m j where x t mr j r m 1 is the updated result and h t is the nonlinear observation operator which is used to map the x t m j r m 1 to observation space thus h x t m j r n 1 is the model simulation correspond to the observation variable y t r j r n 1 the kalman gain k t r m n is expressed as 5 k t p t h t t h t p t h t t o t 1 among which p t r m m is the prior error covariance matrix of the parameter state vector h t r n m is the jacobian of the observation operator h t and o t r n n is the error covariance matrix of the observation vector at time t in practice the need for the explicit calculation of p t and h t for nonlinear observation systems can be bypassed based on the ensemble statistics 6 p t h t t 1 j 1 j 1 j x t m j x t m j h x t m j h x t m j t 7 h t p t h t t 1 j 1 j 1 j h x t m j h x t m j h x t m j h x t m j t 8 o t 1 j 1 j 1 j ψ t r j ψ t r j t where x t m j and h x t m j are the matrix of ensemble averages for instance 9 x t m j 1 j j 1 j x 1 t m j 1 j j 1 j x 2 t m j 1 j j 1 j x m t m j 3 3 assimilation implementation in practice of this study there are two specific steps for the data assimilation including i step 1 acquisition of model simulated and remote sensed psm ensemble at time t ii step 2 the parameter state update by enkf with remote sensed data after the update repeat steps 1 and 2 for the next time period t 1 using updated sensitive parameter vector and psm from step 2 at time t the flowchart of the assimilation steps is provided in fig 3 in this section step 1 is detailed described in 3 3 1 and step 2 is detailed described in 3 3 2 3 3 1 acquisition of model simulated and remote sensed profile soil moisture psm ensemble the step 1 is furthered divided into two steps including i step 1 1 the acquisition of the model simulated psm ensemble and ii step 1 2 the acquisition of the remote sensed psm ensemble in the step 1 1 as shown in fig 3 the sensitive parameter vector ensemble θ t m j s m t m j a t m j b t m j to psm is firstly acquired as 10 θ t m j g perturb θ t 1 mr j δ t 1 j θ t 1 mr j δ t 1 j in this case x t m j θ t m j s m t m j a t m j b t m j it can be seen that θ t m j r 3 1 at time t is acquired by perturbing updated sensitive parameter vector θ t 1 mr j at the last time step t 1 with δ t 1 j which is the random realization of the distribution that the error of θ t 1 mr j s m t 1 mr j a t 1 mr j b t 1 mr j obeys in the study it is assumed that the above mentioned distribution is the gaussian distribution with the mean values equal to 0 and the standard deviations equal to 0 1 times their values specifically n 0 0 1 s m t 1 mr j 2 n 0 0 1 a t 1 mr j 2 and n 0 0 1 b t 1 mr j 2 for errors of s m t 1 mr j a t 1 mr j and b t 1 mr j respectively based on θ t m j in each grid i the model simulated ps m i t m j at time t for the ensemble member j is acquired as 11 ps m i t m j g ddrm ps m i t 1 mr j θ t m j φ q t 1 j in this case x t m j ps m i t m j it indicates that the ddrm system shown as g ddrm transforms ps m i t 1 mr j at the last time step t 1 to ps m i t m j at time t with the sensitive parameter vector θ t m j acquired by the equation 10 the non sensitive parameter vector φ and forcing data q t 1 j among which q t 1 j is acquired by adding a random realization of the distribution that the error of the original forcing value q t 1 obeys which assumes to be the gaussian distribution n 0 0 1 q t 1 2 the method to perturb the parameters and forcing data has been used in previous study lievens et al 2015 in the step 1 2 the remote sensed psm ensemble in each grid i is acquired by 12 ps m i t r j p s m i t r ψ i r j where ps m i t r is the gridded remote sensed psm at time t ψ i r j is the random realization of the distribution that the error of ps m i t r obeys which assumes to be the gaussian distribution n 0 ψ i r 2 in this case y t r ps m i t r the calculation of ψ i r for each grid i is detailed described in the section 3 4 3 3 2 the parameter state update by enkf with remote sensed data the step 2 is also divided into two steps including i step 2 1 parameter update and ii step 2 2 state update as shown in fig 3 parameters and states are updated independently this is because model parameters are used for the whole catchment while psm is simulated at grid scale in the ddrm in the step 2 1 to update sensitive parameter vector θ t m j s m t m j a t m j b t m j the catchment average of remote sensed psm shown as ps m t r j is used thus h θ t m j p s m t m j where ps m t m j is the catchment averaged model simulated psm thus the equation 4 can be specifically expressed as 13 θ t mr j θ t m j k t θ ps m t r j p s m t m j in this case m 3 n 1 and k t θ r 3 1 is the kalman gain to update the sensitive parameter vector θ t m j r 3 1 14 k t θ p t θ h t θ t h t θ p t θ h t θ t o t 1 among which 15 p t θ h t θ t 1 j 1 j 1 j θ t m j θ t m ps m t m j ps m t m 16 h t θ p t θ h t θ t 1 j 1 j 1 j ps m t m j ps m t m 2 17 o t 1 j 1 j 1 j ψ r j 2 where ps m t m 1 j j 1 j ps m t m j and ψ r j is the catchment averaged value of ψ i r j in the step 2 2 to update ps m i t m j in each grid i the gridded observation ps m i t r j is used thus h ps m i t m j p s m i t m j the equation 4 can be specifically expressed as 18 ps m i t mr j p s m i t m j k i t psm ps m i t r j p s m i t m j in this case m 1 n 1 the kalman gain k i t psm r 1 1 is calculated as 19 k i t psm p i t psm h i t psm t h i t psm p i t psm h i t psm t o i t 1 among which 20 p i t psm h i t psm t h i t psm p i t psm h i t psm t 1 j 1 j 1 j ps m i t m j ps m i t m 2 21 o i t 1 j 1 j 1 j ψ i r j 2 where ps m i t m 1 j j 1 j ps m i t m j in the case of assimilating both two remote sensed datasets at each time step t firstly step 1 and step 2 are implemented using one remote sensed dataset secondly the step 2 is repeated with the other remote sensed dataset at this time the updated states and parameters acquired from the last step are regarded as the model simulated states and parameters for this step 3 4 the pre processing for remote sensed soil moisture data obviously the two remote sensed surface soil moisture products esa cci and smap chosen in the study cannot be assimilated into the hydrological model directly there are three key differences between remote sensed surface soil moisture ssm product and model simulated profile soil moisture psm data including i original remote sensed data represent soil moisture of the surface soil layer while model simulated data represent soil moisture of the whole soil profile ii the physical meaning of remote sensed data is the volumetric soil moisture m3m 3 while that of model simulated data is the saturation degree iii the spatial resolution of remote sensed data is 25 25 km2 for esa cci and 9 9 km2 km for smap while that of model simulated data is 1 1 km2 in the study to match the remote sensed data with the model simulated data the remote sensed products have been pre processed by three procedures firstly remote sensed ssm is transformed to remote sensed psm by the exponential filter wagner et al 1999 this filter assumes that the variation in time of psm is linked to the difference between psm and ssm the unknown parameter t in the exponential filter is calculated by maximizing the correlation between remote sensed psm after transformation and model simulated psm secondly remote sensed psm in m3m 3 volumetric soil moisture is transformed to remote sensed psm in saturation degree by the minimum maximum correction method this transformation assumes that the value of the maximal volumetric soil moisture in each satellite spatial grid is the soil porosity value in the last to match the ddrm spatial scale of 1 1 km2 the inverse distance weighted idw method is applied to the remote sensed psm data tomczak 1998 after the pre processing the two remote sensed psm can match the model simulated psm in the study the pre processed remote sensed psm in each grid i at time t is collectively shown as ps m i t r specifically ps m i t esa for esa cci and ps m i t smap for smap in the assimilation the remote sensed psm data are perturbed to generate the ensembles for enkf by adding the random realization of the distribution that the errors obey there are studies utilizing the reported error of satellite data to retain as much of the remote sensed information as possible naz et al 2019 however considering that remote sensed data have been pre processed by multiple procedures in this study the original reported error is not suitable in this study it is assumed that the error of remote sensed psm for each grid i obeys the gaussian distribution n 0 ψ i r 2 ψ i r 2 is the collective representation of ψ i esa 2 and ψ i smap 2 the triple collocation tc method is used to calculate ψ i esa 2 and ψ i smap 2 stoffelen 1998 chen et al 2014 this method is an optimal error estimator when there are three independent datasets yilmaz and crow 2013 the pre processed esa cci psm the pre processed smap psm and the ddrm simulated psm without data assimilation are used as the data triplet 22 ψ i esa 2 v i esa c i esa s m a p c i esa d d r m c i smap d d r m 23 ψ i smap 2 v i smap c i esa s m a p c i smap d d r m c i esa d d r m where v i esa and v i smap is the variance of time series of esa cci and smap psm in each grid i and c i esa s m a p is the covariance between the time series of esa cci psm and smap psm in grid i c i esa d d r m is the covariance between the time series of esa cci psm and the ddrm simulated psm and c i smap d d r m is the covariance between the time series of smap psm and the ddrm simulated psm 3 5 experimental design this study aims to improve the accuracy of psm at 1 1 km2 by assimilating two remote sensed soil moisture products into the ddrm to investigate the influence of the selection of different remote sensed soil moisture products esa cci only smap only and esa cci and smap combined and the different updating schemes the state update and the parameter state update on the assimilation results six scenarios are set shown as as1 as2 as3 aps1 aps2 and aps3 respectively details of these six scenarios are shown in table 2 3 6 performance assessment to evaluate the performance of high resolution 1 1 km2 psm simulations the root mean square error rmse the mean absolute error mae and the correlation coefficient cc are used for validation using the remote sensed data both the pre processed psm from esa cci and smap are used to validate the psm simulations from the six assimilation scenarios thus the scenarios as1 and aps1 have been cross validated by the independent smap data and the scenarios as2 and aps2 have been cross validated by the independent esa cci data however there is no independent satellite data used for validating the scenarios as3 and aps3 besides there is no real psm data it is acknowledged that there are observational errors in the remote sensed soil moisture data thus further validation for psm simulations is considered by comparing streamflow simulations of the ddrm with observed streamflow since improvements of psm simulations would translate into subsequent improvements in simulated streamflow for streamflow validation the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and the kling gupta efficiency kge are also considered in addition a normalized error reduction index ner is used to evaluate the assimilation effectiveness naz et al 2019 it is calculated as 24 ner 1 rms e a rms e ddrm where rms e a is the rmse to validate psm estimated under the assimilation scenarios and rms e ddrm is the rmse to validate psm estimated by the ddrm without assimilation the range of ner is from negative infinity to 1 positive value of ner indicates that data assimilation improves the ddrm simulations while negative value indicates that data assimilation degrades the ddrm simulations 4 results and discussion 4 1 the influence of assimilation on profile soil moisture 4 1 1 the comparison of high resolution 1 1 km2 profile soil moisture the comparison between temporally averaged high resolution 1 1 km2 profile soil moisture psm acquired from esa cci and smap and those estimated from the ddrm without assimilation and under the six assimilation scenarios as1 as2 as3 aps1 aps2 and aps3 is shown in fig 4 for the upper xijiang uxj catchment in fig 5 for the qujiang qj catchments and fig 6 for the yiluohe ylh catchment table 3 illustrates the corresponding spatial averages the ddrm without assimilation exhibits obviously lower psm simulations comparing to the two remote sensed products especially in the upper reaches of the three catchments for any of the two remote sensed products the difference between them and any of the six assimilation scenarios is smaller than the difference between them and the ddrm without assimilation it indicates that assimilation of remote sensed datasets reduces the underestimation of psm in the ddrm the as1 and aps1 scenarios exhibit similar psm patterns with esa cci the as2 and aps2 scenarios exhibit similar psm patterns with smap while the as3 and aps3 scenarios are more likely to exhibit the combination of esa cci and smap this is due to the corresponding remote sensed datasets selected for assimilation in these scenarios besides for each catchment psm patterns estimated under the assimilation scenarios perform to relate to the topography and the river networks of the catchment as similar as those from the ddrm without assimilation this is due to the saturation excess runoff generation mechanism and the dem based model structure of the ddrm table 4 for the uxj catchment table 5 for the qj catchment and table 6 for the ylh catchment respectively illustrates the catchment averaged performance evaluation indexes of high resolution 1 1 km2 psm estimated from the ddrm without assimilation and under six assimilation scenarios these psm simulations are validated by both the two remote sensed products comparing with the ddrm without assimilation all six assimilation scenarios show improvements in psm simulations in different degrees seasonally the ddrm without assimilation shows better performance in the growing period than in the dormant period and assimilation scenarios show the similar seasonal effect besides the performance evaluation indexes show that in scenarios which only consider state update as1 as2 and as3 the as3 scenarios nearly perform best and in scenarios which consider parameter state update aps1 aps2 and aps3 the aps3 scenario performs best it indicates that multi satellite data assimilation is better than the single satellite data assimilation when the performance of psm is considered furtherly fig 7 fig 8 and fig 9 respectively shows the correlation coefficient cc in uxj qj and ylh catchments comparing the gridded psm estimated from the ddrm without assimilation and under six assimilation scenarios with those acquired from the two remote sensed products when the psm acquired from esa cci is used as the validation standard the ddrm without assimilation and under six assimilation scenarios always show higher cc than that when the psm acquired from smap is used as the validation standard especially in the qj catchment furthermore in the two humid catchments for the ddrm without assimilation when psm acquired from esa cci is used as the validation standard the difference in cc from grid to grid is not obvious while when the psm acquired from smap is used as the validation standard the difference is large especially in the dormant period this is due to the difference of the two remote sensed products from this result it can be seen that relative to psm acquired from smap psm acquired from esa cci shows more similar trends with the ddrm psm simulations either in time or space fig 10 fig 11 and fig 12 show the ner over different periods and catchments comparing gridded psm estimated from each assimilation scenario with those estimated from the ddrm without assimilation aiming to validate the efficiency of assimilation as described in section 3 6 the positive ner signals represent improvements and negative signals represent degradation it can be seen that the ner values are mostly positive over the catchments indicating there are improvements in psm simulations through assimilation of esa cci and smap datasets negative ner values are found in the mountain areas in the uxj and the loess plain in the ylh catchment in scenarios as2 and aps2 when psm acquired from esa cci is used as the validation standard and scenarios as1 and aps1 when psm acquired from smap is used as the validation standard and relatively as3 and aps3 scenarios show mostly positive ner regardless which remote sensed dataset is used as the validation standard the negative result may due to that the topographic of the uxj catchment andwaterandsoilloss in the loess plain of the ylh catchment can affect the accuracy of psm acquired from remote sensed products or the performance of psm estimated from ddrm besides the ner values in the dormant period are slightly higher than those in the growing period since the ddrm without assimilation performs better in the growing period than in the dormant period the higher ner values in the dormant period indicate that the assimilation reduces the seasonal effect in the ddrm modelling 4 1 2 the comparison of catchment averaged profile soil moisture the catchment averaged profile soil moisture psm estimated from the ddrm without assimilation and under six assimilation scenarios coupled with psm acquired from esa cci and smap are shown in the left column in fig 13 for the uxj catchment in fig 14 for the qj catchment and in fig 15 for the ylh catchment it can be seen that the ddrm underestimates psm in all three catchments the consistency between the two remote sensed products is different for the three catchments in the uxj and ylh catchments psm from esa cci is obviously higher than that from smap especially in the dormant period while in the qj catchment psm from esa cci and smap are relatively consistent for all catchments the underestimation is reduced in all assimilation scenarios the psm simulations in as1 and aps1 scenarios compare well with psm acquired from esa cci and those in as2 and aps2 compare well with psm acquired from smap with peaks and troughs generally coinciding besides the scenarios that consider the parameter state update aps1 aps2 and aps3 show much smaller difference between ensemble members at each time step than the scenarios that only consider the state update it can be seen that the parameter state update scenarios exhibit higher psm in peak psm and lower psm in trough psm than the state update scenarios the performance evaluation indexes for these catchment averaged psm simulations are shown in table 7 for the uxj catchment table 8 for the qj catchment and table 9 for the ylh catchment noticeably all the assimilation scenarios show lower rmse and mae than the ddrm without assimilation in all periods and catchments it can be seen that in most cases assimilating psm from esa cci improves psm simulations when validating them with psm acquired from smap and vice versa it indicated that the assimilation could improve the performance of psm simulations seasonally in the ddrm without assimilation the performance of psm simulations in the growing period is better than that in the dormant period and the difference of the performance between the two periods is reduced in the assimilation scenarios it indicates that the assimilation has the potential to reduce the seasonal difference of the ddrm this result is consistent with the results of comparing the high resolution psm 4 2 the influence of assimilation on streamflow the observed outlet streamflow data of the three catchments are used to evaluate the streamflow estimated from the ddrm without assimilation and from the ddrm under the six assimilation scenarios according to the right columns of fig 13 fig 14 and fig 15 streamflow estimated from the ddrm without assimilation fails to catch the peak streamflow over the whole period for all catchments relatively all assimilation scenarios overestimate peak streamflow in both dormant and growing periods in the uxj and qj catchments and underestimate in the ylh catchment in the uxj catchment the scenarios as1 as2 and as3 overestimate streamflow for all periods among which the as1 scenario performs worse while streamflow estimated from the scenarios aps1 aps2 and aps3 matches well with the observed streamflow except the peak streamflow in the qj catchment the scenarios as1 as2 and as3 perform well in the dormant period while the scenarios aps1 aps2 and aps3 underestimate streamflow except the peak in the ylh catchment the scenarios as2 and aps2 perform well in the growing period but underestimate streamflow in the dormant period similarly with the results of comparing catchment averaged psm there is obvious difference in streamflow simulations between the scenarios that only consider state update as1 as2 and as3 and the scenarios that consider parameter state update aps1 aps2 and aps3 for all catchments in the scenarios that consider parameter state update the differences between ensemble members of streamflow simulations are much smaller at each time step besides the parameter state update scenarios exhibit higher streamflow in peak streamflow and lower streamflow in trough streamflow table 10 shows the performance evaluation indexes for model simulated streamflow it can be seen that the performance of streamflow simulations in the semiarid catchment i e the ylh catchment is lower than those in the two humid catchments there may be three reasons for this result firstly the model structure of the ddrm model is based on the saturation excess runoff generation mechanism which should be more suitable to be applied in humid catchments rather than in semiarid catchments probably dominated by the infiltration excess runoff generation mechanism secondly the number of meteorological stations within the ylh catchment are less than those within the uxj and qj catchments leading to uncertainty in input data last according to liu et al 2020 and zhao et al 2020 the hydrological situations in the ylh catchment may be affected by human activities such as irrigation in the past decades but this study has not considered the influence of human activities on the rainfall runoff transformation in reality which may lead to poor performance of the model simulated streamflow in terms of the performance evaluation indexes table 10 most of the assimilation scenarios degrade the streamflow simulations comparing to the ddrm without assimilation this is because the initial parameters of the ddrm are calibrated to fit the streamflow simulations to the observed streamflow and the changes to the intermediate variables and parameters are more likely to degrade the fitness however the aps2 scenarios in the uxj catchment and the ylh catchment and the as2 scenario in the qj catchment improve the streamflow simulations with higher cc kge and nse it indicates that the assimilation of the remote sensed data for these scenarios can not only improve psm simulations but also improve streamflow simulations the common point of these scenarios is that all of them have assimilated psm acquired from smap overall assimilating psm acquired from smap into the ddrm has the potential to improve streamflow simulations 4 3 discussion this study demonstrates that the assimilation of remote sensed psm datasets is beneficial to the ddrm modelling it improves the high resolution 1 1 km2 psm simulations of the ddrm for all the uxj catchment the qj catchment and the ylh catchment and has the potential to improve the outlet streamflow simulations when psm acquired from smap is assimilated this study also highlights the added value of coarse resolution remote sensed soil moisture data through data assimilation with a high resolution distributed hydrological model to acquire more accurate high resolution psm with complete spatial temporal coverage than the hydrological model without assimilation the greatest challenge for this study is the lack of the ground measured psm data which could be true for all the similar studies about psm at the moment generally in situ measurements are regarded to represent real soil moisture information since the smap data are available only after april 2015 the assimilation period of the study has to be chosen to be after april 2015 which means that only in situ measurements of psm after april 2015 are useful to validate the assimilation results in this study according to the previous validation studies of smap soil moisture products in china it can be seen that most validation studies are carried out in the northwestern china since there are some in situ soil moisture data available in these areas after april 2015 cui et al 2017 ma et al 2017 lou et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a 2019b sun et al 2017 evaluates smap data using five day in situ measurements from april 2015 to august 2016 in the southeastern china it shows that these in situ data are strictly controlled in quality and are collected from the chinese meteorological data service system of the chinese meteorological administration cma however according to the china meteorological data service center data cma cn only in situ data before 2013 are publicly available and are without quality control leading to that there is no real data of psm used for validation for the time period after april 2015 to handle this issue the cross validation is also considered it means the esa cci data are used for validating the psm simulations when only smap data are assimilated and vice versa in these cases different sources of remote sensed psm data are used for assimilation and validation results show that in the cross validation the improvement of psm simulations is also significant however there is no independent remote sensed psm data for scenarios as3 and aps3 besides in the multiple procedures to pre process original remote sensed data to remoted sensed psm extra uncertainty is introduced although the tc method is used to estimate the errors of the remote sensed psm thus the validation of streamflow simulations is considered to further validate the psm simulations since the improvements of the model simulated psm may translate into subsequent improvements in the model simulated streamflow the results show that the assimilation of remote sensed psm could improve the performance of streamflow simulations in specific scenarios overall the results which show the assimilation has the potential to improve the psm simulations of the ddrm is reasonable in the future in situ data should be considered to further validate the assimilation results of the study besides one issue should be noted that the study period which is from 2013 to 2017 2013 for the warming period 2014 2015 for the calibration period and 2016 2017 for the assimilation period is kind of short according to the previous studies su et al 2021 song et al 2020 and zhao et al 2020 analyze the change of precipitation from 1970 to 2017 for the uxj catchment from 1970 to 2015 for the qj catchment and from 1952 to 2018 for the ylh catchment respectively these studies show that there is no obvious change trend in the annual precipitation of these three catchments while the fluctuation range is large the mean annual precipitation from 2014 to 2017 of the uxj catchment is 1231 mm and the annual precipitation of 2014 and those after 2014 are respectively below and above the multi year mean annual precipitation for the qj catchment the annual precipitation of 2014 2017 is 1204 mm slightly above its multi year mean annual precipitation for the ylh catchment the annual precipitation from 2014 to 2017 is 648 mm similar to its multi year mean annual precipitation considering the availability of both the remote sensed data and observed streamflow data this study chooses the study period of 2014 2017 this short study period may lead to that the climate fluctuations dry years and humid years could affect calibration and assimilation results for instance the calibration of model parameters is affected by the climatic state in the calibration period and the assimilation results are affected by the consistency of climatic states between the calibration period and the assimilation period thus there is a need to validate the assimilation results when the study period can be extended in the further studies however despite that the study period is not long due to the difficulty in obtaining both the remote sensed data and observed streamflow data for the same time period it is necessary to develop the assimilation method to approximately understand the influence of assimilating the remote sensed psm on the performance of the model simulated psm in the assimilation setup in the study the number of ensemble members of the enkf is chosen to be 20 less or more numbers of ensemble members 12 20 40 and 100 have been tested for both catchments to see the influence and results indicate when the number exceeds 20 there is no obvious improvement in assimilation results by increasing the number this result is consistent with naz et al 2019 the choice of 20 ensemble members could reduce the computational burden in a large extent since the high resolution data assimilation with the enkf needs high memory and storage requirements of the computer thus a larger scale catchment and a longer assimilation period can be considered in the future to see the added value in assimilating the remote sensed data in hydrological modelling 5 conclusions in the study three different inputs of remote sensed profile soil moisture psm datasets i e only esa cci only smap and esa cci and smap combined are respectively assimilated into the dem based distributed rainfall runoff model ddrm with the grid scale of 1 1 km2 to improve the psm simulations in the upper xijiang uxj catchment the qujiang qj catchment and the yiluohe ylh catchment in the assimilation process the two updating schemes i e only update ddrm s state variable psm and update both the parameters and psm variable of ddrm are considered these six assimilation scenarios are compared with the ddrm without assimilation to investigate the performances of assimilation the conclusions are drawn as follows i for all catchments the ddrm without assimilation underestimates psm especially in the dormant period for any of remote sensed psm datasets selected for assimilation either the state update or the parameter state update improve the psm simulations by ddrm at 1 1 km2 for both dormant and growing periods besides the assimilation reduces the seasonal differences of psm performances in the ddrm modelling ii for psm simulations assimilating psm acquired from both the two remote sensed products shows better performance than assimilating psm acquired from single remote sensed product for streamflow simulations the ddrm without assimilation underestimates peak streamflow and the assimilation scenarios overestimates peak streamflow most assimilation scenarios degrade the streamflow simulations but assimilating psm from smap improves the streamflow simulations when the parameter state update is considered in the uxj catchment and when the state update is considered in the qj catchment and the ylh catchment overall the assimilation of remote sensed datasets into the high resolution distributed hydrological model ddrm has the potential to provide a high resolution 1 1 km2 psm dataset which has distinct benefits over the original remote sensed psm and the ddrm simulated psm besides there is no obvious difference in the influence of the assimilation on model performance in terms of both psm and streamflow between the two humid catchments and the one semiarid catchment indicating the assimilation method is reliable and universal when applied to catchments in different climatic characteristics although the study period is not long leading to the uncertainty in results of the assimilation method it is significant to develop this assimilation method to analyze the influence of assimilating remote sensed psm on the performance of the model simulated psm since the results can provide the suitable advices for assimilation to acquire more accurate psm datasets in further studies in the future the study areas and time periods can be extended to provide more sufficient information credit authorship contribution statement han yang conceptualization methodology software formal analysis

4645,profile soil moisture psm which represents soil moisture content over the whole soil layer depth is a key variable to control plant growth biological interactions and streamflow generation and its information plays a crucial role in hydrological analysis and agricultural water management recent studies have assimilated multi source satellite psm information into hydrological modelling to more accurately estimate real psm however the psm estimated from these studies are normally at coarse spatial resolution i e larger than 25 25 km2 in this study the high resolution 1 1 km2 psm are generated by assimilating multiple remote sensed psm data of coarse resolution into the digital elevation model dem based distributed rainfall runoff model ddrm in three catchments two humid catchments and one semiarid catchment in china with the grid scale of 1 1 km2 the remote sensed psm data are pre processed from two remote sensed surface soil moisture datasets i e the multi satellite retrieved soil moisture dataset released by the europe space agency climate change initiative esa cci and the soil moisture product from the soil moisture active passive smap satellite the influence of remote sensed datasets selection schemes i e only esa cci only smap and esa cci and smap combined on assimilation results are investigated in the assimilation process two updating schemes are considered one is to only update the ddrm s state variable i e psm and the other updating both the parameters and psm variable of the ddrm thus six assimilation scenarios are set in the study whose performances are compared with the ddrm without assimilation for different time periods including the whole period the dormant period and the growing period results indicate that in any periods for any of remote sensed datasets used for assimilation either the state update or the parameter state update can improve the accuracy of high resolution 1 1 km2 psm simulations by the ddrm besides assimilating the smap psm dataset into the ddrm has the potential to improve streamflow simulations for the three catchments this study has shown that by assimilating multi source remote sensed psm into a high spatial resolution distributed hydrological model i e ddrm estimation of psm can be improved over both the original remote sensed psm and the ddrm simulated psm keywords profile soil moisture distributed rainfall runoff model data assimilation parameter state update 1 introduction soil moisture is one of the most important components in hydrological cycle and agricultural management as it controls the available water and energy exchange among the atmosphere hydrosphere and biosphere wang et al 2011 hoerling et al 2014 yuan et al 2015 it can be observed at different depths of the soil layer van loon and laaha 2015 roudier et al 2016 surface soil moisture ssm generally represents the soil moisture content only at the top 0 10 cm of the soil it has been extensively studied at different temporal and spatial scales since the development of satellite skills and retrieval algorithms over the decades provides various surface soil moisture products van loon 2015 an et al 2016 spennemann et al 2015 barker et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 profile soil moisture psm represents the soil moisture content of the whole soil layer including surface and sub surface soil moisture it is the key variable in hydrological studies and agricultural water management since it controls major process related to plant growth biological interactions and streamflow generation dracup et al 1980 wilhite and glantz 1985 mishra and singh 2010 huang et al 2014 liu et al 2019 thus it is necessary to pay more attention to psm studies traditionally the psm information is acquired from ground measurements or estimated through hydrological modelling van loon 2015 ground measurements are the most accurate records but are costly with small coverage areas and short time span and are mostly discontinuous wang et al 2011 besides the spotty pattern of ground measurements leads to the poor representativeness of areal soil moisture information an et al 2016 liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a 2019b comparing to ground measurements hydrological models have the ability to provide consistent long term psm simulations at various temporal and spatial scales lumped and semi distributed hydrological models can provide hourly or daily psm simulations at catchment and sub catchment scales and dem digital elevation model based distributed hydrological model can provide hourly or daily psm simulations at grid scales xiong et al 2018 yang et al 2019 however the accuracy of psm simulations in these models is limited by uncertainties in input meteorological data normally precipitation and evapotranspiration model parameters and model structures jin et al 2010 brigode et al 2013 thus psm estimated from hydrological models are usually biased they are insufficient to provide optimal psm information apart from ground measurements and hydrological model simulations psm information can also be obtained from the remote sensed surface soil moisture ssm products since there is inherent relationship between ssm and psm parajka et al 2009 xiong et al 2018 for instance the exponential filter proposed by wagner et al 1999 is used to acquire psm information from ssm data based on the assumption that the temporal variation of psm is linearly related to the difference between ssm and psm the remote sensed ssm products are nearly globally available and continuous in time having advantages in capturing spatial distribution and temporal dynamics liu et al 2019 however they are normally at a low spatial resolution most are larger than 25 25 km2 and their accuracy has been suspicious since ssm information acquired from satellites can be affected by the satellite designs the retrieval algorithms the vegetation and the topography xiong et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 liu et al 2019 besides there are large uncertainties during the simple transformation from ssm to psm thus there are also bias in psm directly acquired from the satellites ssm products recently in order to estimate more accurate psm remote sensed soil moisture products have been utilized in hydrological modelling by multi objective calibration or data assimilation chakrabarti et al 2014 kumar et al 2014 yan et al 2018 for instance parajka et al 2009 calibrated a conceptual dual layer hydrological model by both ers scatterometer based soil moisture and streamflow yang et al 2019 transformed remote sensed ssm to psm and using psm information and observed streamflow to calibrate a distributed hydrological model in these multi objective calibration studies whether it is reasonable to use the biased remote sensed data as the calibration objective remains controversial more studies choose data assimilation to merge remote sensed information with model simulations chen et al 2014 kumar et al 2014 yan et al 2018 blyverket et al 2019 nair and indu 2019 these studies show the potential of remote sensed information in improving performances of psm simulations of hydrological models previous studies generally estimate psm at coarse spatial resolutions i e larger than 25 25 km2 blyverket et al 2019 nair and indu 2019 zhang et al 2019a 2019b these psm simulations are too coarse to support local divisional hydrological analysis and agricultural water management among a catchment naz et al 2019 has provided soil moisture at 3 km over europe using land surface data assimilation this study aims to improve the accuracy of psm simulations at a higher resolution 1 1 km2 by assimilating multiple remote sensed soil moisture datasets into the digital elevation model dem based distributed rainfall runoff model ddrm which is developed by xiong et al 2004 with the grid scale of 1 1 km2 in three catchments two humid catchments and one semiarid catchment in china two remote sensed datasets are considered including ssm products from the europe space agency climate change initiative esa cci and the soil moisture active passive smap satellite in the choice of remote sensed datasets three different inputs i e only esa cci only smap and esa cci and smap combined are assimilated respectively into the ddrm in the assimilation process the influence of selecting updating schemes i e only update the ddrm s state variable psm and update both the parameters and psm variable of ddrm on assimilation results are investigated overall this study sets six assimilation scenarios in the remaining of the study study area and datasets are presented in the section 2 followed by the methodology of assimilating the remote sensed soil moisture information into the ddrm in section 3 section 4 assesses the performances of the six assimilation scenarios by comparing them with the ddrm without assimilation finally section 5 makes conclusions 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area three catchments including two humid catchments i e the upper xijiang uxj catchment the sub catchment of the zhu river basin and the qujiang qj catchment the sub catchment of the yangtze river basin and a semiarid catchment i e the yiluohe ylh catchment the sub catchment of the yellow river basin are chosen in this study fig 1 the two humid catchments are both characterized by the subtropical monsoon climate the uxj catchment is located in the upper reaches of the zhu river with a drainage area of 41715 km2 its elevation increases from southeast to northwest ranging from 664 to 2741 m a s l in this catchment the most area is covered by the forest land with relatively low temperature the annual precipitation ranges from 1200 to 1700 mm its outlet hydrological station is the tianyi station at which the mean annual runoff is 32 billion m3 it is nearly 10 of the xijiang s total discharge the qujiang qj catchment is located in the upper and middle reaches of the yangtze river with a drainage area of 39211 km2 its elevation increases from southwest to northeast ranging from 128 to 2 684 m a s l in this catchment the northern forest land has the low temperature and the large proportion of precipitation while the southern plateau covered mostly by cultivated and dry land has moderate temperature its annual precipitation is around 1200 mm the hydrological station at the qujiang catchment outlet is the luoduxi station at which the mean annual runoff is about 23 billion m3 is about the 30 jialing river s total discharge the yiluohe ylh catchment is located in the middle and lower reaches of the yellow river with the drainage area of 18560 km2 it is characterized by the continental monsoon climate with the annual precipitation around 500 mm to 700 mm the elevation of this catchment increases from southwest to northeast ranging from 154 m a s l to 2387 m a s l in the ylh catchment the western mountain area is covered by the vegetation and the eastern plateau is covered by the loess the hydrological station at this catchment outlet is the heishiguan station whose mean annual runoff is around 15 billion m3 2 2 hydro meteorological data precipitation and mean temperature data from meteorological stations as shown in fig 1 are used as the input hydro meteorological data for the ddrm and streamflow data from the outlet hydrological station for each catchment are used for calibration and validation for the ddrm considering the availability of the data the study period is 2013 2017 among which the data of 2013 are used for warming up the model the data from 2014 to 2015 are used for calibration and the data from 2016 to 2017 are used for the ddrm modelling with or without assimilation according to the different climate characteristics of the two humid catchments and the one semiarid catchment the dormant period and the growing period of the uxj and the qj catchments are set to be april to september and october to march respectively while those of the ylh catchment are set to be june to november and december to may the potential evapotranspiration for both catchments are calculated by the blaney criddle method with the mean temperature data hargreaves and samani 1982 to match the 1 1 km2 grid of the ddrm the inverse distance weighted idw method is used to interpolate the input data for the distributed model tomczak 1998 2 3 remote sensed soil moisture data two remote sensed surface soil moisture ssm products are selected to be assimilated into the ddrm one is acquired from the european space agency climate change initiative esa cci the version 04 4 of esa cci soil moisture product released on november 2018 consists of three ssm datasets including the active dataset blending advanced microwave instrument ami and advanced scatterometer ascat metop a and metop b the passive dataset blending scanning multichannel microwave radiometer smmr special sensor microwave imager ssm i tropical rainfall measure mission microwave imager tmi advanced microwave scanning radiometer for earth observing system amsr e windsat advanced microwave scanning radiometer amsr2 and the soil moisture ocean salinity smos and the combined dataset blending all ten satellite products mentioned above liu et al 2011 dorigo et al 2017 all these three datasets have a spatial resolution of nearly 25 25 km2 within a measuring depth of 10 cm the active dataset provides daily global surface saturation degree from 1991 to 2018 and the passive and combined datasets provide daily global surface volumetric soil moisture m3m 3 from 1978 to 2018 the combined dataset of esa cci has been validated in china and results showed its error is within a reasonable range an et al 2016 in this study the combined dataset of esa cci soil moisture product is chosen for the assimilation although the combined dataset of esa cci soil moisture product merges active and passive soil moisture information the newly remote sensed ssm dataset from the national aeronautics and space administration s nasa soil moisture active passive smap mission has not been included this satellite initially designed to provide a combined dataset of a 1 41 ghz l band passive radiometer and a 1 26 ghz l band active radar entekhabi et al 2010 unfortunately the active broke down in 2015 the smap level 3 l3 product provides global ssm dataset spl3smp e in m3m 3 within a measuring depth of about 5 cm and it is available in the national snow and ice data center nsidc it covers the period after april 2015 the spatial resolution of this dataset is 9 9 km2 this smap soil moisture dataset has been validated in southwestern china and results show that it has the potential to be utilized in hydrology agriculture and ecology in china sun et al 2017 xiong et al 2018 yang et al 2019 in this study this smap product is chosen for the assimilation 3 methodology in this study two remote sensed soil moisture datasets esa cci and smap are assimilated into the distributed hydrological model ddrm to improve the accuracy of high resolution 1 1 km2 profile soil moisture psm simulations by ddrm in this section the distributed model ddrm is first described followed by the data assimilation method ensemble kalman filter enkf and details of assimilation implementation then the pre processing for remote sensed data is described experimental design and performance assessment of assimilation are shown in the last 3 1 the dem based distributed rainfall runoff model ddrm in this study the dem based distributed rainfall runoff model ddrm is applied to simulate profile soil moisture psm this model is a conceptual distributed model developed by xiong et al 2004 and has been widely used in the southern china for streamflow and psm simulations and predictions xiong et al 2007 2018 long et al 2012 yang et al 2019 in the ddrm dem grids are the basic simulation units for the psm simulations in this study the scale of dem grids in the ddrm is 1 1 km2 in each dem grid i as shown in fig 2 a the simulation of s i is under the saturation excess runoff generation mechanism which assumes the water infiltrated or percolated to soil profile is redistributed with gridded soil moisture storage capacity sm c i as a threshold from fig 2 a it can be seen that where the soil is unsaturated s i s m c i s i is updated and there is no excess rainfall where the soil is saturated excess rainfall is generated in the ddrm sm c i is linked to the grid topographic index after the excess rainfall generation the ddrm routes excess rainfall in each grid from upstream to the sub catchment outlet and furtherly to the outlet of the whole catchment to get the streamflow values as shown in fig 2 b the muskingum method is used for the routing there are 11 model parameters for the ddrm including 7 saturation excess runoff generation parameters sm a b s 0 n t s t p and 4 routing parameters c 0 c 1 h c 0 h c 1 details of these parameters can be found in xiong et al 2018 and yang et al 2019 according to the sensitivity analysis of parameters in yang et al 2019 range of water storage capacity across the catchment sm proportion of residual groundwater in soil water storage capacity a and empirical parameter b that reflecting the characteristic of ground outflow are sensitive to psm simulations the vector of these three sensitive parameters is shown as θ s m a b in the study the vector of other non sensitive ddrm parameters to psm is shown as φ thus the vector ξ of all the ddrm parameters is composed of all the elements in θ and φ this study chooses the sensitive parameter vector θ to be updated by the remote sensed information at each time step shown as θ t s m t a t b t while the non sensitive parameter vector φ is not updated both sensitive and non sensitive parameters are initially acquired by calibration before the assimilation for all catchments model parameters are calibrated in the calibration period 2014 2015 to match the observed streamflow and the objective function is the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse which is the most widely used performance criteria for model calibration the calibrated parameter values for the uxj catchment the qj catchment and the ylh catchment are shown in table 1 it can be seen that values of some parameters are quite different in these three catchments there are three reasons for that the first reason is that the catchment characteristics are different for the three catchments leading to different parameter values for different catchments for instance most areas of the middle and lower reaches in the uxj catchment and the qj catchment are covered by the vegetation but those in the ylh catchment are covered by loess the second reason is that despite the ddrm is a distributed hydrological model rather than a lumped model its model parameters still cannot be regarded as fully physically based thirdly just like any other hydrological models there still exist uncertainties in the structure and parameters of the ddrm thus resulting in the equifinality phenomenon in calibrating model parameters beven 2006 since s i and sm c i represent moisture depth given in mm which cannot be compared directly to remote sensed data the model simulated psm given in saturation degree at time t is calculated as 1 ps m i t s i t sm c i 3 2 the ensemble kalman filter enkf the ensemble kalman filter enkf is selected in this study for data assimilation burgers et al 1998 evensen 2003 wikle and berliner 2007 this algorithm has been widely used to assimilate remote sensed data into hydrological models and proven relatively efficient and robust loizu et al 2018 blyverket et al 2019 naz et al 2019 in this study the parameters and states obtained by the hydrological model ddrm are denoted by the superscript m while remote sensed data are denoted by the superscript r and the updated parameters and states by merging model simulated and remote sensed information are represented by the superscript mr since the enkf utilizes model simulated ensembles to approximate the error of model state and parameters the second superscript j j 1 2 j is used to indicate one of the ensemble members generally parameter state vector x t m j x 1 t m j x 2 t m j x m t m j of the hydrological model for each ensemble member j j 1 2 j where x 1 t m j x 2 t m j x m t m j can be parameters and states is acquired as 2 x t m j g x t 1 mr j ς t 1 j it indicates that parameter state vector x t m j r m 1 at time t is acquired by the function g with updated parameter state vector x t 1 mr j r m 1 at the last time step t 1 and auxiliary data at the same time the observation vector y t r y 1 t r y 2 t r y n t r from the remote sensing is perturbed to obtain 3 y t r j y t r ψ t r j where ψ t r j r n 1 is the random realization of the distribution that the error of y t r r n 1 obeys to update the parameter state vector x t m j 4 x t mr j x t m j k t y t r j h t x t m j where x t mr j r m 1 is the updated result and h t is the nonlinear observation operator which is used to map the x t m j r m 1 to observation space thus h x t m j r n 1 is the model simulation correspond to the observation variable y t r j r n 1 the kalman gain k t r m n is expressed as 5 k t p t h t t h t p t h t t o t 1 among which p t r m m is the prior error covariance matrix of the parameter state vector h t r n m is the jacobian of the observation operator h t and o t r n n is the error covariance matrix of the observation vector at time t in practice the need for the explicit calculation of p t and h t for nonlinear observation systems can be bypassed based on the ensemble statistics 6 p t h t t 1 j 1 j 1 j x t m j x t m j h x t m j h x t m j t 7 h t p t h t t 1 j 1 j 1 j h x t m j h x t m j h x t m j h x t m j t 8 o t 1 j 1 j 1 j ψ t r j ψ t r j t where x t m j and h x t m j are the matrix of ensemble averages for instance 9 x t m j 1 j j 1 j x 1 t m j 1 j j 1 j x 2 t m j 1 j j 1 j x m t m j 3 3 assimilation implementation in practice of this study there are two specific steps for the data assimilation including i step 1 acquisition of model simulated and remote sensed psm ensemble at time t ii step 2 the parameter state update by enkf with remote sensed data after the update repeat steps 1 and 2 for the next time period t 1 using updated sensitive parameter vector and psm from step 2 at time t the flowchart of the assimilation steps is provided in fig 3 in this section step 1 is detailed described in 3 3 1 and step 2 is detailed described in 3 3 2 3 3 1 acquisition of model simulated and remote sensed profile soil moisture psm ensemble the step 1 is furthered divided into two steps including i step 1 1 the acquisition of the model simulated psm ensemble and ii step 1 2 the acquisition of the remote sensed psm ensemble in the step 1 1 as shown in fig 3 the sensitive parameter vector ensemble θ t m j s m t m j a t m j b t m j to psm is firstly acquired as 10 θ t m j g perturb θ t 1 mr j δ t 1 j θ t 1 mr j δ t 1 j in this case x t m j θ t m j s m t m j a t m j b t m j it can be seen that θ t m j r 3 1 at time t is acquired by perturbing updated sensitive parameter vector θ t 1 mr j at the last time step t 1 with δ t 1 j which is the random realization of the distribution that the error of θ t 1 mr j s m t 1 mr j a t 1 mr j b t 1 mr j obeys in the study it is assumed that the above mentioned distribution is the gaussian distribution with the mean values equal to 0 and the standard deviations equal to 0 1 times their values specifically n 0 0 1 s m t 1 mr j 2 n 0 0 1 a t 1 mr j 2 and n 0 0 1 b t 1 mr j 2 for errors of s m t 1 mr j a t 1 mr j and b t 1 mr j respectively based on θ t m j in each grid i the model simulated ps m i t m j at time t for the ensemble member j is acquired as 11 ps m i t m j g ddrm ps m i t 1 mr j θ t m j φ q t 1 j in this case x t m j ps m i t m j it indicates that the ddrm system shown as g ddrm transforms ps m i t 1 mr j at the last time step t 1 to ps m i t m j at time t with the sensitive parameter vector θ t m j acquired by the equation 10 the non sensitive parameter vector φ and forcing data q t 1 j among which q t 1 j is acquired by adding a random realization of the distribution that the error of the original forcing value q t 1 obeys which assumes to be the gaussian distribution n 0 0 1 q t 1 2 the method to perturb the parameters and forcing data has been used in previous study lievens et al 2015 in the step 1 2 the remote sensed psm ensemble in each grid i is acquired by 12 ps m i t r j p s m i t r ψ i r j where ps m i t r is the gridded remote sensed psm at time t ψ i r j is the random realization of the distribution that the error of ps m i t r obeys which assumes to be the gaussian distribution n 0 ψ i r 2 in this case y t r ps m i t r the calculation of ψ i r for each grid i is detailed described in the section 3 4 3 3 2 the parameter state update by enkf with remote sensed data the step 2 is also divided into two steps including i step 2 1 parameter update and ii step 2 2 state update as shown in fig 3 parameters and states are updated independently this is because model parameters are used for the whole catchment while psm is simulated at grid scale in the ddrm in the step 2 1 to update sensitive parameter vector θ t m j s m t m j a t m j b t m j the catchment average of remote sensed psm shown as ps m t r j is used thus h θ t m j p s m t m j where ps m t m j is the catchment averaged model simulated psm thus the equation 4 can be specifically expressed as 13 θ t mr j θ t m j k t θ ps m t r j p s m t m j in this case m 3 n 1 and k t θ r 3 1 is the kalman gain to update the sensitive parameter vector θ t m j r 3 1 14 k t θ p t θ h t θ t h t θ p t θ h t θ t o t 1 among which 15 p t θ h t θ t 1 j 1 j 1 j θ t m j θ t m ps m t m j ps m t m 16 h t θ p t θ h t θ t 1 j 1 j 1 j ps m t m j ps m t m 2 17 o t 1 j 1 j 1 j ψ r j 2 where ps m t m 1 j j 1 j ps m t m j and ψ r j is the catchment averaged value of ψ i r j in the step 2 2 to update ps m i t m j in each grid i the gridded observation ps m i t r j is used thus h ps m i t m j p s m i t m j the equation 4 can be specifically expressed as 18 ps m i t mr j p s m i t m j k i t psm ps m i t r j p s m i t m j in this case m 1 n 1 the kalman gain k i t psm r 1 1 is calculated as 19 k i t psm p i t psm h i t psm t h i t psm p i t psm h i t psm t o i t 1 among which 20 p i t psm h i t psm t h i t psm p i t psm h i t psm t 1 j 1 j 1 j ps m i t m j ps m i t m 2 21 o i t 1 j 1 j 1 j ψ i r j 2 where ps m i t m 1 j j 1 j ps m i t m j in the case of assimilating both two remote sensed datasets at each time step t firstly step 1 and step 2 are implemented using one remote sensed dataset secondly the step 2 is repeated with the other remote sensed dataset at this time the updated states and parameters acquired from the last step are regarded as the model simulated states and parameters for this step 3 4 the pre processing for remote sensed soil moisture data obviously the two remote sensed surface soil moisture products esa cci and smap chosen in the study cannot be assimilated into the hydrological model directly there are three key differences between remote sensed surface soil moisture ssm product and model simulated profile soil moisture psm data including i original remote sensed data represent soil moisture of the surface soil layer while model simulated data represent soil moisture of the whole soil profile ii the physical meaning of remote sensed data is the volumetric soil moisture m3m 3 while that of model simulated data is the saturation degree iii the spatial resolution of remote sensed data is 25 25 km2 for esa cci and 9 9 km2 km for smap while that of model simulated data is 1 1 km2 in the study to match the remote sensed data with the model simulated data the remote sensed products have been pre processed by three procedures firstly remote sensed ssm is transformed to remote sensed psm by the exponential filter wagner et al 1999 this filter assumes that the variation in time of psm is linked to the difference between psm and ssm the unknown parameter t in the exponential filter is calculated by maximizing the correlation between remote sensed psm after transformation and model simulated psm secondly remote sensed psm in m3m 3 volumetric soil moisture is transformed to remote sensed psm in saturation degree by the minimum maximum correction method this transformation assumes that the value of the maximal volumetric soil moisture in each satellite spatial grid is the soil porosity value in the last to match the ddrm spatial scale of 1 1 km2 the inverse distance weighted idw method is applied to the remote sensed psm data tomczak 1998 after the pre processing the two remote sensed psm can match the model simulated psm in the study the pre processed remote sensed psm in each grid i at time t is collectively shown as ps m i t r specifically ps m i t esa for esa cci and ps m i t smap for smap in the assimilation the remote sensed psm data are perturbed to generate the ensembles for enkf by adding the random realization of the distribution that the errors obey there are studies utilizing the reported error of satellite data to retain as much of the remote sensed information as possible naz et al 2019 however considering that remote sensed data have been pre processed by multiple procedures in this study the original reported error is not suitable in this study it is assumed that the error of remote sensed psm for each grid i obeys the gaussian distribution n 0 ψ i r 2 ψ i r 2 is the collective representation of ψ i esa 2 and ψ i smap 2 the triple collocation tc method is used to calculate ψ i esa 2 and ψ i smap 2 stoffelen 1998 chen et al 2014 this method is an optimal error estimator when there are three independent datasets yilmaz and crow 2013 the pre processed esa cci psm the pre processed smap psm and the ddrm simulated psm without data assimilation are used as the data triplet 22 ψ i esa 2 v i esa c i esa s m a p c i esa d d r m c i smap d d r m 23 ψ i smap 2 v i smap c i esa s m a p c i smap d d r m c i esa d d r m where v i esa and v i smap is the variance of time series of esa cci and smap psm in each grid i and c i esa s m a p is the covariance between the time series of esa cci psm and smap psm in grid i c i esa d d r m is the covariance between the time series of esa cci psm and the ddrm simulated psm and c i smap d d r m is the covariance between the time series of smap psm and the ddrm simulated psm 3 5 experimental design this study aims to improve the accuracy of psm at 1 1 km2 by assimilating two remote sensed soil moisture products into the ddrm to investigate the influence of the selection of different remote sensed soil moisture products esa cci only smap only and esa cci and smap combined and the different updating schemes the state update and the parameter state update on the assimilation results six scenarios are set shown as as1 as2 as3 aps1 aps2 and aps3 respectively details of these six scenarios are shown in table 2 3 6 performance assessment to evaluate the performance of high resolution 1 1 km2 psm simulations the root mean square error rmse the mean absolute error mae and the correlation coefficient cc are used for validation using the remote sensed data both the pre processed psm from esa cci and smap are used to validate the psm simulations from the six assimilation scenarios thus the scenarios as1 and aps1 have been cross validated by the independent smap data and the scenarios as2 and aps2 have been cross validated by the independent esa cci data however there is no independent satellite data used for validating the scenarios as3 and aps3 besides there is no real psm data it is acknowledged that there are observational errors in the remote sensed soil moisture data thus further validation for psm simulations is considered by comparing streamflow simulations of the ddrm with observed streamflow since improvements of psm simulations would translate into subsequent improvements in simulated streamflow for streamflow validation the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and the kling gupta efficiency kge are also considered in addition a normalized error reduction index ner is used to evaluate the assimilation effectiveness naz et al 2019 it is calculated as 24 ner 1 rms e a rms e ddrm where rms e a is the rmse to validate psm estimated under the assimilation scenarios and rms e ddrm is the rmse to validate psm estimated by the ddrm without assimilation the range of ner is from negative infinity to 1 positive value of ner indicates that data assimilation improves the ddrm simulations while negative value indicates that data assimilation degrades the ddrm simulations 4 results and discussion 4 1 the influence of assimilation on profile soil moisture 4 1 1 the comparison of high resolution 1 1 km2 profile soil moisture the comparison between temporally averaged high resolution 1 1 km2 profile soil moisture psm acquired from esa cci and smap and those estimated from the ddrm without assimilation and under the six assimilation scenarios as1 as2 as3 aps1 aps2 and aps3 is shown in fig 4 for the upper xijiang uxj catchment in fig 5 for the qujiang qj catchments and fig 6 for the yiluohe ylh catchment table 3 illustrates the corresponding spatial averages the ddrm without assimilation exhibits obviously lower psm simulations comparing to the two remote sensed products especially in the upper reaches of the three catchments for any of the two remote sensed products the difference between them and any of the six assimilation scenarios is smaller than the difference between them and the ddrm without assimilation it indicates that assimilation of remote sensed datasets reduces the underestimation of psm in the ddrm the as1 and aps1 scenarios exhibit similar psm patterns with esa cci the as2 and aps2 scenarios exhibit similar psm patterns with smap while the as3 and aps3 scenarios are more likely to exhibit the combination of esa cci and smap this is due to the corresponding remote sensed datasets selected for assimilation in these scenarios besides for each catchment psm patterns estimated under the assimilation scenarios perform to relate to the topography and the river networks of the catchment as similar as those from the ddrm without assimilation this is due to the saturation excess runoff generation mechanism and the dem based model structure of the ddrm table 4 for the uxj catchment table 5 for the qj catchment and table 6 for the ylh catchment respectively illustrates the catchment averaged performance evaluation indexes of high resolution 1 1 km2 psm estimated from the ddrm without assimilation and under six assimilation scenarios these psm simulations are validated by both the two remote sensed products comparing with the ddrm without assimilation all six assimilation scenarios show improvements in psm simulations in different degrees seasonally the ddrm without assimilation shows better performance in the growing period than in the dormant period and assimilation scenarios show the similar seasonal effect besides the performance evaluation indexes show that in scenarios which only consider state update as1 as2 and as3 the as3 scenarios nearly perform best and in scenarios which consider parameter state update aps1 aps2 and aps3 the aps3 scenario performs best it indicates that multi satellite data assimilation is better than the single satellite data assimilation when the performance of psm is considered furtherly fig 7 fig 8 and fig 9 respectively shows the correlation coefficient cc in uxj qj and ylh catchments comparing the gridded psm estimated from the ddrm without assimilation and under six assimilation scenarios with those acquired from the two remote sensed products when the psm acquired from esa cci is used as the validation standard the ddrm without assimilation and under six assimilation scenarios always show higher cc than that when the psm acquired from smap is used as the validation standard especially in the qj catchment furthermore in the two humid catchments for the ddrm without assimilation when psm acquired from esa cci is used as the validation standard the difference in cc from grid to grid is not obvious while when the psm acquired from smap is used as the validation standard the difference is large especially in the dormant period this is due to the difference of the two remote sensed products from this result it can be seen that relative to psm acquired from smap psm acquired from esa cci shows more similar trends with the ddrm psm simulations either in time or space fig 10 fig 11 and fig 12 show the ner over different periods and catchments comparing gridded psm estimated from each assimilation scenario with those estimated from the ddrm without assimilation aiming to validate the efficiency of assimilation as described in section 3 6 the positive ner signals represent improvements and negative signals represent degradation it can be seen that the ner values are mostly positive over the catchments indicating there are improvements in psm simulations through assimilation of esa cci and smap datasets negative ner values are found in the mountain areas in the uxj and the loess plain in the ylh catchment in scenarios as2 and aps2 when psm acquired from esa cci is used as the validation standard and scenarios as1 and aps1 when psm acquired from smap is used as the validation standard and relatively as3 and aps3 scenarios show mostly positive ner regardless which remote sensed dataset is used as the validation standard the negative result may due to that the topographic of the uxj catchment andwaterandsoilloss in the loess plain of the ylh catchment can affect the accuracy of psm acquired from remote sensed products or the performance of psm estimated from ddrm besides the ner values in the dormant period are slightly higher than those in the growing period since the ddrm without assimilation performs better in the growing period than in the dormant period the higher ner values in the dormant period indicate that the assimilation reduces the seasonal effect in the ddrm modelling 4 1 2 the comparison of catchment averaged profile soil moisture the catchment averaged profile soil moisture psm estimated from the ddrm without assimilation and under six assimilation scenarios coupled with psm acquired from esa cci and smap are shown in the left column in fig 13 for the uxj catchment in fig 14 for the qj catchment and in fig 15 for the ylh catchment it can be seen that the ddrm underestimates psm in all three catchments the consistency between the two remote sensed products is different for the three catchments in the uxj and ylh catchments psm from esa cci is obviously higher than that from smap especially in the dormant period while in the qj catchment psm from esa cci and smap are relatively consistent for all catchments the underestimation is reduced in all assimilation scenarios the psm simulations in as1 and aps1 scenarios compare well with psm acquired from esa cci and those in as2 and aps2 compare well with psm acquired from smap with peaks and troughs generally coinciding besides the scenarios that consider the parameter state update aps1 aps2 and aps3 show much smaller difference between ensemble members at each time step than the scenarios that only consider the state update it can be seen that the parameter state update scenarios exhibit higher psm in peak psm and lower psm in trough psm than the state update scenarios the performance evaluation indexes for these catchment averaged psm simulations are shown in table 7 for the uxj catchment table 8 for the qj catchment and table 9 for the ylh catchment noticeably all the assimilation scenarios show lower rmse and mae than the ddrm without assimilation in all periods and catchments it can be seen that in most cases assimilating psm from esa cci improves psm simulations when validating them with psm acquired from smap and vice versa it indicated that the assimilation could improve the performance of psm simulations seasonally in the ddrm without assimilation the performance of psm simulations in the growing period is better than that in the dormant period and the difference of the performance between the two periods is reduced in the assimilation scenarios it indicates that the assimilation has the potential to reduce the seasonal difference of the ddrm this result is consistent with the results of comparing the high resolution psm 4 2 the influence of assimilation on streamflow the observed outlet streamflow data of the three catchments are used to evaluate the streamflow estimated from the ddrm without assimilation and from the ddrm under the six assimilation scenarios according to the right columns of fig 13 fig 14 and fig 15 streamflow estimated from the ddrm without assimilation fails to catch the peak streamflow over the whole period for all catchments relatively all assimilation scenarios overestimate peak streamflow in both dormant and growing periods in the uxj and qj catchments and underestimate in the ylh catchment in the uxj catchment the scenarios as1 as2 and as3 overestimate streamflow for all periods among which the as1 scenario performs worse while streamflow estimated from the scenarios aps1 aps2 and aps3 matches well with the observed streamflow except the peak streamflow in the qj catchment the scenarios as1 as2 and as3 perform well in the dormant period while the scenarios aps1 aps2 and aps3 underestimate streamflow except the peak in the ylh catchment the scenarios as2 and aps2 perform well in the growing period but underestimate streamflow in the dormant period similarly with the results of comparing catchment averaged psm there is obvious difference in streamflow simulations between the scenarios that only consider state update as1 as2 and as3 and the scenarios that consider parameter state update aps1 aps2 and aps3 for all catchments in the scenarios that consider parameter state update the differences between ensemble members of streamflow simulations are much smaller at each time step besides the parameter state update scenarios exhibit higher streamflow in peak streamflow and lower streamflow in trough streamflow table 10 shows the performance evaluation indexes for model simulated streamflow it can be seen that the performance of streamflow simulations in the semiarid catchment i e the ylh catchment is lower than those in the two humid catchments there may be three reasons for this result firstly the model structure of the ddrm model is based on the saturation excess runoff generation mechanism which should be more suitable to be applied in humid catchments rather than in semiarid catchments probably dominated by the infiltration excess runoff generation mechanism secondly the number of meteorological stations within the ylh catchment are less than those within the uxj and qj catchments leading to uncertainty in input data last according to liu et al 2020 and zhao et al 2020 the hydrological situations in the ylh catchment may be affected by human activities such as irrigation in the past decades but this study has not considered the influence of human activities on the rainfall runoff transformation in reality which may lead to poor performance of the model simulated streamflow in terms of the performance evaluation indexes table 10 most of the assimilation scenarios degrade the streamflow simulations comparing to the ddrm without assimilation this is because the initial parameters of the ddrm are calibrated to fit the streamflow simulations to the observed streamflow and the changes to the intermediate variables and parameters are more likely to degrade the fitness however the aps2 scenarios in the uxj catchment and the ylh catchment and the as2 scenario in the qj catchment improve the streamflow simulations with higher cc kge and nse it indicates that the assimilation of the remote sensed data for these scenarios can not only improve psm simulations but also improve streamflow simulations the common point of these scenarios is that all of them have assimilated psm acquired from smap overall assimilating psm acquired from smap into the ddrm has the potential to improve streamflow simulations 4 3 discussion this study demonstrates that the assimilation of remote sensed psm datasets is beneficial to the ddrm modelling it improves the high resolution 1 1 km2 psm simulations of the ddrm for all the uxj catchment the qj catchment and the ylh catchment and has the potential to improve the outlet streamflow simulations when psm acquired from smap is assimilated this study also highlights the added value of coarse resolution remote sensed soil moisture data through data assimilation with a high resolution distributed hydrological model to acquire more accurate high resolution psm with complete spatial temporal coverage than the hydrological model without assimilation the greatest challenge for this study is the lack of the ground measured psm data which could be true for all the similar studies about psm at the moment generally in situ measurements are regarded to represent real soil moisture information since the smap data are available only after april 2015 the assimilation period of the study has to be chosen to be after april 2015 which means that only in situ measurements of psm after april 2015 are useful to validate the assimilation results in this study according to the previous validation studies of smap soil moisture products in china it can be seen that most validation studies are carried out in the northwestern china since there are some in situ soil moisture data available in these areas after april 2015 cui et al 2017 ma et al 2017 lou et al 2019 zhang et al 2019a 2019b sun et al 2017 evaluates smap data using five day in situ measurements from april 2015 to august 2016 in the southeastern china it shows that these in situ data are strictly controlled in quality and are collected from the chinese meteorological data service system of the chinese meteorological administration cma however according to the china meteorological data service center data cma cn only in situ data before 2013 are publicly available and are without quality control leading to that there is no real data of psm used for validation for the time period after april 2015 to handle this issue the cross validation is also considered it means the esa cci data are used for validating the psm simulations when only smap data are assimilated and vice versa in these cases different sources of remote sensed psm data are used for assimilation and validation results show that in the cross validation the improvement of psm simulations is also significant however there is no independent remote sensed psm data for scenarios as3 and aps3 besides in the multiple procedures to pre process original remote sensed data to remoted sensed psm extra uncertainty is introduced although the tc method is used to estimate the errors of the remote sensed psm thus the validation of streamflow simulations is considered to further validate the psm simulations since the improvements of the model simulated psm may translate into subsequent improvements in the model simulated streamflow the results show that the assimilation of remote sensed psm could improve the performance of streamflow simulations in specific scenarios overall the results which show the assimilation has the potential to improve the psm simulations of the ddrm is reasonable in the future in situ data should be considered to further validate the assimilation results of the study besides one issue should be noted that the study period which is from 2013 to 2017 2013 for the warming period 2014 2015 for the calibration period and 2016 2017 for the assimilation period is kind of short according to the previous studies su et al 2021 song et al 2020 and zhao et al 2020 analyze the change of precipitation from 1970 to 2017 for the uxj catchment from 1970 to 2015 for the qj catchment and from 1952 to 2018 for the ylh catchment respectively these studies show that there is no obvious change trend in the annual precipitation of these three catchments while the fluctuation range is large the mean annual precipitation from 2014 to 2017 of the uxj catchment is 1231 mm and the annual precipitation of 2014 and those after 2014 are respectively below and above the multi year mean annual precipitation for the qj catchment the annual precipitation of 2014 2017 is 1204 mm slightly above its multi year mean annual precipitation for the ylh catchment the annual precipitation from 2014 to 2017 is 648 mm similar to its multi year mean annual precipitation considering the availability of both the remote sensed data and observed streamflow data this study chooses the study period of 2014 2017 this short study period may lead to that the climate fluctuations dry years and humid years could affect calibration and assimilation results for instance the calibration of model parameters is affected by the climatic state in the calibration period and the assimilation results are affected by the consistency of climatic states between the calibration period and the assimilation period thus there is a need to validate the assimilation results when the study period can be extended in the further studies however despite that the study period is not long due to the difficulty in obtaining both the remote sensed data and observed streamflow data for the same time period it is necessary to develop the assimilation method to approximately understand the influence of assimilating the remote sensed psm on the performance of the model simulated psm in the assimilation setup in the study the number of ensemble members of the enkf is chosen to be 20 less or more numbers of ensemble members 12 20 40 and 100 have been tested for both catchments to see the influence and results indicate when the number exceeds 20 there is no obvious improvement in assimilation results by increasing the number this result is consistent with naz et al 2019 the choice of 20 ensemble members could reduce the computational burden in a large extent since the high resolution data assimilation with the enkf needs high memory and storage requirements of the computer thus a larger scale catchment and a longer assimilation period can be considered in the future to see the added value in assimilating the remote sensed data in hydrological modelling 5 conclusions in the study three different inputs of remote sensed profile soil moisture psm datasets i e only esa cci only smap and esa cci and smap combined are respectively assimilated into the dem based distributed rainfall runoff model ddrm with the grid scale of 1 1 km2 to improve the psm simulations in the upper xijiang uxj catchment the qujiang qj catchment and the yiluohe ylh catchment in the assimilation process the two updating schemes i e only update ddrm s state variable psm and update both the parameters and psm variable of ddrm are considered these six assimilation scenarios are compared with the ddrm without assimilation to investigate the performances of assimilation the conclusions are drawn as follows i for all catchments the ddrm without assimilation underestimates psm especially in the dormant period for any of remote sensed psm datasets selected for assimilation either the state update or the parameter state update improve the psm simulations by ddrm at 1 1 km2 for both dormant and growing periods besides the assimilation reduces the seasonal differences of psm performances in the ddrm modelling ii for psm simulations assimilating psm acquired from both the two remote sensed products shows better performance than assimilating psm acquired from single remote sensed product for streamflow simulations the ddrm without assimilation underestimates peak streamflow and the assimilation scenarios overestimates peak streamflow most assimilation scenarios degrade the streamflow simulations but assimilating psm from smap improves the streamflow simulations when the parameter state update is considered in the uxj catchment and when the state update is considered in the qj catchment and the ylh catchment overall the assimilation of remote sensed datasets into the high resolution distributed hydrological model ddrm has the potential to provide a high resolution 1 1 km2 psm dataset which has distinct benefits over the original remote sensed psm and the ddrm simulated psm besides there is no obvious difference in the influence of the assimilation on model performance in terms of both psm and streamflow between the two humid catchments and the one semiarid catchment indicating the assimilation method is reliable and universal when applied to catchments in different climatic characteristics although the study period is not long leading to the uncertainty in results of the assimilation method it is significant to develop this assimilation method to analyze the influence of assimilating remote sensed psm on the performance of the model simulated psm since the results can provide the suitable advices for assimilation to acquire more accurate psm datasets in further studies in the

distributed natural disaster both in arid and humid areas forzieri et al 2014 mishra and singh 2010 li et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 it develops slowly and becomes apparent only when it has a serious impact dracup et al 1980 peters et al 2006 due to population growth and the expansion of agricultural energy and industrial sectors both the demand for water and the degree of global drought has increased significantly under climate change dai 2011 palmer et al 2008 sheffield et al 2012 resulting in increased attention of many scholars and governments mishra and singh 2010 andreadis and lettenmaier 2006 according to the multiple levels of water shortage drought can be divided into meteorological hydrological agricultural and socioeconomic drought jiang et al 2019 dehghani and zargar 2019 chen et al 2019 wang et al 2020 however hydrological drought is usually characterized by an unusual low flow of rivers or low water levels in lakes van loon and van lanen 2013 which are very vulnerable to human activities xia et al 2019 moreover the occurrence of hydrological drought has serious impacts on ecosystems coto et al 2015 whitehead et al 2015 socio economic systems aranda et al 2012 and public water systems stahl et al 2016 especially when severe droughts with longer durations may have serious impacts on water supply mao et al 2015 many studies have analyzed the impact of different human impacts such as human water intake reservoir regulation and land cover change on hydrological and drought processes jiang et al 2019 wu et al 2019 yuan et al 2018 however because there are many ways to define drought different evaluation methods also have their own evaluation criteria for its characteristics based on different variables heim and brewer 2012 parry et al 2016 for example several standardized drought indices have been proposed to obtain a wide range of hydrological drought characteristics such as the palmer hydrological drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 surface water supply index swsi garen 1993 and standardized runoff index sri vicente serrano et al 2011 it is noted that sri is more widely accepted because of its simple calculation inclusiveness of multiple time scales and less input compared with pdsi and swsi wang et al 2020 meanwhile the use of run theory to extract drought characteristics which is simple convenient and can extract multiple drought characteristics from drought index series has been widely used in drought characteristics recognition mccabe et al 2017 wu et al 2017 to foster the standardization of hydrological drought evaluation it is worth promoting sri and run theory because many drought disasters are related to intricate hydrological factors a comprehensive analysis of the different types of hydrological drought propagation e g drought development dd maximum intensity mi drought termination dt is crucial for drought control apurv et al 2017 van lanen et al 2016 for example the concept of hydrological drought termination duration dtd is defined as the time required for water replenishment from mi to normal water volume thomas et al 2014 a slow drought begins due to a period of insufficient precipitation while a short term heavy rainfall event may terminate the drought tallaksen and van lanen 2004 however the sub duration of the hydrological drought event namely dd duration ddd and dtd are usually ignored parry et al 2016 even with the complexity and concealment of hydrological drought it is difficult to predict and track its propagation dai 2011 van lanen et al 2016 wood et al 2015 how drought occurs develops sustains and terminates is not fully understood van loon and van lanen 2013 wood et al 2015 although many studies have attempted to characterize the different drought durations and examined the corresponding questions and knowledge gaps these have not yet been answered parry et al 2016 therefore the focus of this study is to explore the characteristics of changes in the dd and dt under the influence of human beings which is essential for improving the prediction of hydrological drought propagation and establishing a reliable drought monitoring system the aksu river basin is located in the tarim basin in northwest china nie et al 2020 due to the temperate continental climate precipitation is low and the river runoff mainly depends on ice and snow meltwater chen et al 2016 therefore agricultural development is dominated by irrigation chen et al 2016 recently agricultural water use has increased greatly while drought events have plagued the development of the social economy under global change in the aksu river basin chen et al 2016 previous studies have focused on the analysis of the frequency return period and duration of hydrological drought yang et al 2019 wang et al 2013 xiang et al 2020 however these analyses of hydrological drought cannot provide effective information for future drought warnings therefore the objectives of this study are as follows 1 to analyze and study the abrupt relationship between precipitation and runoff in the aksu river basin 2 to reveal the applicability of clm dtgvm in historical and future hydrological processes in the aksu river basin under climate change and the possible driving factors of changes in runoff and 3 to quantitatively analyze the variation in runoff at different time scales and the characteristics of hydrological drought at multiple durations in the aksu river basin based on run theory 2 study area the aksu river basin is located in the alluvial plain of the northwest tarim basin it is located between 40 n 41 35 n and 78 47 e 82 43 e nie et al 2020 fig 1 the region has a typical temperate continental climate with hot summers cold swinters and little precipitation yang et al 2018 in this region agriculture is a typical oasis irrigated agriculture which completely relies on surface irrigation projects and groundwater extraction it is an important production base for grain cotton melon and fruit crops in xinjiang thevs et al 2015 in recent years the economic development in the aksu area has led to a significant increase in water consumption and water demand in the basin and a continuous decline in groundwater level which has affected agricultural production and ecosystem security resulting in the gradual degradation of important ecosystems chen et al 2016 therefore using a hydrological model to simulate regional hydrological processes and drought characteristics has important practical significance for water resource utilization and ecological security evaluation 3 method and materials 3 1 method 3 1 1 standardized runoff index the standardized drain analysis toolbox sdat proposed by farahmand and agha 2015 was used to calculate the sri this method not only reflects the meteorological drought represented by precipitation but also reflects the hydrological drought represented by runoff without considering the representative parameter distribution farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 it can also be presented at different time scales e g 1 2 3 n and levels e g table 1 in addition this method has been used in many regions and in multiple kinds of drought research e g xiang et al 2020 yang et al 2018 3 1 2 definition of drought characteristics according to the run theory hydrological drought has many characteristics e g frequency duration and mi which is consistent with meteorological drought dracup et al 1980 saghafian and mehdikhani 2014 generally the dd can be divided into two periods i e ddd and dtd mishra and singh 2010 parry et al 2016 fig 2 while ddd is the period from the onset of drought events to the mi dtd is generally considered as the period from the mi to the critical value of the wet period wu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 however the key point to distinguish whether it is a drought event or a wet event is to determine the threshold value in this study the threshold is determined according to the dry and wet characteristic values of the standardized runoff index sri and a drought event is defined as a drought event for more than three consecutive months several concepts and formulas related to drought characteristics are as follows 1 m i m a x 0 5 sris i 0 5 2 d d t dt t dd 1 3 d d d t mi t onset 1 4 d t d t dt t mi 1 5 d d d e f i t dd onset dd mi s r i s t 6 d t d e f i t t mi t dt s r i s t 7 d

deficit of dt rate of dd and rate of dt respectively 3 1 3 downscaling of future scenario data there are many global climate models gcms with different data quality therefore it is necessary to select a better global climate model before downscaling in this study the determinate method proposed by fu et al 2013 was applied to determine the most appropriate gcm the remaining models with good performance can be used to drive the hydrological model i e clm dtvgm the method is as follows 9 rs j i 1 n w i x i j x i m i n x i m a x x i m i n 9 where x i j x i max x i min and ωi represent the relative error the maximum and minimum values of the ith index in all gcms and the weight of the ith index respectively i j and n represent the order numbers of the evaluated index gcms and the number of evaluated indices respectively then the downscaling methods explained by zhang et al 2015 is as follows 10 p fc i p future i p baseline i 1 100 t fc i t future i t baseline i where pfuture i and tfuture i pfc i t fc i pbaseline i and tbaseline i indicate the average precipitation and temperature in the ith month in the future and the adjustment coefficients for precipitation and temperature in the ith month the average precipitation and temperature in the ith month in the baseline period respectively here the periods 1980 2010 and 2010 2100 were considered as the baseline period and future period respectively 3 1 4 clm dtvgm clm dtvgm is a large scale hydrological model that couples the community land model 3 5 clm 3 5 proposed by the institute of atmospheric physics chinese academy of sciences with the distributed time variant gain model dtvgm proposed by xia 2002 zhan et al 2013 dtvgm model has advantages based on nonlinear hydrological system theory and hydrological response unit simulation while clm large scale hydrological model has advantages based on large scale and grid zhan et al 2013 therefore runoff is calculated by a nonlinear method and the flow concentration is simulated on the grid based on the hydrological response unit for clm dtvgm zhan et al 2013 this model has new data set requirements e g medium resolution remote sensing products

applied in small and medium sized basins in semi arid and semi humid regions li et al 2009 song et al 2011 the indicators used for model evaluation mainly include the nash coefficient nse correlation

materials 3 2 1 hydrological data and meteorological data the hydrological data series mainly involved three hydrological stations including shaliguilak xieheala and alaer all of which were from the china hydrological yearbook with a period of 1980 2010 moreover the shaliguilak and xieheala hydrological stations are located in the upper reaches of the aksu river basin while the alaer hydrological station is located in the irrigation region of the middle lower reaches of the aksu river basin in addition there are three weather stations included in this study including aksu aheqi and keping the major meteorological elements are precipitation temperature and relative humidity for the period of 1980 2010 from the china meteorological administration available at http data cma cn fig 1 3 2 2 the

on the method described in section 3 1 3 before driving hydrological models table 2 3 2 3 land use data the land use data used in this study are mainly from the resource and environmental science and data center of the chinese academy of sciences available at http www resdc cn its spatial resolution is 1 km 1 km and the temporal resolution is ten years e g 1980 1990 2000 and 2010 the main types of land use are cultivated land waterbody grassland woodland residential land and unused land 4 result 4 1 analysis of historical runoff in the aksu river basin table 3 describes the mann kendall mk test and pettitt tests for the precipitation and runoff in the aksu river basin it can be seen that both precipitation and runoff in the upper reaches of the aksu river basin increased with a maximum increase of 3 3 mm for precipitation and a maximum increase of 1 2 m3 s for runoff based on the mk test however both precipitation and runoff in the alaer station below the irrigation area of the aksu river basin show a decreasing trend meanwhile the pettitt test was further used to reveal the abrupt time change of precipitation and runoff it was found that the abrupt point of change in precipitation in the mountainous regions was in 1991 and 1993 at a 95 significance level while that of runoff in the mountain region appeared in 1993 with a significance level of 99 however although there was no abrupt change in precipitation in the irrigation region there was a significant change in runoff with a significance level of 99 in previous study the abrupt change in precipitation and runoff synchronously or immediately implied that human activities had a serious impact on the runoff wang et al 2020 subsequently a double cumulative curve of precipitation and runoff was applied to explore their resonance relationship e g fig 3 it was found that the changes in precipitation and runoff were consistent at the shaliguilanke station but not at xieheala and alaer station moreover previous studies also found that the increase in runoff in the mountain region of the aksu river basin was not caused by human activities i e tao et al 2016 wang et al 2019 therefore the mutation here cannot be regarded as being caused by human activities human activities usually have direct or indirect impacts on inland flow through cultivated land reclamation irrigation groundwater extraction and fertilization wang et al 2020 fig 4 shows the changes in land use in the aksu river basin in different periods from 1980 to 1990 most of the waterbodies 85 became unused land and grassland and the conversion between grassland and unused land was similar some of the cultivated land 50 became unused land and part of grassland while unused land was dominant for land use from 1990 to 2000 the conversion share of grassland and unused land was almost equal 12 and the conversion between them was the main feature of this period and other types of changes were not obvious the conversion of land use types in the aksu river basin was not significant and only a small part of land use changed between 2000 and 2010 the water body also mainly turned into unused land 50 and grassland 50 from 1980 to 2018 regarding cultivated land parts of it turned to grassland and unused land it seemed that the cultivated land did not change obviously from 1980 to 2018 however the cultivated land in the aksu region increased year by year from 2005 to 2014 according to the statistical data and the increase was more obvious in 2008 fig 5 in addition although the population of the region increased the per capita cultivated land area also increased which inevitably increased the pressure on water resources and then changed the water cycle and water resources system 4 2 simulation of historical runoff in the aksu river basin fig 6 shows the hydrological process simulation in the aksu river basin and table 4 displays the simulation evaluation of the clm dtvgm in the aksu river basin according to the abrupt change point monitored by the pettitt test the historical hydrological time series was divided into two sections namely disturbed and undisturbed periods moreover the undisturbed period was further divided into a calibration period and verification period based on the conventional hydrological model simulation demand see table 4 it was found that the nash coefficients of the three hydrological stations in the calibration period were all above 0 7 the relative error was between 0 3 and the correlation coefficients were all above 0 9 the nash coefficients in the verification period were all above 0 65 the relative error was within 0 25 and the correlation coefficients were above 0 85 the nash coefficients in the disturbed period were all above 0 6 the relative error was within 0 35 and the correlation coefficients were above 0 85 therefore clm dtvgm can be applied in the simulation of the hydrological process in the aksu river basin 4 3 simulation of future runoff in the aksu river basin based on cmip5 based on the model parameters obtained from the historical runoff simulation and the major meteorological factors in the aksu river basin after being downscaled from cmip5 fig 7 the future runoff in the aksu river basin was simulated fig 8 from the spatial distribution of downscaled annual precipitation and temperature the precipitation in the west of the aksu river basin was higher than that in the east in the future scenarios fig 7a d and g but the temperature in the west was lower than that in the east fig 7b e and h however the precipitation fluctuated frequently under the three scenarios i e rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 and the temperature in the aksu river basin was predicted to gradually increase in the future fig 7c f l fig 8 shows the future runoff in the aksu river basin simulated by clm dtvgm under the three scenarios under these three scenarios the runoff in the three hydrological stations fluctuated greatly in the time series generally these three hydrological stations would have relatively poor runoff during 2010 2030 and 2070 2080 while they would be relatively rich under the three scenarios during 2030 2060 and 2080 2100 fig 8a 8c and 8e in addition the runoff under the scenario of rcp4 5 would be significantly higher than that under the rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 scenarios for the shaliguilanke and alaer stations for the xiehela station the runoff under rcp2 6 scenarios would be significantly more than that under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios fig 8b d and f 4 4 analysis of the characteristics of hydrological drought in the aksu river basin fig 9 illustrates the percentiles e g 95 75 50 and 25 of the historical and future drought characteristics i e dd ddd dtd dmi dd rate dt rate dd def and dt def in typical hydrological stations it was found that the span of drought characteristics increased with an increase in the sri time scale for example the dd of sri3 sri6 sri12 and sri24 were almost less than 10 months 15 months 20 months and 24 months respectively the ddd of sri3 and sri6 were almost less than 10 months and that of sri12 and sri24 were almost less than 15 months the dtd of sri3 and sri6 were almost shorter than 5 months while that of sri12 sri24 were almost 10 months 20 months respectively for the dmi almost all of them were below 2 in terms of ddrate and dtrate almost all of them were below 1 unit month moreover the dddef and dtdef from sri3 and sri6 were below 10 and those from sri12 and sri24 were below 40 the percentiles of dddef and dtdef at corresponding time scales were basically consistent with each other table 5 shows the mean values of different drought characteristics in different drought events in the aksu river basin it was found that the drought duration e g dd ddd and dtd of different durations also increased with an increase in the time scale sri fig 10 shows the percentage of seasons of dd mi and dt occurrence at different hydrological stations at different time scales in the aksu river basin different columns represent different drought characteristics while rows represent time series of different scales i e sri3 sri6 sri12 and sri24 at different hydrological stations it was found that the occurrence of drought characteristics quantified by varied by season at different time scales for different hydrological stations for example spring summer autumn and winter accounted for dd 19 44 31 and 6 occurrence respectively in the historical sri3 of shaliguilanke the mi occurred in spring summer autumn and winter for 30 28 18 and 24 respectively in the rcp2 6 sri3 of shaliguilanke table 5 shows the mean values of different drought characteristics for different drought events it was found that the longer the time scale of sri the greater the mean value of drought characteristics the mean value of ddd was longer than that of dtd and the mean values of ddrate and dtrate decreased with the increase in time scale in addition the mean values of dddef and dtdef increased with an increase in time scale in order to further analyze the drought characteristics the maximum percentage of dd dmi and dt and the corresponding seasons for all drought events were extracted fig 11 a d it was found that the maximum percentage i e 27 45 of the occurrence seasons for dd dmi and dt at different time scales accounted for the vast majority followed by the maximum percentage of occurrence seasons between 45 and 65 and even less when the maximum percentage of occurrence season was between 65 and 100 under the historical and future scenarios in addition the season of maximum percentage of drought characteristics i e dd mi and dt was winter followed by spring and summer and the minimum was autumn for the historical period the season of maximum percentage of dd was mainly summer and for rcp 2 6 the season of maximum percentage was mainly spring however for drought events with a slightly longer time scale the seasons of maximum percentage of drought characteristics was concentrated in winter and spring 45 65 fig 11b 11e while for drought events shorter than 6 months the season of maximum drought characteristics was mainly concentrated in winter and spring 20 45 fig 11c f 4 5 quantitative analysis of the effects of natural and human activities on drought events although the precipitation and runoff had a seemingly resonant mutation it was not regarded as an effect of human activities based on the previous research results wang et al 2020 here the runoff mutation of the alaer hydrological station was taken as the carrier of human activities because it is located in the oasis irrigation area and was deeply affected by population and human agricultural activities table 6 presents a comparison of drought characteristics before and after substantial human activities the results implied that the dd ddd and dtd of sri3 and sri6 were significantly longer under the influence of human activities while that of dtd in sri6 and sri12 was significantly shorter in addition the maximum intensity of drought at the alaer hydrological station was significantly enhanced under the influence of human activities furthermore under the influence of human activities the ddr and dtr in the aksu river basin decreased significantly while dddef and dtdef increased significantly this indicates that human beings aggravated the drought characteristics in the aksu river basin 5 discussion 5 1 analysis of dominant factors of runoff abrupt change the aksu river basin which receives little precipitation is located in the northwest arid area of china the runoff is mainly supplied by ice and snow melting water agricultural development in the basin mainly depends on runoff or groundwater extraction chen et al 2016 therefore the changes in ice and snowmelt water and agricultural irrigation water would have a significant impact on the runoff of the basin chen et al 2018 previous studies have found that the runoff of the aksu river basin has changed significantly with the aggravation of climate change and human activities wang et al 2013 yang et al 2019 combining the grace gldas product and water balance method yang et al 2015 pointed out that the terrestrial water storage in the tarim river basin decreased obviously due to groundwater extraction by agricultural activities both deng et al 2019 and yang et al 2017 revealed that there was an obvious terrestrial water storage deficit in the tienshan mountains that is the ice and snow accumulation rate in the tienshan mountains was far less than the ice and snow melting rate as for the dominant factors of snow and ice melting previous studies attributed it to the increase in the height of the zero degree temperature layer in summer as a consequence of climate change and the snow line was more exposed to the position below the zero degree temperature line chen et al 2016 5 2 drought events in the aksu river basin it should be noted that the results of this study and yang et al 2019 used the same model and obtained very similar results el tantawi et al 2019 the extraction of water for agricultural development is seriously limiting the water available for the ecological environment wang et al 2013 yang et al 2015 water security problems are prominent and drought events often occur in the aksu river basin zhu et al 2018 for example in the aksu river there tends to be a rapid transition between hydrological drought and meteorological drought and therefore is deeply affected by hydro meteorological drought sun et al 2016 while the western and eastern regions of the aksu river basin are prone to drought the central part of the aksu river basin is relatively resilient to drought zhu et al 2018 the precipitation trend shows an abrupt change in 1986 in the aksu river basin tao et al 2016 in terms of historical hydrological drought characteristics the results this study are congruent with findings of wang et al 2019 therefore the results are reliable and can provide a theoretical basis and technical support for basin drought identification 5 3 the deficiency and limitation of the method although the hydrological model can effectively identify the impact of human activities on drought status in a basin different methods or evaluation criteria for drought evaluation are not consistent resulting in inconsistent definitions of drought characteristics heim and brewer 2012 parry et al 2016 therefore similar to the study of xiang et al 2020 the unified threshold of the standard index was selected in addition the concepts and drought characteristic indicators used have been widely used and practiced parry et al 2016 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2019 nevertheless there is some uncertainty in these concepts and definitions for example due to the integrity and comprehensiveness of river flow in the spatial and temporal scales the dd is only the runoff reduction rather than the drought beginning and the dt may not fully compensate for the drought deficit in the dd parry et al 2016 as a result this leads to uncertainty in the defined characteristics of dd or dt in addition the drought occurrence do dd and dt of events is a sophisticated process of multiple factor interactions li et al 2020 zhong et al 2020 the impact of various human activities in a region or watershed will inevitably change the do dd and dt wang et al 2020 therefore the extension of the definition of drought characteristics needs to be adapted to local conditions time and many other factors should be considered in the application process of clm dtvgm the parameters need to be determined zhan et al 2013 there are many methods to determine parameters and there are many kinds of parameters to be determined zhang et al 2015 the sensitivity of each parameter is not similar and they are intertwined with each other in the process of hydrological simulation zhang et al 2015 therefore there are many uncertainties in the process of parameter calibration and verification however the results of calibration validation and disturbed periods of the hydrological model presented in this study are ideal and can fully meet the needs of drought simulation in the aksu river basin table 4 however in general the characteristics of watershed rewetting or drought termination cannot be well simulated in the hydrological model which also brings some uncertainty to the research results birkel et al 2011 wang et al 2020 meanwhile the non stationarity of runoff would affect the selection of the threshold value and then lead to the uncertainty of drought discrimination results if the non stationarity of runoff can be considered in the identification of drought characteristics in future research the hydrological drought characteristics would be more easily quantified wanders and wada 2015 wang et al 2020 6 conclusion based on historical observation data clm dtvgm and cmip5 data this study simulated the historical hydrological runoff changes and future runoff changes based on the statistical method used to distinguish the periods of human activities and natural runoff this study revealed the historical hydrological drought characteristics and possible future hydrological drought characteristics in the aksu river basin under a changing environment the conclusions are as follows 1 both precipitation and runoff in the upper reaches of the aksu river basin were increasing with the maximum increase of precipitation reaching 3 3 mm and the maximum increase of runoff being up to 1 2 m3 s there were obvious abrupt changes in precipitation and runoff but the abrupt changes in precipitation and runoff were not synchronous this implies that human activities only have a significant impact on runoff change in alaer station 2 under the changing environment the lucc in the aksu river basin changed obviously and different types of land use types were also constantly changing especially in recent decades the cultivated land area in the basin has been increasing nevertheless clm gtvgm can be applied to hydrological process simulation in the aksu river basin 3 the drought characteristics in the aksu river basin increased with an increase in the time scale of sri generally dd mi and dt mainly occurred in winter followed by spring summer and autumn human

increased significantly under climate change dai 2011 palmer et al 2008 sheffield et al 2012 resulting in increased attention of many scholars and governments mishra and singh 2010 andreadis and lettenmaier 2006 according to the multiple levels of water shortage drought can be divided into meteorological hydrological agricultural and socioeconomic drought jiang et al 2019 dehghani and zargar 2019 chen et al 2019 wang et al 2020 however hydrological drought is usually characterized by an unusual low flow of rivers or low water levels in lakes van loon and van lanen 2013 which are very vulnerable to human activities xia et al 2019 moreover the occurrence of hydrological drought has serious impacts on ecosystems coto et al 2015 whitehead et al 2015 socio economic systems aranda et al 2012 and public water systems stahl et al 2016 especially when severe droughts with longer durations may have serious impacts on water supply mao et al 2015 many studies have analyzed the impact of different human impacts such as human water intake reservoir regulation and land cover change on hydrological and drought processes jiang et al 2019 wu et al 2019 yuan et al 2018 however because there are many ways to define drought different evaluation methods also have their own evaluation criteria for its characteristics based on different variables heim and brewer 2012 parry et al 2016 for example several standardized drought indices have been proposed to obtain a wide range of hydrological drought characteristics such as the palmer hydrological drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 surface water supply index swsi garen 1993 and standardized runoff index sri vicente serrano et al 2011 it is noted that sri is more widely accepted because of its simple calculation inclusiveness of multiple time scales and less input compared with pdsi and swsi wang et al 2020 meanwhile the use of run theory to extract drought characteristics which is simple convenient and can extract multiple drought characteristics from drought index series has been widely used in drought characteristics recognition mccabe et al 2017 wu et al 2017 to foster the standardization of hydrological drought evaluation it is worth promoting sri and run theory because many drought disasters are related to intricate hydrological factors a comprehensive analysis of the different types of hydrological drought propagation e g drought development dd maximum intensity mi drought termination dt is crucial for drought control apurv et al 2017 van lanen et al 2016 for example the concept of hydrological drought termination duration dtd is defined as the time required for water replenishment from mi to normal water volume thomas et al 2014 a slow drought begins due to a period of insufficient precipitation while a short term heavy rainfall event may terminate the drought tallaksen and van lanen 2004 however the sub duration of the hydrological drought event namely dd duration ddd and dtd are usually ignored parry et al 2016 even with the complexity and concealment of hydrological drought it is difficult to predict and track its propagation dai 2011 van lanen et al 2016 wood et al 2015 how drought occurs develops sustains and terminates is not fully understood van loon and van lanen 2013 wood et al 2015 although many studies have attempted to characterize the different drought durations and examined the corresponding questions and knowledge gaps these have not yet been answered parry et al 2016 therefore the focus of this study is to explore the characteristics of changes in the dd and dt under the influence of human beings which is essential for improving the prediction of hydrological drought propagation and establishing a reliable drought monitoring system the aksu river basin is located in the tarim basin in northwest china nie et al 2020 due to the temperate continental climate precipitation is low and the river runoff mainly depends on ice and snow meltwater chen et al 2016 therefore agricultural development is dominated by irrigation chen et al 2016 recently agricultural water use has increased greatly while drought events have plagued the development of the social economy under global change in the aksu river basin chen et al 2016 previous studies have focused on the analysis of the frequency return period and duration of hydrological drought yang et al 2019 wang et al 2013 xiang et al 2020 however these analyses of hydrological drought cannot provide effective information for future drought warnings therefore the objectives of this study are as follows 1 to analyze and study the abrupt relationship between precipitation and runoff in the aksu river basin 2 to reveal the applicability of clm dtgvm in historical and future hydrological processes in the aksu river basin under climate change and the possible driving factors of changes in runoff and 3 to quantitatively analyze the variation in runoff at different time scales and the characteristics of hydrological drought at multiple durations in the aksu river basin based on run theory 2 study area the aksu river basin is located in the alluvial plain of the northwest tarim basin it is located between 40 n 41 35 n and 78 47 e 82 43 e nie et al 2020 fig 1 the region has a typical temperate continental climate with hot summers cold swinters and little precipitation yang et al 2018 in this region agriculture is a typical oasis irrigated agriculture which completely relies on surface irrigation projects and groundwater extraction it is an important production base for grain cotton melon and fruit crops in xinjiang thevs et al 2015 in recent years the economic development in the aksu area has led to a significant increase in water consumption and water demand in the basin and a continuous decline in groundwater level which has affected agricultural production and ecosystem security resulting in the gradual degradation of important ecosystems chen et al 2016 therefore using a hydrological model to simulate regional hydrological processes and drought characteristics has important practical significance for water resource utilization and ecological security evaluation 3 method and materials 3 1 method 3 1 1 standardized runoff index the standardized drain analysis toolbox sdat proposed by farahmand and agha 2015 was used to calculate the sri this method not only reflects the meteorological drought represented by precipitation but also reflects the hydrological drought represented by runoff without considering the representative parameter distribution farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 it can also be presented at different time scales e g 1 2 3 n and levels e g table 1 in addition this method has been used in many regions and in multiple kinds of drought research e g xiang et al 2020 yang et al 2018 3 1 2 definition of drought characteristics according to the run theory hydrological drought has many characteristics e g frequency duration and mi which is consistent with meteorological drought dracup et al 1980 saghafian and mehdikhani 2014 generally the dd can be divided into two periods i e ddd and dtd mishra and singh 2010 parry et al 2016 fig 2 while ddd is the period from the onset of drought events to the mi dtd is generally considered as the period from the mi to the critical value of the wet period wu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 however the key point to distinguish whether it is a drought event or a wet event is to determine the threshold value in this study the threshold is determined according to the dry and wet characteristic values of the standardized runoff index sri and a drought event is defined as a drought event for more than three consecutive months several concepts and formulas related to drought characteristics are as follows 1 m i m a x 0 5 sris i 0 5 2 d d t dt t dd 1 3 d d d t mi t onset 1 4 d t d t dt t mi 1 5 d d d e f i t dd onset dd mi s r i s t 6 d t d e f i t t mi t dt s r i s t 7 d

deficit of dt rate of dd and rate of dt respectively 3 1 3 downscaling of future scenario data there are many global climate models gcms with different data quality therefore it is necessary to select a better global climate model before downscaling in this study the determinate method proposed by fu et al 2013 was applied to determine the most appropriate gcm the remaining models with good performance can be used to drive the hydrological model i e clm dtvgm the method is as follows 9 rs j i 1 n w i x i j x i m i n x i m a x x i m i n 9 where x i j x i max x i min and ωi represent the relative error the maximum and minimum values of the ith index in all gcms and the weight of the ith index respectively i j and n represent the order numbers of the evaluated index gcms and the number of evaluated indices respectively then the downscaling methods explained by zhang et al 2015 is as follows 10 p fc i p future i p baseline i 1 100 t fc i t future i t baseline i where pfuture i and tfuture i pfc i t fc i pbaseline i and tbaseline i indicate the average precipitation and temperature in the ith month in the future and the adjustment coefficients for precipitation and temperature in the ith month the average precipitation and temperature in the ith month in the baseline period respectively here the periods 1980 2010 and 2010 2100 were considered as the baseline period and future period respectively 3 1 4 clm dtvgm clm dtvgm is a large scale hydrological model that couples the community land model 3 5 clm 3 5 proposed by the institute of atmospheric physics chinese academy of sciences with the distributed time variant gain model dtvgm proposed by xia 2002 zhan et al 2013 dtvgm model has advantages based on nonlinear hydrological system theory and hydrological response unit simulation while clm large scale hydrological model has advantages based on large scale and grid zhan et al 2013 therefore runoff is calculated by a nonlinear method and the flow

applied in small and medium sized basins in semi arid and semi humid regions li et al 2009 song et al 2011 the indicators used for model evaluation mainly include the nash coefficient nse correlation

materials 3 2 1 hydrological data and meteorological data the hydrological data series mainly involved three hydrological stations including shaliguilak xieheala and alaer all of which were from the china hydrological yearbook with a period of 1980 2010 moreover the shaliguilak and xieheala hydrological stations are located in the upper reaches of the aksu river basin while the alaer hydrological station is located in the irrigation region of the middle lower reaches of the aksu river basin in addition there are three weather stations included in this study including aksu aheqi and keping the major meteorological elements are precipitation temperature and relative humidity for the period of 1980 2010 from the china meteorological administration available at http data cma cn fig 1 3 2 2 the

on the method described in section 3 1 3 before driving hydrological models table 2 3 2 3 land use data the land use data used in this study are mainly from the resource and environmental science and data center of the chinese academy of sciences available at http www resdc cn its spatial resolution is 1 km 1 km and the temporal resolution is ten years e g 1980 1990 2000 and 2010 the main types of land use are cultivated land waterbody grassland woodland residential land and unused land 4 result 4 1 analysis of historical runoff in the aksu river basin table 3 describes the mann kendall mk test and pettitt tests for the precipitation and runoff in the aksu river basin it can be seen that both precipitation and runoff in the upper reaches of the aksu river basin increased with a maximum increase of 3 3 mm for precipitation and a maximum increase of 1 2 m3 s for runoff based on the mk test however both precipitation and runoff in the alaer station below the irrigation area of the aksu river basin show a decreasing trend meanwhile the pettitt test was further used to reveal the abrupt time change of precipitation and runoff it was found that the abrupt point of change in precipitation in the mountainous regions was in 1991 and 1993 at a 95 significance level while that of runoff in the mountain region appeared in 1993 with a significance level of 99 however although there was no abrupt change in precipitation in the irrigation region there was a significant change in runoff with a significance level of 99 in previous study the abrupt change in precipitation and runoff synchronously or immediately implied that human activities had a serious impact on the runoff wang et al 2020 subsequently a double cumulative curve of precipitation and runoff was applied to explore their resonance relationship e g fig 3 it was found that the changes in precipitation and runoff were consistent at the shaliguilanke station but not at xieheala and alaer station moreover previous studies also found that the increase in runoff in the mountain region of the aksu river basin was not caused by human activities i e tao et al 2016 wang et al 2019 therefore the mutation here cannot be regarded as being caused by human activities human activities usually have direct or indirect impacts on inland flow through cultivated land reclamation irrigation groundwater extraction and fertilization wang et al 2020 fig 4 shows the changes in land use in the aksu river basin in different periods from 1980 to 1990 most of the waterbodies 85 became unused land and grassland and the conversion between grassland and unused land was similar some of the cultivated land 50 became unused land and part of grassland while unused land was dominant for land use from 1990 to 2000 the conversion share of grassland and unused land was almost equal 12 and the conversion between them was the main feature of this period and other types of changes were not obvious the conversion of land use types in the aksu river basin was not significant and only a small part of land use changed between 2000 and 2010 the water body also mainly turned into unused land 50 and grassland 50 from 1980 to 2018 regarding cultivated land parts of it turned to grassland and unused land it seemed that the cultivated land did not change obviously from 1980 to 2018 however the cultivated land in the aksu region increased year by year from 2005 to 2014 according to the statistical data and the increase was more obvious in 2008 fig 5 in addition although the population of the region increased the per capita cultivated land area also increased which inevitably increased the pressure on water resources and then changed the water cycle and water resources system 4 2 simulation of historical runoff in the aksu river basin fig 6 shows the hydrological process simulation in the aksu river basin and table 4 displays the simulation evaluation of the clm dtvgm in the aksu river basin according to the abrupt change point monitored by the pettitt test the historical hydrological time series was divided into two sections namely disturbed and undisturbed periods moreover the undisturbed period was further divided into a calibration period and verification period based on the conventional hydrological model simulation demand see table 4 it was found that the nash coefficients of the three hydrological stations in the calibration period were all above 0 7 the relative error was between 0 3 and the correlation coefficients were all above 0 9 the nash coefficients in the verification period were all above 0 65 the relative error was within 0 25 and the correlation coefficients were above 0 85 the nash coefficients in the disturbed period were all above 0 6 the relative error was within 0 35 and the correlation coefficients were above 0 85 therefore clm dtvgm can be applied in the simulation of the hydrological process in the aksu river basin 4 3 simulation of future runoff in the aksu river basin based on cmip5 based on the model parameters obtained from the historical runoff simulation and the major meteorological factors in the aksu river basin after being downscaled from cmip5 fig 7 the future runoff in the aksu river basin was simulated fig 8 from the spatial distribution of downscaled annual precipitation and temperature the precipitation in the west of the aksu river basin was higher than that in the east in the future scenarios fig 7a d and g but the temperature in the west was lower than that in the east fig 7b e and h however the precipitation fluctuated frequently under the three scenarios i e rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 and the temperature in the aksu river basin was predicted to gradually increase in the future fig 7c f l fig 8 shows the future runoff in the aksu river basin simulated by clm dtvgm under the three scenarios under these three scenarios the runoff in the three hydrological stations fluctuated greatly in the time series generally these three hydrological stations would have relatively poor runoff during 2010 2030 and 2070 2080 while they would be relatively rich under the three scenarios during 2030 2060 and 2080 2100 fig 8a 8c and 8e in addition the runoff under the scenario of rcp4 5 would be significantly higher than that under the rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 scenarios for the shaliguilanke and alaer stations for the xiehela station the runoff under rcp2 6 scenarios would be significantly more than that under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios fig 8b d and f 4 4 analysis of the characteristics of hydrological drought in the aksu river basin fig 9 illustrates the percentiles e g 95 75 50 and 25 of the historical and future drought characteristics i e dd ddd dtd dmi dd rate dt rate dd def and dt def in typical hydrological stations it was found that the span of drought characteristics increased with an increase in the sri time scale for example the dd of sri3 sri6 sri12 and sri24 were almost less than 10 months 15 months 20 months and 24 months respectively the ddd of sri3 and sri6 were almost less than 10 months and that of sri12 and sri24 were almost less than 15 months the dtd of sri3 and sri6 were almost shorter than 5 months while that of sri12 sri24 were almost 10 months 20 months respectively for the dmi almost all of them were below 2 in terms of ddrate and dtrate almost all of them were below 1 unit month moreover the dddef and dtdef from sri3 and sri6 were below 10 and those from sri12 and sri24 were below 40 the percentiles of dddef and dtdef at corresponding time scales were basically consistent with each other table 5 shows the mean values of different drought characteristics in different drought events in the aksu river basin it was found that the drought duration e g dd ddd and dtd of different durations also increased with an increase in the time scale sri fig 10 shows the percentage of seasons of dd mi and dt occurrence at different hydrological stations at different time scales in the aksu river basin different columns represent different drought characteristics while rows represent time series of different scales i e sri3 sri6 sri12 and sri24 at different hydrological stations it was found that the occurrence of drought characteristics quantified by varied by season at different time scales for different hydrological stations for example spring summer autumn and winter accounted for dd 19 44 31 and 6 occurrence respectively in the historical sri3 of shaliguilanke the mi occurred in spring summer autumn and winter for 30 28 18 and 24 respectively in the rcp2 6 sri3 of shaliguilanke table 5 shows the mean values of different drought characteristics for different drought events it was found that the longer the time scale of sri the greater the mean value of drought characteristics the mean value of ddd was longer than that of dtd and the mean values of ddrate and dtrate decreased with the increase in time scale in addition the mean values of dddef and dtdef increased with an increase in time scale in order to further analyze the drought characteristics the maximum percentage of dd dmi and dt and the corresponding seasons for all drought events were extracted fig 11 a d it was found that the maximum percentage i e 27 45 of the occurrence seasons for dd dmi and dt at different time scales accounted for the vast majority followed by the maximum percentage of occurrence seasons between 45 and 65 and even less when the maximum percentage of occurrence season was between 65 and 100 under the historical and future scenarios in addition the season of maximum percentage of drought characteristics i e dd mi and dt was winter followed by spring and summer and the minimum was autumn for the historical period the season of maximum percentage of dd was mainly summer and for rcp 2 6 the season of maximum percentage was mainly spring however for drought events with a slightly longer time scale the seasons of maximum percentage of drought characteristics was concentrated in winter and spring 45 65 fig 11b 11e while for drought events shorter than 6 months the season of maximum drought characteristics was mainly concentrated in winter and spring 20 45 fig 11c f 4 5 quantitative analysis of the effects of natural and human activities on drought events although the precipitation and runoff had a seemingly resonant mutation it was not regarded as an effect of human activities based on the previous research results wang et al 2020 here the runoff mutation of the alaer hydrological station was taken as the carrier of human activities because it is located in the oasis irrigation area and was deeply affected by population and human agricultural activities table 6 presents a comparison of drought characteristics before and after substantial human activities the results implied that the dd ddd and dtd of sri3 and sri6 were significantly longer under the influence of human activities while that of dtd in sri6 and sri12 was significantly shorter in addition the maximum intensity of drought at the alaer hydrological station was significantly enhanced under the influence of human activities furthermore under the influence of human activities the ddr and dtr in the aksu river basin decreased significantly while dddef and dtdef increased significantly this indicates that human beings aggravated the drought characteristics in the aksu river basin 5 discussion 5 1 analysis of dominant factors of runoff abrupt change the aksu river basin which receives little precipitation is located in the northwest arid area of china the runoff is mainly supplied by ice and snow melting water agricultural development in the basin mainly depends on runoff or groundwater extraction chen et al 2016 therefore the changes in ice and snowmelt water and agricultural irrigation water would have a significant impact on the runoff of the basin chen et al 2018 previous studies have found that the runoff of the aksu river basin has changed significantly with the aggravation of climate change and human activities wang et al 2013 yang et al 2019 combining the grace gldas product and water balance method yang et al 2015 pointed out that the terrestrial water storage in the tarim river basin decreased obviously due to groundwater extraction by agricultural activities both deng et al 2019 and yang et al 2017 revealed that there was an obvious terrestrial water storage deficit in the tienshan mountains that is the ice and snow accumulation rate in the tienshan mountains was far less than the ice and snow melting rate as for the dominant factors of snow and ice melting previous studies attributed it to the increase in the height of the zero degree temperature layer in summer as a consequence of climate change and the snow line was more exposed to the position below the zero degree temperature line chen et al 2016 5 2 drought events in the aksu river basin it should be noted that the results of this study and yang et al 2019 used the same model and obtained very similar results el tantawi et al 2019 the extraction of water for agricultural development is seriously limiting the water available for the ecological environment wang et al 2013 yang et al 2015 water security problems are prominent and drought events often occur in the aksu river basin zhu et al 2018 for example in the aksu river there tends to be a rapid transition between hydrological drought and meteorological drought and therefore is deeply affected by hydro meteorological drought sun et al 2016 while the western and eastern regions of the aksu river basin are prone to drought the central part of the aksu river basin is relatively resilient to drought zhu et al 2018 the precipitation trend shows an abrupt change in 1986 in the aksu river basin tao et al 2016 in terms of historical hydrological drought characteristics the results this study are congruent with findings of wang et al 2019 therefore the results are reliable and can provide a theoretical basis and technical support for basin drought identification 5 3 the deficiency and limitation of the method although the hydrological model can effectively identify the impact of human activities on drought status in a basin different methods or evaluation criteria for drought evaluation are not consistent resulting in inconsistent definitions of drought characteristics heim and brewer 2012 parry et al 2016 therefore similar to the study of xiang et al 2020 the unified threshold of the standard index was selected in addition the concepts and drought characteristic indicators used have been widely used and practiced parry et al 2016 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2019 nevertheless there is some uncertainty in these concepts and definitions for example due to the integrity and comprehensiveness of river flow in the spatial and temporal scales the dd is only the runoff reduction rather than the drought beginning and the dt may not fully compensate for the drought deficit in the dd parry et al 2016 as a result this leads to uncertainty in the defined characteristics of dd or dt in addition the drought occurrence do dd and dt of events is a sophisticated process of multiple factor interactions li et al 2020 zhong et al 2020 the impact of various human activities in a region or watershed will inevitably change the do dd and dt wang et al 2020 therefore the extension of the definition of drought characteristics needs to be adapted to local conditions time and many other factors should be considered in the application process of clm dtvgm the parameters need to be determined zhan et al 2013 there are many methods to determine parameters and there are many kinds of parameters to be determined zhang et al 2015 the sensitivity of each parameter is not similar and they are intertwined with each other in the process of hydrological simulation zhang et al 2015 therefore there are many uncertainties in the process of parameter calibration and verification however the results of calibration validation and disturbed periods of the hydrological model presented in this study are ideal and can fully meet the needs of drought simulation in the aksu river basin table 4 however in general the characteristics of watershed rewetting or drought termination cannot be well simulated in the hydrological model which also brings some uncertainty to the research results birkel et al 2011 wang et al 2020 meanwhile the non stationarity of runoff would affect the selection of the threshold value and then lead to the uncertainty of drought discrimination results if the non stationarity of runoff can be considered in the identification of drought characteristics in future research the hydrological drought characteristics would be more easily quantified wanders and wada 2015 wang et al 2020 6 conclusion based on historical observation data clm dtvgm and cmip5 data this study simulated the historical hydrological runoff changes and future runoff changes based on the statistical method used to distinguish the periods of human activities and natural runoff this study revealed the historical hydrological drought characteristics and possible future hydrological drought characteristics in the aksu river basin under a changing environment the conclusions are as follows 1 both precipitation and runoff in the upper reaches of the aksu river basin were increasing with the maximum increase of precipitation reaching 3 3 mm and the maximum increase of runoff being up to 1 2 m3 s there were obvious abrupt changes in precipitation and runoff but the abrupt changes in precipitation and runoff were not synchronous this implies that human activities only have a significant impact on runoff change in alaer station 2 under the changing environment the lucc in the aksu river basin changed obviously and different types of land use types were also constantly changing especially in recent decades the cultivated land area in the basin has been increasing nevertheless clm gtvgm can be applied to hydrological process simulation in the aksu river basin 3 the drought characteristics in the aksu river basin increased with an increase in the time scale of sri generally dd mi and dt mainly occurred in winter followed by spring summer and autumn human activities have an obvious impact on drought characteristics in the aksu river basin under the changing environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

4647,the construction of dams and sluices dss is conducive to human development but affects river water quality wq and water ecology we seriously while many studies have explored the ds induced impact on hydrology water quality and water ecology the difference in ds regulations for different objectives and interests such as flood control power generation and ecological protection are not taken into the account although their impacts on wq and we are different discharge is the key factor to measure different ds regulation and its variation directly affects the long term wq and we in rivers thus studying short term multi scenario ds regulation with different discharge is very important for providing insights to their long term irregular management furthermore the relationships between discharges and the change of wq indicators are different in the upstream and downstream of dss and at different distance to dss in the downstream however it is not well understood how the wq and we indicators at upstream and downstream sites of dss change under different regulation scenarios in long term and short term using the monitored wq and we indicators at twelve sampling sites sps of six dss in the huai river basin hrb this study investigates the impact of long term irregular ds regulation on changes in wq and we indicators i e the long term regulation experiment ltre and then the relationship between the alteration of ds discharge flow and changes in wq indicators i e the short term regulation experiment stre under four scenarios with different flow magnitudes at one of sluices huaidian sluice the results of long term regulations show that the wq at downstream sites of most dss was worse than their corresponding upstream sites the similarity of we indicators at upstream and downstream sites of dss was low meaning the great impact of ds long term regulation on we the results of short term regulations show that small flow magnitude 20 m3 s in this study helps release and reduce upstream pollution of dss as it does not disturb downstream riverbed pollutions resulting in an increase of downstream river pollution further increasing flow magnitude 40 m3 s in this study helps reduce and release upstream pollution but increases river pollution significantly at downstream due to the release of pollutions in the sediments of downstream riverbed which may cause a great river ecological impact since pollutants cannot be diluted and degraded in time a flow magnitude about 60 m3 s can help release and rapidly dilute and degrade sediment pollutions in downstream riverbed however a larger flow magnitude may also be inappropriate due to the strong downstream riverbed erosion except for special regulation requirements this study can provide more insights for water resources management to develop long term ecological ds regulation schemes for in hrb and other similar ds dominated basins keywords dams and sluices water ecological experiment water quality and water ecology dam regulation huai river basin 1 introduction the construction of dss has always been a controversial topic okyereh et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 it provides great economic benefits while affecting water quality and ecology greatly on the one hand pollutions produced by human activity accumulates in river channels when gates of dss are closed and then releases with discharge flow when gates of dss are opened for flow regulation generating even greater wq and we impact than irregulated river channels watkins et al 2019 additionally if multiple dss are built on the river the naturally formed river channels will be separated into many artificially controlled river sections zhang et al 2012 leading to a significant reduction in water mobility which is more likely to cause river eutrophication and water pollution on the other hand the construction of dss blocks the interaction of aquatic organisms between the upstream and downstream of dss liu et al 2020a many aquatic organisms cannot transfer matter and energy freely as in the naturally connected rivers due to dss and even more seriously some of them will be eliminated while others will be retained to form new environmentally adaptive communities in long term therefore aquatic communities affected by different levels of human intervention may show different features and compositions due to the altered hydrological and environmental conditions according to nilsson et al 2005 and van looy et al 2014 over a half of the world s large river systems are affected by dams and the most of them are subjected to flow regulation it is worth noting that dam construction over the globe is expected to continuously increase in the future zarfl et al 2015 therefore wq and we have been and will continue to be affected by dss although many related studies have been conducted most of them mainly focus on the assessment of wq and we before and after construction removal of dss using experimental and statistical methods luo et al 2020 studied the impact of land use and urbanization on river water quality and ecology in the dam dominated shaying river basin of china thompson et al 2020 evaluated the short term impacts of dam rupture on the environment koutrakis et al 2018 quantified ecological flows in the highly regulated nestos river basin in northern greece by comparing fish species populations under different discharge conditions at downstream sites of dams wang et al 2018 studied the seasonal variability of cations and anions in the lower changjiang due to construction of three gorges dam in china hahn et al 2018 studied effects of dam draining on the mobility of pollutants stored in the bottom sediments van oorschot et al 2018 studied the combined impact of dam regulation and climate change on bio geomorphological processes and habitat suitability of several aquatic species davis et al 2017 investigated changes in sediment concentrations and fish community body burdens of heavy metals before and after two lowhead dam removals in the scioto and olentangy rivers in united states chen et al 2011 evaluated the structural properties of aquatic animals and their complex ecological relationships within the ecosystem before and after dam construction schmitz et al 2009 assessed the long term ecological response of downstream geomorphic and vegetation to dam removal however there are cases without sufficient monitoring data before the construction making the assessment difficult although all the abovementioned studies revealed the important impact of dss on wq and we and made great contribution to water resources management in ds dominated basins it is not well understood how the difference of wq and we indicators at upstream and downstream sites of dss change after long term regulation of dss furthermore the relationships between short term regulation of dss corresponding to different discharges and the change of wq indicators at the upstream and downstream sites of dss and at different distance to dss in the downstream were not well investigated these problems are critical as discharge is the key factor to measure different ds regulation and different regulations directly affect the long term wq and we in rivers further studies are needed to provide more insights for water resources management to develop long term ecological ds regulation schemes for in ds dominated basins in order to have a comprehensive understanding of the relationships of wq and we indicators against different regulations of dss this study designs two types of water ecological experiment based on our previous studies luo et al 2018 the long term regulation experiment ltre and the short term regulation experiment stre for monitoring wq and we indicators at upstream and downstream sites of dss in the hrb the long term in the first experiment means that the time after ds regulation started because most dss in hrb were built in the 1950s their long term irregular regulation operated about 70 years so far according to different objectives and interests such as flood control power generation and ecological protection might already cause significant differences in we indicators at upstream and downstream sites of dss such as richness diversity dominance and similarity a framework is then formed to compare the changes in wq and we indicators at upstream and downstream sites of dss with different discharge flow scenarios therefore based on the monitored wq and we indicators at upstream and downstream sites of dss over the hrb the specific objects of this studies are 1 to compare the difference of both wq and we indicators at upstream and downstream sites of dss after long term irregular regulation impact of dss in order to understand the impact of ds regulation on wq physical and chemical indicators eutrophication and heavy metals and we richness diversity dominance and similarity 2 to compare the difference of wq indicators at upstream and downstream sites of dss in different discharge flow scenarios in order to understand the relationship between discharges and the change of wq indicators at the upstream and downstream sites of dss and at different distance to dss this study can provide insights to the long term irregular regulations of dss with different objectives and interests such as flood control irrigation power generation and ecological protection the paper is organized as follows the study area of the hrb and water ecological experiment are introduced in the next section followed by proposed methods including an evaluation flowchart index system and evaluation methods for studying the impact of long short term regulation of dss on wq and we the results of wq and we impact of dss based on different discharge flow scenarios are summarized and discussed in sections 3 respectively the conclusions are finally summarized in section 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area huai river fig 1 as one of the seven largest rivers in china originates from tongbai mountain and locates between yangtze river and yellow river the two largest rivers in china zhao et al 2012 the drainage area of the hrb is about 270 000 km2 ma et al 2014 the annual average temperature is approximately 11 16 c and the annual average precipitation and runoff are 883 mm and 230 mm respectively the annual average evaporation is 900 1500 mm zhai et al 2017 the basin is under pressure of increasing wq deterioration and drastic decline in aquatic biodiversity since 1950s many dss have been built in the basin to regulate the unevenly distributed water resources in time and space which has a serious impact on wq and we so far over 5700 reservoirs and 5000 sluices have been built with a total storage capacity of 30 3 billion m3 accounting for 51 of the annual average runoff in the entire basin zhang et al 2015 according to the huai river water resources bulletin hrwrb http www hrc gov cn the length of rivers with wq belonging to class iv and class v by surface water environmental quality standard sweq of china accounts for about 23 4 and 8 5 of the total river lengths in the basin a total of five classes are defined in sweq in which the high level indicates the poor wq 2 2 assessment flowchart fig 2 is the framework for assessing the regulation impact of dss on wq and we in the hrb first in the ds regulation experiments the ltre and stre were designed and then the indicators of wq and we were monitored processed and classified for ltre six dss were selected in the hrb and twelve sps were set with six of them being located in upstream of dss and the remaining six ones in the downstream of dss fig 1 for stre huaidian sluice was selected as a case study where four sps were set with two of them being located in the upstream and the other two in the downstream of the sluice see fig 1 four regulation scenarios were designed by controlling the opening height of sluice gates at 0 cm 10 cm 20 cm and 30 cm which corresponds to discharge flows of 0 m3 s 20 m3 s 40 m3 s and 60 m3 s respectively the sluice has six gates and they are opened simultaneously in each regulation scenario in fact it is necessary to study the impacts of many different regulation scenarios for different objectives and interests of ds regulation as different magnitudes of discharge flow affect the changes of wq differently however different to laboratory experiment designing too many regulation scenarios in field experiment is impractical due to various difficulties such as permission from sluice management department more importantly the mutual influence between adjacent regulation scenarios was inevitable if too many regulation scenarios were designed therefore the above four regulation scenarios including discharge flow from small to large were designed in this study to see if the relationship between discharge and the change of water quality indicators remain the same as in the laboratory studies second wq indicators collected at upstream and downstream sites of each ds in ltre were compared in term of wq eutrophication and heavy metal status to assess wq changes affected by long term ds regulation in the basin the impact of multiple scenarios of discharge flow of dss on wq was investigated by comparing the changes in wq indicators at upstream and downstream sites of huaidian sluice based on stre experiment third the species composition and similarity at upstream and downstream sites of each ds were compared in term of richness diversity dominance and similarity to study the impact of long term ds regulation on river we based on ltre experiment finally the impact characteristics of ds regulation on wq and we were summarized and discussed 2 3 assessment indicators and methods the sps set in ltre and stre are show in fig 1 the data used in ltre and stre were collected in june from 2012 to 2017 and in 2014 respectively the sampling time of june was selected because river water volume in wet seasons june is abundant which can make it easier to implement our regulation scenarios of dss designed in the huaidian sluice although many studies have shown that long time series of data is necessary for flow regime studies kennard et al 2010 six years of monitoring data can support this study because the long term means the regulation time of dss in this study most dss in hrb were built in 1950s we use the monitored data to investigate the difference of wq and we between upstream and downstream sites of dss after their long term regulation impact rather than evaluating the long term changing processes of wq and we the monitored wq indicators in ltre include potential of hydrogen ph water temperature t electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do total dissolved solid tds transparency sd chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp chlorophyll a chla nitrate no3 sulfate so4 2 chloride cl fluoride f arsenic as selenium se cadmium cd chromium cr copper cu and nickel ni the monitored we indicators in ltre include habit environment quality and species of phytoplankton zooplankton zoobenthos the monitored wq indicators in stre include ph ec do ammonium nitrogen nh4 n permanganate index codmn tn tp nitrate nitrogen no3 n and 5 day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 different indicators were monitored in these two experiments because it is undoubted that both long term and short term regulation of dss will have an important impact on wq however the temporary changes of flow regime caused by short term regulation of dss generally do not cause obvious changes in we richness diversity dominance and similarity due to their environmental adaptabilities therefore it is not meaningful to consider the change of we in the impact of short term regulation of dss therefore we indicators were only considered in the ltre since some wq indicators were proved not to be the main factors affecting water pollution in the hrb based on the long term regulation experiment some wq indicators considered in the ltre were not considered in the stre the wq indicators ph tds t sd chla and ec were monitored by secchi disk hq11d portable ph orp mv meter exo sondes in the field directly for the rest wq indicators water samples a 1000 ml which are collected by polyethylene bottle from about 30 cm underwater were collected and then brought back to the laboratory for testing based on the standard of water and wastewater monitoring and analysis methods in china habit environment quality was scored in situ according to the river habitat evaluation standard in china see luo et al 2018 meng et al 2011 for detail the samples of phytoplankton zooplankton and zoobenthos were collected and counted according to freshwater animals survey technical specification in china no db43 t 432 2009 among them phytoplankton and zooplankton were counted using the counting chamber method and the number of zoobenthos was accurately counted according to different species at each sampling site the methods used in our study for wq and we assessment are summarized in table 1 water quality index wqi changes from 0 to 1 was calculated using fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method for assessing the effects of dss on wq in overlying water bodies based on indicators of ec do tds cod tn tp chla f cl so4 2 no3 river eutrophication was assessed because regulation of dss can slow down river mobility which easily leads to nutrient accumulation in riverbeds and causes a higher probability of eutrophication according to surface water environmental quality assessment methods sweqam in china trophic status index tsi was calculated based on indicators of ds tn tp cod and chla using methods in table 1 the geoaccumulation index igeo developed by müller 1986 was employed to assess heavy metal pollution at upstream and downstream sites of dss based on indicators of al fe ca mg na k cd cr pb cu and zn the biological richness abundance and diversity shannon wiener index swi were calculated to compare the alteration in composition of aquatic communities at upstream and downstream sites of dss travers et al 2018 jaccard s similarity coefficient jsc was employed to compare the similarity of aquatic communities at upstream and downstream sites of dss bennell et al 2010 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation of river water quality indicators the wq indicators monitored at the upstream and downstream sites of dss in ltre are plotted in fig 3 and the wqi at each sp is calculated and then plotted in fig 4 according to results shown in fig 3 the monitored wq indicators of cod tn f cl so4 2 and no3 were poor in the hrb their concentrations at the upstream sites of dss changed between 10 10 and 19 20 mg l 2 65 and 3 75 mg l 3 69 and 7 12 mg l 54 90 and 915 90 mg l 273 70 and 1172 02 mg l and 13 71 and 111 13 mg l respectively at the corresponding downstream sites their concentrations changed between 10 20 and 18 70 mg l 2 9 and 4 8 mg l 4 42 and 7 07 mg l 156 45 and 940 62 mg l 478 48 and 1273 67 mg l and 29 84 and 119 95 mg l respectively therefore the downstream sites of dss were more seriously polluted than upstream sites of dss over the basin in the long term irregular regulation scenario the results of water quality index given in fig 4 also showed a more serious water pollution at downstream sites of dss with wqi values of 0 50 0 47 0 26 0 36 0 34 and 0 23 at downstream sites of selected six dss see fig 1 which were lower than that at upstream sites of dss with wqi values of 0 58 0 47 0 34 0 42 0 40 and 0 33 more serious water pollution at downstream sites of dss might mainly relate to the impact of irregular flow magnitudes due to the irregular regulation of dss for economic and ecological benefits which forms a weak connectivity in the upstream and downstream of these dss because different requirements of ds regulation over time flood control irrigation power generation and ecological protection produce different magnitudes of discharge flow kuriqi et al 2019 on the one hand pollutions in the upstream of dss can enter the downstream when discharge flow is small liu et al 2020b in this case pollutions in downstream riverbed sediments will not be released due to the small flow magnitude however on the other hand when the discharge flow is large pollutions in downstream riverbed sediments will be released they both cause a more serious river pollution in downstream in addition to the direct regulation impact of dss there are some other reasons such as downstream domestic and industrial sewage discharge water depth to sediment and pollutant concentration in sediments more data are needed to consider these factors and it will be an important and interesting research topic in future study however the difference in wq changes at upstream and downstream sites of dss and at different distance to dss in the downstream is not well known under different discharge flow scenarios therefore a study on the relationship between the alteration of ds discharge flow and changes in wq indicators can provide insights to long term irregular ds regulation according to sweq most wq indicators mentioned above belonged to class iv or above mainly used for industrial and recreational water use particularly the concentrations of tn changing between 2 and 5 mg l with the average of 3 10 and 3 68 mg l at upstream and downstream sites of dss respectively were seriously exceeded the threshold of class v the most polluted water quality class in sweq the remaining wq indicators showed a moderate pollution with characteristics that downstream sites were worse than upstream sites as described above in addition most wq indicators at upstream and downstream sites of dss showed a consistent changing trend from upstream to downstream of the basin such as t ec do tds cod tn tp chla f cl so4 2 and no3 the results fully illustrated that water pollution at downstream sites of most dss was mainly caused by pollution inflow in upstream of dss followed by pollutions from downstream riverbed sediments for the long term irregular regulation scenario in the basin according to the monitored heavy metal indicators given in fig 3 most heavy metal indicators showed unobvious differences in the concentration at upstream and downstream sites of dss however there are some indicators showing a more serious heavy metal pollution at upstream sites of dss such as as and se and others showing a more severe heavy metal pollution at downstream sites of dss such as cr and cu according to the results of igeo shown in fig 5 the heavy metal pollution at most sps belonged to the uncontaminated level with the value of igeo 0 the igeo index also showed unobvious concentration differences at upstream and downstream sites of dss therefore regulation of dss has not caused a significant difference in heavy metal concentrations at upstream and downstream sites of dss in the basin 3 2 variation of river eutrophication the results of tsi in table 2 showed that the hrb belongs to a moderate eutrophication with the tsi changing between 57 33 and 69 42 in general eutrophication is less likely to occur in naturally flowing rivers with negligible human interference because nutrients are not conducive to enrichment in flowing rivers the eutrophication in the basin from tsi assessment and in situ investigation fully illustrated that the fluidity of water bodies was seriously affected by construction of multiple dss particularly when gates of dss were closed for water storage during dry seasons flow velocity between dss would be greatly reduced furthermore the nitrogen and phosphorus pollutant form domestic sewage were another important cause of eutrophication due to the dense population in the basin luo et al 2019 according to table 2 the results of tsi at downstream sites of dss changed between 59 91 and 69 42 with the average of 63 17 which were greater than that at their corresponding upstream sites with the tsi changed between 57 33 and 66 88 with the average of 61 88 indicating that eutrophication was more likely to occur at downstream sites of dss this may be caused by regulation of dss which makes nutrients easier to accumulate at downstream sites of dss this result is consistent with our conclusion in section 3 1 that the downstream sites of dss are more seriously polluted compared to their corresponding upstream sites in the hrb 3 3 variation of river water quality indicators in different short term regulation scenarios based on the analysis of wq indicator changes under long term irregular regulation of dss we concluded that downstream sites of dss showed a greater water pollution and the basin showed eutrophication however the flow magnitudes under long term irregular regulation vary and are determined by different function requirement of dss over time therefore the relationship between the alteration of ds discharge flow and the changes in wq indicators needs further study to provide references for long term ds regulation four short term regulation scenarios of dss with the discharge flow of 0 m3 s 20 m3 s 40 m3 s and 60 m3 s were conducted at huaidian sluice in this study wq samples were collected four hours later after each regulation scenario was implemented the time interval between two adjacent scheduling scenarios was greater than twelve hours to avoid their mutual influence nine indicators ph ec do nh4 n codmn tn tp no3 n and bod5 were monitored the variation of wq indicators in each regulation scenario is plotted in fig 6 from which it can be seen that the concentrations of wq indicators varied greatly and water pollution at downstream sites of the sluice 12 13 for most indicators was more serious compared to corresponding upstream sites 1 7 the fluctuations of monitored wq indicators especially do nh4 n and tp were obvious for different regulation scenarios corresponding to different discharge flows indicating the great impacts of different flow magnitudes on wq changes at both upstream and downstream sites of dss the coefficients of variation at the four sps of 1 7 12 and 13 were 17 90 23 85 22 67 and 10 72 for do 29 95 14 21 18 90 and 8 23 for nh4 n and 15 84 5 35 11 86 and 1 28 for tp respectively wq indicators at sp 1 were used as references for investigating the relationship between different flow magnitudes and changes of wq indicators among the four selected sps with different distance from the sluice therefore the monitored values of wq indicators at the upstream and downstream sites of huaidian sluice at sps 7 12 and 13 were divided by corresponding wq indicator values at the sp 1 the adjusted concentrations of wq indicators are named as relative concentrations hereinafter see fig 7 the average relative concentrations of nh4 n codmn tn tp no3 n and bod5 were 1 mg l 1 09 mg l 1 13 mg l and 1 25 mg l at sps 1 7 12 and 13 for scenario one with the discharge flow of 0 m3 s 1 mg l 0 99 mg l 1 01 mg l and 1 05 mg l for scenario two with the discharge flow of 20 m3 s 1 mg l 0 96 mg l 1 02 mg l and 1 11 mg l for scenario three with the discharge flow of 40 m3 s 1 mg l 0 99 mg l 1 02 mg l and 0 98 mg l for scenario four with the discharge flow of 60 m3 s according to fig 7 when the gates of sluice were closed the scenario one with the discharge flow of 0 m3 s water pollutions at four sps were in the order of 13 12 7 1 indicating that sps in downstream of the sluice were more polluted compared to that in upstream of the sluice when the discharge flow was 20 m3 s scenario two water pollutions at four sps were in the order of 13 12 1 7 indicating that water pollution at the sp in upstream of and closest to the sluice 7 which has a closer distance from gates of the sluice than 1 improved this indicates that pollutions in upstream of and near the sluice were first entered to downstream of the sluice when the discharge flow was 40 m3 s scenario three water pollutions at four sps were in the order of 13 12 1 7 the order was not changed compared to scenario two however water pollution for most wq indicators at downstream sites of the sluice had increased further when the discharge flow was 60 m3 s scenario four water pollutions at four sps were in the order of 12 1 7 13 water pollution at the sp 13 had significantly been improved compared to that in scenario three indicating that the discharge flow of 60 m3 s may be more helpful for the degradation of pollutions at downstream sites of sluice therefore the small flow magnitude of 20 m3 s improved water pollution at sp 7 upstream of and near the sluice while deteriorated water pollution at downstream sites of the sluice when the discharge flow reached 40 m3 s the improvement and deterioration of water pollution at upstream and downstream sites of the sluice became more obvious compared to the scenario of 20 m3 s however when the discharge flow reached 60 m3 s water pollution at downstream sites of the sluice began to improve in summary we conclude that small flow magnitude 20 m3 s in this study helps release and reduce upstream pollution of dss as pollutions in downstream riverbed sediments is not released therefore this situation helps to improve water pollution without requirement for the erosion of downstream riverbed sediments further increasing flow magnitude 40 m3 s in this study helps reduce and release upstream pollutions continuously without consideration of the pollution input from upstream but increases river pollution significantly at downstream due to the release of pollutions in the sediments of downstream riverbed which may cause a great river ecological impact since pollutants cannot be diluted and degraded in time fortunately a larger flow magnitude about 60 m3 s may help to release and rapidly dilutes and degrades sediment pollutions in downstream riverbed due to the large flow velocity therefore the situation is recommended for water pollution improvement and erosion of sediments in the basin zhang et al 2012 designed a laboratory experiment using glass flume to study the relationship between sluice opening corresponding to different discharge flow and changes of wq indicators both designs of their experiment and our experiment share many similarities zhang et al 2012 concluded that pollution concentration fluctuated along the glass flume channel in different discharge flow scenarios which is consistent with our studies in real river channels however as zhang et al 2012 did not consider the impact of sediment erosion laboratory simulation and assumed that the pollution source in their simulation experiment was located in the upstream of the sluice their experiment showed that pollution concentration increases in upstream of the sluice when the sluice gate was opened due to the decrease of pollution storage of the sluice caused by reduced water storage this is contrary to our experiment which showed an improvement of water pollution in upstream of huaidian sluice the reason is that unlike the laboratory experimental device the change of water storage in upstream of huaidian sluice was negligible in addition the erosion of upstream riverbed sediment can also be ignored when the discharge flow was small the difference in our field regulation experiment and the laboratory regulation experiment is also reflected in the impact of different discharge flow on the change of pollution concentration the laboratory experiment by zhang et al 2012 showed that the larger the relative sluice opening is the less the impact of the sluice regulation on river water quality is that is the impact of sluice regulation on wq is inversely proportional to the relative opening of sluice because pollution concentrations in upstream and downstream of the sluice tends to be the same as the gate opening increases however our study showed that different discharge flows produce different impacts on wq at upstream and downstream sites of dss due to the erosion of riverbed sediment that is the impact of sluice regulation on water quality is not strictly inversely proportional to the relative opening of sluice in actual applications for example the results of stre showed that the discharge flow of 40 m3 s at huaidian sluice helps reduce and release upstream pollution but increases river pollution significantly at downstream due to the release of pollutions in the sediments of downstream riverbed this regulation scenario may cause a great river ecological impact since pollutants cannot be diluted and degraded in time since our sampling time was in june we did not study the changes of wq indicators influenced by seasonal variation of discharge flow however the essence of seasonal changes discharge flow is mainly reflected in different magnitudes of discharge flow in different seasons our designed four regulation scenarios include different discharge flow magnitudes from small to large some seasonal regulation scenarios of sluices may be similar to one of our designed scenarios therefore the results of this study provides some references to dam induced seasonal variation of wq in fact the impact of dams and sluices on water quality and water ecology in different seasons are interesting and important research topics if samples were collected in different seasons in the near future the impact of dss on wq and we in different seasons can be investigated thoroughly 3 4 variation of aquatic composition affected by regulation of dss in our experiment 66 species of phytoplankton belonging to 8 phylum 24 species of zooplankton belonging to 4 phylum and 14 species of zoobenthos belonging to 3 phylum were monitored the species abundance at each sp varies from 3 to 31 for phytoplankton from 2 to 9 for zooplankton and from 1 to 7 for zoobenthos the monitored we indicators of zooplankton and zoobenthos at downstream sites of dss in july and december from 2012 to 2017 are plotted in fig 8 for revealing the change of aquatic communities affected by short term regulation of dss the figure shows that the abundance of some we indicators changed greatly in some years which may be caused by experimental monitoring uncertainty however the richness of we indicators were not obviously changed during the period it shows that short term environmental changes had little effects on aquatic communities due to adaptation and improvement of aquatic organisms to their surrounding environment the long term regulation impact of dss on aquatic communities was analyzed by comparing the difference of aquatic communities between the upstream and downstream sites of dss according to jaccard s similarity coefficient jsc of we indicators given in fig 9 a aquatic organisms at upstream and downstream sites of dss had poor similarities with the jsc of phytoplankton changing between 0 and 0 54 with the average of 0 27 the jsc of zooplankton changing between 0 and 0 5 with the average of 0 31 and the jsc of zoobenthos changing between 0 14 and 0 6 with the average of 0 37 respectively the richness of aquatic organisms phytoplankton zooplankton zoobenthos given in table 3 shows that species richness at upstream sites of dss with the average of 20 for phytoplankton 6 for zooplankton and 4 for zoobenthos was greater than their corresponding downstream sites with values of 18 6 3 respectively however the diversity index given in fig 9 b d shows that the average of the swi at the upstream sites of dss with values of 1 93 1 33 and 0 73 for phytoplankton zooplankton and zoobenthos was smaller than their corresponding downstream sites with values of 1 96 1 37 and 0 84 respectively this indicates that species evenness at downstream sites of dss was greater than upstream sites of dss in the hrb fewer aquatic organisms are monitored resulting in a higher evenness the swi at downstream sites of dss shows a decreasing trend from upstream to downstream of the hrb the average slops of the swi for phytoplankton zooplankton and zoobenthos were 0 21 0 19 and 0 18 indicating a more significant decrease of phytoplankton than zooplankton and zoobenthos however the spatial variation of the swi at upstream sites of dss was not significant 4 conclusions the main objective of this study is to invetigate the impact of ds regulation on wq and we based on two simple regulation experiment of dss the ltre and the stre two sps in the upstream and downstream of each ds were set in ltre for monitoring and comparing changes in wq and we indicators affected by long term regulation of dss four sps were designed in the upstream and downstream of huaidian sluice in stre to analyze the relationship between the alteration of ds discharge flow and changes in wq indicators for providing insights to long term irregular regulation management of dss a framework was then developed to compare changes in monitored wq and we indicators at the upstream and downstream sites of dss the long term regulation results indicate that the construction of dss had a negative impact on wq and we the downstream sites of dss were more seriously polluted compared to the corresponding upstream sites the moderate eutrophication phenomenon in river channels of the basin illustrated the great impact of dss on water fluidity which easily causes nutrient enrichment in river channels more serious eutrophication in downstream sites of most dss was consistent with changes in wq indicators with the more serious downstream pollution no significant change was found in the concentration of heavy metals at upstream and downstream sites of dss due to their low concentration in hrb however the similarity of aquatic communities at the upstream and downstream sites of dss was poor indicating the great impact of ds regulation on we according to the short term regulation the increasing discharge flow helps improve water pollution at sps before the gates of dss and can exacerbate water pollution at sps after the gates of dss in the scenario of small flow magnitude that is the increasing discharge flow with a small and moderate magnitude had positive effects on pollution improvement before the gates of sluices and negative effects on pollution improvement after the gates of sluices however when the discharge flow became larger such as 60 m3 s in this study water pollution in the downstream sites of dss was found to be improved therefore a small flow magnitude which meets ecological needs is recommended for water quality improvement without erosion of downstream riverbed sediment and a large flow magnitude is recommended for water quality improvement with the requirement of sediment erosion in hrb such as 60 m3 s in this study certainly too large flow magnitude should be avoided due to the strong erosion of downstream riverbed except for special regulation requirements in addition the main pollution indicators in the hrb were the cod tn f cl so4 2 and no3 credit authorship contribution

4647,the construction of dams and sluices dss is conducive to human development but affects river water quality wq and water ecology we seriously while many studies have explored the ds induced impact on hydrology water quality and water ecology the difference in ds regulations for different objectives and interests such as flood control power generation and ecological protection are not taken into the account although their impacts on wq and we are different discharge is the key factor to measure different ds regulation and its variation directly affects the long term wq and we in rivers thus studying short term multi scenario ds regulation with different discharge is very important for providing insights to their long term irregular management furthermore the relationships between discharges and the change of wq indicators are different in the upstream and downstream of dss and at different distance to dss in the downstream however it is not well understood how the wq and we indicators at upstream and downstream sites of dss change under different regulation scenarios in long term and short term using the monitored wq and we indicators at twelve sampling sites sps of six dss in the huai river basin hrb this study investigates the impact of long term irregular ds regulation on changes in wq and we indicators i e the long term regulation experiment ltre and then the relationship between the alteration of ds discharge flow and changes in wq indicators i e the short term regulation experiment stre under four scenarios with different flow magnitudes at one of sluices huaidian sluice the results of long term regulations show that the wq at downstream sites of most dss was worse than their corresponding upstream sites the similarity of we indicators at upstream and downstream sites of dss was low meaning the great impact of ds long term regulation on we the results of short term regulations show that small flow magnitude 20 m3 s in this study helps release and reduce upstream pollution of dss as it does not disturb downstream riverbed pollutions resulting in an increase of downstream river pollution further increasing flow magnitude 40 m3 s in this study helps reduce and release upstream pollution but increases river pollution significantly at downstream due to the release of pollutions in the sediments of downstream riverbed which may cause a great river ecological impact since pollutants cannot be diluted and degraded in time a flow magnitude about 60 m3 s can help release and rapidly dilute and degrade sediment pollutions in downstream riverbed however a larger flow magnitude may also be inappropriate due to the strong downstream riverbed erosion except for special regulation requirements this study can provide more insights for water resources management to develop long term ecological ds regulation schemes for in hrb and other similar ds dominated basins keywords dams and sluices water ecological experiment

economic benefits while affecting water quality and ecology greatly on the one hand pollutions produced by human activity accumulates in river channels when gates of dss are closed and then releases with discharge flow when gates of dss are opened for flow regulation generating even greater wq and we impact than irregulated river channels watkins et al 2019 additionally if multiple dss are built on the river the naturally formed river channels will be separated into many artificially controlled river sections zhang et al 2012 leading to a significant reduction in water mobility which is more likely to cause river eutrophication and water pollution on the other hand the construction of dss blocks the interaction of aquatic organisms between the upstream and downstream of dss liu et al 2020a many aquatic organisms cannot transfer matter and energy freely as in the naturally connected rivers due to dss and even more seriously some of them will be eliminated while others will be retained to form new environmentally adaptive communities in long term therefore aquatic communities affected by different levels of human intervention may show different features and compositions due to the altered hydrological and environmental conditions according to nilsson et al 2005 and van looy et al 2014 over a half of the world s large river systems are affected by dams and the most of them are subjected to flow regulation it is worth noting that dam construction over the globe is expected to continuously increase in the future zarfl et al 2015 therefore wq and we have been and will continue to be affected by dss although many related studies have been conducted most of them mainly focus on the assessment of wq and we before and after construction removal of dss using experimental and statistical methods luo et al 2020 studied the impact of land use and urbanization on river water quality and ecology in the dam dominated shaying river basin of china thompson et al 2020 evaluated the short term impacts of dam rupture on the environment koutrakis et al 2018 quantified ecological flows in the highly regulated nestos river basin in northern greece by comparing fish species populations under different discharge conditions at downstream sites of dams wang et al 2018 studied the seasonal variability of cations and anions in the lower changjiang due to construction of three gorges dam in china hahn et al 2018 studied effects of dam draining on the mobility of pollutants stored in the bottom sediments van oorschot et al 2018 studied the combined impact of dam regulation and climate change on bio geomorphological processes and habitat suitability of several aquatic species davis et al 2017 investigated changes in sediment concentrations and fish community body burdens of heavy metals before and after two lowhead dam removals in the scioto and olentangy rivers in united states chen et al 2011 evaluated the structural properties of aquatic animals and their complex ecological relationships within the ecosystem before and after dam construction schmitz et al 2009 assessed the long term ecological response of downstream geomorphic and vegetation to dam removal however there are cases without sufficient monitoring data before the construction making the assessment difficult although all the abovementioned studies revealed the important impact of dss on wq and we and made great contribution to water resources management in ds dominated basins it is not well understood how the difference of wq and we indicators at upstream and downstream sites of dss change after long term regulation of dss furthermore the relationships between short term regulation of dss corresponding to different discharges and the change of wq indicators at the upstream and downstream sites of dss and at different distance to dss in the downstream were not well investigated these problems are critical as discharge is the key factor to measure different ds regulation and different regulations directly affect the long term wq and we in rivers further studies are needed to provide more insights for water resources management to develop long term ecological ds regulation schemes for in ds dominated basins in order to have a comprehensive understanding of the relationships of wq and we indicators against different regulations of dss this study designs two types of water ecological experiment based on our previous studies luo et al 2018 the long term regulation experiment ltre and the short term regulation experiment stre for monitoring wq and we indicators at upstream and downstream sites of dss in the hrb the long term in the first experiment means that the time after ds regulation started because most dss in hrb were built in the 1950s their long term irregular regulation operated about 70 years so far according to different objectives and interests such as flood control power generation and ecological protection might already cause significant differences in we indicators at upstream and downstream sites of dss such as richness diversity dominance and similarity a framework is then formed to compare the changes in wq and we indicators at upstream and downstream sites of dss with different discharge flow scenarios therefore based on the monitored wq and we indicators at upstream and downstream sites of dss over the hrb the specific objects of this studies are 1 to compare the difference of both wq and we indicators at upstream and downstream sites of dss after long term irregular regulation impact of dss in order to understand the impact of ds regulation on wq physical and chemical indicators eutrophication and heavy metals and we richness diversity dominance and similarity 2 to compare the difference of wq indicators at upstream and downstream sites of dss in different discharge flow scenarios in order to understand the relationship between discharges and the change of wq indicators at the upstream and downstream sites of dss and at different distance to dss this study can provide insights to the long term irregular regulations of dss with different objectives and interests such as flood control irrigation power generation and ecological protection the paper is organized as follows the study area of the hrb and water ecological experiment are introduced in the next section followed by proposed methods including an evaluation flowchart index system and evaluation methods for studying the impact of long short term regulation of dss on wq and we the results of wq and we impact of dss based on different discharge flow scenarios are summarized and discussed in sections 3 respectively the conclusions are finally summarized in section 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area huai river fig 1 as one of the seven largest rivers in china originates from tongbai mountain and locates between yangtze river and yellow river the two largest rivers in china zhao et al 2012 the drainage area of the hrb is about 270 000 km2 ma et al 2014 the annual average temperature is approximately 11 16 c and the annual average precipitation and runoff are 883 mm and 230 mm respectively the annual average evaporation is 900 1500 mm zhai et al 2017 the basin is under pressure of increasing wq deterioration and drastic decline in aquatic biodiversity since 1950s many dss have been built in the basin to regulate the unevenly distributed water resources in time and space which has a serious impact on wq and we so far over 5700 reservoirs and 5000 sluices have been built with a total storage capacity of 30 3 billion m3 accounting for 51 of the annual average runoff in the entire basin zhang et al 2015 according to the huai river water resources bulletin hrwrb http www hrc gov cn the length of rivers with wq belonging to class iv and class v by surface water environmental quality standard sweq of china accounts for about 23 4 and 8 5 of the total river lengths in the basin a total of five classes are defined in sweq in which the high level indicates the poor wq 2 2 assessment flowchart fig 2 is the framework for assessing the regulation impact of dss on wq and we in the hrb first in the ds regulation experiments the ltre and stre were designed and then the indicators of wq and we were monitored processed and classified for ltre six dss were selected in the hrb and twelve sps were set with six of them being located in upstream of dss and the remaining six ones in the downstream of dss fig 1 for stre huaidian sluice was selected as a case study where four sps were set with two of them being located in the upstream and the other two in the downstream of the sluice see fig 1 four regulation scenarios were designed by controlling the opening height of sluice gates at 0 cm 10 cm 20 cm and 30 cm which corresponds to discharge flows of 0 m3 s 20 m3 s 40 m3 s and 60 m3 s respectively the sluice has six gates and they are opened simultaneously in each regulation scenario in fact it is necessary to study the impacts of many different regulation scenarios for different objectives and interests of ds regulation as different magnitudes of discharge flow affect the changes of wq differently however different to laboratory experiment designing too many regulation scenarios in field experiment is impractical due to various difficulties such as permission from sluice management department more importantly the mutual influence between adjacent regulation scenarios was inevitable if too many regulation scenarios were designed therefore the above four regulation scenarios including discharge flow from small to large were designed in this study to see if the relationship between discharge and the change of water quality indicators remain the same as in the laboratory studies second wq indicators collected at upstream and downstream sites of each ds in ltre were compared in term of wq eutrophication and heavy metal status to assess wq changes affected by long term ds regulation in the basin the impact of multiple scenarios of discharge flow of dss on wq was investigated by comparing the changes in wq indicators at upstream and downstream sites of huaidian sluice based on stre experiment third the species composition and similarity at upstream and downstream sites of each ds were compared in term of richness diversity dominance and similarity to study the impact of long term ds regulation on river we based on ltre experiment finally the impact characteristics of ds regulation on wq and we were summarized and discussed 2 3 assessment indicators and methods the sps set in ltre and stre are show in fig 1 the data used in ltre and stre were collected in june from 2012 to 2017 and in 2014 respectively the sampling time of june was selected because river water volume in wet seasons june is abundant which can make it easier to implement our regulation scenarios of dss designed in the huaidian sluice although many studies have shown that long time series of data is necessary for flow regime studies kennard et al 2010 six years of monitoring data can support this study because the long term means the regulation time of dss in this study most dss in hrb were built in 1950s we use the monitored data to investigate the difference of wq and we between upstream and downstream sites of dss after their long term regulation impact rather than evaluating the long term changing processes of wq and we the monitored wq indicators in ltre include potential of hydrogen ph water temperature t electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do total dissolved solid tds transparency sd chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp chlorophyll a chla nitrate no3 sulfate so4 2 chloride cl fluoride f arsenic as selenium se cadmium cd chromium cr copper cu and nickel ni the monitored we indicators in ltre include habit environment quality and species of phytoplankton zooplankton zoobenthos the monitored wq indicators in stre include ph ec do ammonium nitrogen nh4 n permanganate index codmn tn tp nitrate nitrogen no3 n and 5 day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 different indicators were monitored in these two experiments because it is undoubted that both long term and short term regulation of dss will have an important impact on wq however the temporary changes of flow regime caused by short term regulation of dss generally do not cause obvious changes in we richness diversity dominance and similarity due to their environmental adaptabilities therefore it is not meaningful to consider the change of we in the impact of short term regulation of dss therefore we indicators were only considered in the ltre since some wq indicators were proved not to be the main factors affecting water pollution in the hrb based on the long term regulation experiment some wq indicators considered in the ltre were not considered in the stre the wq indicators ph tds t sd chla and ec were monitored by secchi disk hq11d portable ph orp mv meter exo sondes in the field directly for the rest wq indicators water samples a 1000 ml which are collected by polyethylene bottle from about 30 cm underwater were collected and then brought back to the laboratory for testing based on the standard of water and wastewater monitoring and analysis methods in china habit environment quality was scored in situ according to the river habitat evaluation standard in china see luo et al 2018 meng et al 2011 for detail the samples of phytoplankton zooplankton and zoobenthos were collected and counted according to freshwater animals survey technical specification in china no db43 t 432 2009 among them phytoplankton and zooplankton were counted using the counting chamber method and the number of zoobenthos was accurately counted according to different species at each sampling site the methods used in our study for wq and we assessment are summarized in table 1 water quality index wqi changes from 0 to 1 was calculated using fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method for assessing the effects of dss on wq in overlying water bodies based on indicators of ec do tds cod tn tp chla f cl so4 2 no3 river eutrophication was assessed because regulation of dss can slow down river mobility which easily leads to nutrient accumulation in riverbeds and causes a higher probability of eutrophication according to surface water environmental quality assessment methods sweqam in china trophic status index tsi was calculated based on indicators of ds tn tp cod and chla using methods in table 1 the geoaccumulation index igeo developed by müller 1986 was employed to assess heavy metal pollution at upstream and downstream sites of dss based on indicators of al fe ca mg na k cd cr pb cu and zn the biological richness abundance and diversity shannon wiener index swi were calculated to compare the alteration in composition of aquatic communities at upstream and downstream sites of dss travers et al 2018 jaccard s similarity coefficient jsc was employed to compare the similarity of aquatic communities at upstream and downstream sites of dss bennell et al 2010 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation of river water quality indicators the wq indicators monitored at the upstream and downstream sites of dss in ltre are plotted in fig 3 and the wqi at each sp is calculated and then plotted in fig 4 according to results shown in fig 3 the monitored wq indicators of cod tn f cl so4 2 and no3 were poor in the hrb their concentrations at the upstream sites of dss changed between 10 10 and 19 20 mg l 2 65 and 3 75 mg l 3 69 and 7 12 mg l 54 90 and 915 90 mg l 273 70 and 1172 02 mg l and 13 71 and 111 13 mg l respectively at the corresponding downstream sites their concentrations changed between 10 20 and 18 70 mg l 2 9 and 4 8 mg l 4 42 and 7 07 mg l 156 45 and 940 62 mg l 478 48 and 1273 67 mg l and 29 84 and 119 95 mg l respectively therefore the downstream sites of dss were more seriously polluted than upstream sites of dss over the basin in the long term irregular regulation scenario the results of water quality index given in fig 4 also showed a more serious water pollution at downstream sites of dss with wqi values of 0 50 0 47 0 26 0 36 0 34 and 0 23 at downstream sites of selected six dss see fig 1 which were lower than that at upstream sites of dss with wqi values of 0 58 0 47 0 34 0 42 0 40 and 0 33 more serious water pollution at downstream sites of dss might mainly relate to the impact of irregular flow magnitudes due to the irregular regulation of dss for economic and ecological benefits which forms a weak connectivity in the upstream and downstream of these dss because different requirements of ds regulation over time flood control irrigation power generation and ecological protection produce different magnitudes of discharge flow kuriqi et al 2019 on the one hand pollutions in the upstream of dss can enter the downstream when discharge flow is small liu et al 2020b in this case pollutions in downstream riverbed sediments will not be released due to the small flow magnitude however on the other hand when the discharge flow is large pollutions in downstream riverbed sediments will be released they both cause a more serious river pollution in downstream in addition to the direct regulation impact of dss there are some other reasons such as downstream domestic and industrial sewage discharge water depth to sediment and pollutant concentration in sediments more data are needed to consider these factors and it will be an important and interesting research topic in future study however the difference in wq changes at upstream and downstream sites of dss and at different distance to dss in the downstream is not well known under different discharge flow scenarios therefore a study on the relationship between the alteration of ds discharge flow and changes in wq indicators can provide insights to long term irregular ds regulation according to sweq most wq indicators mentioned above belonged to class iv or above mainly used for industrial and recreational water use particularly the concentrations of tn changing between 2 and 5 mg l with the average of 3 10 and 3 68 mg l at upstream and downstream sites of dss respectively were seriously exceeded the threshold of class v the most polluted water quality class in sweq the remaining wq indicators showed a moderate pollution with characteristics that downstream sites were worse than upstream sites as described above in addition most wq indicators at upstream and downstream sites of dss showed a consistent changing trend from upstream to downstream of the basin such as t ec do tds cod tn tp chla f cl so4 2 and no3 the results fully illustrated that water pollution at downstream sites of most dss was mainly caused by pollution inflow in upstream of dss followed by pollutions from downstream riverbed sediments for the long term irregular regulation scenario in the basin according to the monitored heavy metal indicators given in fig 3 most heavy metal indicators showed unobvious differences in the concentration at upstream and downstream sites of dss however there are some indicators showing a more serious heavy metal pollution at upstream sites of dss such as as and se and others showing a more severe heavy metal pollution at downstream sites of dss such as cr and cu according to the results of igeo shown in fig 5 the heavy metal pollution at most sps belonged to the uncontaminated level with the value of igeo 0 the igeo index also showed unobvious concentration differences at upstream and downstream sites of dss therefore regulation of dss has not caused a significant difference in heavy metal concentrations at upstream and downstream sites of dss in the basin 3 2 variation of river eutrophication the results of tsi in table 2 showed that the hrb belongs to a moderate eutrophication with the tsi changing between 57 33 and 69 42 in general eutrophication is less likely to occur in naturally flowing rivers with negligible human interference because nutrients are not conducive to enrichment in flowing rivers the eutrophication in the basin from tsi assessment and in situ investigation fully illustrated that the fluidity of water bodies was seriously affected by construction of multiple dss particularly when gates of dss were closed for water storage during dry seasons flow velocity between dss would be greatly reduced furthermore the nitrogen and phosphorus pollutant form domestic sewage were another important cause of eutrophication due to the dense population in the basin luo et al 2019 according to table 2 the results of tsi at downstream sites of dss changed between 59 91 and 69 42 with the average of 63 17 which were greater than that at their corresponding upstream sites with the tsi changed between 57 33 and 66 88 with the average of 61 88 indicating that eutrophication was more likely to occur at downstream sites of dss this may be caused by regulation of dss which makes nutrients easier to accumulate at downstream sites of dss this result is consistent with our conclusion in section 3 1 that the downstream sites of dss are more seriously polluted compared to their corresponding upstream sites in the hrb 3 3 variation of river water quality indicators in different short term regulation scenarios based on the analysis of wq indicator changes under long term irregular regulation of dss we concluded that downstream sites of dss showed a greater water pollution and the basin showed eutrophication however the flow magnitudes under long term irregular regulation vary and are determined by different function requirement of dss over time therefore the relationship between the alteration of ds discharge flow and the changes in wq indicators needs further study to provide references for long term ds regulation four short term regulation scenarios of dss with the discharge flow of 0 m3 s 20 m3 s 40 m3 s and 60 m3 s were conducted at huaidian sluice in this study wq samples were collected four hours later after each regulation scenario was implemented the time interval between two adjacent scheduling scenarios was greater than twelve hours to avoid their mutual influence nine indicators ph ec do nh4 n codmn tn tp no3 n and bod5 were monitored the variation of wq indicators in each regulation scenario is plotted in fig 6 from which it can be seen that the concentrations of wq indicators varied greatly and water pollution at downstream sites of the sluice 12 13 for most indicators was more serious compared to corresponding upstream sites 1 7 the fluctuations of monitored wq indicators especially do nh4 n and tp were obvious for different regulation scenarios corresponding to different discharge flows indicating the great impacts of different flow magnitudes on wq changes at both upstream and downstream sites of dss the coefficients of variation at the four sps of 1 7 12 and 13 were 17 90 23 85 22 67 and 10 72 for do 29 95 14 21 18 90 and 8 23 for nh4 n and 15 84 5 35 11 86 and 1 28 for tp respectively wq indicators at sp 1 were used as references for investigating the relationship between different flow magnitudes and changes of wq indicators among the four selected sps with different distance from the sluice therefore the monitored values of wq indicators at the upstream and downstream sites of huaidian sluice at sps 7 12 and 13 were divided by corresponding wq indicator values at the sp 1 the adjusted concentrations of wq indicators are named as relative concentrations hereinafter see fig 7 the average relative concentrations of nh4 n codmn tn tp no3 n and bod5 were 1 mg l 1 09 mg l 1 13 mg l and 1 25 mg l at sps 1 7 12 and 13 for scenario one with the discharge flow of 0 m3 s 1 mg l 0 99 mg l 1 01 mg l and 1 05 mg l for scenario two with the discharge flow of 20 m3 s 1 mg l 0 96 mg l 1 02 mg l and 1 11 mg l for scenario three with the discharge flow of 40 m3 s 1 mg l 0 99 mg l 1 02 mg l and 0 98 mg l for scenario four with the discharge flow of 60 m3 s according to fig 7 when the gates of sluice were closed the scenario one with the discharge flow of 0 m3 s water pollutions at four sps were in the order of 13 12 7 1 indicating that sps in downstream of the sluice were more polluted compared to that in upstream of the sluice when the discharge flow was 20 m3 s scenario two water pollutions at four sps were in the order of 13 12 1 7 indicating that water pollution at the sp in upstream of and closest to the sluice 7 which has a closer distance from gates of the sluice than 1 improved this indicates that pollutions in upstream of and near the sluice were first entered to downstream of the sluice when the discharge flow was 40 m3 s scenario three water pollutions at four sps were in the order of 13 12 1 7 the order was not changed compared to scenario two however water pollution for most wq indicators at downstream sites of the sluice had increased further when the discharge flow was 60 m3 s scenario four water pollutions at four sps were in the order of 12 1 7 13 water pollution at the sp 13 had significantly been improved compared to that in scenario three indicating that the discharge flow of 60 m3 s may be more helpful for the degradation of pollutions at downstream sites of sluice therefore the small flow magnitude of 20 m3 s improved water pollution at sp 7 upstream of and near the sluice while deteriorated water pollution at downstream sites of the sluice when the discharge flow reached 40 m3 s the improvement and deterioration of water pollution at upstream and downstream sites of the sluice became more obvious compared to the scenario of 20 m3 s however when the discharge flow reached 60 m3 s water pollution at downstream sites of the sluice began to improve in summary we conclude that small flow magnitude 20 m3 s in this study helps release and reduce upstream pollution of dss as pollutions in downstream riverbed sediments is not released therefore this situation helps to improve water pollution without requirement for the erosion of downstream riverbed sediments further increasing flow magnitude 40 m3 s in this study helps reduce and release upstream pollutions continuously without consideration of the pollution input from upstream but increases river pollution significantly at downstream due to the release of pollutions in the sediments of downstream riverbed which may cause a great river ecological impact since pollutants cannot be diluted and degraded in time fortunately a larger flow magnitude about 60 m3 s may help to release and rapidly dilutes and degrades sediment pollutions in downstream riverbed due to the large flow velocity therefore the situation is recommended for water pollution improvement and erosion of sediments in the basin zhang et al 2012 designed a laboratory experiment using glass flume to study the relationship between sluice opening corresponding to different discharge flow and changes of wq indicators both designs of their experiment and our experiment share many similarities zhang et al 2012 concluded that pollution concentration fluctuated along the glass flume channel in different discharge flow scenarios which is consistent with our studies in real river channels however as zhang et al 2012 did not consider the impact of sediment erosion laboratory simulation and assumed that the pollution source in their simulation experiment was located in the upstream of the sluice their experiment showed that pollution concentration increases in upstream of the sluice when the sluice gate was opened due to the decrease of pollution storage of the sluice caused by reduced water storage this is contrary to our experiment which showed an improvement of water pollution in upstream of huaidian sluice the reason is that unlike the laboratory experimental device the change of water storage in upstream of huaidian sluice was negligible in addition the erosion of upstream riverbed sediment can also be ignored when the discharge flow was small the difference in our field regulation experiment and the laboratory regulation experiment is also reflected in the impact of different discharge flow on the change of pollution concentration the laboratory experiment by zhang et al 2012 showed that the larger the relative sluice opening is the less the impact of the sluice regulation on river water quality is that is the impact of sluice regulation on wq is inversely proportional to the relative opening of sluice because pollution concentrations in upstream and downstream of the sluice tends to be the same as the gate opening increases however our study showed that different discharge flows produce different impacts on wq at upstream and downstream sites of dss due to the erosion of riverbed sediment that is the impact of sluice regulation on water quality is not strictly inversely proportional to the relative opening of sluice in actual applications for example the results of stre showed that the discharge flow of 40 m3 s at huaidian sluice helps reduce and release upstream pollution but increases river pollution significantly at downstream due to the release of pollutions in the sediments of downstream riverbed this regulation scenario may cause a great river ecological impact since pollutants cannot be diluted and degraded in time since our sampling time was in june we did not study the changes of wq indicators influenced by seasonal variation of discharge flow however the essence of seasonal changes discharge flow is mainly reflected in different magnitudes of discharge flow in different seasons our designed four regulation scenarios include different discharge flow magnitudes from small to large some seasonal regulation scenarios of sluices may be similar to one of our designed scenarios therefore the results of this study provides some references to dam induced seasonal variation of wq in fact the impact of dams and sluices on water quality and water ecology in different seasons are interesting and important research topics if samples were collected in different seasons in the near future the impact of dss on wq and we in different seasons can be investigated thoroughly 3 4 variation of aquatic composition affected by regulation of dss in our experiment 66 species of phytoplankton belonging to 8 phylum 24 species of zooplankton belonging to 4 phylum and 14 species of zoobenthos belonging to 3 phylum were monitored the species abundance at each sp varies from 3 to 31 for phytoplankton from 2 to 9 for zooplankton and from 1 to 7 for zoobenthos the monitored we indicators of zooplankton and zoobenthos at downstream sites of dss in july and december from 2012 to 2017 are plotted in fig 8 for revealing the change of aquatic communities affected by short term regulation of dss the figure shows that the abundance of some we indicators changed greatly in some years which may be caused by experimental monitoring uncertainty however the richness of we indicators were not obviously changed during the period it shows that short term environmental changes had little effects on aquatic communities due to adaptation and improvement of aquatic organisms to their surrounding environment the long term regulation impact of dss on aquatic communities was analyzed by comparing the difference of aquatic communities between the upstream and downstream sites of dss according to jaccard s similarity coefficient jsc of we indicators given in fig 9 a aquatic organisms at upstream and downstream sites of dss had poor similarities with the jsc of phytoplankton changing between 0 and 0 54 with the average of 0 27 the jsc of zooplankton changing between 0 and 0 5 with the average of 0 31 and the jsc of zoobenthos changing between 0 14 and 0 6 with the average of 0 37 respectively the richness of aquatic organisms phytoplankton zooplankton zoobenthos given in table 3 shows that species richness at upstream sites of dss with the average of 20 for phytoplankton 6 for zooplankton and 4 for zoobenthos was greater than their corresponding downstream sites with values of 18 6 3 respectively however the diversity index given in fig 9 b d shows that the average of the swi at the upstream sites of dss with values of 1 93 1 33 and 0 73 for phytoplankton zooplankton and zoobenthos was smaller than their corresponding downstream sites with values of 1 96 1 37 and 0 84 respectively this indicates that species evenness at downstream sites of dss was greater than upstream sites of dss in the hrb fewer aquatic organisms are monitored resulting in a higher evenness the swi at downstream sites of dss shows a decreasing trend from upstream to downstream of the hrb the average slops of the swi for phytoplankton zooplankton and zoobenthos were 0 21 0 19 and 0 18 indicating a more significant decrease of phytoplankton than zooplankton and zoobenthos however the spatial variation of the swi at upstream sites of dss was not significant 4 conclusions the main objective of this study is to invetigate the impact of ds regulation on wq and we based on two simple regulation experiment of dss the ltre and the stre two sps in the upstream and downstream of each ds were set in ltre for monitoring and comparing changes in wq and we indicators affected by long term regulation of dss four sps were designed in the upstream and downstream of huaidian sluice in stre to analyze the relationship between the alteration of ds discharge flow and changes in wq indicators for providing insights to long term irregular regulation management of dss a framework was then developed to compare changes in monitored wq and we indicators at the upstream and downstream sites of dss the long term regulation results indicate that the construction of dss had a negative impact on wq and we the downstream sites of dss were more seriously polluted compared to the corresponding upstream sites the moderate eutrophication phenomenon in river channels of the basin illustrated the great impact of dss on water fluidity which easily causes nutrient enrichment in river channels more serious eutrophication in downstream sites of most dss was consistent with changes in wq indicators with the more serious downstream pollution no significant change was found in the concentration of heavy metals at upstream and downstream sites of dss due to their low concentration in hrb however the similarity of aquatic communities at the upstream and downstream sites of dss was poor indicating the great impact of ds regulation on we according to the short term regulation the increasing discharge flow helps improve water pollution at sps before the gates of dss and can exacerbate water pollution at sps after the gates of dss in the scenario of small flow magnitude that is the increasing discharge flow with a small and moderate magnitude had positive effects on pollution improvement before the gates of sluices and negative effects on pollution improvement after the gates of sluices however when the discharge flow became larger such as 60 m3 s in this study water pollution in the downstream sites of dss was found to be improved therefore a small flow magnitude which meets ecological needs is recommended for water quality improvement without erosion of downstream riverbed sediment and a large flow magnitude is recommended for water quality improvement with the requirement of sediment erosion in hrb such as 60 m3 s in this study certainly too large flow magnitude should be avoided due to the strong erosion of downstream riverbed except for special regulation requirements in addition the main pollution indicators in the hrb were the cod tn f cl so4 2 and no3 credit authorship contribution

4648,ice cover formed on an alluvial channel can significantly alter the flow characteristics such as the vertical distributions of streamwise velocity and shear stress and hence the water and sediment transport process the vertical profile of the suspended sediment concentration in the ice covered alluvial channels with steady uniform flows is investigated in this study to calculate the suspended sediment concentration we are based on the schmidt o brien equation and deduce an analytical model that employs an existing eddy viscosity model and a modified formula of the sediment fall velocity considering the common effects of the upper and lower boundaries the proposed analytical model is then validated by using available experimental data reported in the literature the predicted accuracy of the proposed model is evaluated through error statistics by comparing to previous modeled results the relative concentration profiles of the suspended sediment are subsequently simulated by applying the validated analytical model with different characteristic parameters results show that the relative concentration decreases with the increase of both the ice cover roughness and the

roughness 1 introduction the flow structure in alluvial channels changes and develops continuously caused by the interaction between the water flow and the rough river bed lane et al 1996 sharma et al 2019 tayfur and singh 2012 in effect sediment transport which is mainly controlled by the turbulent flow structure is the agent of the aforementioned interacted process cordier et al 2019 when the lift force exerted on the sediment particle due to the turbulent diffusion effect is greater than the submerged weight of the sediment particle the sediment particle will be raised from the channel bed and move forward along with the water flow thereby forming sediment laden flow brayshaw et al 1983 cheng et al 2020 on the other hand if the turbulent diffusion effect is weaker than the submerged weight effect of the sediment particle the suspended sediment particle will be brought back to the channel bed resulting in the sediment deposition in engineering practice the sediment problem is one of the issues that engineers must consider in the construction of all water conservancy projects such as the selection of a port site the scheme formulation of the channel dredging and improvement and the layout of the irrigation and drainage facilities peng et al 2020 stone and krishnappan 2002 torres et al 2009 xia et al 2016 yang et al 2007 therefore in light of the non negligible impact of the sediment movement on the industrial and agricultural production along the channel banks there is a growing interest in the concentration distribution of the suspended sediment in the alluvial channels when alluvial channels located in cold regions expose to freezing temperatures an ice cover will form over the water surface of alluvial channels significantly altering the flow characteristics and consequently influencing the sediment transport chassiot et al 2020 ettema 2002 lawler 1993 turcotte et al 2011 as shown in the schematic diagram of fig 1 the ice covered alluvial channel flow is asymmetric concerning the plane of the zero shear stress due to the different roughnesses and shear stresses on the upper and lower boundaries guo et al 2017 tsai and ettema 1994 the wetted perimeter of the shallow channel is approximately doubled both the flow depth and the total boundary shear stress increase and the averaged streamwise velocity decreases hoque 2009 smith and ettema 1997 wang et al 2020 given that the total boundary shear stress is certainly distributed between the upper and lower boundaries the boundary shear stress corresponding to the channel bed i e the lower boundary is expected to be reduced sayre and song 1979 the reduction of the bed boundary shear stress and the averaged streamwise velocity can in turn reduce the bedload transport as well as the suspended sediment concentration ssc thereby affecting the sediment transport process and hence the river bed morphology because knowledge of the ssc profile is related to many engineering and environmental problems such as the operation and maintenance of a reservoir and the performance of the channel control structures beltaos and burrell 2016 caissie et al 2014 ettema et al 2000 gebre et al 2014 it is necessary to investigate the ssc in the ice covered alluvial channel flows extensive studies have been conducted to investigate the ssc profiles in the fully developed two dimensional 2d free surface alluvial channel flows cellino and lemmin 2004 jha and bombardelli 2011 kabir and ahmari 2020 miyata et al 2020 pal and ghoshal 2017 rouse 1937 umeyama 1992 however to the authors best knowledge studies on the ssc profile in the ice covered alluvial channel flows have been very limited except that several studies were carried out to explore the sediment transport using the flume experiments with narrow flow conditions muste et al 2000 carried out laboratory flume experiments in an ice covered sand bed channel and found that the sediment transport rates were reduced comparing with that without the ice cover channel flows sayre and song 1979 performed flume experiments to investigate the effect of a floating ice cover on the sediment transport features they divided the flow of the ice covered channel into two layers namely the upper ice layer and the lower bed layer with the maximum streamwise velocity and the zero turbulent shear stress at the interface subsequently the analytical expressions for the vertical turbulent mass transfer coefficient and the ssc were derived by adopting the two layer approach based on the formula of the ssc proposed by sayre and song 1979 knack and shen 2015 estimated the suspended sediment load and the bed load for the ice covered channels differently krishnappan 1983 applied the k ε turbulent model to predict the momentum diffusivity distributions in the ice covered streams and then formulated the concentration distribution curves for the suspended sediment similar to the method used by krishnappan 1983 lau and krishnappan 1985 simulated both the ssc profile and the streamwise velocity distribution and then compared the simulated results with their laboratory measurements conducted under different ice covered conditions huang 2014 and knack 2011 developed a two dimensional numerical model that coupled the hydro thermo ice sediment dynamics to investigate the effect of the ice cover on the suspended sediment transport in curved channels the above literature review shows that the previous models predicting the ssc profile for the ice covered channel flows can be classified as the analytical model and the numerical model as shown in table 1 although the analytical model proposed by sayre and song 1979 has a good predictive ability one needs to know the streamwise velocity profile prior to determining the position of the maximum streamwise velocity for the application of the two layer hypothesis the model of the turbulent mass transfer coefficient that is the key factor to obtain the above analytical model consists of three components and is not integrated into a single equation furthermore the turbulent mass transfer coefficient is not deduced rigorously because sayre and song 1979 simply assumed that the turbulent mass transfer coefficient followed the linear distribution in the central region the numerical model presented by krishnappan 1983 and lau and krishnappan 1985 applied the k ε turbulent model when one applies the numerical model to simulate the ssc profile an appropriate numerical scheme has to be proposed to solve the semiempirical transport equations of k and ε along with the continuity and momentum equations the predicted ssc distribution based on the k ε turbulent model agrees well with experimental results however this numerical model requires considerable computation and can not directly reflect which physical quantity affects the sediment concentration similarly the hydro thermo ice sediment dynamical model employed by huang 2014 and knack 2011 lacks brevity and involves substantial calculations this motivates the current work in which we develop a concise and precise analytical model for predicting the ssc distribution in the ice covered channel flows in this study we present a novel analytical model to predict the vertical profile of the ssc for the steady uniform flow in the ice covered alluvial channels first the analytical expression of the vertical turbulent mass transfer coefficient is obtained by utilizing the eddy viscosity model applied to asymmetric turbulent flows proposed by guo et al 2017 in light of the dimensional limitation of experimental facilities the sediment fall velocity is certainly affected by the wall boundary accordingly a modified formula for the sediment fall velocity which considers the combined effects of the upper and lower boundaries is then proposed by introducing the formulas of the turbulent mass transfer coefficient and the sediment fall velocity into the schmidt o brien equation an analytical model is derived to calculate the ssc distribution in the ice covered channel flows subsequently the analytical ssc model is verified by available experimental data and the prediction accuracy of the model is assessed by comparing the calculated ssc distributions in this study with those found in the literature finally the influences of the pivotal characteristic parameters on the ssc profile in the ice covered channel flows are investigated 2 method the sediment transport in the ice covered alluvial channel flows is more complicated than the sediment conveyance in the open channel flows due to the effect of a floating ice cover on the one hand the turbulent coherent vortex generated underside the ice cover interacts with that induced by the channel bottom lotsari et al 2019 muste et al 2000 which enhances the disturbance intensity and affects the turbulent shear stress distribution the redistribution of the turbulent shear stress will certainly influence the turbulent mass diffusivity and hence the vertical distribution of the ssc on the other hand the presence of the floating ice cover increases the pressure at the ice water interface that is equal to the atmospheric pressure plus the weight of the ice column per unit area correspondingly the fall velocity of the suspended sediment particle is expected to be affected by the floating ice cover therefore this study focuses on the analytical exploration of the ssc in the ice covered alluvial channel flows 2 1 formulation of the suspended sediment concentration for an ice covered channel with a steady uniform flow field if the sinking sediment flux due to the submerged weight is balanced by the net floating upward sediment flux due to the turbulent diffusion the ssc profile will then reach an equilibrium in the vertical direction which is similar to that in the open channel flows based on the schmidt o brien equation the governing equation of the ssc profile in the steady uniform flow field of the ice covered channels can be expressed as sayre and song 1979 1 γ z dc dz ω s c 0 where c denotes the suspended sediment concentration in mg l г z is the vertical turbulent mass transfer coefficient of the sediment particles in m2 s ωs is the sediment fall velocity in m s and z denotes the vertical coordinate in m by solving eq 1 one has 2 c c a exp a z ω s γ z d z where ca is a reference sediment concentration at the vertical level z a from the channel bed bottom in mg l to obtain the analytical solution of the ssc it is required to know the distribution patterns of the vertical turbulent mass transfer coefficient г z and the sediment fall velocity ωs the turbulent mass transfer coefficient is usually related to the eddy viscosity υ t and can be described as krishnappan 1983 3 γ z σ υ t where σ is the dimensionless proportionality constant which is equal to the reciprocal of the turbulent schmidt number with regard to the eddy viscosity υ t in the ice covered channels considering that there exist two sets of length and velocity scales for the turbulent mixing due to the different roughnesses between the channel bed and the ice cover guo et al 2017 integrated the two scales into a single eddy viscosity equation and proposed an analytical model that can be applied to the asymmetric turbulent flow 4 υ t 2 κ h u b β ξ 1 ξ 1 α ξ ξ c 1 2 where κ is

layer is greater than that of the upper ice layer and the turbulent coherent vortex due to the bed roughness dominates the turbulent mixing when λ 1 a symmetrical flow forms underneath the floating ice cover and the turbulent coherent vortices generated by the bed roughness and the ice cover roughness are approximately equivalent in strength when λ 1 the turbulent coherent vortex of the upper ice layer plays a prominent role in the turbulent mixing substituting eq 4 into eq 3 yields the expression of the vertical turbulent mass transfer coefficient г z 5 γ z 2 σ κ h u b β ξ 1 ξ 1 α ξ ξ c 1 2 most studies on the fall velocity of the sediment particle assume that the water depth is infinite thereby introducing a constant sediment fall velocity throughout the flow depth however the flow condition about the infinite water depth is impossible to achieve in practice especially in the laboratory experiment when one studies the sediment settlement law or the gradation analysis based on the sediment settlement law the wall boundary of the experimental facility will definitely affect the research results hence it is necessary to take into account the influence of the wall boundary on the sediment fall velocity for an ice covered channel with shallow flows the upper ice cover boundary and the lower channel bed boundary will undoubtedly have an impact on the fall velocity of the sediment particle hence based on the work of lorentz 1903 a modified formula for the sediment fall velocity considering the influences of the upper ice cover and lower channel bed boundaries is proposed as 6 ω s ω 0 1 φ d z ω 0 ξ ξ φ ξ d where ω 0 is the sediment fall velocity in the infinite flow field in m s φ is the dimensionless correction coefficient that needs to be calibrated and its magnitude will affect the vertical distribution of the sediment fall velocity and hence the ssc profile d is the median diameter of the sediment particle in mm z is the distance from the particle center to the channel bed in m and ξ d d h for the sediment fall velocity in the infinite flow field ω 0 the formula proposed by zhang 1998 is adopted 7 ω 0 13 95 υ d 2 1 09 γ s γ w γ w g d 13 95 υ d where υ is the kinematic viscosity coefficient of clear water in m2 s γs is the specific weight of sediment in n m3 γw is the specific weight of clear water in n m3 and g is the gravitational

to compute the ssc for an ice covered channel one requires to know the values of the shear velocity of the lower bed layer u b the shear velocity of the upper ice layer u i the dimensionless characteristic parameter λ the reference sediment concentration ca the dimensionless correction coefficient φ and the proportionality constant σ this section presents the determination procedure of these physical parameters in detail 2 2 1 dimensionless characteristic parameter λ and shear velocities u b and u i when studying the ice covered channel flow the two layer hypothesis is usually adopted to divide the flow underneath the floating ice cover into two pseudo free surface flows sayre and song 1979 teal et al 1994 as shown in fig 1 the two layers correspond to the upper ice layer and the lower bed layer and their interface locates at the position of the maximum streamwise velocity the flow characteristics in the two layers are dominated by the roughnesses of the ice cover and the channel bed respectively the relationship between the flow depth of the lower bed layer and the total flow depth can be expressed as tsai and ettema 1994 11 h b h m i m b m i where hb is the flow depth of the lower bed layer namely the distance from the channel bed bottom to the plane of the maximum streamwise velocity in m mb and mi are the dimensionless parameters related to the channel bed roughness and the ice cover roughness respectively tsai and ettema 1994 gave the expressions of the parameters mb and mi as 12 m b κ 8 f b 1 2 13 m i κ 8 f i 1 2 where fb and fi are the darcy weisbach resistance factors of the lower bed layer and the upper ice layer respectively by combining the chezy formula with the manning formula one can obtain the resistance factors fb and fi as 14 f b 8 g n b 2 r b 1 3 15 f i 8 g n i 2 r i 1 3 where nb and ni are the manning s roughness coefficients associated with the channel bed and the ice cover respectively rb and ri are respectively the hydraulic radiuses of the lower bed layer and the upper ice layer in m considering that the relationship between rb and ri can be presented by r b r i n b 3 2 n i 3 2 wang et al 2020 the relationship between fb and fi based on eqs 14 and 15 can be expressed as 16 f b f i n b n i 3 2 hence substituting eqs 12 13 and 16 into eq 11 yields 17 h b h 1 n i n b 3 4 according to hi h hb the flow depth of the upper ice layer hi can be expressed as 18 h i h 1 n b n i 3 4 given that the flows in the upper ice layer and the lower bed layer are usually deemed as two pseudo free surface flows the shear velocities u b and u i of the two layers can be obtained from the momentum balance which is similar to the uniform open channel flow lau and krishnappan 1985 muste et al 2000 19 u b gs h b 20 u i gs h i where s is the channel bed slope substituting eqs 17 and 18 into eqs 19 and 20 yields 21 u b gsh 1 n i n b 3 4 22 u i gsh 1 n b n i 3 4 therefore in line with λ u i u b the dimensionless characteristic parameter λ can be presented as 23 λ n i n b 3 8 2 2 2 reference sediment concentration ca the method proposed by van rijn 1984b is adopted here for estimating the reference concentration ca 24 c a 0 015 d 50 t 1 5 a d 0 3 where a is the reference level from the channel bed bottom and assumed to be equal to the half of the bed form height δ i e a 0 5 δ while the bed form dimensions are known or else a is equal to the equivalent roughness height ks i e a ks and a must satisfy a 0 01h d 50 is the particle median diameter of the bed material in mm d is a dimensionless particle parameter and d d 50 s 1 g υ 2 1 3 s s ρ s ρ is the dimensionless specific density of the sediment particle t is a dimensionless transport stage parameter according to the studies of knack and shen 2015 and van rijn 1984a the parameter t is defined as 25 t u 2 u c r 2 u c r 2 in which u u τ b ρ is the shear velocity related to the sediment particles in m s τ b τ b γ n b 2 u 2 ζ b h 1 3 is the bed shear stress related to

b h is the fraction of the flow depth influenced by the channel bed roughness u c r is the critical bed shear velocity in m s which can be computed based on the shields curve as shown in fig 1 of van rijn 1984a note that the reference concentration ca computed by eq 24 is in terms of solids volume per unit fluid volume and the unit of ca can be transformed into kg m3 after multiplying by the sediment density ρs 2 2 3 dimensionless correction coefficient φ and proportionality constant σ in this study the correction coefficient of the sediment fall velocity φ and the proportionality constant σ are two free characteristic parameters and need to be empirically calibrated for computing the best fit with the available experimental suspended sediment concentration from the above analysis if the values of u b u i λ and ca have been calculated and the values of φ and σ have been given the ssc profile in an ice covered channel can be computed by using eq 9 to clearly show the physical parameters required for the calculation of the ssc we summarize the classification of these physical quantities in table 2 3 results this section consists of two parts the validation of the proposed ssc model and the effects of the characteristic parameters on the ssc profile when demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed ssc model we employ the experimental data published in the literature and calibrate the values of the correction coefficient φ and the proportionality constant σ to improve the simulation accuracy a series of values for the correction coefficient φ the proportionality constant σ and the dimensionless characteristic parameters λ are provided and the influences of these characteristic parameters on the ssc profile are investigated 3 1 comparison with experimental data the proposed ssc model is validated by comparing the simulated results with the measured data from sediment transport experiments on the ice covered channel flows reported in the literature these experiments included both the smooth and rough ice cover the detailed experimental conditions of the eight runs by sayre and song 1979 notated with as ar bs and br lau and krishnappan 1985 represented as 4c 5c and 7c and muste et al 2000 denoted as sc are shown in table 3 a brief description of these experimental schemes is presented here for completeness and convenience sayre and song 1979 performed sediment transport experiments in a recirculating flume with a sand bed and a simulated floating ice cover the measuring section had glass sided walls and was 27 4 m long 0 914 m wide and 0 45 m deep the flume slope could be adjusted without interfering with the operation of the flume the channel bed consisted of quartz foundry sand with a median diameter of 0 25 mm and a geometric standard deviation of 1 41 the simulated ice cover was composed of two types namely smooth ice cover and rough ice cover to simulate the smooth ice cover the adopted painted plywood panels which were 1 22 m in length 0 91 m in width and 1 27 cm in thickness were connected by hinges and formed a nonrigid floating cover expanding over almost the entire measuring section for constituting a rough ice cover the 0 64 cm thick and 2 54 cm wide continuous masonite strips were tacked to the undersurface of the panels with intervals of 15 24 cm details of the experimental parameters are summarized in columns two to five in table 3 lau and krishnappan 1985 conducted the experiments in a rectangular flume with a length of 57 3 m a width of 0 756 m and a depth of 0 29 m the bed material was made up of flex o lite bt10 glass beads with a median diameter of 0 15 mm and a specific gravity of 2 50 the simulated ice cover consisted of 1 9 cm thick plywood panels whose underside was glued by plastic laminate thereby forming a very smooth bottom surface for runs 4c 5c and 7c the channel slope was held constant as 0 001 while the flow discharge was varied from 0 0154 m3 s to 0 0274 m3 s other flow parameters were listed in table 3 the sediment recirculating flume with a floating ice cover used by muste et al 2000 was 30 m long 0 91 m wide and 0 45 m deep the flume slope was set to 1 5 10 4 with a resolution of 5 10 4 the flow discharge was kept constant at 0 0318 m3 s with an uncertainty of 5 10 5 m3 s the sediment bed was comprised of a uniform fine sand with a median diameter of 0 25 mm a geometric standard deviation of 1 4 and a specific gravity of 2 64 the floating ice cover was simulated using 1 22 m long 0 9 m wide and 1 3 cm thick plywood panels similar to the experiments of sayre and song 1979 the smooth ice cover was formed by painting the underside surface of the panels and the rough ice cover was modeled by gluing rectangular shaped wooden strips on the undersurface of the panels we first utilize the experimental data with the smooth ice cover to carry out the simulation and comparison fig 3 is the comparison between the simulated and the measured sayre and song 1979 ssc profile where the simulated parameters φ and σ are empirically calibrated and listed in table 3 overall the simulated ssc profiles agree fairly well with the experimental results for the four runs it is also seen that near the ice cover bottom the proposed ssc model slightly overpredicts the ssc for run as and underpredicts the ssc for runs ar and bs the correction coefficient of the sediment fall velocity φ for the four runs fluctuates around 1 15 which is larger than the value of 9 16 proposed by lorentz 1903 in studying the impact of the bottom horizontal boundary on the particle fall velocity the values of the proportionality parameter σ using in the simulation are relatively large and range from 4 3 to 16 7 in the study of sayre and song 1979 they also found unreasonably large values for the proportionality parameter σ that ranged from 1 9 to 25 sayre and song 1979 ascribed the unreasonable value of σ to the inaccurate measurement of the suspended sediment with a moderately small quantity in the samples and also to the possibility that the adopted fall velocity corresponding to the sediment median diameter was considerably greater than the actual fall velocity of the suspended sediment however the relatively large value of σ presented here may be related to the strength of the turbulent diffusion effect in the experimental flow which will be understood from the dependence of the ssc profile on the proportionality parameter σ described in the next section fig 4 shows the comparison of the simulated ssc profile with the experimental data from lau and krishnappan 1985 and muste et al 2000 from the visualization perspective the proposed ssc model can provide a good prediction in the ssc distribution it is noted that the proposed model slightly underestimates the ssc in the upper ice layer for runs 4c 5c and 7c which is similar to the simulation results in runs ar and bs this phenomenon may be ascribed to the fact that two turbulent coherent vortices appear beneath the ice cover enhancing the ssc near the ice cover moreover the averaged value of the proportionality parameter σ used in the simulation for runs 4c 5c and 7c is 1 3 that is close to that used in the study of lau and krishnappan 1985 to quantify the accuracy of the predicted ssc by the proposed model error statistics for the eight runs are carried out and shown in table 4 the mean absolute error mae is defined as the average value of the difference between the computed and measured suspended sediment concentrations 26 mae 1 n i 1 n c com i c mea i where n is the sampling number of the measured suspended sediment concentrations for each run ccom denotes the computed ssc using the proposed model and cmea represents the measured ssc the mean relative error mre is expressed as 27 mre 1 n i 1 n c com i c mea i c mea i table 4 shows that the proposed analytical model simulates the ssc profiles within 3 34 mg l accuracy as far as the mae is concerned whereas the mae values for runs br and 7c exceed 5 53 mg l and 7 89 mg l respectively the mre ranges from 0 0836 to 0 1442 except for runs 4c 5c and 7c whose mre values reach up to 0 3567 the comparatively large values of the mre for runs 4c 5c and 7c are mainly caused by the underpredicted ssc in the upper ice layer in the study of lau and krishnappan 1985 they ascribed the underpredicted results to the suspension of the finer fractions of the bed materials krishnappan 1983 utilized the experimental data of sayre and song 1979 to predict the ssc profile while lau and krishnappan 1985 also gave the modeled results for their measured suspended sediment concentrations accordingly to evaluate the performance of the proposed ssc model in this study the mre calculated in this study is compared with that computed by krishnappan 1983 and lau and krishnappan 1985 respectively the result is shown in fig 5 for runs as ar and bs the mre in this study is approximately equivalent to the mre in the previous studies however the mre in this study is significantly smaller than the mre in prior studies for other runs this demonstrates that the analytical ssc model presented in this study has higher accuracy than the model proposed by krishnappan 1983 and lau and krishnappan 1985 3 2 effect of characteristic parameters on the ssc in this section the effect of the characteristic parameters λ φ and σ on the ssc distribution for the ice covered channel flows has been studied using the validated analytical model the vertical reference level adopted in simulations follows the convention and is selected as 0 05h other parameters are listed in table 5 fig 6 shows the influence of the characteristic parameter λ on the vertical distribution of the relative concentration of the suspended sediment c ca in an ice covered channel with σ 5 and σ 10 more detailed results with different values of σ are shown in fig a1 in the appendix a for a given value of σ no matter what the value of λ is the relative concentration is very small near the bottom surface of the ice cover this is similar to the situation of the free surface flows at a given elevation satisfying ξ ξa the relative concentration decreases with the increase of λ whereas the relative concentration increases as λ increases for a given elevation satisfying ξ ξa thus the smaller the value of λ is the more uniform the concentration distribution is this means that under the same channel bed roughness the relatively small ice cover roughness is conducive to suspending the sediment particle these results are consistent with the research of krishnappan 1983 who presented a series of concentration distribution curves with different ratios of the ice cover roughness to the channel bed roughness the impact of the correction coefficient φ on the simulated distribution of the relative concentration in an ice covered channel with σ 5 and σ 10 is presented in fig 7 more detailed results with different values of σ are shown in fig a2 in the appendix a it can be seen that the relative concentration has a similar variation trend as φ changes for different values of σ when ξ ξa the value of the relative concentration is greater for larger values of the correction coefficient φ suggesting that the smaller the sediment fall velocity is the larger the relative concentration is which coincides with the physical mechanism nevertheless the relative concentration presents a negative correlation with the increase of φ for ξ ξa note that the variation law of the relative concentration induced by different values of φ is opposite to that created by diverse values of λ meanwhile by comparing fig 6 with fig 7 the concentration profile is more sensitive to the parameter λ which means that the impact of the varying upper and lower boundary roughness on the concentration distribution is more noticeable than that of the changing sediment fall velocity on the concentration distribution fig 8 presents the dependence of the concentration profile on the proportionality parameter σ when λ 1 and φ 1 5 more detailed results with different values of λ and φ are shown in figs a3 and a4 in the appendix a at a given vertical elevation the value of the relative concentration is greater for larger values of the proportionality parameter σ indicating that the proportionality parameter σ reflects the uniformity of the concentration profile in fact the simulated results presented here can be explained from the perspective of the physical mechanism according to eq 3 it is known that the larger the value of σ is the more conspicuous the turbulent diffusion effect is when the turbulent diffusion effect with a relatively large σ is much greater than the gravity effect the sediment particles will be easily suspended in the water body thereby generating a comparatively uniform concentration profile therefore if the vertical profile of the relative concentration is known it can be inferred the degree of the turbulent diffusion effect and hence the rough value of the proportionality parameter σ 4 discussion when an ice cover is formed on the channel flow surface the boundary shear stress and the eddy viscosity corresponding to the lower bed layer of the ice covered channel flows are both smaller than that corresponding to the bed boundary of the ice free channel flows whereupon the ability of the flow to transport sediments is declined due to the reduced bed shear stress leading to a decrease of ssc as well as the suspended sediment load in light of these facts this study proposes an analytical ssc model based on the schmidt o brien equation the proposed ssc model considers the effect of the additional ice cover on the sediment fall velocity an eddy viscosity model that can be applied to the ice covered channel flow is also employed in the derivation of the ssc model the proposed ssc model is then validated by comparing with the available sediment transport experiments on the ice covered channel flows reported in the literature the accuracy of the proposed ssc model is evaluated meanwhile the effect of both the parameter λ and the sediment fall velocity correction coefficient φ on the ssc is investigated by using the proposed model simulated results show that the smaller ice cover roughness relative to the channel bed roughness is favorable to the suspension of the sediment particles and the ssc is more sensitive to the variation of the boundary roughness than to the variation of the sediment fall velocity besides it has been found that there is a correlation between the uniformity of the concentration profile and the magnitude of the proportionality parameter σ although several models had been developed for predicting the suspended sediment concentration for the ice covered channel flows in previous studies all these ssc models were not concisely expressed as a straightforward equation in the study of sayre and song 1979 the turbulent mass transfer coefficient г z near the lower and upper boundaries followed the parabola distribution whereas г z in the middle flow depth zone was assumed to be distributed linearly between the vertices of the lower and upper parabolas given that the distribution of г z in the central region was given without any theoretical foundation the reliability of the ssc model proposed by sayre and song 1979 needs further verification in the studies of krishnappan 1983 and lau and krishnappan 1985 they obtained the distribution of the eddy viscosity νt based on the k ε turbulent model and then developed the profile of г z utilizing the assumed proportional relationship between г z and νt the ssc distribution curves for the ice covered channel flows were then obtained by solving the schmidt o brien equation however the methods for predicting the ssc developed by krishnappan 1983 and lau and krishnappan 1985 are implicit and appropriate numerical schemes are required for solving the k ε turbulent model involved different from previous studies the ssc model proposed in this study is expressed as an explicit equation that can be easily computed by using matlab to investigate how the characteristic parameters affect the ssc profile in the ice covered channel flow the simulation results show that the proposed ssc model has higher accuracy than previously reported methods in terms of the predicted ssc profile however there is still room for improvement as the model underestimates the suspended sediment concentration near the upper boundary note that due to the limitation of available experimental data the correction coefficient of the sediment fall velocity φ used in the simulation for the eight runs in this study fluctuates around the value of 1 09 which lacks the universality and may not apply to other ice covered flow conditions therefore further sediment transport experiments in an ice covered channel are required to be conducted for investigating the general value for the correction coefficient φ 5 conclusions to obtain a thorough knowledge of the ssc profile for the ice covered alluvial channels with steady uniform flows this study proposes an analytical ssc model by utilizing the eddy viscosity model applied to the asymmetric turbulent flow and considering the common effects of the upper and lower boundaries on the sediment fall velocity the proposed model is validated by comparing the simulated results with available experimental data the validated model is then used to investigate the effects of the characteristic parameters on the vertical distribution of the ssc in the ice covered channel the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the agreement between the simulated ssc profile and the laboratory measured data reported in the literature is satisfactory nonetheless the simulated results underpredict the ssc in the upper ice layer which may be caused by the coherent vortex generating underside the ice cover the error statistics analysis illustrates that the performance of the proposed model is better than previous models in terms of predicting the suspended sediment concentration profile in the ice covered channel flows 2 the relative suspended sediment concentration decreases as the parameter λ increases at a given elevation satisfying ξ ξa while the relative concentration increases with the increase of the parameter λ for ξ ξa as the parameter λ actually reflects the ratio of the ice cover roughness to the channel bed roughness it can be inferred that the sediment particles are more likely to be suspended under the action of a smaller ice cover roughness 3 the impact of the correction coefficient of the sediment fall velocity on the ssc distribution is in contrast to the effect of the parameter λ on the ssc profile although the relative concentration decreases as the ice cover roughness and the sediment fall velocity increase the boundary roughness has a relatively prominent influence on the relative concentration profile 4 the simulated relative concentration profile becomes more uniform as the proportionality parameter σ increases this result is consistent with the physical mechanism that the uniformity of the ssc profile is mainly determined by the strength of the turbulent diffusion effect while the magnitude of the proportionality parameter σ actually represents the extent of the turbulent diffusion effect although this study presents an effective analytical model to compute the ssc for the ice covered alluvial channels there are still some aspects that could be improved in future work for example the available laboratory measured data that can be found in the literature are limited which restricts the detailed analysis and study of the sediment fall velocity correction coefficient φ that is very important in determining the ssc further experiments in the ice covered sediment laden flow are required in order to investigate the universal value or range of φ besides given that numerical simulation is a significant tool for investigating the water and sediment transport process the motion of sediment particles such as the rolling and sliding motion the saltation motion and the suspended particle motion in the ice covered channel flows could be simulated by utilizing the sophisticated numerical models credit

4648,ice cover formed on an alluvial channel can significantly alter the flow characteristics such as the vertical distributions of streamwise velocity and shear stress and hence the water and sediment transport process the vertical profile of the suspended sediment concentration in the ice covered alluvial channels with steady uniform flows is investigated in this study to calculate the suspended sediment concentration we are based on the schmidt o brien equation and deduce an analytical model that employs an existing eddy viscosity model and a modified formula of the sediment fall velocity considering the common effects of the upper and lower boundaries the proposed analytical model is then validated by using available experimental data reported in the literature the predicted accuracy of the proposed model is evaluated through error statistics by comparing to previous modeled results the relative concentration profiles of the suspended sediment are subsequently simulated by applying the validated analytical model with different characteristic parameters results show that the relative concentration decreases with the increase of both the ice cover roughness and the sediment fall velocity the uniformity of the relative concentration distribution is closely related to the value of the proportionality parameter σ revealing the physical mechanism that the more prominent the turbulent diffusion effect is the more uniform the relative concentration profile is keywords suspended sediment concentration ice covered channel analytical model modified sediment fall

roughness 1 introduction the flow structure in alluvial channels changes and develops continuously caused by the interaction between the water flow and the rough river bed lane et al 1996 sharma et al 2019 tayfur and singh 2012 in effect sediment transport which is mainly controlled by the turbulent flow structure is the agent of the aforementioned interacted process cordier et al 2019 when the lift force exerted on the sediment particle due to the turbulent diffusion effect is greater than the submerged weight of the sediment particle the sediment particle will be raised from the channel bed and move forward along with the water flow thereby forming sediment laden flow brayshaw et al 1983 cheng et al 2020 on the other hand if the turbulent diffusion effect is weaker than the submerged weight effect of the sediment particle the suspended sediment particle will be brought back to the channel bed resulting in the sediment deposition in engineering practice the sediment problem is one of the issues that engineers must consider in the construction of all water conservancy projects such as the selection of a port site the scheme formulation of the channel dredging and improvement and the layout of the irrigation and drainage facilities peng et al 2020 stone and krishnappan 2002 torres et al 2009 xia et al 2016 yang et al 2007 therefore in light of the non negligible impact of the sediment movement on the industrial and agricultural production along the channel banks there is a growing interest in the concentration distribution of the suspended sediment in the alluvial channels when alluvial channels located in cold regions expose to freezing temperatures an ice cover will form over the water surface of alluvial channels significantly altering the flow characteristics and consequently influencing the sediment transport chassiot et al 2020 ettema 2002 lawler 1993 turcotte et al 2011 as shown in the schematic diagram of fig 1 the ice covered alluvial channel flow is asymmetric concerning the plane of the zero shear stress due to the different roughnesses and shear stresses on the upper and lower boundaries guo et al 2017 tsai and ettema 1994 the wetted perimeter of the shallow channel is approximately doubled both the flow depth and the total boundary shear stress increase and the averaged streamwise velocity decreases hoque 2009 smith and ettema 1997 wang et al 2020 given that the total boundary shear stress is certainly distributed between the upper and lower boundaries the boundary shear stress corresponding to the channel bed i e the lower boundary is expected to be reduced sayre and song 1979 the reduction of the bed boundary shear stress and the averaged streamwise velocity can in turn reduce the bedload transport as well as the suspended sediment concentration ssc thereby affecting the sediment transport process and hence the river bed morphology because knowledge of the ssc profile is related to many engineering and environmental problems such as the operation and maintenance of a reservoir and the performance of the channel control structures beltaos and burrell 2016 caissie et al 2014 ettema et al 2000 gebre et al 2014 it is necessary to investigate the ssc in the ice covered alluvial channel flows extensive studies have been conducted to investigate the ssc profiles in the fully developed two dimensional 2d free surface alluvial channel flows cellino and lemmin 2004 jha and bombardelli 2011 kabir and ahmari 2020 miyata et al 2020 pal and ghoshal 2017 rouse 1937 umeyama 1992 however to the authors best knowledge studies on the ssc profile in the ice covered alluvial channel flows have been very limited except that several studies were carried out to explore the sediment transport using the flume experiments with narrow flow conditions muste et al 2000 carried out laboratory flume experiments in an ice covered sand bed channel and found that the sediment transport rates were reduced comparing with that without the ice cover channel flows sayre and song 1979 performed flume experiments to investigate the effect of a floating ice cover on the sediment transport features they divided the flow of the ice covered channel into two layers namely the upper ice layer and the lower bed layer with the maximum streamwise velocity and the zero turbulent shear stress at the interface subsequently the analytical expressions for the vertical turbulent mass transfer coefficient and the ssc were derived by adopting the two layer approach based on the formula of the ssc proposed by sayre and song 1979 knack and shen 2015 estimated the suspended sediment load and the bed load for the ice covered channels differently krishnappan 1983 applied the k ε turbulent model to predict the momentum diffusivity distributions in the ice covered streams and then formulated the concentration distribution curves for the suspended sediment similar to the method used by krishnappan 1983 lau and krishnappan 1985 simulated both the ssc profile and the streamwise velocity distribution and then compared the simulated results with their laboratory measurements conducted under different ice covered conditions huang 2014 and knack 2011 developed a two dimensional numerical model that coupled the hydro thermo ice sediment dynamics to investigate the effect of the ice cover on the suspended sediment transport in curved channels the above literature review shows that the previous models predicting the ssc profile for the ice covered channel flows can be classified as the analytical model and the numerical model as shown in table 1 although the analytical model proposed by sayre and song 1979 has a good predictive ability one needs to know the streamwise velocity profile prior to determining the position of the maximum streamwise velocity for the application of the two layer hypothesis the model of the turbulent mass transfer coefficient that is the key factor to obtain the above analytical model consists of three components and is not integrated into a single equation furthermore the turbulent mass transfer coefficient is not deduced rigorously because sayre and song 1979 simply assumed that the turbulent mass transfer coefficient followed the linear distribution in the central region the numerical model presented by krishnappan 1983 and lau and krishnappan 1985 applied the k ε turbulent model when one applies the numerical model to simulate the ssc profile an appropriate numerical scheme has to be proposed to solve the semiempirical transport equations of k and ε along with the continuity and momentum equations the predicted ssc distribution based on the k ε turbulent model agrees well with experimental results however this numerical model requires considerable computation and can not directly reflect which physical quantity affects the sediment concentration similarly the hydro thermo ice sediment dynamical model employed by huang 2014 and knack 2011 lacks brevity and involves substantial calculations this motivates the current work in which we develop a concise and precise analytical model for predicting the ssc distribution in the ice covered channel flows in this study we present a novel analytical model to predict the vertical profile of the ssc for the steady uniform flow in the ice covered alluvial channels first the analytical expression of the vertical turbulent mass transfer coefficient is obtained by utilizing the eddy viscosity model applied to asymmetric turbulent flows proposed by guo et al 2017 in light of the dimensional limitation of experimental facilities the sediment fall velocity is certainly affected by the wall boundary accordingly a modified formula for the sediment fall velocity which considers the combined effects of the upper and lower boundaries is then proposed by introducing the formulas of the turbulent mass transfer coefficient and the sediment fall velocity into the schmidt o brien equation an analytical model is derived to calculate the ssc distribution in the ice covered channel flows subsequently the analytical ssc model is verified by available experimental data and the prediction accuracy of the model is assessed by comparing the calculated ssc distributions in this study with those found in the literature finally the influences of the pivotal characteristic parameters on the ssc profile in the ice covered channel flows are investigated 2 method the sediment transport in the ice covered alluvial channel flows is more complicated than the sediment conveyance in the open channel flows due to the effect of a floating ice cover on the one hand the turbulent coherent vortex generated underside the ice cover interacts with that induced by the channel bottom lotsari et al 2019 muste et al 2000 which enhances the disturbance intensity and affects the turbulent shear stress distribution the redistribution of the turbulent shear stress will certainly influence the turbulent mass diffusivity and hence the vertical distribution of the ssc on the other hand the presence of the floating ice cover increases the pressure at the ice water interface that is equal to the atmospheric pressure plus the weight of the ice column per unit area correspondingly the fall velocity of the suspended sediment particle is expected to be affected by the floating ice cover therefore this study focuses on the analytical exploration of the ssc in the ice covered alluvial channel flows 2 1 formulation of the suspended sediment concentration for an ice covered channel with a steady uniform flow field if the sinking sediment flux due to the submerged weight is balanced by the net floating upward sediment flux due to the turbulent diffusion the ssc profile will then reach an equilibrium in the vertical direction which is similar to that in the open channel flows based on the schmidt o brien equation the governing equation of the ssc profile in the steady uniform flow field of the ice covered channels can be expressed as sayre and song 1979 1 γ z dc dz ω s c 0 where c denotes the suspended sediment concentration in mg l г z is the vertical turbulent mass transfer coefficient of the sediment particles in m2 s ωs is the sediment fall velocity in m s and z denotes the vertical coordinate in m by solving eq 1 one has 2 c c a exp a z ω s γ z d z where ca is a reference sediment concentration at the vertical level z a from the channel bed bottom in mg l to obtain the analytical solution of the ssc it is required to know the distribution patterns of the vertical turbulent mass transfer coefficient г z and the sediment fall velocity ωs the turbulent mass transfer coefficient is usually related to the eddy viscosity υ t and can be described as krishnappan 1983 3 γ z σ υ t where σ is the dimensionless proportionality constant which is equal to the reciprocal of the turbulent schmidt number with regard to the eddy viscosity υ t in the ice covered channels considering that there exist two sets of length and velocity scales for the turbulent mixing due to the different roughnesses between the channel bed and the ice cover guo et al 2017 integrated the two scales into a single eddy viscosity equation and proposed an analytical model that can be applied to the asymmetric turbulent flow 4 υ t 2 κ h u b β ξ 1 ξ 1 α ξ ξ c 1 2 where κ is the von kámán constant and κ 0 40 h is the total flow depth underneath the ice cover in m u b is the shear velocity of the lower bed layer in m s β λ λ 2 n 2 1 λ 2 n α 1 λ λ λ 2 n ξ z h ξc represents the critical position of the eddy viscosity and ξ c 1 1 λ n with n 5 6 λ is a dimensionless parameter and λ u i u b and u i is the shear velocity of the upper ice layer in m s the vertical profile of the eddy viscosity υ t can be attained if λ is known fig 2 shows the eddy viscosity distribution with different λ values in the ice covered channel flows when 0 λ 1 the shear velocity of the lower bed layer is greater than that of the upper ice layer and the turbulent coherent vortex due to the bed roughness dominates the turbulent mixing when λ 1 a symmetrical flow forms underneath the floating ice cover and the turbulent coherent vortices generated by the bed roughness and the ice cover roughness are approximately equivalent in strength when λ 1 the turbulent coherent vortex of the upper ice layer plays a prominent role in the turbulent mixing substituting eq 4 into eq 3 yields the expression of the vertical turbulent mass transfer coefficient г z 5 γ z 2 σ κ h u b β ξ 1 ξ 1 α ξ ξ c 1 2 most studies on the fall velocity of the sediment particle assume that the water depth is infinite thereby introducing a constant sediment fall velocity throughout the flow depth however the flow condition about the infinite water depth is impossible to achieve in practice especially in the laboratory experiment when one studies the sediment settlement law or the gradation analysis based on the sediment settlement law the wall boundary of the experimental facility will definitely affect the research results hence it is necessary to take into account the influence of the wall boundary on the sediment fall velocity for an ice covered channel with shallow flows the upper ice cover boundary and the lower channel bed boundary will undoubtedly have an impact on the fall velocity of the sediment particle hence based on the work of lorentz 1903 a modified formula for the sediment fall velocity considering the influences of the upper ice cover and lower channel bed boundaries is proposed as 6 ω s ω 0 1 φ d z ω 0 ξ ξ φ ξ d where ω 0 is the sediment fall velocity in the infinite flow field in m s φ is the dimensionless correction coefficient that needs to be calibrated and its magnitude will affect the vertical distribution of the sediment fall velocity and hence the ssc profile d is the median diameter of the sediment particle in mm z is the distance from the particle center to the channel bed in m and ξ d d h for the sediment fall velocity in the infinite flow field ω 0 the formula proposed by zhang 1998 is adopted 7 ω 0 13 95 υ d 2 1 09 γ s γ w γ w g d 13 95 υ d where υ is the kinematic viscosity coefficient of clear water in m2 s γs is the specific weight of sediment in n m3 γw is the specific weight of clear water in n m3 and g is the gravitational acceleration in m s2 accordingly substituting eqs 5 and 6 into eq 2 yields 8 c c a exp ω 0 2 σ κ h u b β a z 1 1 ξ 1 α ξ ξ c 1 2 ξ φ ξ d d z by dividing the integral term of eq 8 into partial fractions we can get the exact expression of the integral term see appendix a1 thus the ssc in the ice covered channel flows can be obtained as 9 c c a exp ω 0 2 σ κ u b β 1 φ ξ d ξ c 2 α 1 ξ c 2 ξ c

to compute the ssc for an ice covered channel one requires to know the values of the shear velocity of the lower bed layer u b the shear velocity of the upper ice layer u i the dimensionless characteristic parameter λ the reference sediment concentration ca the dimensionless correction coefficient φ and the proportionality constant σ this section presents the determination procedure of these physical parameters in detail 2 2 1 dimensionless characteristic parameter λ and shear velocities u b and u i when studying the ice covered channel flow the two layer hypothesis is usually adopted to divide the flow underneath the floating ice cover into two pseudo free surface flows sayre and song 1979 teal et al 1994 as shown in fig 1 the two layers correspond to the upper ice layer and the lower bed layer and their interface locates at the position of the maximum streamwise velocity the flow characteristics in the two layers are dominated by the roughnesses of the ice cover and the channel bed respectively the relationship between the flow depth of the lower bed layer and the total flow depth can be expressed as tsai and ettema 1994 11 h b h m i m b m i where hb is the flow depth of the lower bed layer namely the distance from the channel bed bottom to the plane of the maximum streamwise velocity in m mb and mi are the dimensionless parameters related to the channel bed roughness and the ice cover roughness respectively tsai and ettema 1994 gave the expressions of the parameters mb and mi as 12 m b κ 8 f b 1 2 13 m i κ 8 f i 1 2 where fb and fi are the darcy weisbach resistance factors of the lower bed layer and the upper ice layer respectively by combining the chezy formula with the manning formula one can obtain the resistance factors fb and fi as 14 f b 8 g n b 2 r b 1 3 15 f i 8 g n i 2 r i 1 3 where nb and ni are the manning s roughness coefficients associated with the channel bed and the ice cover respectively rb and ri are respectively the hydraulic radiuses of the lower bed layer and the upper ice layer in m considering that the relationship between rb and ri can be presented by r b r i n b 3 2 n i 3 2 wang et al 2020 the relationship between fb and fi based on eqs 14 and 15 can be expressed as 16 f b f i n b n i 3 2 hence substituting eqs 12 13 and 16 into eq 11 yields 17 h b h 1 n i n b 3 4 according to hi h hb the flow depth of the upper ice layer hi can be expressed as 18 h i h 1 n b n i 3 4 given that the flows in the upper ice layer and the lower bed layer are usually deemed as two pseudo free surface flows the shear velocities u b and u i of the two layers can be obtained from the momentum balance which is similar to the uniform open channel flow lau and krishnappan 1985 muste et al 2000 19 u b gs h b 20 u i gs h i where s is the channel bed slope substituting eqs 17 and 18 into eqs 19 and 20 yields 21 u b gsh 1 n i n b 3 4 22 u i gsh 1 n b n i 3 4 therefore in line with λ u i u b the dimensionless characteristic parameter λ can be presented as 23 λ n i n b 3 8 2 2 2 reference sediment concentration ca the method proposed by van rijn 1984b is adopted here for estimating the reference concentration ca 24 c a 0 015 d 50 t 1 5 a d 0 3 where a is the reference level from the channel bed bottom and assumed to be equal to the half of the bed form height δ i e a 0 5 δ while the bed form dimensions are known or else a is

b h is the fraction of the flow depth influenced by the channel bed roughness u c r is the critical bed shear velocity in m s which can be computed based on the shields curve as shown in fig 1 of van rijn 1984a note that the reference concentration ca computed by eq 24 is in terms of solids volume per unit fluid volume and the unit of ca can be transformed into kg m3 after multiplying by the sediment density ρs 2 2 3 dimensionless correction coefficient φ and proportionality constant σ in this study the correction coefficient of the sediment fall velocity φ and the proportionality constant σ are two free characteristic parameters and need to be empirically calibrated for computing the best fit with the available experimental suspended sediment concentration from the above analysis if the values of u b u i λ and ca have been calculated and the values of φ and σ have been given the ssc profile in an ice covered channel can be computed by using eq 9 to clearly show the physical parameters required for the calculation of the ssc we summarize the classification of these physical quantities in table 2 3 results this section consists of two parts the validation of the proposed ssc model and the effects of the characteristic parameters on the ssc profile when demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed ssc model we employ the experimental data published in the literature and calibrate the values of the correction coefficient φ and the proportionality constant σ to improve the simulation accuracy a series of values for the correction coefficient φ the proportionality constant σ and the dimensionless characteristic parameters λ are provided and the influences of these characteristic parameters on the ssc profile are investigated 3 1 comparison with experimental data the proposed ssc model is validated by comparing the simulated results with the measured data from sediment transport experiments on the ice covered channel flows reported in the literature these experiments included both the smooth and rough ice cover the detailed experimental conditions of the eight runs by sayre and song 1979 notated with as ar bs and br lau and krishnappan 1985 represented as 4c 5c and 7c and muste et al 2000 denoted as sc are shown in table 3 a brief description of these experimental schemes is presented here for completeness and convenience sayre and song 1979 performed sediment transport experiments in a recirculating flume with a sand bed and a simulated floating ice cover the measuring section had glass sided walls and was 27 4 m long 0 914 m wide and 0 45 m deep the flume slope could be adjusted without interfering with the operation of the flume the channel bed consisted of quartz foundry sand with a median diameter of 0 25 mm and a geometric standard deviation of 1 41 the simulated ice cover was composed of two types namely smooth ice cover and rough ice cover to simulate the smooth ice cover the adopted painted plywood panels which were 1 22 m in length 0 91 m in width and 1 27 cm in thickness were connected by hinges and formed a nonrigid floating cover expanding over almost the entire measuring section for constituting a rough ice cover the 0 64 cm thick and 2 54 cm wide continuous masonite strips were tacked to the undersurface of the panels with intervals of 15 24 cm details of the experimental parameters are summarized in columns two to five in table 3 lau and krishnappan 1985 conducted the experiments in a rectangular flume with a length of 57 3 m a width of 0 756 m and a depth of 0 29 m the bed material was made up of flex o lite bt10 glass beads with a median diameter of 0 15 mm and a specific gravity of 2 50 the simulated ice cover consisted of 1 9 cm thick plywood panels whose underside was glued by plastic laminate thereby forming a very smooth bottom surface for runs 4c 5c and 7c the channel slope was held constant as 0 001 while the flow discharge was varied from 0 0154 m3 s to 0 0274 m3 s other flow parameters were listed in table 3 the sediment recirculating flume with a floating ice cover used by muste et al 2000 was 30 m long 0 91 m wide and 0 45 m deep the flume slope was set to 1 5 10 4 with a resolution of 5 10 4 the flow discharge was kept constant at 0 0318 m3 s with an uncertainty of 5 10 5 m3 s the sediment bed was comprised of a uniform fine sand with a median diameter of 0 25 mm a geometric standard deviation of 1 4 and a specific gravity of 2 64 the floating ice cover was simulated using 1 22 m long 0 9 m wide and 1 3 cm thick plywood panels similar to the experiments of sayre and song 1979 the smooth ice cover was formed by painting the underside surface of the panels and the rough ice cover was modeled by gluing rectangular shaped wooden strips on the undersurface of the panels we first utilize the experimental data with the smooth ice cover to carry out the simulation and comparison fig 3 is the comparison between the simulated and the measured sayre and song 1979 ssc profile where the simulated parameters φ and σ are empirically calibrated and listed in table 3 overall the simulated ssc profiles agree fairly well with the experimental results for the four runs it is also seen that near the ice cover bottom the proposed ssc model slightly overpredicts the ssc for run as and underpredicts the ssc for runs ar and bs the correction coefficient of the sediment fall velocity φ for the four runs fluctuates around 1 15 which is larger than the value of 9 16 proposed by lorentz 1903 in studying the impact of the bottom horizontal boundary on the particle fall velocity the values of the proportionality parameter σ using in the simulation are relatively large and range from 4 3 to 16 7 in the study of sayre and song 1979 they also found unreasonably large values for the proportionality parameter σ that ranged from 1 9 to 25 sayre and song 1979 ascribed the unreasonable value of σ to the inaccurate measurement of the suspended sediment with a moderately small quantity in the samples and also to the possibility that the adopted fall velocity corresponding to the sediment median diameter was considerably greater than the actual fall velocity of the suspended sediment however the relatively large value of σ presented here may be related to the strength of the turbulent diffusion effect in the experimental flow which will be understood from the dependence of the ssc profile on the proportionality parameter σ described in the next section fig 4 shows the comparison of the simulated ssc profile with the experimental data from lau and krishnappan 1985 and muste et al 2000 from the visualization perspective the proposed ssc model can provide a good prediction in the ssc distribution it is noted that the proposed model slightly underestimates the ssc in the upper ice layer for runs 4c 5c and 7c which is similar to the simulation results in runs ar and bs this phenomenon may be ascribed to the fact that two turbulent coherent vortices appear beneath the ice cover enhancing the ssc near the ice cover moreover the averaged value of the proportionality parameter σ used in the simulation for runs 4c 5c and 7c is 1 3 that is close to that used in the study of lau and krishnappan 1985 to quantify the accuracy of the predicted ssc by the proposed model error statistics for the eight runs are carried out and shown in table 4 the mean absolute error mae is defined as the average value of the difference between the computed and measured suspended sediment concentrations 26 mae 1 n i 1 n c com i c mea i where n is the sampling number of the measured suspended sediment concentrations for each run ccom denotes the computed ssc using the proposed model and cmea represents the measured ssc the mean relative error mre is expressed as 27 mre 1 n i 1 n c com i c mea i c mea i table 4 shows that the proposed analytical model simulates the ssc profiles within 3 34 mg l accuracy as far as the mae is concerned whereas the mae values for runs br and 7c exceed 5 53 mg l and 7 89 mg l respectively the mre ranges from 0 0836 to 0 1442 except for runs 4c 5c and 7c whose mre values reach up to 0 3567 the comparatively large values of the mre for runs 4c 5c and 7c are mainly caused by the underpredicted ssc in the upper ice layer in the study of lau and krishnappan 1985 they ascribed the underpredicted results to the suspension of the finer fractions of the bed materials krishnappan 1983 utilized the experimental data of sayre and song 1979 to predict the ssc profile while lau and krishnappan 1985 also gave the modeled results for their measured suspended sediment concentrations accordingly to evaluate the performance of the proposed ssc model in this study the mre calculated in this study is compared with that computed by krishnappan 1983 and lau and krishnappan 1985 respectively the result is shown in fig 5 for runs as ar and bs the mre in this study is approximately equivalent to the mre in the previous studies however the mre in this study is significantly smaller than the mre in prior studies for other runs this demonstrates that the analytical ssc model presented in this study has higher accuracy than the model proposed by krishnappan 1983 and lau and krishnappan 1985 3 2 effect of characteristic parameters on the ssc in this section the effect of the characteristic parameters λ φ and σ on the ssc distribution for the ice covered channel flows has been studied using the validated analytical model the vertical reference level adopted in simulations follows the convention and is selected as 0 05h other parameters are listed in table 5 fig 6 shows the influence of the characteristic parameter λ on the vertical distribution of the relative concentration of the suspended sediment c ca in an ice covered channel with σ 5 and σ 10 more detailed results with different values of σ are shown in fig a1 in the appendix a for a given value of σ no matter what the value of λ is the relative concentration is very small near the bottom surface of the ice cover this is similar to the situation of the free surface flows at a given elevation satisfying ξ ξa the relative concentration decreases with the increase of λ whereas the relative concentration increases as λ increases for a given elevation satisfying ξ ξa thus the smaller the value of λ is the more uniform the concentration distribution is this means that under the same channel bed roughness the relatively small ice cover roughness is conducive to suspending the sediment particle these results are consistent with the research of krishnappan 1983 who presented a series of concentration distribution curves with different ratios of the ice cover roughness to the channel bed roughness the impact of the correction coefficient φ on the simulated distribution of the relative concentration in an ice covered channel with σ 5 and σ 10 is presented in fig 7 more detailed results with different values of σ are shown in fig a2 in the appendix a it can be seen that the relative concentration has a similar variation trend as φ changes for different values of σ when ξ ξa the value of the relative concentration is greater for larger values of the correction coefficient φ suggesting that the smaller the sediment fall velocity is the larger the relative concentration is which coincides with the physical mechanism nevertheless the relative concentration presents a negative correlation with the increase of φ for ξ ξa note that the variation law of the relative concentration induced by different values of φ is opposite to that created by diverse values of λ meanwhile by comparing fig 6 with fig 7 the concentration profile is more sensitive to the parameter λ which means that the impact of the varying upper and lower boundary roughness on the concentration distribution is more noticeable than that of the changing sediment fall velocity on the concentration distribution fig 8 presents the dependence of the concentration profile on the proportionality parameter σ when λ 1 and φ 1 5 more detailed results with different values of λ and φ are shown in figs a3 and a4 in the appendix a at a given vertical elevation the value of the relative concentration is greater for larger values of the proportionality parameter σ indicating that the proportionality parameter σ reflects the uniformity of the concentration profile in fact the simulated results presented here can be explained from the perspective of the physical mechanism according to eq 3 it is known that the larger the value of σ is the more conspicuous the turbulent diffusion effect is when the turbulent diffusion effect with a relatively large σ is much greater than the gravity effect the sediment particles will be easily suspended in the water body thereby generating a comparatively uniform concentration profile therefore if the vertical profile of the relative concentration is known it can be inferred the degree of the turbulent diffusion effect and hence the rough value of the proportionality parameter σ 4 discussion when an ice cover is formed on the channel flow surface the boundary shear stress and the eddy viscosity corresponding to the lower bed layer of the ice covered channel flows are both smaller than that corresponding to the bed boundary of the ice free channel flows whereupon the ability of the flow to transport sediments is declined due to the reduced bed shear stress leading to a decrease of ssc as well as the suspended sediment load in light of these facts this study proposes an analytical ssc model based on the schmidt o brien equation the proposed ssc model considers the effect of the additional ice cover on the sediment fall velocity an eddy viscosity model that can be applied to the ice covered channel flow is also employed in the derivation of the ssc model the proposed ssc model is then validated by comparing with the available sediment transport experiments on the ice covered channel flows reported in the literature the accuracy of the proposed ssc model is evaluated meanwhile the effect of both the parameter λ and the sediment fall velocity correction coefficient φ on the ssc is investigated by using the proposed model simulated results show that the smaller ice cover roughness relative to the channel bed roughness is favorable to the suspension of the sediment particles and the ssc is more sensitive to the variation of the boundary roughness than to the variation of the sediment fall velocity besides it has been found that there is a correlation between the uniformity of the concentration profile and the magnitude of the proportionality parameter σ although several models had been developed for predicting the suspended sediment concentration for the ice covered channel flows in previous studies all these ssc models were not concisely expressed as a straightforward equation in the study of sayre and song 1979 the turbulent mass transfer coefficient г z near the lower and upper boundaries followed the parabola distribution whereas г z in the middle flow depth zone was assumed to be distributed linearly between the vertices of the lower and upper parabolas given that the distribution of г z in the central region was given without any theoretical foundation the reliability of the ssc model proposed by sayre and song 1979 needs further verification in the studies of krishnappan 1983 and lau and krishnappan 1985 they obtained the distribution of the eddy viscosity νt based on the k ε turbulent model and then developed the profile of г z utilizing the assumed proportional relationship between г z and νt the ssc distribution curves for the ice covered channel flows were then obtained by solving the schmidt o brien equation however the methods for predicting the ssc developed by krishnappan 1983 and lau and krishnappan 1985 are implicit and appropriate numerical schemes are required for solving the k ε turbulent model involved different from previous studies the ssc model proposed in this study is expressed as an explicit equation that can be easily computed by using matlab to investigate how the characteristic parameters affect the ssc profile in the ice covered channel flow the simulation results show that the proposed ssc model has higher accuracy than previously reported methods in terms of the predicted ssc profile however there is still room for improvement as the model underestimates the suspended sediment concentration near the upper boundary note that due to the limitation of available experimental data the correction coefficient of the sediment fall velocity φ used in the simulation for the eight runs in this study fluctuates around the value of 1 09 which lacks the universality and may not apply to other ice covered flow conditions therefore further sediment transport experiments in an ice covered channel are required to be conducted for investigating the general value for the correction coefficient φ 5 conclusions to obtain a thorough knowledge of the ssc profile for the ice covered alluvial channels with steady uniform flows this study proposes an analytical ssc model by utilizing the eddy viscosity model applied to the asymmetric turbulent flow and considering the common effects of the upper and lower boundaries on the sediment fall velocity the proposed model is validated by comparing the simulated results with available experimental data the validated model is then used to investigate the effects of the characteristic parameters on the vertical distribution of the ssc in the ice covered channel the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the agreement between the simulated ssc profile and the laboratory measured data reported in the literature is satisfactory nonetheless the simulated results underpredict the ssc in the upper ice layer which may be caused by the coherent vortex generating underside the ice cover the error statistics analysis illustrates that the performance of the proposed model is better than previous models in terms of predicting the suspended sediment concentration profile in the ice covered channel flows 2 the relative suspended sediment concentration decreases as the parameter λ increases at a given elevation satisfying ξ ξa while the relative concentration increases with the increase of the parameter λ for ξ ξa as the parameter λ actually reflects the ratio of the ice cover roughness to the channel bed roughness it can be inferred that the sediment particles are more likely to be suspended under the action of a smaller ice cover roughness 3 the impact of the correction coefficient of the sediment fall velocity on the ssc distribution is in contrast to the effect of the parameter λ on the ssc profile although the relative concentration decreases as the ice cover roughness and the sediment fall velocity increase the boundary roughness has a relatively prominent influence on the relative concentration profile 4 the simulated relative concentration profile becomes more uniform as the proportionality parameter σ increases this result is consistent with the physical mechanism that the uniformity of the ssc profile is mainly determined by the strength of the turbulent diffusion effect while the magnitude of the proportionality parameter σ actually represents the extent of the turbulent diffusion effect although this study presents an effective analytical model to compute the ssc for the ice covered alluvial channels there are still some aspects that could be improved in future work for example the available laboratory measured data that can be found in the literature are limited which restricts the detailed analysis and study of the sediment fall velocity correction coefficient φ that is very important in determining the ssc further experiments in the ice covered sediment laden flow are required in order to investigate the universal value or range of φ besides given that numerical simulation is a significant tool for investigating the water and sediment transport process the motion of sediment particles such as the rolling and sliding motion the saltation motion and the suspended particle motion in the ice covered channel flows could be simulated by utilizing the sophisticated numerical models credit

4649,to distinguish the two fates of co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 during the dissolution of carbonate rock and to reveal the effect of this co2 on the karst related carbon cycle at short timescales baishuwan spring bsw overlying secondary forest and lanhuagou spring lhg overlying farmland were monitored monthly by measurement of major elements and the stable carbon isotope of dissolved inorganic carbon δ13cdic in spring water the average net co2 consumption co2 consumption by h2co3 and co2 emission by h2so4 and or hno3 were 2 43 2 65 and 0 23 mmol l at bsw whereas they were 1 07 2 27 and 1 2 mmol l at lhg respectively the low co2 consumption by h2co3 and the high co2 emission by h2so4 and or hno3 collectively led to a lower net co2 consumption at lhg than at bsw the effect of co2 emissions was greater than the effect of co2 consumption the fates of the co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 were quantified on average 35 26 of this co2 escaped from the water at bsw whereas 82 82 escaped from the water at lhg presumably due to different water rock reaction times changes in the fate of co2 may influence emissions and the karst related carbon cycle keywords karst related carbon cycle molar ratio stable carbon isotope two fates of co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 1 introduction after being released by human activities h2so4 and hno3 are involved in karstification jiang et al 2009 and interfere in the karst related carbon cycle li et al 2008 barnes and raymond 2009 sun et al 2017 when h2so4 and or hno3 dissolve carbonate the first product to be generated is co2 which may directly escape from the water or may further dissolve carbonate and enter water bodies in the form of hco3 perrin et al 2008 in both processes the dissolution of carbonate by h2so4 and or hno3 is regarded as a carbon source over geological timescales torres et al 2014 martin 2017 jiang et al 2018 because hco3 is eventually converted into co2 and then released into the atmosphere when carbonate minerals are deposited in oceans calmels et al 2007 torres et al 2017 however over short timescales the two fates of co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 may have different effects on the karst related carbon cycle one of the important reasons why carbonate dissolution by h2co3 has been considered a carbon sink effect is that atmospheric or soil co2 enters groundwater in the form of hco3 in a short time and this portion of hco3 may be absorbed by aquatic plants in the process of migration with the water pu et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 similarly if the co2 generated by carbonate dissolution by h2so4 and or hno3 participates in additional karstification and subsequently enters groundwater in the form of hco3 the carbon is considered to be sequestered west and mcbride 2005 because no co2 is released into the atmosphere this is simply regarded as the transfer of carbon between the lithosphere and hydrosphere thus the karst related carbon sink flux equals the atmosphere and or soil co2 consumption caused by karstification regardless of carbonate weathering induced by h2so4 and or hno3 in contrast if this co2 does not participate in karstification it may directly return to the soil or atmosphere in the form of co2g li et al 2002 bertrand et al 2007 or may enter groundwater in the form of co2aq where it may escape from the water with a high partial pressure pco2 when groundwater is exposed west and mcbride 2005 in this scenario the carbonate weathering induced by h2so4 and or hno3 will become a co2 source the amount of this co2 should be subtracted from the atmosphere and or soil co2 consumption to estimate karst related carbon sink fluxes whether co2 can participate in karstification is considered to be controlled by a dilution effect soil properties and other factors liu et al 2007 yang et al 2012 zeng et al 2016 this means that the fates of the co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 may also change under different conditions thereby further affecting the karst related carbon sink fluxes zhao et al 2019 therefore in the case of interference by h2so4 and or hno3 it is necessary to quantify the two fates of the co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 during the dissolution of carbonate to estimate karst related carbon fluxes karst related carbon sink fluxes are generally estimated by measurement of the stable carbon isotope of dic δ13cdic or major elements of spring water because there are differences between the δ13cdic generated by h2co3 and the δ13cdic generated by h2so4 and or hno3 the contribution of h2co3 to karstification and co2 consumption can be calculated brunet et al 2011 the co2 consumption calculated by δ13cdic is the amount of co2 consumed by h2co3 rather than the net co2 consumption thus co2 consumption by h2co3 would not change regardless of whether the co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 escaped from the water and reduced net co2 consumption this situation would lead to an overestimation of karst related carbon sink fluxes conversely measurement using the major elements of spring water can enable calculation of the net co2 consumption zhao et al 2019 but it cannot distinguish the co2 consumption by h2co3 and the co2 emission by h2so4 and or hno3 to evaluate the karst related carbon cycle and its influencing factors when h2so4 and or hno3 participate in karstification this study quantified net co2 consumption co2 consumption by h2co3 co2 emission by h2so4 and or hno3 and the fates of the co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 at two karst spring catchments with different land use types measurements of the major elements and δ13cdic of spring water were combined in this study 2 study area baishuwan spring bsw and lanhuagou spring lhg were selected as study sites and were monitored monthly from november 2017 to october 2018 the two springs are located close to each other in the nanchuan district of chongqing city southwest china fig 1 where the annual average precipitation is approximately 1103 1 mm and mean air temperature is approximately 16 68 c zhao et al 2019 the mineral composition is predominantly limestone of the lower triassic jialingjiang formation in the bsw catchment while the lhg catchment consists of limestone and dolomitic limestone of the lower triassic jialingjiang formation there are obvious differences in the land use types between the two catchments in the bsw catchment the land cover is woodland that has experienced minimal disturbance by human activity with the area fenced off for afforestation in recent decades pinus massoniana and shrub species are the primary plants in this catchment farmland is the predominant land cover in the lhg catchment part of the land was planted with honeysuckle and the other part was alternately planted with rape and rice throughout the study period in addition nitrogen fertilizers e g urea and ammonium sulfate are applied to farmland in the lhg catchment the overlying soil of the two spring fields is yellow soil with depths of 110 cm in the bsw catchment and 70 cm in the lhg catchment in a previous study the soils were sampled at 20 cm 50 cm 80 cm and 110 cm depth in the bsw catchment and at 20 cm 50 cm and 70 cm depth in the lhg catchment the results showed that the soil particles were mainly composed of clay particles with a particle size less than 0 01 mm in both catchments while the organic carbon content of the soil was 4 7 8 g kg at bsw and 21 22 9 g kg at lhg zhao 2016 3 material and methods temperature ph and electronic conductivity at 25 c were measured using a wtw multi350i water quality multimeter in the field with resolutions of 0 1 c 0 1 and 1 μs cm respectively two bottles of 50 ml spring water were collected to measure ion concentrations one

with a titration pipette aquamerck darmstadt germany measurements were made in the field with a resolution of 0 1 mmol l because of the limited ca2 and mg2 inputs from precipitation jiang 2012 nearly all ca2 and mg2 in the spring water were generated by the dissolution of carbonate rock net co2 consumption was calculated by measuring the major elements in spring water as discussed in a previous study zhao et al 2019 the net co2 consumption equaled co2 consumption by h2co3 eq 1 minus the co2 emission by the action of h2so4 and or hno3 eqs 2 and 3 when the co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 escapes from the water eq 4 the net co2 consumption equaled the co2 consumption by h2co3 eq 1 if the co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 participated in additional karstification and entered the water

a polythene bottle approximately 50 ml was filled with spring water for the analysis of δ13cdic to avoid possible isotopic fractionation due to microbial activity saturated hgcl2 was added to the spring water samples and the bottles were sealed with air tight caps the samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 c prior to analysis by mass spectrometry gas bench linked with mat253 thermo fisher waltham ma usa at the institute of karst geology chinese academy of geological sciences the results were related to the vienna pee dee belemnite standard with a resolution of 0 15 the δ13cdic was used to distinguish the contribution of h2co3 to karstification as shown in eq 8 8 δ13cdic x δ13cdicc 1 x δ13cdics n where δ13cdic represents the δ13cdic of spring water δ13cdicc represents the δ13c of the

generated by the dissolution of carbonate by h2co3 to total dic the co2 consumption could be calculated as shown in eq 1 when the contribution of the dissolution of carbonate by h2co3 to the dic of spring water was quantified 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemical properties of spring water and the h2so4 and or hno3 participating in karstification the hydrochemical properties of the two springs are shown in table 1 the ph ranged from 7 21 to 8 13 for the two springs indicating that hco3 was the dominant component of dic wallin et al 2010 the coefficients of variation of temperature ph and specific conductivity were 0 15 0 03 and 0 07 at bsw while the corresponding values at lhg were 0 23 0 04 and 0 08 the greater variation in temperature at lhg may be due to rapid flow through conduit features and a lack of thermal equilibrium with the subsurface environment hess and white 1988 in both springs ca2 was the predominant cation the mg2 na and k concentrations were lower at bsw than at lhg there were significant differences in anion concentrations between the two springs the hco3 concentration was higher at bsw than at lhg and the so4 2 no3 and cl concentrations were lower at bsw than at lhg it was found that urea and ammonium sulfate are spread extensively in lhg catchment indicating that the higher so4 2 no3 and cl concentrations could derive from the application of chemical fertilizer to farmland however the no3 concentrations at lhg were slightly higher than those at bsw which may be due to the absorption of no3 by plants after nitrification perrin et al 2008 nitrification of ammonium simultaneously generated no3 and so4 2 and the so4 2 concentration at lhg was significantly higher than at bsw this may also indicate that the no3 was absorbed by plants since the so4 2 and no3 concentrations might change along the flow path due to the effects of plant activity denitrification sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation lee and krothe 2001 schilling and helmers 2008 the molar ratio between ca2 mg2 and hco3 ca2 mg2 mol hco3 mol was used to detect h2so4 and or hno3 participating in karstification li et al 2010 the ca2 mg2 mol hco3 mol ratio was 0 5 when h2co3 dissolved carbonate rock because half of the hco3 was derived from atmospheric and or soil co2 the other half was derived from carbonate rock however when all of the hco3 was derived from carbonate rock the ca2 mg2 mol hco3 mol ratio was 0 5 as when h2so4 and or hno3 participated in karstification the ca2 mg2 mol hco3 mol ratio ranged from 0 64 to 0 88 at lhg which was higher than the range of 0 53 to 0 65 at bsw fig 2 with no interference from gypsum in the study area zhao 2016 h2so4 and or hno3 participated in karstification at both spring catchments the contribution of h2so4 and or hno3 to karstification was greater at lhg than at bsw although there was no input of chemical fertilizer the average so4 2 concentration was 45 07 mg l and the ca2 mg2 mol hco3 mol ratio was 0 5 at bsw similar results have been reported in other studies and were attributed to atmospheric pollution perrin et al 2008 in southwest china sulfate acid rain is a serious problem tian et al 2013 therefore acid rain might have been a source of h2so4 at both catchments which led to a high so4 2 concentration and low no3 concentration at bsw given the participation of h2so4 and or hno3 the net co2 consumption was calculated by hco3 mol ca2 mg2 mol fig 3 the average net co2 consumption values were 2 43 mmol l at bsw and 1 07 mmol l at lhg 4 2 δ13cdic of spring water and co2 consumption by h2co3 4 2 1 δ13cdic of spring water at two catchments in covered karst areas the h2co3 involved in carbonate weathering mainly originates from the soil co2 because the co2 concentration is much higher in soil than in the atmosphere soil co2 and carbonate rock are two primary sources of dic in spring water the δ13cdic of spring water is mainly affected by the δ13c of soil co2 when h2co3 dissolves carbonate in an open karst system jiang 2013 at both catchments when the soil depth was 20 cm gas exchange between the top 20 cm of soil and the atmosphere as well as the high soil co2 concentration zhao et al 2019 resulted in the δ13c of soil co2 being influenced by plants and soil organic carbon the δ13c of plants except rice and soil organic carbon at the two catchments was measured in previous studies the δ13c values of p massoniana and shrubs at bsw were 28 95 and 31 73 respectively the δ13c values of honeysuckle and rape at lhg were 28 28 and 30 55 respectively zhao 2016 zhao et al 2019 the δ13c values of soil organic carbon were 23 47 at bsw and 22 82 at lhg zhao 2016 zhao et al 2019 the δ13c of rice was considered to be 29 42 based on measurements reported elsewhere conrad et al 2009 the average δ13c values in plants and soil were 26 91 at bsw and 26 12 at lhg compared to organic matter sources the δ13c of soil co2 was enriched by 4 4 due to fractionation of the carbon isotope composition caused by organic decomposition and plant respiration cerling et al 1991 fractionation of the carbon isotope composition was approximately 9 in soil co2 and hco3 deines 2004 thus the quantities of δ13cdic generated by h2co3 should have been 13 51 at bsw and 12 72 at lhg however the dic was fully derived from carbonate bedrock when carbonate rock weathering was induced by h2so4 and or hno3 the δ13cdic of spring water was dominated by the δ13c of carbonate rock which led to a heavier δ13cdic of spring water li et al 2008 bertrand et al 2007 because the δ13c of marine carbonate bedrocks was near 0 salomons and mook 1986 telmer and veizer 1999 theoretically compared with bsw the difference between the δ13cdic of spring water and the δ13cdic generated by h2co3 should have been larger at lhg because more carbonate rock weathering occurred due to h2so4 and or hno3 at lhg as indicated by the ca2 mg2 mol hco3 mol ratio however the results showed that the δ13cdic of spring water ranged from 13 48 to 11 47 at bsw with an average value of 12 48 1 03 heavier than the δ13cdic generated by h2co3 in contrast the δ13cdic of spring water ranged from 13 34 to 10 97 at lhg with an average value of 12 02 only 0 7 heavier than the δ13cdic generated by h2co3 fig 4 at lhg the δ13cdic of spring water was lighter than 12 7 δ13cdic generated by h2co3 as calculated above in august and september 2018 indicating that the actual δ13cdic generated by h2co3 might be lighter than 12 7 soil co2 was derived from both vegetation and soil the ratio of their contributions to soil co2 might vary under different conditions dilustro et al 2005 frouz and bujalský 2018 because the δ13c of vegetation was significantly lighter than the δ13c of soil organic matter if the contribution of vegetation to soil co2 was larger at lhg than at bsw it would compensate for the heavier δ13cdic induced by h2so4 and or hno3 dissolving carbonate it would also mask the larger difference between the δ13cdic of spring water and the δ13cdic generated by h2co3 at lhg compared to the difference at bsw however although the soil organic carbon content was larger at lhg than at bsw the soil co2 concentration was lower at lhg than at bsw this finding indicated that the contribution of vegetation to soil co2 was lower at lhg than at bsw because the honeysuckle rape and rice had smaller roots which resulted in less litter production compared to p massoniana and shrubs zhao 2016 therefore the δ13cdic values of these two spring waters might be affected by other factors 4 2 2 co2 consumption by h2co3 calculated from δ13cdic although there might be a few differences between actual and theoretical values the δ13cdic quantities generated by h2co3 were still considered to be 13 51 at bsw and 12 7 at lhg the dic generated by h2co3 was calculated from the δ13cdic of spring water eq 8 co2 consumption by h2co3 was quantified by eq 1 because hco3 was the dominant component of dic in both springs for lhg x in eq 8 was considered to be 100 in august and september 2018 because the amount of dic generated by h2co3 could not exceed the total dic of spring water the co2 consumption by h2co3 ranged from 2 42 to 2 9 mmol l with an average value of 2 65 mmol l at bsw at lhg the co2 consumption by h2co3 ranged from 1 85 to 2 85 mmol l with an average value of 2 27 mmol l fig 5 4 2 3 co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 escaping from water at two catchments based on the difference between co2 consumption and net co2 consumption the co2 consumption by h2co3 was greater than the net co2 consumption in both springs indicating that some co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 might escape from the water in addition the co2 consumption by h2co3 was higher than net co2 consumption by 0 03 0 47 mmol l average 0 23 mmol l at bsw and 0 78 1 49 mmol l average 1 2 mmol l at lhg fig 6 the larger difference between co2 consumption by h2co3 and net co2 consumption at lhg indicated greater emission of co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 the co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 escaped from the water as co2 rather than entering the water in the form of hco3 thus the δ13cdic would not change despite carbonate rock weathering induced by h2so4 and or hno3 this might explain why there was no observation of a larger difference between δ13cdic generated by h2co3 and δ13cdic of spring water at lhg than at bsw the co2 consumption by h2co3 is presumably equal to the net co2 consumption and any difference between the two values may result from the lighter actual δ13cdic generated by h2co3 compared to the theoretical value in this study according to eq 8 the δ13cdic generated by h2co3 should therefore range from 16 48 to 13 69 with an average value of 14 86 at bsw whereas it should range from 46 5 to 18 37 with an average value of 29 65 at lhg further derivation indicated that the δ13c of organic carbon should range from 29 88 to 27 09 with an average value of 28 26 at bsw while it should range from 59 9 to 31 77 with average value of 43 05 at lhg this possibility could not be ruled out at bsw however it could be ruled out at lhg because there was no such light δ13c of organic carbon however the difference between co2 consumption calculated by hco3 mol ca2 mg2 mol net co2 consumption and co2 consumption calculated by δ13cdic co2 consumption by h2co3 was not observed in a previous study regardless of the participation of h2so4 and or hno3 in karstification jiang 2013 this was presumably because all co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 participated in karstification in that study thus no co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 escaped from the water and the net co2 consumption was equal to the co2 consumption by h2co3 4 3 different fates of co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 and its effects on karst related carbon fluxes 4 3 1 effects of co2 consumption by h2co3 and co2 emission by h2so4 and or hno3 on net co2 consumption because the co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 had two different fates karstification was considered to involve the following three processes in this study 1 h2co3 formed by soil co2 dissolving carbonate rock 2 h2so4 and or hno3 dissolving carbonate rock with the co2 generated in this process participating in additional karstification and entering the groundwater in the form of hco3 and 3 h2so4 and or hno3 dissolving carbonate rock with the co2 generated in this process escaping from the water in addition to co2 consumption by h2co3 it was necessary to determine the quantity of co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 that entered the water in the form of hco3 as well as the quantity of co2 that escaped from the water the quantity of co2 that entered the groundwater in the form of hco3 could be determined by calculation of the dic induced by h2so4 and or hno3 from δ13cdic eq 8 the quantity of co2 that escaped from the water could be determined by subtracting the net co2 consumption from co2 consumption by h2co3 eq 4 the total amount of h2so4 and or hno3 that participated in karstification could be quantified by eqs 2 6 3 5 and 6 when these two values were obtained therefore in addition to co2 consumption by h2co3 the co2 emission by h2so4 and or hno3 and co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 entering the water in the form of hco3 at the two catchments were further quantified according to the above methods fig 7 the co2 consumption by h2co3 was lower at lhg 2 27 mmol l than at bsw 2 65 mmol l while the average co2 emission at lhg 1 2 mmol l was higher than at bsw 0 23 mmol l these two factors led to a lower net co2 consumption at lhg however the average co2 consumption by h2co3was 0 38 mmol l lower at lhg than at bsw while the average co2 emission was 0 97 mmol l higher at lhg than at bsw these findings indicated that the effect of co2 emission on net co2 consumption was greater than the effect of co2 consumption 4 3 2 the proportion of the two fates of co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 at bsw the total amount of h2so4 and or hno3 participating in karstification ranged from 0 26 to 1 3 mmol l with an average of 0 67 mmol l this amount was lower than the amount at lhg where the corresponding values ranged from to 0 78 to 2 07 mmol l with an average of 1 49 mmol l fig 7 an average of 35 26 ranging from 4 58 to 97 72 of the co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 escaped from the water at bsw this proportion ranged from 62 59 to 100 with an average of 82 82 at lhg fig 7 conversely an average of 64 74 at bsw and 17 18 at lhg of the co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 entered the water in the form of hco3 these findings indicated that the difference in co2 emissions from the two springs was related to the different h2so4 and or hno3 inputs as well as the different ratios of co2 fates under different conditions the fate of co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 might be affected by the water rock reaction time because of the thinner depth of overlying soil as well as tillage reducing soil compactness abdalla et al 2016 the infiltration rate might have been accelerated at lhg thus contributing to reduced water rock reaction time this notion was supported by the observation that the coefficient of variation was larger for lhg than for bsw which indicated that lhg was more sensitive to the external environment than bsw because there was less time for the co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 to participate in additional karstification at lhg a greater proportion of this co2 at lhg could escape from the water as a consequence of the difference in pco2 between air and water in addition the mg ca ratio was higher at lhg than at bsw indicating that the proportion of dolomite was greater at lhg dolomite has a lower dissolution rate than limestone liu et al 2005 therefore the effect of the water rock reaction time on the fate of co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 might be amplified by the bedrock properties in a previous study of hougou spring another karst spring located close to lhg but with larger h2so4 and or hno3 inputs the co2 emissions generated by h2so4 and or hno3 and the co2 consumption by h2co3 were not quantified however a short water rock reaction time was proposed leading to greater escape of co2 from the water because the net co2 consumption was lower in the rainy season than in the dry season the net co2 consumption was even less than 0 in the rainy season zhao et al 2019 in this study the fates of co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 also showed seasonal variation at lhg an average of 86 04 of this co2 escaped from the water in the rainy season april to october compared with 78 31 in the dry season november to march this may indicate that reduced water rock reaction time limited the co2 taking part in karstifiction however the proportion of the co2 escaping from the water in the rainy season average 32 58 was lower than that in the dry season average 39 02 at bsw this may be due to the fact that the thick soil had a strong ability to store and regulate infiltration water thereby damping the seasonal change thus in addition to comparing seasonal changes more evidence for the effect of water rock reaction time on the fates of co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 is needed in future studies high resolution continuous monitoring of water isotope composition δ18o or δd special conductivity and temperature during precipitation may be an appropriate method because this could reflect the change in water rock reaction in time 4 3 3 change in the fates of co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 affects the karst related carbon cycle in estimating the karst related carbon cycle precipitation and land use transition were considered two important factors for the karst related carbon sink although increased runoff and deforestation would lead to a decreased hco3 concentration in groundwater by reducing the water rock reaction time and soil pco2 greater runoff would offset or even exceed the negative effects that enhance the net karst related carbon sink zeng et al 2016 2019 however these views focus on the carbonate dissolution by h2co3 atmosphere and or soil co2 consumption with h2so4 and or hno3 taking part in karstification the effect of runoff on the karst related carbon cycle had not been considered as mentioned above there are two fates of co2 generated by dissolution of carbonate by h2so4 and or hno3 which might be controlled by many factors such as water rock reaction time this indicates that reduced water rock reaction time could induce more escape of co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 from water instead of entrance to water in the form hco3 thus enhancing carbon source fluxes and reducing the net karst related carbon sink the karstification even changed from carbon sink to carbon source when the co2 emission caused by h2so4 and or hno3 carbonate dissolution exceeded the co2 consumption caused by h2co3 carbonate dissolution 5 conclusion in this study major element and stable carbon isotope analyses were used simultaneously to assess the karst related carbon cycle inputs of h2so4 and or hno3 caused the ca2 mg2 mol hco3 mol ratio at lhg to be significantly higher than that at bsw however the difference of the δ13cdic of karst spring waters between bsw and lhg with similar δ13c values of overlying vegetation and soil was not as significant as for the ca2 mg2 mol hco3 mol ratio in addition the average co2 consumption by h2co3 soil co2 consumption calculated by δ13cdic was 2 65 mmol l at bsw and 2 27 mmol l at lhg while the average net co2 consumption calculated from major elements was 2 43 mmol l at bsw and 1 07 mmol l at lhg respectively the result that the co2 consumption by h2co3 was higher than the net co2 consumption indicated that co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 escaped from water in the form of co2g at bsw an average of 35 26 of the co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 escaped from water in the form of co2g whereas 64 74 of it continued to take part in karstification and entered water in the form of hco3 at lhg an average of 82 82 of the co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 escaped from water in the form of co2g and 17 18 of it continued to take part in karstification and entered water in the form of hco3 this result indicated that there were two fates of co2 generated by dissolution of carbonate by h2so4 and or hno3 and that the ratio of these two fates could change under different conditions resulting in different effects on the carbon cycle therefore it is necessary to recognize the effects of h2so4 and or hno3 on the karst related carbon cycle especially at short timescales credit authorship contribution statement ruiyi zhao conceptualization investigation writing original draft ziqi liu investigation funding acquisition lili dong

4649,to distinguish the two fates of co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 during the dissolution of carbonate rock and to reveal the effect of this co2 on the karst related carbon cycle at short timescales baishuwan spring bsw overlying secondary forest and lanhuagou spring lhg overlying farmland were monitored monthly by measurement of major elements and the stable carbon isotope of dissolved inorganic carbon δ13cdic in spring water the average net co2 consumption co2 consumption by h2co3 and co2 emission by h2so4 and or hno3 were 2 43 2 65 and 0 23 mmol l at bsw whereas they were 1 07 2 27 and 1 2 mmol l at lhg respectively the low co2 consumption by h2co3 and the high co2 emission by h2so4 and or hno3 collectively led to a lower net co2 consumption at lhg than at bsw the effect of co2 emissions was greater than the effect of co2 consumption the fates of the co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 were quantified on average 35 26 of this co2 escaped from the water at bsw whereas 82 82 escaped from the water at lhg presumably due to different water rock reaction times changes in the fate of co2 may influence emissions and the karst related carbon cycle keywords karst related carbon cycle molar ratio stable carbon isotope two fates of co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 1 introduction after being released by human activities h2so4 and hno3 are involved in karstification jiang et al 2009 and interfere in the karst related carbon cycle li et al 2008 barnes and raymond 2009 sun et al 2017 when h2so4 and or hno3 dissolve carbonate the first product to be generated is co2 which may directly escape from the water or may further dissolve carbonate and enter water bodies in the form of hco3 perrin et al 2008 in both processes the dissolution of carbonate by h2so4 and or hno3 is regarded as a carbon source over geological timescales torres et al 2014 martin 2017 jiang et al 2018 because hco3 is eventually converted into co2 and then released into the atmosphere when carbonate minerals are deposited in oceans calmels et al 2007 torres et al 2017 however over short timescales the two fates of co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 may have different effects on the karst related carbon cycle one of the important reasons why carbonate dissolution by h2co3 has been considered a carbon sink effect is that atmospheric or soil co2 enters groundwater in the form of hco3 in a short time and this portion of hco3 may be absorbed by aquatic plants in the process of migration with the water pu et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 similarly if the co2 generated by carbonate dissolution by h2so4 and or hno3 participates in additional karstification and subsequently enters groundwater in the form of hco3 the carbon is considered to be sequestered west and mcbride 2005 because no co2 is released into the atmosphere this is simply regarded as the transfer of carbon between the lithosphere and hydrosphere thus the karst related carbon sink flux equals the atmosphere and or soil co2 consumption caused by karstification regardless of carbonate weathering induced by h2so4 and or hno3 in contrast if this co2 does not participate in karstification it may directly return to the soil or atmosphere in the form of co2g li et al 2002 bertrand et al 2007 or may enter groundwater in the form of co2aq where it may escape from the water with a high partial pressure pco2 when groundwater is exposed west and mcbride 2005 in this scenario the carbonate weathering induced by h2so4 and or hno3 will become a co2 source the amount of this co2 should be subtracted from the atmosphere and or soil co2 consumption to estimate karst related carbon sink fluxes whether co2 can participate in karstification is considered to be controlled by a dilution effect soil properties and other factors liu et al 2007 yang et al 2012 zeng et al 2016 this means that the fates of the co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 may also change under different conditions thereby further affecting the karst related carbon sink fluxes zhao et al 2019 therefore in the case of interference by h2so4 and or hno3 it is necessary to quantify the two fates of the co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 during the dissolution of carbonate to estimate karst related carbon fluxes karst related carbon sink fluxes are generally estimated by measurement of the stable carbon isotope of dic δ13cdic or major elements of spring water because there are differences between the δ13cdic generated by h2co3 and the δ13cdic generated by h2so4 and or hno3 the contribution of h2co3 to karstification and co2 consumption can be calculated brunet et al 2011 the co2 consumption calculated by δ13cdic is the amount of co2 consumed by h2co3 rather than the net co2 consumption thus co2 consumption by h2co3 would not change regardless of whether the co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 escaped from the water and reduced net co2 consumption this situation would lead to an overestimation of karst related carbon sink fluxes conversely measurement using the major elements of spring water can enable calculation of the net co2 consumption zhao et al 2019 but it cannot distinguish the co2 consumption by h2co3 and the co2 emission by h2so4 and or hno3 to evaluate the karst related carbon cycle and its influencing factors when h2so4 and or hno3 participate in karstification this study quantified net co2 consumption co2 consumption by h2co3 co2 emission by h2so4 and or hno3 and the fates of the co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 at two karst spring catchments with different land use types measurements of the major elements and δ13cdic of spring water were combined in this study 2 study area baishuwan spring bsw and lanhuagou spring lhg were selected as study sites and were monitored monthly from november 2017 to october 2018 the two springs are located close to each other in the nanchuan district of chongqing city southwest china fig 1 where the annual average precipitation is approximately 1103 1 mm and mean air temperature is approximately 16 68 c zhao et al 2019 the mineral composition is predominantly limestone of the lower triassic jialingjiang formation in the bsw catchment while the lhg catchment consists of limestone and dolomitic limestone of the lower triassic jialingjiang formation there are obvious differences in the land use types between the two catchments in the bsw catchment the land cover is woodland that has experienced minimal disturbance by human activity with the area fenced off for afforestation in recent decades pinus massoniana and shrub species are the primary plants in this catchment farmland is the predominant land cover in the lhg catchment part of the land was planted with honeysuckle and the other part was alternately planted with rape and rice throughout the study period in addition nitrogen fertilizers e g urea and ammonium sulfate are applied to farmland in the lhg catchment the overlying soil of the two spring fields is yellow soil with depths of 110 cm in the bsw catchment and 70 cm in the lhg catchment in a previous study the soils were sampled at 20 cm 50 cm 80 cm and 110 cm depth in the bsw catchment and at 20 cm 50 cm and 70 cm depth in the lhg catchment the results showed that the soil particles were mainly composed of clay particles with a particle size less than 0 01 mm in both catchments while the organic carbon content of the soil was 4 7 8 g kg at bsw and 21 22 9 g kg at lhg zhao 2016 3 material and methods temperature ph and electronic conductivity at 25 c were measured using a wtw multi350i water quality multimeter in the field with resolutions of 0 1 c 0 1 and 1 μs cm respectively two bottles of 50 ml spring water were collected to measure ion concentrations one received an addition of ultrapurified hno3 to acidify the sample to ph 2 and was stored at 4 c until the cation concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icap 7200 thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa with a resolution of 0 01 mg l this measurement was conducted at chongqing branch yangtze river scientific research institute the other bottle of spring water was used for the analysis of anion concentrations of so4 2 no3 and cl by means of an ion chromatography system dionex ics 900 dionex sunnyvale ca usa with a resolution of 0 01

with a titration pipette aquamerck darmstadt germany measurements were made in the field with a resolution of 0 1 mmol l because of the limited ca2 and mg2 inputs from precipitation jiang 2012 nearly all ca2 and mg2 in the spring water were generated by the dissolution of carbonate rock net co2 consumption was calculated by measuring the major elements in spring water as discussed in a previous study zhao et al 2019 the net co2 consumption equaled co2 consumption by h2co3 eq 1 minus the co2 emission by the action of h2so4 and or hno3 eqs 2 and 3 when the co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 escapes from the water eq 4 the net co2 consumption equaled the co2 consumption by h2co3 eq 1 if the co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 participated in additional karstification and entered the water

a polythene bottle approximately 50 ml was filled with spring water for the analysis of δ13cdic to avoid possible isotopic fractionation due to microbial activity saturated hgcl2 was added to the spring water samples and the bottles were sealed with air tight caps the samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 c prior to analysis by mass spectrometry gas bench linked with mat253 thermo fisher waltham ma usa at the institute of karst geology chinese academy of geological sciences the results were related to the vienna pee dee belemnite standard with a resolution of 0 15 the δ13cdic was used to distinguish the contribution of h2co3 to karstification as shown in eq 8 8 δ13cdic x δ13cdicc 1 x δ13cdics n where δ13cdic represents the δ13cdic of spring water δ13cdicc represents the δ13c of the dic generated by the dissolution of carbonate by h2co3 δ13cdics n represents the δ13c of dic generated by h2so4 and or the dissolution of carbonate by hno3 and x represents the contribution of dic generated by the dissolution of carbonate by h2co3 to total dic the co2 consumption could be calculated as shown in eq 1 when the contribution of the dissolution of carbonate by h2co3 to the dic of spring water was quantified 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemical properties of spring water and the h2so4 and or hno3 participating in karstification the hydrochemical properties of the two springs are shown in table 1 the ph ranged from 7 21 to 8 13 for the two springs indicating that hco3 was the dominant component of dic wallin et al 2010 the coefficients of variation of temperature ph and specific conductivity were 0 15 0 03 and 0 07 at bsw while the corresponding values at lhg were 0 23 0 04 and 0 08 the greater variation in temperature at lhg may be due to rapid flow through conduit features and a lack of thermal equilibrium with the subsurface environment hess and white 1988 in both springs ca2 was the predominant cation the mg2 na and k concentrations were lower at bsw than at lhg there were significant differences in anion concentrations between the two springs the hco3 concentration was higher at bsw than at lhg and the so4 2 no3 and cl concentrations were lower at bsw than at lhg it was found that urea and ammonium sulfate are spread extensively in lhg catchment indicating that the higher so4 2 no3 and cl concentrations could derive from the application of chemical fertilizer to farmland however the no3 concentrations at lhg were slightly higher than those at bsw which may be due to the absorption of no3 by plants after nitrification perrin et al 2008 nitrification of ammonium simultaneously generated no3 and so4 2 and the so4 2 concentration at lhg was significantly higher than at bsw this may also indicate that the no3 was absorbed by plants since the so4 2 and no3 concentrations might change along the flow path due to the effects of plant activity denitrification sulfate reduction and sulfide oxidation lee and krothe 2001 schilling and helmers 2008 the molar ratio between ca2 mg2 and hco3 ca2 mg2 mol hco3 mol was used to detect h2so4 and or hno3 participating in karstification li et al 2010 the ca2 mg2 mol hco3 mol ratio was 0 5 when h2co3 dissolved carbonate rock because half of the hco3 was derived from atmospheric and or soil co2 the other half was derived from carbonate rock however when all of the hco3 was derived from carbonate rock the ca2 mg2 mol hco3 mol ratio was 0 5 as when h2so4 and or hno3 participated in karstification the ca2 mg2 mol hco3 mol ratio ranged from 0 64 to 0 88 at lhg which was higher than the range of 0 53 to 0 65 at bsw fig 2 with no interference from gypsum in the study area zhao 2016 h2so4 and or hno3 participated in karstification at both spring catchments the contribution of h2so4 and or hno3 to karstification was greater at lhg than at bsw although there was no input of chemical fertilizer the average so4 2 concentration was 45 07 mg l and the ca2 mg2 mol hco3 mol ratio was 0 5 at bsw similar results have been reported in other studies and were attributed to atmospheric pollution perrin et al 2008 in southwest china sulfate acid rain is a serious problem tian et al 2013 therefore acid rain might have been a source of h2so4 at both catchments which led to a high so4 2 concentration and low no3 concentration at bsw given the participation of h2so4 and or hno3 the net co2 consumption was calculated by hco3 mol ca2 mg2 mol fig 3 the average net co2 consumption values were 2 43 mmol l at bsw and 1 07 mmol l at lhg 4 2 δ13cdic of spring water and co2 consumption by h2co3 4 2 1 δ13cdic of spring water at two catchments in covered karst areas the h2co3 involved in carbonate weathering mainly originates from the soil co2 because the co2 concentration is much higher in soil than in the atmosphere soil co2 and carbonate rock are two primary sources of dic in spring water the δ13cdic of spring water is mainly affected by the δ13c of soil co2 when h2co3 dissolves carbonate in an open karst system jiang 2013 at both catchments when the soil depth was 20 cm gas exchange between the top 20 cm of soil and the atmosphere as well as the high soil co2 concentration zhao et al 2019 resulted in the δ13c of soil co2 being influenced by plants and soil organic carbon the δ13c of plants except rice and soil organic carbon at the two catchments was measured in previous studies the δ13c values of p massoniana and shrubs at bsw were 28 95 and 31 73 respectively the δ13c values of honeysuckle and rape at lhg were 28 28 and 30 55 respectively zhao 2016 zhao et al 2019 the δ13c values of soil organic carbon were 23 47 at bsw and 22 82 at lhg zhao 2016 zhao et al 2019 the δ13c of rice was considered to be 29 42 based on measurements reported elsewhere conrad et al 2009 the average δ13c values in plants and soil were 26 91 at bsw and 26 12 at lhg compared to organic matter sources the δ13c of soil co2 was enriched by 4 4 due to fractionation of the carbon isotope composition caused by organic decomposition and plant respiration cerling et al 1991 fractionation of the carbon isotope composition was approximately 9 in soil co2 and hco3 deines 2004 thus the quantities of δ13cdic generated by h2co3 should have been 13 51 at bsw and 12 72 at lhg however the dic was fully derived from carbonate bedrock when carbonate rock weathering was induced by h2so4 and or hno3 the δ13cdic of spring water was dominated by the δ13c of carbonate rock which led to a heavier δ13cdic of spring water li et al 2008 bertrand et al 2007 because the δ13c of marine carbonate bedrocks was near 0 salomons and mook 1986 telmer and veizer 1999 theoretically compared with bsw the difference between the δ13cdic of spring water and the δ13cdic generated by h2co3 should have been larger at lhg because more carbonate rock weathering occurred due to h2so4 and or hno3 at lhg as indicated by the ca2 mg2 mol hco3 mol ratio however the results showed that the δ13cdic of spring water ranged from 13 48 to 11 47 at bsw with an average value of 12 48 1 03 heavier than the δ13cdic generated by h2co3 in contrast the δ13cdic of spring water ranged from 13 34 to 10 97 at lhg with an average value of 12 02 only 0 7 heavier than the δ13cdic generated by h2co3 fig 4 at lhg the δ13cdic of spring water was lighter than 12 7 δ13cdic generated by h2co3 as calculated above in august and september 2018 indicating that the actual δ13cdic generated by h2co3 might be lighter than 12 7 soil co2 was derived from both vegetation and soil the ratio of their contributions to soil co2 might vary under different conditions dilustro et al 2005 frouz and bujalský 2018 because the δ13c of vegetation was significantly lighter than the δ13c of soil organic matter if the contribution of vegetation to soil co2 was larger at lhg than at bsw it would compensate for the heavier δ13cdic induced by h2so4 and or hno3 dissolving carbonate it would also mask the larger difference between the δ13cdic of spring water and the δ13cdic generated by h2co3 at lhg compared to the difference at bsw however although the soil organic carbon content was larger at lhg than at bsw the soil co2 concentration was lower at lhg than at bsw this finding indicated that the contribution of vegetation to soil co2 was lower at lhg than at bsw because the honeysuckle rape and rice had smaller roots which resulted in less litter production compared to p massoniana and shrubs zhao 2016 therefore the δ13cdic values of these two spring waters might be affected by other factors 4 2 2 co2 consumption by h2co3 calculated from δ13cdic although there might be a few differences between actual and theoretical values the δ13cdic quantities generated by h2co3 were still considered to be 13 51 at bsw and 12 7 at lhg the dic generated by h2co3 was calculated from the δ13cdic of spring water eq 8 co2 consumption by h2co3 was quantified by eq 1 because hco3 was the dominant component of dic in both springs for lhg x in eq 8 was considered to be 100 in august and september 2018 because the amount of dic generated by h2co3 could not exceed the total dic of spring water the co2 consumption by h2co3 ranged from 2 42 to 2 9 mmol l with an average value of 2 65 mmol l at bsw at lhg the co2 consumption by h2co3 ranged from 1 85 to 2 85 mmol l with an average value of 2 27 mmol l fig 5 4 2 3 co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 escaping from water at two catchments based on the difference between co2 consumption and net co2 consumption the co2 consumption by h2co3 was greater than the net co2 consumption in both springs indicating that some co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 might escape from the water in addition the co2 consumption by h2co3 was higher than net co2 consumption by 0 03 0 47 mmol l average 0 23 mmol l at bsw and 0 78 1 49 mmol l average 1 2 mmol l at lhg fig 6 the larger difference between co2 consumption by h2co3 and net co2 consumption at lhg indicated greater emission of co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 the co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 escaped from the water as co2 rather than entering the water in the form of hco3 thus the δ13cdic would not change despite carbonate rock weathering induced by h2so4 and or hno3 this might explain why there was no observation of a larger difference between δ13cdic generated by h2co3 and δ13cdic of spring water at lhg than at bsw the co2 consumption by h2co3 is presumably equal to the net co2 consumption and any difference between the two values may result from the lighter actual δ13cdic generated by h2co3 compared to the theoretical value in this study according to eq 8 the δ13cdic generated by h2co3 should therefore range from 16 48 to 13 69 with an average value of 14 86 at bsw whereas it should range from 46 5 to 18 37 with an average value of 29 65 at lhg further derivation indicated that the δ13c of organic carbon should range from 29 88 to 27 09 with an average value of 28 26 at bsw while it should range from 59 9 to 31 77 with average value of 43 05 at lhg this possibility could not be ruled out at bsw however it could be ruled out at lhg because there was no such light δ13c of organic carbon however the difference between co2 consumption calculated by hco3 mol ca2 mg2 mol net co2 consumption and co2 consumption calculated by δ13cdic co2 consumption by h2co3 was not observed in a previous study regardless of the participation of h2so4 and or hno3 in karstification jiang 2013 this was presumably because all co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 participated in karstification in that study thus no co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 escaped from the water and the net co2 consumption was equal to the co2 consumption by h2co3 4 3 different fates of co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 and its effects on karst related carbon fluxes 4 3 1 effects of co2 consumption by h2co3 and co2 emission by h2so4 and or hno3 on net co2 consumption because the co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 had two different fates karstification was considered to involve the following three processes in this study 1 h2co3 formed by soil co2 dissolving carbonate rock 2 h2so4 and or hno3 dissolving carbonate rock with the co2 generated in this process participating in additional karstification and entering the groundwater in the form of hco3 and 3 h2so4 and or hno3 dissolving carbonate rock with the co2 generated in this process escaping from the water in addition to co2 consumption by h2co3 it was necessary to determine the quantity of co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 that entered the water in the form of hco3 as well as the quantity of co2 that escaped from the water the quantity of co2 that entered the groundwater in the form of hco3 could be determined by calculation of the dic induced by h2so4 and or hno3 from δ13cdic eq 8 the quantity of co2 that escaped from the water could be determined by subtracting the net co2 consumption from co2 consumption by h2co3 eq 4 the total amount of h2so4 and or hno3 that participated in karstification could be quantified by eqs 2 6 3 5 and 6 when these two values were obtained therefore in addition to co2 consumption by h2co3 the co2 emission by h2so4 and or hno3 and co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 entering the water in the form of hco3 at the two catchments were further quantified according to the above methods fig 7 the co2 consumption by h2co3 was lower at lhg 2 27 mmol l than at bsw 2 65 mmol l while the average co2 emission at lhg 1 2 mmol l was higher than at bsw 0 23 mmol l these two factors led to a lower net co2 consumption at lhg however the average co2 consumption by h2co3was 0 38 mmol l lower at lhg than at bsw while the average co2 emission was 0 97 mmol l higher at lhg than at bsw these findings indicated that the effect of co2 emission on net co2 consumption was greater than the effect of co2 consumption 4 3 2 the proportion of the two fates of co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 at bsw the total amount of h2so4 and or hno3 participating in karstification ranged from 0 26 to 1 3 mmol l with an average of 0 67 mmol l this amount was lower than the amount at lhg where the corresponding values ranged from to 0 78 to 2 07 mmol l with an average of 1 49 mmol l fig 7 an average of 35 26 ranging from 4 58 to 97 72 of the co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 escaped from the water at bsw this proportion ranged from 62 59 to 100 with an average of 82 82 at lhg fig 7 conversely an average of 64 74 at bsw and 17 18 at lhg of the co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 entered the water in the form of hco3 these findings indicated that the difference in co2 emissions from the two springs was related to the different h2so4 and or hno3 inputs as well as the different ratios of co2 fates under different conditions the fate of co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 might be affected by the water rock reaction time because of the thinner depth of overlying soil as well as tillage reducing soil compactness abdalla et al 2016 the infiltration rate might have been accelerated at lhg thus contributing to reduced water rock reaction time this notion was supported by the observation that the coefficient of variation was larger for lhg than for bsw which indicated that lhg was more sensitive to the external environment than bsw because there was less time for the co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 to participate in additional karstification at lhg a greater proportion of this co2 at lhg could escape from the water as a consequence of the difference in pco2 between air and water in addition the mg ca ratio was higher at lhg than at bsw indicating that the proportion of dolomite was greater at lhg dolomite has a lower dissolution rate than limestone liu et al 2005 therefore the effect of the water rock reaction time on the fate of co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 might be amplified by the bedrock properties in a previous study of hougou spring another karst spring located close to lhg but with larger h2so4 and or hno3 inputs the co2 emissions generated by h2so4 and or hno3 and the co2 consumption by h2co3 were not quantified however a short water rock reaction time was proposed leading to greater escape of co2 from the water because the net co2 consumption was lower in the rainy season than in the dry season the net co2 consumption was even less than 0 in the rainy season zhao et al 2019 in this study the fates of co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 also showed seasonal variation at lhg an average of 86 04 of this co2 escaped from the water in the rainy season april to october compared with 78 31 in the dry season november to march this may indicate that reduced water rock reaction time limited the co2 taking part in karstifiction however the proportion of the co2 escaping from the water in the rainy season average 32 58 was lower than that in the dry season average 39 02 at bsw this may be due to the fact that the thick soil had a strong ability to store and regulate infiltration water thereby damping the seasonal change thus in addition to comparing seasonal changes more evidence for the effect of water rock reaction time on the fates of co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 is needed in future studies high resolution continuous monitoring of water isotope composition δ18o or δd special conductivity and temperature during precipitation may be an appropriate method because this could reflect the change in water rock reaction in time 4 3 3 change in the fates of co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 affects the karst related carbon cycle in estimating the karst related carbon cycle precipitation and land use transition were considered two important factors for the karst related carbon sink although increased runoff and deforestation would lead to a decreased hco3 concentration in groundwater by reducing the water rock reaction time and soil pco2 greater runoff would offset or even exceed the negative effects that enhance the net karst related carbon sink zeng et al 2016 2019 however these views focus on the carbonate dissolution by h2co3 atmosphere and or soil co2 consumption with h2so4 and or hno3 taking part in karstification the effect of runoff on the karst related carbon cycle had not been considered as mentioned above there are two fates of co2 generated by dissolution of carbonate by h2so4 and or hno3 which might be controlled by many factors such as water rock reaction time this indicates that reduced water rock reaction time could induce more escape of co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 from water instead of entrance to water in the form hco3 thus enhancing carbon source fluxes and reducing the net karst related carbon sink the karstification even changed from carbon sink to carbon source when the co2 emission caused by h2so4 and or hno3 carbonate dissolution exceeded the co2 consumption caused by h2co3 carbonate dissolution 5 conclusion in this study major element and stable carbon isotope analyses were used simultaneously to assess the karst related carbon cycle inputs of h2so4 and or hno3 caused the ca2 mg2 mol hco3 mol ratio at lhg to be significantly higher than that at bsw however the difference of the δ13cdic of karst spring waters between bsw and lhg with similar δ13c values of overlying vegetation and soil was not as significant as for the ca2 mg2 mol hco3 mol ratio in addition the average co2 consumption by h2co3 soil co2 consumption calculated by δ13cdic was 2 65 mmol l at bsw and 2 27 mmol l at lhg while the average net co2 consumption calculated from major elements was 2 43 mmol l at bsw and 1 07 mmol l at lhg respectively the result that the co2 consumption by h2co3 was higher than the net co2 consumption indicated that co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 escaped from water in the form of co2g at bsw an average of 35 26 of the co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 escaped from water in the form of co2g whereas 64 74 of it continued to take part in karstification and entered water in the form of hco3 at lhg an average of 82 82 of the co2 generated by h2so4 and or hno3 escaped from water in the form of co2g and 17 18 of it continued to take part in karstification and entered water in the form of hco3 this result indicated that there were two fates of co2 generated by dissolution of carbonate by h2so4 and or hno3 and that the ratio of these two fates could change under different conditions resulting in different effects on the carbon cycle therefore it is necessary to recognize the effects of h2so4 and or hno3 on the karst related carbon cycle especially at short timescales credit authorship contribution statement ruiyi zhao conceptualization investigation writing original draft ziqi liu investigation funding acquisition lili dong
