5590,freezing of unsaturated soils jointly involves heat transfer water vapor migration water ice and water vapor phase changes and deformation to understand this freezing we conducted a series of one dimensional freezing tests to study the influences of the initial water content and cooling temperature on the water vapor migration and deformation of unsaturated soils results show that the initial water content determines the water and vapor migration intensity and deformation of unsaturated soils vapor migrates prominently and frost heave develops slowly when the initial water content is lower than a critical value above this value the liquid water migration dominates and frost heave develops rapidly it is also found that the cooling temperature dominates water and vapor fluxes in such a manner that a higher cooling temperature leads to faster migrations of water and vapor in unsaturated soil we further analyzed the coupled heat water vapor mechanics process of unsaturated soils and proposed a coupled heat water vapor mechanics model the simulated temperatures volumetric water content and displacement agree well with those measured data validating that the model can describe effectively the coupled heat water vapor mechanics process in freezing unsaturated soils keywords unsaturated soils water migration vapor migration frost heave heat water vapor mechanics process 1 introduction under temperature gradients within a pavement structure water vapor flow is an important mechanism of moisture ingress in aggregate base layers during winter in cold regions guthrie et al 2006 as an impervious cover the pavement prevents evaporation leading to moisture accumulation under it li et al 2014a the accumulated moisture under a freezing temperature freezes into ice increasing the soil volume and resulting in frost heave vapor migration is a common cause of engineering failure in structures like the concrete panel of hydraulic engineering airfield runway pavements li et al 2014a and high speed railway pavement niu et al 2016 it is imperative to understand the water and vapor migration in unsaturated soils in freezing process the importance of vapor migration in unsaturated soils has been well documented experimentally vapor migration takes place in freezing unsaturated soils under the driving force of matric suction or temperature gradient nakano et al 1984 a series of tests on gravel showed that the moisture content will increase due to vapor diffusion eigenbrod and kennepohl 1996 guthrie et al 2006 had conducted an unidirectional freezing test on a non frost susceptible granular material typical of base layers within the jurisdiction of the swedish national road administration for 41 days and found that the average vapor flow rate was 12 8 g week and the majority of the incoming water accumulated just above the freezing front zhang et al 2016b conducted a series of one side freezing tests on calcareous sand and found that the water content at the top of sample increases from 5 and 7 to 35 and 47 respectively in addition the model of zhang et al 2016c showed that vapor flow contributes to the ice formation greatly and can be more than 10 of total moisture flow wu et al 2016 studied the evaporation from seasonally frozen soils under various water solute and groundwater conditions tests of gao et al 2018 and bai et al 2018a indicated that vapor migration creates a thin ice layer in the covered cold top of coarse grained sample some models have been proposed about vapor migration in unsaturated soils penman 1940 first developed a theory of vapor flow in soils based on fick s law later philip and de vries 1957 extended penman s theory to describe coupled movements of liquid water and vaporous water under non isothermal conditions de vries 1958 generalized the model by combining influence of gravity and gradients of temperature and moisture content after that some researchers further extended and completed the model milly 1984 cass et al 1984 nassar and horton 1992 nassar et al 1992 noborio et al 1996a b nassar et al 1999 in addition saito et al 2006 proposed a new heat water vapor coupling model to study the process of water and vapor migration in vadose zone sakai et al 2009 used the heat water vapor coupling model to study the water and vapor migration in sand soil under the conditions of condensation and evaporation the above models are only applicable to the process of water and vapor migration in unfrozen soils hansson et al 2004 extended the model to freezing soil presented a new method to account for phase changes for coupled heat transport and variably saturated water flow the model was further developed to illustrate the process of water and vapor migration and mechanisms of vapor condensation and of ice formation in unsaturated soils zhang et al 2016b c luo et al 2016 song et al 2017 zhang et al 2016a extended the model to simulate the water and vapor behavior of the field soil in the qinghai tibet plateau he et al 2018 proposed a coupled model for liquid water vapor heat migration to study the water vapor behavior in different soils yao and wang 2019 established a numerical model to investigate the mechanism of the double pot cover effect and to further determine the optimal depth of the impervious layer wu et al 2019 built a coupled water heat and salt transport model to simulate the dynamical interactions between soil freezing thawing and salinization in cold arid agricultural regions the existing models are heat water vapor coupling ones that only consider the processes of water vapor migration and heat transfer in unsaturated soils but not accounting for the deformation the freezing process of an unsaturated soil involves complexly heat transfer water vapor migration water ice and water vapor phase changes and deformation to clarify this process we studied the influences of the initial water content and cooling temperature on water vapor migration process and soil deformation in unsaturated soils the coupled heat water vapor mechanics mechanism process of unsaturated soils was analyzed and a coupled heat water vapor mechanics model was proposed the numerical model is validated by the measured data and thus can describe the coupled heat water vapor mechanics process in the freezing unsaturated soil 2 test description 2 1 test material and design the grain size distribution of the soil used in this study is shown in fig 1 it is a silty soil the samples were prepared as cylinders with 100 mm in diameter and 90 mm in height the dry density and initial volumetric water content are listed in table 1 after the sample preparation a thin plastic film was covered and sealed at the top surface of each sample to prevent water evaporation from the top surface a series of one dimensional freezing tests were conducted in this study the experimental conditions of the tests are shown in table 1 in table 1 the initial volumetric water contents of no 1 no 2 and no 3 are 14 62 18 71 and 24 03 respectively therefore no 1 no 2 and no 3 are used to study the influence of initial water content on water vapor migration process and deformation of the freezing unsaturated soils cooling temperatures of no 3 no 4 and no 5 are different so no 3 no 4 and no 5 are used to study the influence of the cooling temperature on water vapor migration process and deformation of the freezing unsaturated soils 2 2 test apparatus and method the experimental apparatus is composed of temperature control system water supply system and data acquisition system as shown in fig 2 in the cold and arid regions it is difficult to recharge the surface soil with water because the water table is deep so we close the water supply system during test process to make the test more practically the apparatus is instrumented with ten thermistors at 1 cm intervals along the vertical direction to monitor the soil temperatures at different heights and one displacement sensor at the top of the sample to measure the frost heave in vertical direction the data of temperature and displacement are automatically collected every 5 min firstly the top and bottom temperatures were kept constant at initial temperature until the initial profile of temperature was constant along the column height then the top temperature was set as table 1 and kept as constant during the whole test progress and the duration of each test is 96 h the water content profile was measured at the end of the test by dividing the sample into slices at 1 cm intervals along the sample height all the samples were tested in accordance with the above method 3 test results and analyses 3 1 influence of initial water content the temperature variation of no 1 is taken as a case study fig 3 because the temperatures variation processes of the samples with time are the same from fig 3 it can be found the temperature variations in different heights could be divided into three stages according to their change rates a sharply cooling stage a slowly cooling stage and a steady stage which is consistent with the results of lai et al 2014 in fig 3 the temperature change rate of soil column at 80 mm height is analyzed the first stage is the sharply cooling stage the change rates of temperature are large and the temperature at the top of sample quickly reduces to target temperature in this stage the temperatures at different heights of the sample also reduce over time with the top temperature decreasing the duration of this stage is short and the freezing depth increases with time in this stage the second stage is the slowly cooling stage the temperatures of sample are close to the target temperature and the heat transfer becomes slowly due to small temperature difference between top plane and soil sample top surface the change rates of temperature are close to zero and the temperatures at different heights are close to steady state and then the steady stage is reached in this stage the temperature hardly fluctuates and the heat transfer of the sample is in a steady state fig 4 is the profiles of total volumetric water content of the samples at the end of tests under different initial water contents it can be found that the volumetric water content in frozen zone is larger than the initial water content while the water content in unfrozen zone is less than the initial water content this is caused by the liquid water and vapor migration it s worth noting that two peak values appear in the profiles of total volumetric water content at the end of tests under the initial water contents of 14 62 and 18 71 the first peak appears at the top of the sample while the second peak appears at the freezing fringe only one peak appears in the profile of test total water content under the initial water content of 24 03 and distributes in freezing fringe these different distributions of water content profile at the end of tests are caused by different water and vapor migration intensities under different initial water contents for unsaturated silty soil the water migrates with the patterns of liquid water and vapor under the driving of temperature gradients when the initial volumetric water content is small liquid water migration is difficult due to many unsaturated pores exist in the soil while the vapor migrates prominently due to the many unsaturated pores provide channels for vapor migration vapor migrates to the top of sample and then aggregates and condenses under the closed top surface leading to volumetric water content peak at the top of sample when the initial volumetric water content is large some of the unsaturated pores will be occupied by liquid water and ice which will decrease the vapor migration the water migratoin is mainly in the form of liquid water under this situation and liquid water is frozen in the advancing freezing front so the peak is not prominent at the closed top surface meanwhile liquid water and vapor migrate to freezing fringe from the unfrozen zone which will increase the water content of freezing fringe resulting in water content peak appears at the freezing fringe the analyses above indicate that initial water content determines the water and vapor migration intensity in unsaturated soils vapor migrates prominently when the initial water content is lower than a critical value above this value the liquid water migrates dominantly fig 5 shows the variations of the frost heave with time under different initial water contents it can be found that the frost heave increases and the increase rate decreases with time and the frost heave variation can be divided into two stages a sharply frost heave stage and a slowly frost heave stage the first stage is the sharply frost heave stage which is corresponding with the sharply cooling stage of temperature and the water vapor migration is less because this stage is very short so the frost heave in this stage could be considered as in situ frost heave the second stage is the slowly frost heave stage which is corresponding with the slowly cooling stage and steady stage of temperature in this stage the liquid water and vapor migrate increasing the soil volume and leading to frost heave the frost heave gradually increases in this stage and then keeps basically stable the frost heave in this stage can be considered as migration frost heave comparing the frost heave variations under different initial water contents it can be found that the frost heave increase rate under initial water content of 24 03 are much larger than those under initial water contents of 14 62 and 18 71 this is because the frost heave is controlled by liquid water and vapor migration according to the analysis of water and vapor migration the initial water content determines the water and vapor migration intensity vapor migrates prominently when the initial water content is lower than a critical value above this value the liquid water migrates dominantly the water flux is much more than the vapor flux so the frost heave increase rate under initial water content of 24 03 is much larger than that under initial water contents of 14 62 and 18 71 to further study the influence of initial water content on frost heave fig 6 shows the relationship between the final frost heave and initial water content it can be found that the final frost heave increases slowly with the initial water content increasing when the initial water content is between 14 62 and 18 71 while the finial frost heave increases rapidly with the initial water content increasing when the initial moisture content is larger than 18 71 which implies that there is a critical initial water content between 18 71 and 24 03 vapor migrates prominently and frost heave develops slowly when the initial water content is lower than the critical value above this value the water migrates dominantly and frost heave develops rapidly 3 2 influence of cooling temperature to study the influence of the cooling temperature on water vapor migration process and deformation of freezing unsaturated soils different cooling temperatures are controlled by 2 c at cold end and 3 9 c at warm end 3 c at cold end and 3 4 c at warm end as well as 3 4 c at cold end and 3 4 c at warm end respectively the results are shown in figs 7 and 8 from fig 7 it can be found that the liquid water and vapor migration are obvious and the lower the cooling temperature is the less the liquid water and vapor migration are in the one hand the liquid water freezes into ice with the cooling temperature decreasing and the pore ice decreases the water and vapor migration leading to less migrations of liquid water and vapor on the other hand the freezing front is higher under a warmer cooling temperature so that unfrozen zone take up more space and more unfrozen water could migrate easily which promotes the water and vapor migration fig 8 shows the frost heave variations under different cooling temperatures it can be found that the frost heave variations under different cooling temperatures are basically same and can be divided into a sharply frost heave stage and a slowly frost heave stage in addition it can be found that the frost heave increase rate decreases with the cooling temperature decreasing this is because the liquid water freezes into ice with the cooling temperature decreasing and the pore ice decreases the water and vapor migration in addition the freezing front is higher under a warmer cooling temperature so that unfrozen zone take up more space and more unfrozen water could migrate easily which promotes the water and vapor migration these two reasons result in the frost heave increase rate decreases with the cooling temperature decreasing 4 numerical model unsaturated soil is composed of mineral particles liquid water and gaseous inclusions under thermal and mechanical loads heat transfer water vapor migration water ice and water vapor phase changes and deformation will occur we make the following basic assumptions to propose a coupled heat water vapor mechanics model of unsaturated soils the soil is assumed to be isotropic and elastic plastic medium within which the soil is fully frozen partially frozen or unfrozen only consider the influence of vapor in unsaturated pores and ignore the influence of other gaseous inclusions that is unsaturated frozen soil is composed of liquid water ice vapor and soil particles while unsaturated unfrozen soil is composed of liquid water vapor and soil particles the freezing point of pore water is assumed as a constant and its depression is negligible under loads and different degrees of saturation the influences of freezing thawing cycle hysteresis drying wetting cycle hysteresis and deformation on soil water characteristic curve swcc and soil freezing characteristic curve sfcc are negligible the column sample is used to carry out test in this study and all boundary conditions are symmetrical along the center line so it is a classical axisymmetric problem and the mathematical model is established under a cylindrical coordinate system it is worth noting that our purpose of proposing the model is to further simulate the heat water vapor mechanics behavior in practical engineering and the test data is only used to verify the model 4 1 coupled heat water vapor mechanics mechanism when a freezing temperature gradient forms in an unsaturated soil the heat transfer will cause the migrations of unfrozen pore water and vapor at the same time the water and vapor aggregate and then freeze into ice at the freezing fringe which will increase the soil volume and then frost heave emerges the heat is carried by the migrated liquid water and vapor which will enhance the heat transfer process meanwhile the pore pressure changes due to water and vapor migration and the effective stress of unsaturated soil will be changed causing volumetric strain of soil heat content in volume element is also changed due to soil volumetric strain which will affect the heat transfer process of soil in addition under thermal and mechanical loads thermal expansion volume compression water ice change and water vapor change will occur the main coupled heat water vapor mechanics process considered are illustrated in fig 9 4 2 liquid water and water vapor flow for an freezing unsaturated soil volumetric contents of liquid water ice and equivalent vapor can be expressed as 1 θ θ l ρ i ρ w θ i 2 θ v ρ v ρ w θ s θ l θ i where θl θi θv are the volumetric contents of liquid water ice and equivalent vapor respectively θs is the saturated volumetric water content ρw ρi ρv are the densities of liquid water ice and vapor respectively the model of philip and de vries 1957 is phenomenologically reasonable and some studies e g hansson et al 2004 sakai et al 2009 zhang et al 2016a b c have showed that the model can simulate the heat water vapor behavior in unsaturated soils so the model is used in this study the flux density of liquid water ql is described using a modified darcy law as given by philip and de vries 1957 3 q l q lh q lt k lh h z k lt t where qlh and qlt are isothermal and thermal liquid water flux densities respectively h is the pressure head and klh and klt are the isothermal and thermal hydraulic conductivities for liquid phase

philip and de vries 1957 4 q v q vh q vt k vh h k vt t where qlh and qlt are isothermal and thermal vapor flux densities respectively kvh and kvt are the isothermal and thermal vapor hydraulic conductivities respectively according to the mass conservation equation the governing liquid water and vapor flow equation can be expressed as 5 θ t θ v t q l q v combining eqs 1 5 the governing equation can be rewritten as 6 θ l t θ v t ρ i ρ w θ i t k l h h z k l t t k vh h k vt t 4 3 heat transport the law of energy conservation of heat for freezing soils can be expressed as 7 φ t q t 0

represents the contribution of pure heat conduction λ is the thermal conductivity of soil the second term represents the transfer of latent heat by vapor movement the third and fourth terms represent the transfer of sensible heat in vapor and liquid form respectively cv and cl are the volumetric heat capacities of the vapor and liquid water combining eqs 7 8 and 9 the governing equation of heat transfer in unsaturated soils can be expressed as 10 c t t l i ρ i θ i t l w ρ w θ v t λ t c l q l t c v q v t l w ρ w q v 4 4 force equilibrium 4 4 1 equilibrium equation the volumetric deformation is assumed to be positive under compression condition based on the general assumption in geotechnical engineering the local equilibrium equation can be written as li et al 2014b 2015 2018 shen and

increment vector and the plastic strain increment vector respectively eqs 1 13 consist of the coupled heat water vapor mechanics model and the other parameters see in appendix a 4 5 model validation the model is strongly nonlinear because the coefficients in these equations vary over time and they are interrelated therefore the model is solved by finite element method the equations are discretized with the finite element method in space and the backward difference method in time in the process of solving firstly we calculate thermal and hydraulic parameters with the initial conditions and solve the eqs 6 and 10 and the distributions of water and heat are obtained in this step then we calculate mechanical parameters with the distributions of water and heat next we solve the eqs 11 13 according to the boundary and initial conditions the solution procedure is same in each step computation model is shown in fig 10 it is established under a cylindrical coordinate system the radii and height of the computation model are the same as those of the test sample the sample of no 1 is taken as a case study the boundary and initial conditions are consistent with the conditions of the test the initial water content is 14 62 and initial temperature is 4 c the horizontal displacements on the sides of the soil sample and the vertical displacements on the bottom boundary are all constrained fig 11 shows the measured and computed temperatures at different heights it can be found that the simulated temperatures agree with those measured data at different heights except for the values at 40 mm height the first reason is the frost heave which makes the measured and modeled soil temperature represent different locations the second reason may be that the radial thermal boundary conditions are slightly different between testing and modelling in the model the radial thermal boundary is adiabatic in the test although thermal conductivity of the test tube is small there still exists some heat exchange between the sample and external environment the temperature of external environment is higher than the sample temperature the heat will transfer into the sample and increase the temperature of sample in the process of test the soil at 40 mm height is far away from the bottom and top plates temperature control plates so it is the most affected as a result there are slight differences between the simulated temperatures and measured temperatures at 40 mm height nonetheless the simulated temperatures agree well with those measured data which indicates that the model can simulate the heat transfer process in unsaturated soils to study the water and vapor migration of unsaturated soils in freezing process we given the computed profiles of volumetric water content fig 12 and equivalent vapor content fig 13 at different times fig 12 is the computed profiles of volumetric water content at different times from fig 12 a it can be found that the volumetric water content at the top of sample is larger than the initial water content liquid water and vapor migrate by driving of temperature gradients and matric suctions and the vapor aggregates and condenses under the closed top surface causing the volumetric water content increases at sample top in addition the water content below freezing front slightly decreases due to water and vapor migration from fig 12 b it can be found that the freezing front continues to move downward with the time and the liquid water and vapor further migrate which further decreases the water content in unfrozen soil it is worth noting there are two peaks in the profile of water content at 10 h one locates at the top of the sample and the other one locates at the freezing fringe which is in accordance with the test distribution of water content the profile of water content at 96 h is same as that at 10 h and the values are greater than that at 10 h due to water and vapor further migration from fig 12 c it can be found that the simulated freezing fringe locates about at 56 65 mm heights and with a volumetric water content of 29 the measured freezing fringe locates at 50 60 mm heights and with a volumetric water content of 31 34 the simulated minimum value of water content in frozen soil is 22 and locates at 73 82 mm heights while the measured minimum value of water content in frozen soil is 19 29 and locates at 70 80 mm heights in addition the simulated water content distribution in unfrozen soil is also consistent with these measured data that is the computed profile of water content is in good agreement with the measured profile of water content meanwhile from fig 12 a c it can be found that water contents in frozen soil increase with time while the water contents in unfrozen soil decrease with time this is caused by the water and vapor migration and aggregation the above analyses indicate that the model can simulate the water and vapor migration process of unsaturated soils in freezing process fig 13 is the computed profiles of equivalent vapor content at different times from fig 13 a it can be found that the equivalent vapor content in the sample increases gradually from the top to the bottom at 2 h migrated water and vapor are less and the filling effects of pore water and ice on unsaturated pores are not obvious the content of equivalent vapor is mainly affected by temperature the content of equivalent vapor at the bottom of sample is higher than that at the top of sample due to the high temperature at the bottom of sample fig 13 b and c show that a minimal value of equivalent vapor content appears about at 60 mm height which corresponds to the position of volumetric water content peak this is because some of the unsaturated pores are filled by pore water and ice at that location resulting in less space for vapor in addition it can be found that the equivalent vapor content in frozen soil decreases with time while the equivalent vapor content in unfrozen soil increases with time this is mainly because the liquid water and vapor migration decreases the water content increases vapor space in unfrozen soil and increases it decreases vapor space in frozen soil the above analyses indicate that the equivalent vapor content in unsaturated soil is controlled by the soil temperature and degree of saturation temperature controls the equivalent vapor content by influencing the vapor density while the degree of saturation controls the vapor content through affecting the space occupied by vapor fig 14 shows the measured and computed frost heave variations of the sample it can be found that the simulated frost heave agrees well with the measured frost heave this agreement indicates that the model can simulate the frost heave variation of unsaturated soils in the freezing process to further analyze the deformation of the freezing unsaturated soil fig 15 shows the profiles of displacement at different times from fig 15 a it can be found that the displacements are small and evenly distribute in frozen soil at 2 h and the displacement at the top surface of the sample in this stage could be considered as in situ frost heave fig 15 b shows the distribution of displacement at 10 h which is different with that at 2 h and the contour lines of displacement are relatively dense at 60 70 mm heights that is the deformation of the sample is concentrated at 60 70 mm heights this difference is more dramatic in fig 15 c according to the profile of water content at 96 h that location is corresponding with the freezing fringe of the sample the water and vapor migrate and accumulate at that location increasing soil volume at the freezing fringe and resulting in the concentrated distribution of displacement at freezing fringe the increased displacement at the sample top surface in this stage could be considered as migration frost heave the above analyses show that frost heave consists of two parts i e in situ frost heave and migration frost heave the in situ frost heave is small and evenly distributes in frozen soil while the migration frost heave is large and mainly distributes at the freezing fringe 5 conclusions to understand the water vapor migration process and deformation of freezing unsaturated soils we conducted a series of one dimensional freezing tests to study the influences of the initial water content and cooling temperature on the water vapor migration and deformation of unsaturated soils we further analyzed the coupled heat water vapor mechanics process of unsaturated soils and proposed a coupled heat water vapor mechanics model the following conclusions can be made 1 the initial water content determines the water and vapor migration intensity and deformation of unsaturated soils vapor migrates prominently and frost heave develops slowly when the initial water content is lower than a critical value above this value the water migrates dominantly and frost heave develops rapidly 2 water and vapor fluxes are related to cooling temperature and a higher cooling temperature is beneficial to the migrations of water and vapor in unsaturated soil 3 the simulated temperatures volumetric water content and displacement are good in agreement with those measured data which implies the numerical model is valid and can

5590,freezing of unsaturated soils jointly involves heat transfer water vapor migration water ice and water vapor phase changes and deformation to understand this freezing we conducted a series of one dimensional freezing tests to study the influences of the initial water content and cooling temperature on the water vapor migration and deformation of unsaturated soils results show that the initial water content determines the water and vapor migration intensity and deformation of unsaturated soils vapor migrates prominently and frost heave develops slowly when the initial water content is lower than a critical value above this value the liquid water migration dominates and frost heave develops rapidly it is also found that the cooling temperature dominates water and vapor fluxes in such a manner that a higher cooling temperature leads to faster migrations of water and vapor in unsaturated soil we further analyzed the coupled heat water vapor mechanics process of unsaturated soils and proposed a coupled heat water vapor mechanics model the simulated temperatures volumetric water content and displacement agree well with those measured data validating that the model can describe effectively the coupled heat water vapor mechanics process in freezing unsaturated soils keywords unsaturated soils water migration vapor migration frost heave heat water vapor mechanics process 1 introduction under temperature gradients within a pavement structure water vapor flow is an important mechanism of moisture ingress in aggregate base layers during winter in cold regions guthrie et al 2006 as an impervious cover the pavement prevents evaporation leading to moisture accumulation under it li et al 2014a the accumulated moisture under a freezing temperature freezes into ice increasing the soil volume and resulting in frost heave vapor migration is a common cause of engineering failure in structures like the concrete panel of hydraulic engineering airfield runway pavements li et al 2014a and high speed railway pavement niu et al 2016 it is imperative to understand the water and vapor migration in unsaturated soils in freezing process the importance of vapor migration in unsaturated soils has been well documented experimentally vapor migration takes place in freezing unsaturated soils under the driving force of matric suction or temperature gradient nakano et al 1984 a series of tests on gravel showed that the moisture content will increase due to vapor diffusion eigenbrod and kennepohl 1996 guthrie et al 2006 had conducted an unidirectional freezing test on a non frost susceptible granular material typical of base layers within the jurisdiction of the swedish national road administration for 41 days and found that the average vapor flow rate was 12 8 g week and the majority of the incoming water accumulated just above the freezing front zhang et al 2016b conducted a series of one side freezing tests on calcareous sand and found that the water content at the top of sample increases from 5 and 7 to 35 and 47 respectively in addition the model of zhang et al 2016c showed that vapor flow contributes to the ice formation greatly and can be more than 10 of total moisture flow wu et al 2016 studied the evaporation from seasonally frozen soils under various water solute and groundwater conditions tests of gao et al 2018 and bai et al 2018a indicated that vapor migration creates a thin ice layer in the covered cold top of coarse grained sample some models have been proposed about vapor migration in unsaturated soils penman 1940 first developed a theory of vapor flow in soils based on fick s law later philip and de vries 1957 extended penman s theory to describe coupled movements of liquid water and vaporous water under non isothermal conditions de vries 1958 generalized the model by combining influence of gravity and gradients of temperature and moisture content after that some researchers further extended and completed the model milly 1984 cass et al 1984 nassar and horton 1992 nassar et al 1992 noborio et al 1996a b nassar et al 1999 in addition saito et al 2006 proposed a new heat water vapor coupling model to study the process of water and vapor migration in vadose zone sakai et al 2009 used the heat water vapor coupling model to study the water and vapor migration in sand soil under the conditions of condensation and evaporation the above models are only applicable to the process of water and vapor migration in unfrozen soils hansson et al 2004 extended the model to freezing soil presented a new method to account for phase changes for coupled heat transport and variably saturated water flow the model was further developed to illustrate the process of water and vapor migration and mechanisms of vapor condensation and of ice formation in unsaturated soils zhang et al 2016b c luo et al 2016 song et al 2017 zhang et al 2016a extended the model to simulate the water and vapor behavior of the field soil in the qinghai tibet plateau he et al 2018 proposed a coupled model for liquid water vapor heat migration to study the water vapor behavior in different soils yao and wang 2019 established a numerical model to investigate the mechanism of the double pot cover effect and to further determine the optimal depth of the impervious layer wu et al 2019 built a coupled water heat and salt transport model to simulate the dynamical interactions between soil freezing thawing and salinization in cold arid agricultural regions the existing models are heat water vapor coupling ones that only consider the processes of water vapor migration and heat transfer in unsaturated soils but not accounting for the deformation the freezing process of an unsaturated soil involves complexly heat transfer water vapor migration water ice and water vapor phase changes and deformation to clarify this process we studied the influences of the initial water content and cooling temperature on water vapor migration process and soil deformation in unsaturated soils the coupled heat water vapor mechanics mechanism process of unsaturated soils was analyzed and a coupled heat water vapor mechanics model was proposed the numerical model is validated by the measured data and thus can describe the coupled heat water vapor mechanics process in the freezing unsaturated soil 2 test description 2 1 test material and design the grain size distribution of the soil used in this study is shown in fig 1 it is a silty soil the samples were prepared as cylinders with 100 mm in diameter and 90 mm in height the dry density and initial volumetric water content are listed in table 1 after the sample preparation a thin plastic film was covered and sealed at the top surface of each sample to prevent water evaporation from the top surface a series of one dimensional freezing tests were conducted in this study the experimental conditions of the tests are shown in table 1 in table 1 the initial volumetric water contents of no 1 no 2 and no 3 are 14 62 18 71 and 24 03 respectively therefore no 1 no 2 and no 3 are used to study the influence of initial water content on water vapor migration process and deformation of the freezing unsaturated soils cooling temperatures of no 3 no 4 and no 5 are different so no 3 no 4 and no 5 are used to study the influence of the cooling temperature on water vapor migration process and deformation of the freezing unsaturated soils 2 2 test apparatus and method the experimental apparatus is composed of temperature control system water supply system and data acquisition system as shown in fig 2 in the cold and arid regions it is difficult to recharge the surface soil with water because the water table is deep so we close the water supply system during test process to make the test more practically the apparatus is instrumented with ten thermistors at 1 cm intervals along the vertical direction to monitor the soil temperatures at different heights and one displacement sensor at the top of the sample to measure the frost heave in vertical direction the data of temperature and displacement are automatically collected every 5 min firstly the top and bottom temperatures were kept constant at initial temperature until the initial profile of temperature was constant along the column height then the top temperature was set as table 1 and kept as constant during the whole test progress and the duration of each test is 96 h the water content profile was measured at the end of the test by dividing the sample into slices at 1 cm intervals along the sample height all the samples were tested in accordance with the above method 3 test results and analyses 3 1 influence of initial water content the temperature variation of no 1 is taken as a case study fig 3 because the temperatures variation processes of the samples with time are the same from fig 3 it can be found the temperature variations in different heights could be divided into three stages according to their change rates a sharply cooling stage a slowly cooling stage and a steady stage which is consistent with the results of lai et al 2014 in fig 3 the temperature change rate of soil column at 80 mm height is analyzed the first stage is the sharply cooling stage the change rates of temperature are large and the temperature at the top of sample quickly reduces to target temperature in this stage the temperatures at different heights of the sample also reduce over time with the top temperature decreasing the duration of this stage is short and the freezing depth increases with time in this stage the second stage is the slowly cooling stage the temperatures of sample are close to the target temperature and the heat transfer becomes slowly due to small temperature difference between top plane and soil sample top surface the change rates of temperature are close to zero and the temperatures at different heights are close to steady state and then the steady stage is reached in this stage the temperature hardly fluctuates and the heat transfer of the sample is in a steady state fig 4 is the profiles of total volumetric water content of the samples at the end of tests under different initial water contents it can be found that the volumetric water content in frozen zone is larger than the initial water content while the water content in unfrozen zone is less than the initial water content this is caused by the liquid water and vapor migration it s worth noting that two peak values appear in the profiles of total volumetric water content at the end of tests under the initial water contents of 14 62 and 18 71 the first peak appears at the top of the sample while the second peak appears at the freezing fringe only one peak appears in the profile of test total water content under the initial water content of 24 03 and distributes in freezing fringe these different distributions of water content profile at the end of tests are caused by different water and vapor migration intensities under different initial water contents for unsaturated silty soil the water migrates with the patterns of liquid water and vapor under the driving of temperature gradients when the initial volumetric water content is small liquid water migration is difficult due to many unsaturated pores exist in the soil while the vapor migrates prominently due to the many unsaturated pores provide channels for vapor migration vapor migrates to the top of sample and then aggregates and condenses under the closed top surface leading to volumetric water content peak at the top of sample when the initial volumetric water content is large some of the unsaturated pores will be occupied by liquid water and ice which will decrease the vapor migration the water migratoin is mainly in the form of liquid water under this situation and liquid water is frozen in the advancing freezing front so the peak is not prominent at the closed top surface meanwhile liquid water and vapor migrate to freezing fringe from the unfrozen zone which will increase the water content of freezing fringe resulting in water content peak appears at the freezing fringe the analyses above indicate that initial water content determines the water and vapor migration intensity in unsaturated soils vapor migrates prominently when the initial water content is lower than a critical value above this value the liquid water migrates dominantly fig 5 shows the variations of the frost heave with time under different initial water contents it can be found that the frost heave increases and the increase rate decreases with time and the frost heave variation can be divided into two stages a sharply frost heave stage and a slowly frost heave stage the first stage is the sharply frost heave stage which is corresponding with the sharply cooling stage of temperature and the water vapor migration is less because this stage is very short so the frost heave in this stage could be considered as in situ frost heave the second stage is the slowly frost heave stage which is corresponding with the slowly cooling stage and steady stage of temperature in this stage the liquid water and vapor migrate increasing the soil volume and leading to frost heave the frost heave gradually increases in this stage and then keeps basically stable the frost heave in this stage can be considered as migration frost heave comparing the frost heave variations under different initial water contents it can be found that the frost heave increase rate under initial water content of 24 03 are much larger than those under initial water contents of 14 62 and 18 71 this is because the frost heave is controlled by liquid water and vapor migration according to the analysis of water and vapor migration the initial water content determines the water and vapor migration intensity vapor migrates prominently when the initial water content is lower than a critical value above this value the liquid water migrates dominantly the water flux is much more than the vapor flux so the frost heave increase rate under initial water content of 24 03 is much larger than that under initial water contents of 14 62 and 18 71 to further study the influence of initial water content on frost heave fig 6 shows the relationship between the final frost heave and initial water content it can be found that the final frost heave increases slowly with the initial water content increasing when the initial water content is between 14 62 and 18 71 while the finial frost heave increases rapidly with the initial water content increasing when the initial moisture content is larger than 18 71 which implies that there is a critical initial water content between 18 71 and 24 03 vapor migrates prominently and frost heave develops slowly when the initial water content is lower than the critical value above this value the water migrates dominantly and frost heave develops rapidly 3 2 influence of cooling temperature to study the influence of the cooling temperature on water vapor migration process and deformation of freezing unsaturated soils different cooling temperatures are controlled by 2 c at cold end and 3 9 c at warm end 3 c at cold end and 3 4 c at warm end as well as 3 4 c at cold end and 3 4 c at warm end respectively the results are shown in figs 7 and 8 from fig 7 it can be found that the liquid water and vapor migration are obvious and the lower the cooling temperature is the less the liquid water and vapor migration are in the one hand the liquid water freezes into ice with the cooling temperature decreasing and the pore ice decreases the water and vapor migration leading to less migrations of liquid water and vapor on the other hand the freezing front is higher under a warmer cooling temperature so that unfrozen zone take up more space and more unfrozen water could migrate easily which promotes the water and vapor migration fig 8 shows the frost heave variations under different cooling temperatures it can be found that the frost heave variations under different cooling temperatures are basically same and can be divided into a sharply frost heave stage and a slowly frost heave stage in addition it can be found that the frost heave increase rate decreases with the cooling temperature decreasing this is because the liquid water freezes into ice with the cooling temperature decreasing and the pore ice decreases the water and vapor migration in addition the freezing front is higher under a warmer cooling temperature so that unfrozen zone take up more space and more unfrozen water could migrate easily which promotes the water and vapor migration these two reasons result in the frost heave increase rate decreases with the cooling temperature decreasing 4 numerical model unsaturated soil is composed of mineral particles liquid water and gaseous inclusions under thermal and mechanical loads heat transfer water vapor migration water ice and water vapor phase changes and deformation will occur we make the following basic assumptions to propose a coupled heat water vapor mechanics model of unsaturated soils the soil is assumed to be isotropic and elastic plastic medium within which the soil is fully frozen partially frozen or unfrozen only consider the influence of vapor in unsaturated pores and ignore the influence of other gaseous inclusions that is unsaturated frozen soil is composed of liquid water ice vapor and soil particles while unsaturated unfrozen soil is composed of liquid water vapor and soil particles the freezing point of pore water is assumed as a constant and its depression is negligible under loads and different degrees of saturation the influences of freezing thawing cycle hysteresis drying wetting cycle hysteresis and deformation on soil water characteristic curve swcc and soil freezing characteristic curve sfcc are negligible the column sample is used to carry out test in this study and all boundary conditions are symmetrical along the center line so it is a classical axisymmetric problem and the mathematical model is established under a cylindrical coordinate system it is worth noting that our purpose of proposing the model is to further simulate the heat water vapor mechanics behavior in practical engineering and the test data is only used to verify the model 4 1 coupled heat water vapor mechanics mechanism when a freezing temperature gradient forms in an unsaturated soil the heat transfer will cause the migrations of unfrozen pore water and vapor at the same time the water and vapor aggregate and then freeze into ice at the freezing fringe which will increase the soil volume and then frost heave emerges the heat is carried by the migrated liquid water and vapor which will enhance the heat transfer process meanwhile the pore pressure changes due to water and vapor migration and the effective stress of unsaturated soil will be changed causing volumetric strain of soil heat content in volume element is also changed due to soil volumetric strain which will affect the heat transfer process of soil in addition under thermal and mechanical loads thermal expansion volume compression water ice change and water vapor change will occur the main coupled heat water vapor mechanics process considered are illustrated in fig 9 4 2 liquid water and water vapor flow for an freezing unsaturated soil volumetric contents of liquid water ice and equivalent vapor can be expressed as 1 θ θ l ρ i ρ w θ i 2 θ v ρ v ρ w θ s θ l θ i where θl θi θv are the volumetric contents of liquid water ice and equivalent vapor respectively θs is the saturated volumetric water content ρw ρi ρv are the densities of liquid water ice and vapor respectively the model of philip and de vries 1957 is phenomenologically reasonable and some studies e g hansson et al 2004 sakai et al 2009 zhang et al 2016a b c have showed that the model can simulate the heat water vapor behavior in unsaturated soils so the model is used in this study the flux density of liquid water ql is described using a modified darcy law as given by philip and de vries 1957 3 q l q lh q lt k lh h z k lt t

philip and de vries 1957 4 q v q vh q vt k vh h k vt t where qlh and qlt are isothermal and thermal vapor flux densities respectively kvh and kvt are the isothermal and thermal vapor hydraulic

increment vector and the plastic strain increment vector respectively eqs 1 13 consist of the coupled heat water vapor mechanics model and the other parameters see in appendix a 4 5 model validation the model is strongly nonlinear because the coefficients in these equations vary over time and they are interrelated therefore the model is solved by finite element method the equations are discretized with the finite element method in space and the backward difference method in time in the process of solving firstly we calculate thermal and hydraulic parameters with the initial conditions and solve the eqs 6 and 10 and the distributions of water and heat are obtained in this step then we calculate mechanical parameters with the distributions of water and heat next we solve the eqs 11 13 according to the boundary and initial conditions the solution procedure is same in each step computation model is shown in fig 10 it is established under a cylindrical coordinate system the radii and height of the computation model are the same as those of the test sample the sample of no 1 is taken as a case study the boundary and initial conditions are consistent with the conditions of the test the initial water content is 14 62 and initial temperature is 4 c the horizontal displacements on the sides of the soil sample and the vertical displacements on the bottom boundary are all constrained fig 11 shows the measured and computed temperatures at different heights it can be found that the simulated temperatures agree with those measured data at different heights except for the values at 40 mm height the first reason is the frost heave which makes the measured and modeled soil temperature represent different locations the second reason may be that the radial thermal boundary conditions are slightly different between testing and modelling in the model the radial thermal boundary is adiabatic in the test although thermal conductivity of the test tube is small there still exists some heat exchange between the sample and external environment the temperature of external environment is higher than the sample temperature the heat will transfer into the sample and increase the temperature of sample in the process of test the soil at 40 mm height is far away from the bottom and top plates temperature control plates so it is the most affected as a result there are slight differences between the simulated temperatures and measured temperatures at 40 mm height nonetheless the simulated temperatures agree well with those measured data which indicates that the model can simulate the heat transfer process in unsaturated soils to study the water and vapor migration of unsaturated soils in freezing process we given the computed profiles of volumetric water content fig 12 and equivalent vapor content fig 13 at different times fig 12 is the computed profiles of volumetric water content at different times from fig 12 a it can be found that the volumetric water content at the top of sample is larger than the initial water content liquid water and vapor migrate by driving of temperature gradients and matric suctions and the vapor aggregates and condenses under the closed top surface causing the volumetric water content increases at sample top in addition the water content below freezing front slightly decreases due to water and vapor migration from fig 12 b it can be found that the freezing front continues to move downward with the time and the liquid water and vapor further migrate which further decreases the water content in unfrozen soil it is worth noting there are two peaks in the profile of water content at 10 h one locates at the top of the sample and the other one locates at the freezing fringe which is in accordance with the test distribution of water content the profile of water content at 96 h is same as that at 10 h and the values are greater than that at 10 h due to water and vapor further migration from fig 12 c it can be found that the simulated freezing fringe locates about at 56 65 mm heights and with a volumetric water content of 29 the measured freezing fringe locates at 50 60 mm heights and with a volumetric water content of 31 34 the simulated minimum value of water content in frozen soil is 22 and locates at 73 82 mm heights while the measured minimum value of water content in frozen soil is 19 29 and locates at 70 80 mm heights in addition the simulated water content distribution in unfrozen soil is also consistent with these measured data that is the computed profile of water content is in good agreement with the measured profile of water content meanwhile from fig 12 a c it can be found that water contents in frozen soil increase with time while the water contents in unfrozen soil decrease with time this is caused by the water and vapor migration and aggregation the above analyses indicate that the model can simulate the water and vapor migration process of unsaturated soils in freezing process fig 13 is the computed profiles of equivalent vapor content at different times from fig 13 a it can be found that the equivalent vapor content in the sample increases gradually from the top to the bottom at 2 h migrated water and vapor are less and the filling effects of pore water and ice on unsaturated pores are not obvious the content of equivalent vapor is mainly affected by temperature the content of equivalent vapor at the bottom of sample is higher than that at the top of sample due to the high temperature at the bottom of sample fig 13 b and c show that a minimal value of equivalent vapor content appears about at 60 mm height which corresponds to the position of volumetric water content peak this is because some of the unsaturated pores are filled by pore water and ice at that location resulting in less space for vapor in addition it can be found that the equivalent vapor content in frozen soil decreases with time while the equivalent vapor content in unfrozen soil increases with time this is mainly because the liquid water and vapor migration decreases the water content increases vapor space in unfrozen soil and increases it decreases vapor space in frozen soil the above analyses indicate that the equivalent vapor content in unsaturated soil is controlled by the soil temperature and degree of saturation temperature controls the equivalent vapor content by influencing the vapor density while the degree of saturation controls the vapor content through affecting the space occupied by vapor fig 14 shows the measured and computed frost heave variations of the sample it can be found that the simulated frost heave agrees well with the measured frost heave this agreement indicates that the model can simulate the frost heave variation of unsaturated soils in the freezing process to further analyze the deformation of the freezing unsaturated soil fig 15 shows the profiles of displacement at different times from fig 15 a it can be found that the displacements are small and evenly distribute in frozen soil at 2 h and the displacement at the top surface of the sample in this stage could be considered as in situ frost heave fig 15 b shows the distribution of displacement at 10 h which is different with that at 2 h and the contour lines of displacement are relatively dense at 60 70 mm heights that is the deformation of the sample is concentrated at 60 70 mm heights this difference is more dramatic in fig 15 c according to the profile of water content at 96 h that location is corresponding with the freezing fringe of the sample the water and vapor migrate and accumulate at that location increasing soil volume at the freezing fringe and resulting in the concentrated distribution of displacement at freezing fringe the increased displacement at the sample top surface in this stage could be considered as migration frost heave the above analyses show that frost heave consists of two parts i e in situ frost heave and migration frost heave the in situ frost heave is small and evenly distributes in frozen soil while the migration frost heave is large and mainly distributes at the freezing fringe 5 conclusions to understand the water vapor migration process and deformation of freezing unsaturated soils we conducted a series of one dimensional freezing tests to study the influences of the initial water content and cooling temperature on the water vapor migration and deformation of unsaturated soils we further analyzed the coupled heat water vapor mechanics process of unsaturated soils and proposed a coupled heat water vapor mechanics model the following conclusions can be made 1 the initial water content determines the water and vapor migration intensity and deformation of unsaturated soils vapor migrates prominently and frost heave develops slowly when the initial water content is lower than a critical value above this value the water migrates dominantly and frost heave develops rapidly 2 water and vapor fluxes are related to cooling temperature and a higher cooling temperature is beneficial to the migrations of water and vapor in unsaturated soil 3 the simulated temperatures volumetric water content and displacement are good in agreement with those measured data which implies the numerical model is valid and can

5591,soil moisture processes exhibit a strong variability in space and time due to the variability of the meteorological forcing and the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties this study aims at providing a statistical description of soil moisture variability by analyzing data from nine in situ stations located over an west east gradient in southwestern france smosmania stations distributed over an area of about 300 200 km for each station four time series of soil moisture observed at four different depths ranging from 5 cm to 30 cm are analyzed first possible scaling properties are investigated within the fourier domain with the help of spectral analysis tools red noise like 1 f 2 scaling properties could be noticed over a fairly wide scale range 1000 h 1 h with relatively homogeneous scaling parameters for 5 cm depth soil moistures regardless of the station these properties are confirmed at other depths with slightly steeper spectra and more heterogeneity across stations in a second step multifractal analysis has been carried out on the same data multifractal scaling is observed over a narrower scaling range 128 h 1 h moment scaling functions can be parameterized within the framework of universal multifractals typical parameters are c 1 0 25 and α 1 6 1 8 for surface data while both parameters are subject to strong changes c 1 increases and α decreases as the depth increases in a third step multiscale entropy mse analysis has been applied in order to analyze the dataset from an information theory point of view and to infer whether multifractal properties could have a signature on mse estimates the mse function has been found to follow a power law of the aggregation time with a scaling exponent close to 0 3 0 4 for surface data these exponents were generally close to the hurst exponent h estimated by first order structure functions while it is already known that mse should follow scaling properties in the case of monofractal signals the results suggest that the latter property holds for natural multifractal processes finally complementary numerical tests based on synthetic multifractal time series are done in order to assess the relationship between the mse scaling exponent h and multifractal parameters c 1 α and h a dependency on the three multifractal parameters has been observed yet in practice the approximation h h seems somewhat acceptable for processes with relatively large hurst exponents and or low multifractal intermittency c 1 on a more broad perspective the existence of relationships between multifractal scaling and mse properties could help to refine the physical interpretation of observed scaling properties in many geophysical processes keywords soil moisture multifractals time series analysis multiscale entropy scaling 1 introduction soil moisture is a key variable in hydrology meteorology and biosphere science it is the result of a strongly heterogeneous atmospheric forcing i e rainfall and of the interaction of other processes like evaporation transpiration or infiltration consequently soil moisture is subject to strong and possibly quick variations and is heterogeneous in space and time this results in potential difficulties in sampling strategies since sensors have their own limitations in terms of observable scales vereecken et al 2014 for instance operating passive l band radiometers like those of smos kerr et al 2010 2016 and smap entekhabi et al 2010 missions can provide continental daily coverage of soil moisture variability but their spatial resolution is limited to pixels of about 50 50 km2 airborne missions can provide more details about spatial variability but data are available over limited areas and a very limited amount of time i e when the mission is operated conversely in situ sensors have the ability to give a very local estimate of soil moisture over small hourly or sub hourly time steps but their observations are difficult to upscale or to extrapolate to other locations this resolution mismatch may be somewhat reduced by applying downscaling methods to satellite data e g merlin et al 2008 2012 but the problem is still not fully solved since downscaled products have still coarse kilometric resolutions in comparison to the small spatial domain seen by an in situ sensor an alternative approach is to try to characterize the spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture with intrinsically multiscale statistical formalisms the idea behind such formalisms relies on the fact that a complex heterogeneous signal or random process may hide remarkable symmetries in this context we may look for statistical estimators that could be related to the process resolution by simple analytical laws such scaling properties are accurately followed by various geophysical variables lovejoy et al 2008a lovejoy and schertzer 2006 2010 gagnon et al 2006 tessier et al 1993 in many cases these properties are even related to the concepts of scale invariance and fractality some of these concepts will be defined in section 2 in geophysics the characterization of scaling laws may be useful for several kinds of applications such as i comparing the variability of measurements collected by sensors operating at different resolutions ii evaluating a numerical model such as a general circulation model or a land surface model that should be able to reproduce some scaling features of the observations e g lovejoy et al 2013 verrier et al 2014 iii constraining statistical downscaling methods gires et al 2012 to respect the observed scaling laws in the context of soil moisture existing studies already evidenced the existence of fractal like scaling in space and in time in particular remote sensing data have been used by several authors in order to investigate fractal properties across space scales kim and barros 2002a 2002b analyzed airborne soil moisture estimates from the southern great plains 1997 experiment and proposed a monofractal approach for downscaling soil moisture from 10 km to 1 km resolution multifractal variants of the latter approach have been proposed later by mascaro et al mascaro and vivoni 2010 2012 mascaro et al 2010 2011 based on partly similar airborne remote sensing data sets several analyses have also been performed on satellite images for instance lovejoy et al 2008b have shown that both modis radiances and surface soil moisture index exhibit scaling and multifractal properties based on a case study over central spain in the time domain katul et al 2007 also identified the existence of spectral scaling properties based on relatively long term in situ acquisitions 8 years of hourly data at one specific station the authors also proposed a physical approach to justify the existence of these properties especially taking into account the integrative nature of soil water content with respect to its meteorological forcing in the following scaling analysis tools are applied to surface soil moisture time series collected by a network of probes smosmania overall the smosmania network consists of about 20 stations located in south western and south eastern france capacitive measurements of hourly soil moisture have been done continuously during several years at stations belonging to the météo france operational observation network this makes these measurements suitable for scaling analyses due to the wide range of time scales covered by the data moreover the network design is based on a compromise between a large spatial coverage and a moderate distance between probes finally all probes are located at places with relatively normalized conditions flat areas fallow vegetation low or moderate altitude since they are co located with operational meteorological stations operated by météo france calvet et al 2007 albergel et al 2010 in this paper a scaling analysis of eight year long smosmania time series is proposed based on spectral and multifractal analysis tools the objective will be to try to identify whether scaling properties are present and over which scale range scaling will also be investigated in terms of complexity analysis by computing the multiscale entropy mse of the different time series the rest of the paper is structured as follows in section 2 theoretical notions related to spectral scaling multifractal scaling and mse are recalled then the dataset is presented in section 3 spectral analysis results are then presented in section 4 followed by the multifractal analysis of the dataset in section 5 mse analysis of the data is detailed in section 6 then in the subsequent section 7 the expected relationship between mse and multifractal scaling parameters is investigated with the help of numerical simulations and discussed finally i conclude in section 8 2 theoretical background 2 1 spectral scaling scale invariance consists of a family of generic properties exhibited by many geophysical datasets time series 2d 3d fields the concept is closely related to the concept of fractality that has been investigated and popularized by b mandelbrot e g mandelbrot 1983 in the context of stochastic modeling of geophysical processes scaling may be typically detected by investigating the scale dependence of some classical or less classical statistical indicators that often vary as a power law of the time or spatial resolution or lag the exponents of such power laws can therefore characterize a physical process over given range of scales for instance the approaches proposed by kolmogorov 1941 for turbulence or by hurst 1951 in hydrological science have led to a vast scientific literature among various statistical tools that can be used to investigate scaling properties spectral analysis offers a relatively simple and convenient way to study the distribution of energy across a wide range of temporal or spatial frequencies in particular power spectral densities have been used as a tool to investigate the temporal scaling properties of various hydrologic variables such as rainfall fraedrich and larnder 1993 olsson 1995 verrier et al 2011 river flows pandey et al 1998 or soil moisture katul et al 2007 in the spectral sense a time series is scaling if its power spectral density e f is proportional to a power law of the form 1 e f f β where f is the frequency and denotes equality within the limits of slowly varying factors that do not affect the main scaling behavior eq 1 is valid for frequencies f comprised between two limit frequencies defining the limits of the scaling range in which the scaling properties have been found for some processes like rainfall several distinct scaling ranges may be found in the series with possible meteorological interpretation e g fraedrich and larnder 1993 in the case of soil moisture katul et al 2007 used theoretical and empirical arguments to separate two ranges one with a steep spectrum behaving like 1 f 2 spectrum or steeper at high frequencies equivalent to time scales from hours to about one hundred hours and another one with a flatter spectrum at lower frequencies i e larger time scales 2 2 multifractals and cascades multifractality may be viewed as a generalization of classical scaling properties to systems that do not exhibit a unique scaling law per scaling range but a whole set of scaling laws with specific parameters that nonlinearly depend on the order of statistical moments used in analysis schertzer et al 2002 physically it is interesting to investigate different orders of statistical moments since they are representative of various levels of intensities of the process e g moderate intensities vs extreme intensities let us denote λ t τ the resolution factor consisting of the ratio of the series time length t and a given analysis time scale τ comprised between the time lag between two measurements and t in the strict sense a time series φ t is said to be multifractal if its statistical moments of real positive orders q follow power laws of the resolution λ 2 φ λ q λ k q in the previous equation φλ represents a low resolution version of the original times series obtained by direct aggregation over disjoint intervals of length τ t λ other approaches could have been used for defining aggregated products moving averages wavelets but these approaches will not be considered in the following in theoretical terms stochastic processes following eq 2 may be built by iterative multiplicative procedures called multiplicative cascades schertzer et al 2002 these procedures consist in a series of resolution refinements where a given coarse scale series is modulated by random multiplicative factors at each step i e at each resolution refinement resolution refinements can be done by explicitly dividing coarse pixels in smaller subpixels thus causing a discretization of the scales alternatively this construction can be extended to consider a continuum of scales leading to continuous in scale multiplicative cascades schertzer and lovejoy 1997 for the latter random multiplicative factors between two arbitrary scales should follow a log infinitely divisible distribution in the general case described by eq 2 the scaling exponent k q is a convex function of the moment order q however the exact form of k q is subject to additional constraints when taking into account the continuity of the scale space and the related constraints such as the distribution of random multiplicative factors described above based on these considerations some authors proposed cascade models where the function k q can be expressed in closed form in particular two parameter models have been proposed by schertzer and lovejoy 1987 and by she and levêque 1994 in the following the parameterization of the k q function will be investigated with the help of the universal multifractal um model proposed by schertzer and lovejoy 1987 the choice of this model was motivated by several factors such as its mathematical pertinence the model is one of the natural attractors of the class of continuous in scale log infinitely divisible cascades its wide use in geophysical literature and its physically interpretable parameterization in this framework the function k q is parameterized as follows 3 k q c 1 α 1 q α q c 1 is a dispersion parameter comprised in the interval 0 1 for time series for instance c 1 0 would correspond to a homogeneous time series mathematically c 1 is the fractal co dimension associated to the set of points exceeding a specific threshold specifically related to the mean value of the field the parameter α is an index of multifractality and belongs to the 0 2 interval α 0 is the pure monofractal case where k q becomes linear while α 2 corresponds to log normal cascades for which scaling exponents k q vary in a quadratic way with q 2 3 fractionally integrated cascades by construction multiplicative cascades are potentially appropriate for modeling time series whose power spectrum follows a scaling law with a scaling exponent β 1 more precisely the scaling exponent should follow the relationship β 1 k 2 where k 2 is necessarily positive see e g tessier et al 1993 3 b however most geophysical variables are characterized by steeper power spectra β 1 in space and or time domains this is typically the case for variables closely related to turbulence where β is generally close to 5 3 for both wind speed and passive scalars coherently with the predictions of kolmogorov 1941 obukhov 1949 and corrsin 1951 but also for many other variables including topographic fields gagnon et al 2006 anticipating on section 4 the subsequent analyses of smosmania soil moisture will show evidence of power spectra that are closer to 1 f 2 behavior in the latter cases multifractality can be investigated by testing the validity of eq 2 for a derivative of the process called the flux and denoted φ this derivative can be a fractional derivative of the original process it is recalled that fractional derivative and integrations are useful notions of fractional calculus that extend classical definitions of derivatives and integrals to non integer orders loverro 2004 these concepts are useful for modeling processes with various spectral scaling exponents e g integrations can represent effects leading to steeper power spectra schertzer and lovejoy 1991 appendix b2 gagnon et al 2006 in the context of our study the observable variable y e g soil moisture is modeled as the fractional integration of order h of a multifractal flux φ that follow eq 2 combined with um cascades this defines the fractionally integrated flux fif model schertzer and lovejoy 1987 which depends of the three parameters α c 1 and h when h is positive its effect is that of a smoothing parameter on the contrary the case h 0 corresponds to additional roughening effects the case h 0 corresponds to multiplicative cascades described in the previous paragraph i e without any additional smoothing or roughening in practice this parameter h may also be estimated by computing the first order structure function s δt defined by the first order absolute increments of the time series as a function of the time lag δt 4 s δ t def y t δ t y t in the case of a fif model s δt follows a scaling law similar to the one exhibited by fractional brownian motions processes 5 s δ t δ t h where again means equality within the limits of slowly varying factors it should be mentioned that the definitions above can be extended by using other definitions of fluctuations in time series for instance lovejoy and schertzer 2012 have proposed a variant based on the replacement of difference fluctuations used in eq 4 by haar fluctuations interestingly such variants may differ from each other in terms of range of validity of h estimates for instance structure functions estimates based on eq 4 will allow the retrieval of h only when 0 h 1 the use of haar fluctuations can lead to correct estimates on a wider range of h values 1 h 1 in the rest of the paper analyses will nevertheless be based on the more classical structure functions defined by eq 4 this is not a limitation here since h estimates will be found near the middle of the 0 1 interval see section 6 2 the value of h directly affects the distribution of energy across scales namely a higher value of h implies a steeper spectrum for a fif series both values are related by β 1 k 2 2h tessier et al 1993 note that for a monofractal signal such as a fractional brownian motion characterized by a unique scaling exponent h a more or less similar relationship β 1 2h still holds the case of fif processes differs from the fbm case by the multifractal correction term k 2 2 4 multiscale entropy other signatures of scale invariance may be found by using analysis methods more closely related to information theory for instance the notion of information dimension has been defined to characterize the density of points in fractal geometric sets and strange attractors e g hentschel and procaccia 1983 farmer et al 1983 zhang 1991 suggested computing shannon entropies of coarse grained time series as a prerequisite to define a complexity measure of a signal a similar approach has been proposed by costa et al 2002 2003 2005 in the context of the analysis of biological signals their approach called multiscale entropy mse is based on the estimation of the sample entropy sampen richman and moorman 2000 applied on time series that are coarse grained at various time resolutions the sample entropy provides an approximation of the entropy information of any discrete time series y i of length n by computing the conditional probability that two similar sequences of m consecutive points will remain similar when considering extended sequences of m 1 points if u m i denotes a sequence vector of m points starting at index i i e u m i y i y i m 1 and d is a given distance between vectors here taken as the maximal absolute distance between their components then we may define the probability of similarity between two different vectors with respect to a threshold t 6 a m t n pr d u m i u m j t j i then the sample entropy may be computed by estimating the negative logarithm of the conditional probability that two matching vectors of length m will still match while taking into account an additional point within all vectors costa et al 2005 7 s e m t n l n a m 1 t n a m t n due to the negative logarithm the sample entropy tends to increase when unexpected changes in the series tend to occur i e when they are less repetitive and contain more information in the following the parameters m and t will be fixed to values close to those used in the literature i e m 2 and t taken as 15 of the standard deviation of the time series y within this context the multiscale entropy is a procedure consisting at estimating the sample entropy not only from given a data time series y i but also from coarse grained time series y τ i that may be estimated by averaging y over non overlapping windows of length τ this provides an entropy estimate mse τ that depends on the time resolution τ recent results tend to prove that scale invariance has a specific signature on the multiscale entropy as recalled by nogueira 2017 mse τ should scale as a power law with exponents closely related with the spectral slope i e 8 m s e τ τ h this has been verified empirically in the case of colored noise fractional brownian motion fbm time series courtiol et al 2016 analytical arguments based on fbm theory have also been proposed by gao et al 2015 to understand this relationship these authors also confirmed their findings on empirical studies of biological signals nogueira 2017 compared the scaling laws of power spectra and mse approach for both geophysical data near surface wind and synthetic data based on monofractal fbm series in the case of monofractal fbm signals the results were tending to confirm that the mse scaling exponent h should be identical to the scaling exponent h determined by the first order structure function on the contrary the case of multifractal signals has not been explicitly analyzed it may be noticed that nogueira s empirical results on turbulent i e likely multifractal wind processes suggest that a scaling law if the form of eq 8 could still hold for multifractal signals in the following both mse tools and multifractal analysis tools will be applied to the same smosmania surface soil moisture time series this will provide two types of multiscale information that could eventually be compared 3 data sets smosmania consists of a network of about 20 measurement stations distributed across southwestern and southeastern france in grassland and agricultural areas calvet et al 2007 albergel et al 2010 2011 this network has been set up in relation with the much broader hymex campaign http www hymex org which was mainly devoted to the monitoring and modeling of water cycle within the mediterranean region the smosmania probes are located at existing operational météo france weather stations radome network the average distance between two smosmania stations is of the order of 45 km albergel et al 2010 these locations may be viewed at ismn website at the following address www geo tuwien ac at insitu data viewer ismn php all stations are located at places with a fallow vegetation cover the smosmania network provides operational measurements of volumetric soil moisture and soil temperatures at various depths concerning the former soil moisture is estimated on a hourly basis with the help of thetaprobe sensors based on a capacitive technology measurements are available at four references depths ranging from 5 cm to 30 cm all the time series may be downloaded for free at the international soil moisture network ismn page http ismn geo tuwien ac at data access for more information about ismn the reader is also referred to the presentation by dorigo et al 2011 the present study is focused on time series located in southwestern france i e on time series of soil moisture collected at 12 places reported in table 1 since scaling related analyses must generally rely on data that have a small number of missing data time series presenting long missing periods of several dozens of days have been discarded we therefore restricted the study to nine of the twelve initial series discarded series are marked with a star in table 1 all remaining missing data have been replaced by linear interpolation several differences between locations should be noted for instance urgons sabres and créon d armagnac are located closer to the atlantic ocean and therefore are subject to a more oceanic climate they also differ from most of the other stations by a different soil texture with a much larger sand proportion stations that are closer to the mediterranean sea narbonne lézignan corbières typically have a silt loam texture finally stations that are distant from both seas tend also to have the largest clay fraction condom peyrusse grande lahas we can notice that all stations except mouthoumet station are located at low altitudes the present study is focused on the 2007 2014 period that covers most of the available time series from ismn thus all soil moisture measurements comprised between 2007 01 07 6 00 and 2015 01 01 0 00 local time have been selected in order to cover approximately 8 years measurements before 2007 01 07 were only available at a few stations and thus were discarded since all sensors provide measurements on an hourly basis all selected time series have about 70 000 data points which provides the possibility of investigating potential scaling properties over four orders of magnitude in scale finally some data at the beginning of the data series have been removed in order to reduce all the time series to 65 536 measurements points each all the retained series still cover the same dates ending on 2015 01 01 0 00 the purpose of this restriction is to work with 2 n length time series here n 16 which is preferable for technical reasons indeed multifractal analysis requires the estimation of statistical moments at different aggregated resolutions and the use of a dyadic cascade i e 2 i resolutions with integer i is very convenient for this moreover fft based spectral analysis techniques are also faster when applied to series with 2 n data points 4 spectral analysis of smosmania series 4 1 surface soil moisture data 5 cm depth spectral analysis has been carried out on the data set of soil moistures measured at 5 cm depth in order to identify scaling properties and possible scaling ranges since scaling properties generally take the form of a power law spectrum i e e f f β the results are presented in logarithmic coordinates in such a graph scaling laws should indeed appear as linear however this representation may have less desirable counterparts when analyzing long time series in particular this usually results in a much denser sampling of frequencies near the high frequencies and often in a less readable graphic representation to avoid these problems an average of the spectra over equally spaced logarithmic bins of length 0 02 here was performed the power spectra of the nine selected series are shown on fig 1 the figure is presented in logarithmic coordinates in order to make it more readable the spectra are translated upwards from one station to the next one the spectrum of the condom series is the only one that has not been vertically translated time scale tick labels are displayed on the horizontal axis i e high frequencies are still on the right of the figure but the horizontal graduations specify the time scale equivalent to this frequency i e τ 1 f the main feature exhibited by the spectra on fig 1 is the presence of scaling laws over a large scale range covering a large range of scales all spectra seem nevertheless slightly steeper at the high frequencies than at low frequencies a more oscillatory behavior at low frequencies e g time scales larger than several thousands of days may be noticed this feature is probably related to the coarser sampling of frequencies when analyzing large scale structures over time series that is not much longer than these structures it may also be noticed that all spectra appear roughly parallel to each other which suggests that all spectra should have very similar scaling laws with exponents β that are not expected to vary much this may be checked by calculating these scaling exponents while the spectra look scaling over three orders of magnitude at first glance several additional factors must be taken into account to determine the scale range considered in the fits i the low frequency part of the spectrum has a poorer sampling and is less robustly estimated ii the application of a segmentation algorithm d errico 2017 has been used to identify possible transitions between ranges with different spectral exponents β but failed to notice very significant transitions iii however some spectral estimations for instance at lahas station exhibit a very local drop at time scales of the order of 1000 3000 h iv the retained fit range must permit linear regressions with a good coefficient of determination for example r2 0 98 taking these elements into account and also anticipating on sect 5 where a narrower scaling range will be found the estimation of scaling exponents has been limited to the range of scales 1000 h 1 h the linear regressions are shown on fig 1 and the scaling coefficients β are reported in table 2 for the nine soil moisture time series collected at depth 5 cm it may be noticed that this choice permits one to obtain a very good coefficient of determination for each of the nine spectra presented all spectral slopes β are found within or very close to the range 1 9 2 and thus are very similar to each other when considering that each exponent is given with an uncertainty of 0 04 this confirms the apparent parallelism of the spectra on the figure 4 2 other depths by repeating the above procedure for the three other depths similar results were obtained with scaling holding to a good approximation for scales smaller than 1000 h all error bars δβ were found smaller than 0 04 for a linear fit within this range for all time series the surface 5 cm data spectrum remains above the other spectra meaning that the surface series contains more energy in the signal processing sense than the other ones physically this is also coherent with the greater variability amplitude of soil moisture at the surface due to the meteorological forcing however significant differences have been found between stations with typical cases illustrated on figs 2a and 2b at peyrusse grande station fig 2a the spectra are close to each other and the spectral slopes do not change considerably with depth here from 1 93 to 2 08 while at montaut the spectra are clearly distinct with different spectral slopes ranging from 1 97 to 2 35 it may be noted that the spectra displayed on figs 2 do not include any vertical shifts between spectra the spectral slopes β estimated for all stations at all considered depths are summarized on fig 3 the estimates of β are represented on the vertical axis while the stations names are distributed on the abscissa axis the stations have been sorted from the most western position to the most eastern position more precisely the abscissa axis refers to the three first letters of the names of the stations error bars are omitted but are of the order of 0 03 or 0 04 for all estimates as illustrated on figs 2 and 3 it seems that the spectral slope tends to increase as we consider deeper layers however β estimates become more variable across stations as the depth increases this could possibly be related to the differences in subsurface processes and soil texture the latter being heterogeneous across the stations while similar studies in the region of interest do not seem to be reported in the literature several published studies may help to put our findings in perspective in the space domain lower scaling exponents are generally reported for instance pelletier et al 1997 found a value of β 1 8 while a value closer to 1 2 might be deduced from the findings presented by kim and barros 2002a based on remote sensing data more recently neuhauser et al 2018 reported a spectral exponent closer to 1 0 at spatial scales 40 km based on smos data in the time domain higher estimates of β have been reported by katul et al 2007 based on measurements of soil moisture in a more subtropical eastern us region durham nc these authors considered an eight year long time series of integrated 0 30 cm soil moisture they found a steep scaling β 2 75 in the scale range 90 h 1 h and a much flatter spectrum at larger scales interestingly they also proposed a simplified physical model to show that soil moisture time series may behave as a time integration of precipitation time series at relatively small time scales at least in first approximation since power spectra of precipitation data are either flat or decrease in a scaling way i e f a where a 0 cf fraedrich and larnder 1993 the expected spectrum of soil moisture could be of the form f 2 a which was verified in their case the results obtained by katul et al 2007 therefore suggest that it is not surprising that soil moisture has a steeper scaling in the time domain than in the space domain due to this time integration effect however in the present study estimates of β are found closer to 2 0 i e a red noise like scaling in this sense our results may differ from those of katul et al 2007 since the model proposed by the latter authors does not seem compatible in practice with values of β smaller than 2 5 multifractal analysis 5 1 surface soil moisture data 5 cm depth results of the previous section show that soil moisture power spectra estimated above are rather steep similar to a f 2 red noise this usually means that the series cannot be directly described by a multifractal multiplicative cascade which requires β 1 however as explained in section 2 3 it is possible to check whether a multifractal cascade structure may describe some derivative or integration of the process fractionally integrated stochastic processes e g fractional brownian motions fractionally integrated flux are models that may be appropriate for scaling processes with steeper spectral slopes therefore a possible way to investigate multifractality within the series is to consider a flux estimated from a derivative of the time series and to test whether the moments of this flux follow a multifractal law analogous to that described in section 2 2 eq 2 in the following the fluxes φ are estimated at 1 h resolution by taking the absolute value of the finite difference derivative of the 5 cm moisture series following the process originally described by lavallée et al 1991 1993 for each series the flux is aggregated over non overlapping intervals of length τ 2 i τ 0 using a dyadic cascade approach i e at each step the resolution ratio λ t τ is divided by a factor two and the data are aggregated on successive couples of points this leads to an ensemble of aggregated fluxes series φ λ t i indexed by the resolution λ 2 j for j 0 1 16 each aggregated series thus containing λ data points then the empirical moments are used as an estimate of the unknown statistical moments for each series and for each chosen moment order q the aggregated fluxes are elevated to power q and averaged over the whole series length the computation is done for all averaging resolutions λ 2 j j 0 1 16 and for various orders q comprised between 0 and 2 5 with a spacing of 0 1 between two successive orders this provides the empirical moments m λ q that approximate the statistical moments φ λ q the statistical average being replaced by the empirical average this procedure corresponds to the trace moment approach presented by tessier et al 1993 the empirical moments are represented in logarithmic coordinates as a function of the resolution λ the process is repeated for each series the result is displayed in a larger figure for the case of peyrusse grande data and in a composite figure for other stations see figs 4 and 5 fig 4 may be read as follows first each curve is associated to one specific moment order the higher moment orders q 1 are associated with the upper increasing curves on the figure while the slightly decreasing curves are associated to orders q such that 0 q 1 similarly to fig 1 finer resolutions are located on the right of fig 4 at the coarsest time scales typically 1000 h the curves are undistinguishable meaning that no significant multiscaling may be found however moments are much more variable towards finer resolutions log log linear behavior is found to a good approximation within the range of resolutions comprised between 128 h and 1 h green fit lines since the figure is in logarithmic coordinates each regression is representative of eq 2 for a fixed order of moment q and its slope corresponds to the scaling exponent k q comparable figures are found for the eight others time series with very similar scaling ranges fig 5 thus and in order to facilitate the comparison between the different series it has been chosen to perform the regression over the same scaling range 128 h 1 h it can be noted that this range is smaller than the one observed on power spectra presented in the previous section based on fig 4 we also remark that all linear regressions are convergent towards a point while being extrapolated towards coarser resolutions the abscissa of this point may correspond to the external scale lovejoy et al 2008 at which the multifractal cascade is initiated for the nine time series the exact position of the external scale may vary a bit but is comprised in the range 200 600 h for most of the time series the external scale would be close to 200 300 h but for some of them higher values seem obtainable e g urgons narbonne or créon d armagnac for the latter station the external scale seems indeed closer to 600 h due to the uncertainty of this estimate it is not possible to clearly tell if the latter difference is really significant and related to meteorological forcing nevertheless the position of the external scale is plausibly related to the weather macroweather transition scale that has been evidenced for numerous atmospheric fields lovejoy et al 2013 de lima and lovejoy 2015 the transition between the weather and macroweather regimes occurs at the lifetime of planetary meteorological structures i e at time scales of the order of a couple of weeks for meteorological variables the transition separates scaling regime respectively characterized by a small intermittency i e large scale macroweather and a stronger multifractal intermittency at smaller scales i e weather regime as explained above the slopes of the green lines on fig 4 provide the estimates of the moment scaling function k q for the orders q that have been used in previous computations the graph of the estimated k q function at peyrusse grande station is provided on fig 6 the round dots correspond to the empirical estimates we may notice that the values of k q are also given for higher moment orders up to 3 0 that have not been represented on fig 4 for readability purposes see fig 7 as expected the k q estimates are distributed along a convex curve the latter may then be fitted by the two parameter universal form recalled in section 3 the green curve is obtained by nonlinear optimization on the interval defined by q 0 2 5 more precisely the nelder mead method is used to find the couple of parameters that minimizes the quadratic distance between fixed k q estimates and the theoretical values predicted by eq 3 in this case the universal parameters estimates for peyrusse grande station are c 1 0 28 and α 1 51 for other stations more or less similar graphs may be obtained but some variability still exists in both estimates of α and c 1 figs 9 all the different k q function estimates were fitted within the interval 0 2 5 see fig 5 the obtained parameters are reported in table 3 as shown on table 3 some variability may be found within parameter estimates nevertheless c 1 remains always close to 0 25 0 3 and the observed variability does not seem related with the positions of the stations and or soil texture such estimates are significantly larger than the values closer to 0 1 or even less reported for other geophysical fields e g lovejoy and schertzer 2013 however some studies report large 0 3 estimates in the case of rainfall e g lovejoy et al 2008a at least at time scales 1 h verrier et al 2011 thus the relatively high value of c 1 that has been observed in this study for soil moisture could be a consequence of the large intermittency of the rainfall process concerning the index of multifractality α most estimates are found within the range 1 6 1 8 in this aspect the stations of créon d armagnac and urgons seem to differ significantly from the others with much lower α estimates closer to 1 3 1 4 interestingly these stations are relatively close to each other about 55 km and both located in the french department of landes at the most western part of the region covered by smosmania i e closer to the atlantic ocean and with significantly more sandy soil texture this could suggest a possible impact of these features on α however the parameter α characterizes the degree of nonlinearity of the k q curve and is known to be more difficult to estimate than c 1 this could also explain part of the observed difference despite the relative homogeneity of α estimates for the other stations 5 2 other depths by repeating the previous analysis to other depths a similar multifractal scaling was found in the range 128 h 1 h for all stations this is illustrated on fig 8 where moments of peyrusse grande 10 20 30 cm data follow a scaling law that could be extrapolated to external scales of the order of several hundreds of hours from the slopes of the green lines scaling exponents k q may be computed and then plotted on fig 8 bottom right on this figure each color is associated to one depth note that 5 cm depth estimates are also plotted on the same graph while the different curves globally follow the same shape they differ significantly from each other for low and high moment orders in this case high order moments are higher for 10 cm depth data than for other data while 20 cm depth data differ from the others for low moment orders these differences affect both estimates of multifractal parameters which can be checked by comparing the couples α c 1 at depths 5 cm and 20 cm indeed the latter are respectively equal to 1 51 0 28 and 0 79 0 40 part of the change may be explained by the partial linearization of the k q curve as the depth increases the limit case of linearity can theoretically be attained at α 0 i e monofractality case for all time series the parameters α and c 1 have been estimated at the different depths the results are summarized on figs 9a and 9b where estimates are given as a function of the station once again stations are sorted from the most western to the most eastern and are identified by their first three letters as deeper data are considered smaller values of α and larger values of c 1 are systematically obtained with a globally larger variability from one station to one another similar to fig 8 this change seems to be related to a less pronounced convexity of the k q curves as depth increases we may conclude that soil moisture at these depths still follows multifractal properties but with different k q scaling exponents especially at low and high order moments this is illustrated by a change in multifractal parameter estimates that is noticeable when compared to the relative homogeneity of the parameters for 5 cm depth data across different stations a possible explanation could reside in the impact of soil texture on soil moisture at the deeper layers for instance subsurface processes could cause a change of the scaling of some moment orders this change propagating to the multifractal parameters 6 multiscale entropy properties 6 1 mse analysis the nine surface 5 cm depth soil moisture time series are now analyzed within the mse framework for each series sample entropy is estimated at various coarse resolution time series obtained by the means of averages performed over non overlapping intervals of various durations τ chosen between 1 h i e the finest resolution available and 690 h we cannot degrade the time series to coarser resolutions since the sample entropy calculation can only be performed over coarse time series containing at least 100 points nogueira 2017 the estimated entropies are represented in logarithmic coordinates on fig 10 for the different time series once again mse curves are regularly shifted upwards to make the figure more readable mse curves are steeper at lower time scales and a bit flatter at larger scales the segmentation tool proposed by d errico 2017 was used to estimate the position of the transition between the two behaviors with a result close to 30 h due to the better sampling of the mse on the right of the figure only time scales within the range 650 h 30 h have been considered for fitting the exponents h are determined by linear regressions over this interval of time scales the values of h estimates and error bars may be found in table 4 estimates are comprised between 0 31 and 0 66 for a mean value of h 0 43 for all time series all the regressions have a very good coefficient of determination except in the case of the mouthoumet station despite the narrower scale range the results are partially coherent with the findings previously obtained by spectral analysis with often similar scaling exponents across stations see table 2 once again all time series have rather similar scaling properties which could be related to the sampling strategies all sensors being located in grassland on flat areas nevertheless it could be noted that the dispersion of the values of h is greater than the dispersion of spectral slopes this dispersion is nevertheless probably not representative of a better sensitivity of mse to local differences indeed h is estimated over a significantly narrower scale range than β which could lead to more dispersion in the estimates furthermore the soil moisture series collected at 10 cm 20 cm and 30 cm depths have been analyzed in a similar way the scaling exponents h obtained by fitting the mse curves are displayed on fig 11 all these exponents have been obtained by linear fits on the log log graph of mse τ for time scales in the range 30 h 650 h all linear regressions had an r2 0 94 except in the case of peyrusse grande where the fits are poorer fig 11 also confirms that the scaling exponents may depend on depth coherently with what was reported on fig 3 the scaling seems in general a bit steeper at greater depths the results of this section confirm that the scaling properties of soil moisture may be retrieved not only in terms of spectra and moments but also in terms of information content this was expectable since the signal information occurrence of unexpected structures is of course strongly constrained by the probability distribution of the signal at various resolutions nevertheless this result shows that multiscale entropy scaling can be found in non biological natural signals consistently with the findings by nogueira 2017 additionally our results show that mse scaling may be found in natural signals that follow multifractal statistics this could extend the findings of the literature that mainly focuses on monofractal brownian processes or natural processes assimilated to the former ones e g gao et al 2015 complementarily we may investigate which degree of redundancy may exist between the mse approach and the structure function approach i e to check if they estimate the same scaling properties or not indeed first order structure functions can be used to estimate the third parameter h of the fif model cf section 2 3 in the case of our dataset is h indeed close to the mse scaling parameter obtained above 6 2 comparison with first order structure functions in order to investigate this issue the first order structure functions defined by eq 4 have been estimated based on the surface soil moisture data from the nine stations the structure functions are displayed on fig 12 where they are regularly shifted in the vertical direction to improve readability it should be noted that on fig 12 the large time increments are on the right of the figure very small and very large time increments are not taken into account as they might be affected by sampling limitations on the middle of the fig 12 a scaling regime may be identified for 30 h δ t 1000 h this regime is representative of a scaling behavior of the form given by eq 5 in order to make the comparison with sect 6 1 easier the linear fit range was restricted to 30 h δ t 650 h good scaling results are obtained with an very small error bar on the slope estimate δ h 0 01 or smaller the scaling exponent does not vary much from one series to one another the mean value of h being equal to h 0 41 see values in table 5 we may now compare the estimates of h and h obtained for the different series fig 13 displays h as a function of h for the different time series for most stations estimates of h and h are very similar despite some differences larger than the regressions error bars however significant differences were found for two stations narbonne and savenès where the h estimates are much larger than their structure function counterparts it remains unclear if this is due to greater uncertainties in the estimates obtained by the mse approach and or an ability of the latter method to catch specific features at some stations this issue could be investigated in future studies since mse and structure function approaches may perform differently in the estimation of hurst like scaling parameters while the detailed comparison of the two methods still requires additional theoretical work we can already notice that each method has qualitatively identifiable practical advantages and drawbacks namely classical structure functions are more easy to use to analyze a large scale range but do not have direct interpretation in terms of signal information additionally they cannot estimate negative scaling exponents unless modified variants based on wavelets are used e g lovejoy and schertzer 2012 meanwhile mse algorithms are appropriate for information and complexity estimation but they are applicable over a relatively limited scale range due to computational constraints nogueira 2017 the mse framework also provides equations that seem more difficult to relate analytically to equations such as those governing the statistics of multifractal cascades for non unity orders of statistics eq 2 it could be interesting to try to investigate possible links with other theoretical notions such as the information dimension which contains both scaling and shannon entropy characterization the latter point is left as a perspective in this work however a better understanding of the possible relationship between multifractal scaling and mse scaling can already be achieved with the help of numerical tests this is the subject of the next section 7 expected relationship between h and multifractal parameters 7 1 numerical experiments the analysis presented in section 6 was aimed to test if h and h estimates could have close values in the empirical case of the study while the hypothesis h h has been tested numerically by nogueira 2017 in the case of fractional brownian motion processes where the structure function h is the unique scaling parameter the extension to the case of multifractal processes has not yet been investigated by theoretical or numerical approaches at least to the author s knowledge multifractal processes differ from fractional brownian motions by the existence of more nonlinear properties that are characterized by the parameters c 1 and α defined above a priori there is no theoretical reason to rule out a possible effect of c 1 and α on the mse scaling parameter therefore we might look for a possible functional relationship of the form h f h c 1 α while it is still unknown if this function f can be defined in closed form numerical tests can be performed to check if there is a systematic dependency of h on the three multifractal parameters in the following numerical tests are presented based on the multifractal simulation techniques of fif processes described by pecknold et al 1993 schertzer et al 2002 macor 2007 verrier et al 2011 the main steps are the following i generation of a unit extremal lévy stable noise with an asymmetry parameter equal to 1 and a stability parameter α identical to the multifractal α defined above ii multiplication by a normalizing multiplicative constant σ c 1 α 1 1 α iii convolution by a kernel proportional to t d α where d is the embedding space dimension i e d 1 for time series iv exponentiation v fractional integration of order h step i above is performed by applying the procedure described by chambers et al 1976 to a couple of independent simple random variables at each data point it is worth noting the procedure allows to store numerical realizations of these two simple input variables u and e with uniform and exponential distributions respectively cf pecknold et al 1993 3 and then to repeat the five step procedure with different sets of parameters h c 1 α therefore it is very easy to test different sets of parameters on the same probabilistic events i e numerical realizations numerical tests have been implemented in the following way twenty independent realizations of couples of u and e time series are first generated in order to build the experiment on twenty different probabilistic events then the procedure of simulation is applied for various sets of multifractal parameters h c 1 α in other words 20 synthetic multifractal time series are obtained for each set of parameters but the 20 random realizations used to generate the series are the same for all sets since synthetic multifractal time series can have numerical discrepancies at the highest frequencies it has been chosen to perform all numerical simulations based on time series of 218 points and then to average each of them over a series of disjoint intervals of 16 points this procedure provides 20 time series of 214 16384 points for each set of multifractal parameters in a second step mse analysis is applied to each individual time series and then the mse τ function is averaged over the 20 individual realizations available for each set of multifractal parameters the h exponent is then estimated from the averaged mse τ by performing a linear regression in log log coordinates over the whole range of available scales i e from 1 to 163 data points since sample entropy needs 100 data points to be computed 7 2 results examples of mses estimated from individual series are presented in log log coordinates on figs 14 and 15 fig 14 shows the mse τ obtained for a single random realization with α 2 and c1 0 05 the blue curve is obtained when h 0 and the green curve when h has been fixed to 0 4 it may be noticed that the effect of the fractional integration i e transition from the blue to the green curve changes both the height and the slope of the mse τ function in this individual case the hypothesis h h seems to hold when 0 4 but a moderate scaling is found in the h 0 fig 15 illustrate the case where the parameter c 1 changes while α 2 and h 0 based on a different individual realization the increase of c 1 leads to a drastic decrease of the entropy and seems also to increase the slope h of the mse curve these conclusions are globally confirmed when considering the h estimates obtained from the averaged mses figs 16 and 17 fig 16 shows the h estimate as a function of h with variable c 1 while α is fixed to 2 on the figure each curve corresponds to one value of c 1 comprised between 0 05 continuous blue curve and 0 55 dashed green curve with a spacing of 0 10 h is sampled in the range 0 0 7 with a spacing of 0 10 the first bisectrix is represented as a dashed black line for all curves h increases with h but does not follow the bisectrix except when c 1 is very small when h 0 5 all curves tends to get relatively close to each other meaning that when h is sufficiently high the influence of c 1 on h is relatively small on the contrary when h 0 4 the influence can become quite large with a systematic increase of h with c 1 confirming the observation of fig 15 in the case of a non integrated multiplicative cascade h 0 this can lead to an h estimate varying within the range 0 1 0 3 depending on the c 1 value regression error bars on h estimated from the average mse τ functions are not represented because they are very small inferior to 0 01 the possible influence of the α parameter coupled with h is presented on fig 17 where h is represented as a function of h with one curve for one value of α c 1 being fixed to 0 25 the parameter α has been chosen in the interval 1 5 2 with a spacing of 0 1 i e values usually encountered in geophysics and also reported in this study again h is an increasing function of h for all curves which also remain above the first bisectrix however h is a decreasing function of α such that the relationship between h and h tends to become closer to the first bisectrix when α 2 we may notice that the dependency of h on α is very limited for high values of α α 1 7 but becomes more pronounced for smaller values finally we may again notice that for high values of h all curves become close to the first bisectrix and increasingly undistinguishable from each other e g h 0 7 these numerical results show that the relationship between multifractal parameters and the mse scaling properties is more complex than originally anticipated and that a dependency on the three multifractal parameters should be expected in the general case however we may distinguish two basic cases for relatively high values of h 0 4 0 5 the relationship h h might still provide a useful work assumption since our results suggest that the fractional integration washes out the possible effects of the multifractal parameters α and c 1 in this case the mse scaling properties of a multifractal process are expectedly close to those of a fractional brownian motion which have been investigated by nogueira 2017 for lower values of h and in particular in the case of a non integrated multiplicative cascade h 0 the effect of α and c 1 is visible and results in a mse scaling exponent that is higher than h i e h h g h c 1 α the positive offset modeled by the function g is higher when c 1 increases or when α becomes significantly smaller than 2 interestingly the offset becomes very small when c 1 takes small values which illustrates that multifractal intermittency plays an important role in the difference h h while more exhaustive numerical tests and theoretical work remain to be done to quantify and understand the relationships between multifractal parameters and observed mse scaling laws some qualitative arguments may help to interpret the present observations first the effect of the fractional integration included in the fif model is similar to a scaling low pass filter that significantly attenuates the variability at the smallest scales it is therefore expectable that a fractionally integrated signal h 0 possesses more entropy at coarse resolutions than at fine resolutions this is obvious on fig 14 where we see that the effect of h is to strongly reduce entropy estimates at small scales i e on the left part of fig 14 moreover as already noted on fig 15 high c 1 parameter values also contribute to strongly reduce entropy this could seem a bit paradoxical since c 1 is known as an intermittency heterogeneity parameter however multifractal processes with high c 1 correspond to processes that exhibit slow variations most of the time while most of the variance is due to very strong and sparse peaks e g fig 10 in pecknold et al 1993 in this case sample entropies tend to decrease since repetitive patterns are or seem more frequent due to the existence of wide areas with small variations this effect is even more pronounced due to the increased standard deviation of the process when c 1 is large due to the contribution of extreme peaks indeed since the sample entropy builds its similarity criterion by using the standard deviation of the series see eq 6 it classifies events as similar more easily when large standard deviation and c 1 are involved we can notice that the decrease of entropy is expectably stronger at small scales where peaks are both very intense and cover a very small fraction of the time 7 3 application to smosmania empirical parameters finally we may come back to the results of section 6 since we have just demonstrated that the initial hypothesis h h may be too simplistic for multifractal processes in some situations by reporting the parameters h c 1 α estimated in sections 5 and 6 2 to the graph presented on fig 17 we obtain an expected parameter h between 0 4 and 0 5 however the empirical h estimates found in section 6 1 0 40 are less coherent with this expected parameter h 0 47 0 48 for multifractal parameters α 1 7 c1 0 25 h 0 40 than the one resulting from the naive h h hypothesis beyond possible estimation uncertainties a plausible explanation for this observation is the fact that the multifractal parameters c 1 and α are expected to be valid in the range of scales 128 h 1 h while h and h are valid in the range 650 h 30 h at scales 128 h i e beginning of the macroweather regime the flux moments have much slower variation with scale figs 4 and 5 which is equivalent to a strong decrease of the c 1 parameter this could explain why the empirical estimates of h are close to the structure function exponents since it is what is expected for low values of c 1 see fig 16 continuous blue curve especially when h is still relatively large 0 4 in this case 8 conclusions like other geophysical processes soil moisture is strongly variable over a rather wide range of time and space scales some previous literature papers advocated the existence of scaling and fractal properties over various ranges of scales in this study 8 year time series of surface soil moisture have been analyzed with the help of various multiscale analysis tools in order to investigate the existence of scaling laws the twelve sensors are located in the same area of about 300 200 km2 in southwestern france and the average distance between stations is of the order of a few dozens of kilometers for nine of these stations power spectra of surface soil moisture showed a red noise like 1 f 2 scaling over a large scale range of time scales 1 h τ 1000 h without any strong break in the scaling the scaling exponents are rather homogeneous at the surface layer and exhibit some variability at deeper horizons where spectra tend to become steeper in a second step multifractal analysis has been applied in order to identify the possible existence of scaling properties for non quadratic moment orders multifractality has also been observed in the range of scales comprised between 1 h and 128 h the moment scaling functions have been successfully fitted with the two parameter functional form predicted by the universal multifractal model at the surface 5 cm depth layer the obtained parameters showed a slightly greater dispersion than that of spectral slopes with c 1 0 2 0 3 and α 1 3 1 8 for surface data 5 cm depths however a greater dispersion has been found for data collected at deeper horizons 10 30 cm on average the depth affects the multifractality parameters more strongly than spectral slopes at 30 cm depth c1 is closer to 0 4 0 5 while α often becomes smaller than 1 this shift and this variability could be related to the soil composition while surface parameters are likely to be more representative of the influence of the meteorological forcing multiscale entropy has also been applied as a complementary scaling analysis tool devoted to the multiscale analysis of information content present in the series this approach had been originally developed in biology medicine research literature and has a good potential for analyzing time series in other scientific fields as noticed by nogueira 2017 a systematic relationship exists between mse scaling and spectral first order structure function scaling in the case of synthetic monofractal data and seems to hold for scaling geophysical observations mse analysis has been performed over the twelve smosmania surface time series showing the existence of scaling properties for the sample entropies estimated at various aggregation resolutions 30 650 h due to the strong constraints on sample entropy estimation the validity of mse scaling at larger scales could not be investigated this is a basic methodological limitation of the mse approach that is compensated by other advantages contrary to the usual structure function approach mse could be appropriate to analyze processes with negative hurst scaling exponents i e with h 0 or β 1 and has a rather direct interpretation in terms of information theory more generally our numerical results also demonstrated that the mse scaling properties are not limited to fbm like monofractals investigated by previous authors gao et al 2015 nogueira 2017 but should hold for synthetic and natural signals characterized by multifractal properties numerical tests were used to investigate the existence of a systematic relationship between the mse scaling parameter h and the three multifractal parameters h c 1 and α it has been observed that the relationship h f h c 1 α is more complex than in the monofractal case where h h and that in some cases the intermittency parameter c 1 and the multifractality parameter α can affect significantly mse scaling properties in other cases i e large h or low intermittency the approximation h h could be acceptable finally more theoretical work remains to be done to understand the relationships between mse scaling and fractal multifractal scaling properties

5591,soil moisture processes exhibit a strong variability in space and time due to the variability of the meteorological forcing and the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties this study aims at providing a statistical description of soil moisture variability by analyzing data from nine in situ stations located over an west east gradient in southwestern france smosmania stations distributed over an area of about 300 200 km for each station four time series of soil moisture observed at four different depths ranging from 5 cm to 30 cm are analyzed first possible scaling properties are investigated within the fourier domain with the help of spectral analysis tools red noise like 1 f 2 scaling properties could be noticed over a fairly wide scale range 1000 h 1 h with relatively homogeneous scaling parameters for 5 cm depth soil moistures regardless of the station these properties are confirmed at other depths with slightly steeper spectra and more heterogeneity across stations in a second step multifractal analysis has been carried out on the same data multifractal scaling is observed over a narrower scaling range 128 h 1 h moment scaling functions can be parameterized within the framework of universal multifractals typical parameters are c 1 0 25 and α 1 6 1 8 for surface data while both parameters are subject to strong changes c 1 increases and α decreases as the depth increases in a third step multiscale entropy mse analysis has been applied in order to analyze the dataset from an information theory point of view and to infer whether multifractal properties could have a signature on mse estimates the mse function has been found to follow a power law of the aggregation time with a scaling exponent close to 0 3 0 4 for surface data these exponents were generally close to the hurst exponent h estimated by first order structure functions while it is already known that mse should follow scaling properties in the case of monofractal signals the results suggest that the latter property holds for natural multifractal processes finally complementary numerical tests based on synthetic multifractal time series are done in order to assess the relationship between the mse scaling exponent h and multifractal parameters c 1 α and h a dependency on the three multifractal parameters has been observed yet in practice the approximation h h seems somewhat acceptable for processes with relatively large hurst exponents and or low multifractal intermittency c 1 on a more broad perspective the existence of relationships between multifractal scaling and mse properties could help to refine the physical interpretation of observed scaling properties in many geophysical processes keywords soil moisture multifractals time series analysis multiscale entropy scaling 1 introduction soil moisture is a key variable in hydrology meteorology and biosphere science it is the result of a strongly heterogeneous atmospheric forcing i e rainfall and of the interaction of other processes like evaporation transpiration or infiltration consequently soil moisture is subject to strong and possibly quick variations and is heterogeneous in space and time this results in potential difficulties in sampling strategies since sensors have their own limitations in terms of observable scales vereecken et al 2014 for instance operating passive l band radiometers like those of smos kerr et al 2010 2016 and smap entekhabi et al 2010 missions can provide continental daily coverage of soil moisture variability but their spatial resolution is limited to pixels of about 50 50 km2 airborne missions can provide more details about spatial variability but data are available over limited areas and a very limited amount of time i e when the mission is operated conversely in situ sensors have the ability to give a very local estimate of soil moisture over small hourly or sub hourly time steps but their observations are difficult to upscale or to extrapolate to other locations this resolution mismatch may be somewhat reduced by applying downscaling methods to satellite data e g merlin et al 2008 2012 but the problem is still not fully solved since downscaled products have still coarse kilometric resolutions in comparison to the small spatial domain seen by an in situ sensor an alternative approach is to try to characterize the spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture with intrinsically multiscale statistical formalisms the idea behind such formalisms relies on the fact that a complex heterogeneous signal or random process may hide remarkable symmetries in this context we may look for statistical estimators that could be related to the process resolution by simple analytical laws such scaling properties are accurately followed by various geophysical variables lovejoy et al 2008a lovejoy and schertzer 2006 2010 gagnon et al 2006 tessier et al 1993 in many cases these properties are even related to the concepts of scale invariance and fractality some of these concepts will be defined in section 2 in geophysics the characterization of scaling laws may be useful for several kinds of applications such as i comparing the variability of measurements collected by sensors operating at different resolutions ii evaluating a numerical model such as a general circulation model or a land surface model that should be able to reproduce some scaling features of the observations e g lovejoy et al 2013 verrier et al 2014 iii constraining statistical downscaling methods gires et al 2012 to respect the observed scaling laws in the context of soil moisture existing studies already evidenced the existence of fractal like scaling in space and in time in particular remote sensing data have been used by several authors in order to investigate fractal properties across space scales kim and barros 2002a 2002b analyzed airborne soil moisture estimates from the southern great plains 1997 experiment and proposed a monofractal approach for downscaling soil moisture from 10 km to 1 km resolution multifractal variants of the latter approach have been proposed later by mascaro et al mascaro and vivoni 2010 2012 mascaro et al 2010 2011 based on partly similar airborne remote sensing data sets several analyses have also been performed on satellite images for instance lovejoy et al 2008b have shown that both modis radiances and surface soil moisture index exhibit scaling and multifractal properties based on a case study over central spain in the time domain katul et al 2007 also identified the existence of spectral scaling properties based on relatively long term in situ acquisitions 8 years of hourly data at one specific station the authors also proposed a physical approach to justify the existence of these properties especially taking into account the integrative nature of soil water content with respect to its meteorological forcing in the following scaling analysis tools are applied to surface soil moisture time series collected by a network of probes smosmania overall the smosmania network consists of about 20 stations located in south western and south eastern france capacitive measurements of hourly soil moisture have been done continuously during several years at stations belonging to the météo france operational observation network this makes these measurements suitable for scaling analyses due to the wide range of time scales covered by the data moreover the network design is based on a compromise between a large spatial coverage and a moderate distance between probes finally all probes are located at places with relatively normalized conditions flat areas fallow vegetation low or moderate altitude since they are co located with operational meteorological stations operated by météo france calvet et al 2007 albergel et al 2010 in this paper a scaling analysis of eight year long smosmania time series is proposed based on spectral and multifractal analysis tools the objective will be to try to identify whether scaling properties are present and over which scale range scaling will also be investigated in terms of complexity analysis by computing the multiscale entropy mse of the different time series the rest of the paper is structured as follows in section 2 theoretical notions related to spectral scaling multifractal scaling and mse are recalled then the dataset is presented in section 3 spectral analysis results are then presented in section 4 followed by the multifractal analysis of the dataset in section 5 mse analysis of the data is detailed in section 6 then in the subsequent section 7 the expected relationship between mse and multifractal scaling parameters is investigated with the help of numerical simulations and discussed finally i conclude in section 8 2 theoretical background 2 1 spectral scaling scale invariance consists of a family of generic properties exhibited by many geophysical datasets time series 2d 3d fields the concept is closely related to the concept of fractality that has been investigated and popularized by b mandelbrot e g mandelbrot 1983 in the context of stochastic modeling of geophysical processes scaling may be typically detected by investigating the scale dependence of some classical or less classical statistical indicators that often vary as a power law of the time or spatial resolution or lag the exponents of such power laws can therefore characterize a physical process over given range of scales for instance the approaches proposed by kolmogorov 1941 for turbulence or by hurst 1951 in hydrological science have led to a vast scientific literature among various statistical tools that can be used to investigate scaling properties spectral analysis offers a relatively simple and convenient way to study the distribution of energy across a wide range of temporal or spatial frequencies in particular power spectral densities have been used as a tool to investigate the temporal scaling properties of various hydrologic variables such as rainfall fraedrich and larnder 1993 olsson 1995 verrier et al 2011 river flows pandey et al 1998 or soil moisture katul et al 2007 in the spectral sense a time series is scaling if its power spectral density e f is proportional to a power law of the form 1 e f f β where f is the frequency and denotes equality within the limits of slowly varying factors that do not affect the main scaling behavior eq 1 is valid for frequencies f comprised between two limit frequencies defining the limits of the scaling range in which the scaling properties have been found for some processes like rainfall several distinct scaling ranges may be found in the series with possible meteorological interpretation e g fraedrich and larnder 1993 in the case of soil moisture katul et al 2007 used theoretical and empirical arguments to separate two ranges one with a steep spectrum behaving like 1 f 2 spectrum or steeper at high frequencies equivalent to time scales from hours to about one hundred hours and another one with a flatter spectrum at lower frequencies i e larger time scales 2 2 multifractals and cascades multifractality may be viewed as a generalization of classical scaling properties to systems that do not exhibit a unique scaling law per scaling range but a whole set of scaling laws with specific parameters that nonlinearly depend on the order of statistical moments used in analysis schertzer et al 2002 physically it is interesting to investigate different orders of statistical moments since they are representative of various levels of intensities of the process e g moderate intensities vs extreme intensities let us denote λ t τ the resolution factor consisting of the ratio of the series time length t and a given analysis time scale τ comprised between the time lag between two measurements and t in the strict sense a time series φ t is said to be multifractal if its statistical moments of real positive orders q follow power laws of the resolution λ 2 φ λ q λ k q in the previous equation φλ represents a low resolution version of the original times series obtained by direct aggregation over disjoint intervals of length τ t λ other approaches could have been used for defining aggregated products moving averages wavelets but these approaches will not be considered in the following in theoretical terms stochastic processes following eq 2 may be built by iterative multiplicative procedures called multiplicative cascades schertzer et al 2002 these procedures consist in a series of resolution refinements where a given coarse scale series is modulated by random multiplicative factors at each step i e at each resolution refinement resolution refinements can be done by explicitly dividing coarse pixels in smaller subpixels thus causing a discretization of the scales alternatively this construction can be extended to consider a continuum of scales leading to continuous in scale multiplicative cascades schertzer and lovejoy 1997 for the latter random multiplicative factors between two arbitrary scales should follow a log infinitely divisible distribution in the general case described by eq 2 the scaling exponent k q is a convex function of the moment order q however the exact form of k q is subject to additional constraints when taking into account the continuity of the scale space and the related constraints such as the distribution of random multiplicative factors described above based on these considerations some authors proposed cascade models where the function k q can be expressed in closed form in particular two parameter models have been proposed by schertzer and lovejoy 1987 and by she and levêque 1994 in the following the parameterization of the k q function will be investigated with the help of the universal multifractal um model proposed by schertzer and lovejoy 1987 the choice of this model was motivated by several factors such as its mathematical pertinence the model is one of the natural attractors of the class of continuous in scale log infinitely divisible cascades its wide use in geophysical literature and its physically interpretable parameterization in this framework the function k q is parameterized as follows 3 k q c 1 α 1 q α q c 1 is a dispersion parameter comprised in the interval 0 1 for time series for instance c 1 0 would correspond to a homogeneous time series mathematically c 1 is the fractal co dimension associated to the set of points exceeding a specific threshold specifically related to the mean value of the field the parameter α is an index of multifractality and belongs to the 0 2 interval α 0 is the pure monofractal case where k q becomes linear while α 2 corresponds to log normal cascades for which scaling exponents k q vary in a quadratic way with q 2 3 fractionally integrated cascades by construction multiplicative cascades are potentially appropriate for modeling time series whose power spectrum follows a scaling law with a scaling exponent β 1 more precisely the scaling exponent should follow the relationship β 1 k 2 where k 2 is necessarily positive see e g tessier et al 1993 3 b however most geophysical variables are characterized by steeper power spectra β 1 in space and or time domains this is typically the case for variables closely related to turbulence where β is generally close to 5 3 for both wind speed and passive scalars coherently with the predictions of kolmogorov 1941 obukhov 1949 and corrsin 1951 but also for many other variables including topographic fields gagnon et al 2006 anticipating on section 4 the subsequent analyses of smosmania soil moisture will show evidence of power spectra that are closer to 1 f 2 behavior in the latter cases multifractality can be investigated by testing the validity of eq 2 for a derivative of the process called the flux and denoted φ this derivative can be a fractional derivative of the original process it is recalled that fractional derivative and integrations are useful notions of fractional calculus that extend classical definitions of derivatives and integrals to non integer orders loverro 2004 these concepts are useful for modeling processes with various spectral scaling exponents e g integrations can represent effects leading to steeper power spectra schertzer and lovejoy 1991 appendix b2 gagnon et al 2006 in the context of our study the observable variable y e g soil moisture is modeled as the fractional integration of order h of a multifractal flux φ that follow eq 2 combined with um cascades this defines the fractionally integrated flux fif model schertzer and lovejoy 1987 which depends of the three parameters α c 1 and h when h is positive its effect is that of a smoothing parameter on the contrary the case h 0 corresponds to additional roughening effects the case h 0 corresponds to multiplicative cascades described in the previous paragraph i e without any additional smoothing or roughening in practice this parameter h may also be estimated by computing the first order structure function s δt defined by the first order absolute increments of the time series as a function of the time lag δt 4 s δ t def y t δ t y t in the case of a fif model s δt follows a scaling law similar to the one exhibited by fractional brownian motions processes 5 s δ t δ t h where again means equality within the limits of slowly varying factors it should be mentioned that the definitions above can be extended by using other definitions of fluctuations in time series for instance lovejoy and schertzer 2012 have proposed a variant based on the replacement of difference fluctuations used in eq 4 by haar fluctuations interestingly such variants may differ from each other in terms of range of validity of h estimates for instance structure functions estimates based on eq 4 will allow the retrieval of h only when 0 h 1 the use of haar fluctuations can lead to correct estimates on a wider range of h values 1 h 1 in the rest of the paper analyses will nevertheless be based on the more classical structure functions defined by eq 4 this is not a limitation here since h estimates will be found near the middle of the 0 1 interval see section 6 2 the value of h directly affects the distribution of energy across scales namely a higher value of h implies a steeper spectrum for a fif series both values are related by β 1 k 2 2h tessier et al 1993 note that for a monofractal signal such as a fractional brownian motion characterized by a unique scaling exponent h a more or less similar relationship β 1 2h still holds the case of fif processes differs from the fbm case by the multifractal correction term k 2 2 4 multiscale entropy other signatures of scale invariance may be found by using analysis methods more closely related to information theory for instance the notion of information dimension has been defined to characterize the density of points in fractal geometric sets and strange attractors e g hentschel and procaccia 1983 farmer et al 1983 zhang 1991 suggested computing shannon entropies of coarse grained time series as a prerequisite to define a complexity measure of a signal a similar approach has been proposed by costa et al 2002 2003 2005 in the context of the analysis of biological signals their approach called multiscale entropy mse is based on the estimation of the sample entropy sampen richman and moorman 2000 applied on time series that are coarse grained at various time resolutions the sample entropy provides an approximation of the entropy information of any discrete time series y i of length n by computing the conditional probability that two similar sequences of m consecutive points will remain similar when considering extended sequences of m 1 points if u m i denotes a sequence vector of m points starting at index i i e u m i y i y i m 1 and d is a given distance between vectors here taken as the maximal absolute distance between their components then we may define the probability of similarity between two different vectors with respect to a threshold t 6 a m t n pr d u m i u m j t j i then the sample entropy may be computed by estimating the negative logarithm of the conditional probability that two matching vectors of length m will still match while taking into account an additional point within all vectors costa et al 2005 7 s e m t n l n a m 1 t n a m t n due to the negative logarithm the sample entropy tends to increase when unexpected changes in the series tend to occur i e when they are less repetitive and contain more information in the following the parameters m and t will be fixed to values close to those used in the literature i e m 2 and t taken as 15 of the standard deviation of the time series y within this context the multiscale entropy is a procedure consisting at estimating the sample entropy not only from given a data time series y i but also from coarse grained time series y τ i that may be estimated by averaging y over non overlapping windows of length τ this provides an entropy estimate mse τ that depends on the time resolution τ recent results tend to prove that scale invariance has a specific signature on the multiscale entropy as recalled by nogueira 2017 mse τ should scale as a power law with exponents closely related with the spectral slope i e 8 m s e τ τ h this has been verified empirically in the case of colored noise fractional brownian motion fbm time series courtiol et al 2016 analytical arguments based on fbm theory have also been proposed by gao et al 2015 to understand this relationship these authors also confirmed their findings on empirical studies of biological signals nogueira 2017 compared the scaling laws of power spectra and mse approach for both geophysical data near surface wind and synthetic data based on monofractal fbm series in the case of monofractal fbm signals the results were tending to confirm that the mse scaling exponent h should be identical to the scaling exponent h determined by the first order structure function on the contrary the case of multifractal signals has not been explicitly analyzed it may be noticed that nogueira s empirical results on turbulent i e likely multifractal wind processes suggest that a scaling law if the form of eq 8 could still hold for multifractal signals in the following both mse tools and multifractal analysis tools will be applied to the same smosmania surface soil moisture time series this will provide two types of multiscale information that could eventually be compared 3 data sets smosmania consists of a network of about 20 measurement stations distributed across southwestern and southeastern france in grassland and agricultural areas calvet et al 2007 albergel et al 2010 2011 this network has been set up in relation with the much broader hymex campaign http www hymex org which was mainly devoted to the monitoring and modeling of water cycle within the mediterranean region the smosmania probes are located at existing operational météo france weather stations radome network the average distance between two smosmania stations is of the order of 45 km albergel et al 2010 these locations may be viewed at ismn website at the following address www geo tuwien ac at insitu data viewer ismn php all stations are located at places with a fallow vegetation cover the smosmania network provides operational measurements of volumetric soil moisture and soil temperatures at various depths concerning the former soil moisture is estimated on a hourly basis with the help of thetaprobe sensors based on a capacitive technology measurements are available at four references depths ranging from 5 cm to 30 cm all the time series may be downloaded for free at the international soil moisture network ismn page http ismn geo tuwien ac at data access for more information about ismn the reader is also referred to the presentation by dorigo et al 2011 the present study is focused on time series located in southwestern france i e on time series of soil moisture collected at 12 places reported in table 1 since scaling related analyses must generally rely on data that have a small number of missing data time series presenting long missing periods of several dozens of days have been discarded we therefore restricted the study to nine of the twelve initial series discarded series are marked with a star in table 1 all remaining missing data have been replaced by linear interpolation several differences between locations should be noted for instance urgons sabres and créon d armagnac are located closer to the atlantic ocean and therefore are subject to a more oceanic climate they also differ from most of the other stations by a different soil texture with a much larger sand proportion stations that are closer to the mediterranean sea narbonne lézignan corbières typically have a silt loam texture finally stations that are distant from both seas tend also to have the largest clay fraction condom peyrusse grande lahas we can notice that all stations except mouthoumet station are located at low altitudes the present study is focused on the 2007 2014 period that covers most of the available time series from ismn thus all soil moisture measurements comprised between 2007 01 07 6 00 and 2015 01 01 0 00 local time have been selected in order to cover approximately 8 years measurements before 2007 01 07 were only available at a few stations and thus were discarded since all sensors provide measurements on an hourly basis all selected time series have about 70 000 data points which provides the possibility of investigating potential scaling properties over four orders of magnitude in scale finally some data at the beginning of the data series have been removed in order to reduce all the time series to 65 536 measurements points each all the retained series still cover the same dates ending on 2015 01 01 0 00 the purpose of this restriction is to work with 2 n length time series here n 16 which is preferable for technical reasons indeed multifractal analysis requires the estimation of statistical moments at different aggregated resolutions and the use of a dyadic cascade i e 2 i resolutions with integer i is very convenient for this moreover fft based spectral analysis techniques are also faster when applied to series with 2 n data points 4 spectral analysis of smosmania series 4 1 surface soil moisture data 5 cm depth spectral analysis has been carried out on the data set of soil moistures measured at 5 cm depth in order to identify scaling properties and possible scaling ranges since scaling properties generally take the form of a power law spectrum i e e f f β the results are presented in logarithmic coordinates in such a graph scaling laws should indeed appear as linear however this representation may have less desirable counterparts when analyzing long time series in particular this usually results in a much denser sampling of frequencies near the high frequencies and often in a less readable graphic representation to avoid these problems an average of the spectra over equally spaced logarithmic bins of length 0 02 here was performed the power spectra of the nine selected series are shown on fig 1 the figure is presented in logarithmic coordinates in order to make it more readable the spectra are translated upwards from one station to the next one the spectrum of the condom series is the only one that has not been vertically translated time scale tick labels are displayed on the horizontal axis i e high frequencies are still on the right of the figure but the horizontal graduations specify the time scale equivalent to this frequency i e τ 1 f the main feature exhibited by the spectra on fig 1 is the presence of scaling laws over a large scale range covering a large range of scales all spectra seem nevertheless slightly steeper at the high frequencies than at low frequencies a more oscillatory behavior at low frequencies e g time scales larger than several thousands of days may be noticed this feature is probably related to the coarser sampling of frequencies when analyzing large scale structures over time series that is not much longer than these structures it may also be noticed that all spectra appear roughly parallel to each other which suggests that all spectra should have very similar scaling laws with exponents β that are not expected to vary much this may be checked by calculating these scaling exponents while the spectra look scaling over three orders of magnitude at first glance several additional factors must be taken into account to determine the scale range considered in the fits i the low frequency part of the spectrum has a poorer sampling and is less robustly estimated ii the application of a segmentation algorithm d errico 2017 has been used to identify possible transitions between ranges with different spectral exponents β but failed to notice very significant transitions iii however some spectral estimations for instance at lahas station exhibit a very local drop at time scales of the order of 1000 3000 h iv the retained fit range must permit linear regressions with a good coefficient of determination for example r2 0 98 taking these elements into account and also anticipating on sect 5 where a narrower scaling range will be found the estimation of scaling exponents has been limited to the range of scales 1000 h 1 h the linear regressions are shown on fig 1 and the scaling coefficients β are reported in table 2 for the nine soil moisture time series collected at depth 5 cm it may be noticed that this choice permits one to obtain a very good coefficient of determination for each of the nine spectra presented all spectral slopes β are found within or very close to the range 1 9 2 and thus are very similar to each other when considering that each exponent is given with an uncertainty of 0 04 this confirms the apparent parallelism of the spectra on the figure 4 2 other depths by repeating the above procedure for the three other depths similar results were obtained with scaling holding to a good approximation for scales smaller than 1000 h all error bars δβ were found smaller than 0 04 for a linear fit within this range for all time series the surface 5 cm data spectrum remains above the other spectra meaning that the surface series contains more energy in the signal processing sense than the other ones physically this is also coherent with the greater variability amplitude of soil moisture at the surface due to the meteorological forcing however significant differences have been found between stations with typical cases illustrated on figs 2a and 2b at peyrusse grande station fig 2a the spectra are close to each other and the spectral slopes do not change considerably with depth here from 1 93 to 2 08 while at montaut the spectra are clearly distinct with different spectral slopes ranging from 1 97 to 2 35 it may be noted that the spectra displayed on figs 2 do not include any vertical shifts between spectra the spectral slopes β estimated for all stations at all considered depths are summarized on fig 3 the estimates of β are represented on the vertical axis while the stations names are distributed on the abscissa axis the stations have been sorted from the most western position to the most eastern position more precisely the abscissa axis refers to the three first letters of the names of the stations error bars are omitted but are of the order of 0 03 or 0 04 for all estimates as illustrated on figs 2 and 3 it seems that the spectral slope tends to increase as we consider deeper layers however β estimates become more variable across stations as the depth increases this could possibly be related to the differences in subsurface processes and soil texture the latter being heterogeneous across the stations while similar studies in the region of interest do not seem to be reported in the literature several published studies may help to put our findings in perspective in the space domain lower scaling exponents are generally reported for instance pelletier et al 1997 found a value of β 1 8 while a value closer to 1 2 might be deduced from the findings presented by kim and barros 2002a based on remote sensing data more recently neuhauser et al 2018 reported a spectral exponent closer to 1 0 at spatial scales 40 km based on smos data in the time domain higher estimates of β have been reported by katul et al 2007 based on measurements of soil moisture in a more subtropical eastern us region durham nc these authors considered an eight year long time series of integrated 0 30 cm soil moisture they found a steep scaling β 2 75 in the scale range 90 h 1 h and a much flatter spectrum at larger scales interestingly they also proposed a simplified physical model to show that soil moisture time series may behave as a time integration of precipitation time series at relatively small time scales at least in first approximation since power spectra of precipitation data are either flat or decrease in a scaling way i e f a where a 0 cf fraedrich and larnder 1993 the expected spectrum of soil moisture could be of the form f 2 a which was verified in their case the results obtained by katul et al 2007 therefore suggest that it is not surprising that soil moisture has a steeper scaling in the time domain than in the space domain due to this time integration effect however in the present study estimates of β are found closer to 2 0 i e a red noise like scaling in this sense our results may differ from those of katul et al 2007 since the model proposed by the latter authors does not seem compatible in practice with values of β smaller than 2 5 multifractal analysis 5 1 surface soil moisture data 5 cm depth results of the previous section show that soil moisture power spectra estimated above are rather steep similar to a f 2 red noise this usually means that the series cannot be directly described by a multifractal multiplicative cascade which requires β 1 however as explained in section 2 3 it is possible to check whether a multifractal cascade structure may describe some derivative or integration of the process fractionally integrated stochastic processes e g fractional brownian motions fractionally integrated flux are models that may be appropriate for scaling processes with steeper spectral slopes therefore a possible way to investigate multifractality within the series is to consider a flux estimated from a derivative of the time series and to test whether the moments of this flux follow a multifractal law analogous to that described in section 2 2 eq 2 in the following the fluxes φ are estimated at 1 h resolution by taking the absolute value of the finite difference derivative of the 5 cm moisture series following the process originally described by lavallée et al 1991 1993 for each series the flux is aggregated over non overlapping intervals of length τ 2 i τ 0 using a dyadic cascade approach i e at each step the resolution ratio λ t τ is divided by a factor two and the data are aggregated on successive couples of points this leads to an ensemble of aggregated fluxes series φ λ t i indexed by the resolution λ 2 j for j 0 1 16 each aggregated series thus containing λ data points then the empirical moments are used as an estimate of the unknown statistical moments for each series and for each chosen moment order q the aggregated fluxes are elevated to power q and averaged over the whole series length the computation is done for all averaging resolutions λ 2 j j 0 1 16 and for various orders q comprised between 0 and 2 5 with a spacing of 0 1 between two successive orders this provides the empirical moments m λ q that approximate the statistical moments φ λ q the statistical average being replaced by the empirical average this procedure corresponds to the trace moment approach presented by tessier et al 1993 the empirical moments are represented in logarithmic coordinates as a function of the resolution λ the process is repeated for each series the result is displayed in a larger figure for the case of peyrusse grande data and in a composite figure for other stations see figs 4 and 5 fig 4 may be read as follows first each curve is associated to one specific moment order the higher moment orders q 1 are associated with the upper increasing curves on the figure while the slightly decreasing curves are associated to orders q such that 0 q 1 similarly to fig 1 finer resolutions are located on the right of fig 4 at the coarsest time scales typically 1000 h the curves are undistinguishable meaning that no significant multiscaling may be found however moments are much more variable towards finer resolutions log log linear behavior is found to a good approximation within the range of resolutions comprised between 128 h and 1 h green fit lines since the figure is in logarithmic coordinates each regression is representative of eq 2 for a fixed order of moment q and its slope corresponds to the scaling exponent k q comparable figures are found for the eight others time series with very similar scaling ranges fig 5 thus and in order to facilitate the comparison between the different series it has been chosen to perform the regression over the same scaling range 128 h 1 h it can be noted that this range is smaller than the one observed on power spectra presented in the previous section based on fig 4 we also remark that all linear regressions are convergent towards a point while being extrapolated towards coarser resolutions the abscissa of this point may correspond to the external scale lovejoy et al 2008 at which the multifractal cascade is initiated for the nine time series the exact position of the external scale may vary a bit but is comprised in the range 200 600 h for most of the time series the external scale would be close to 200 300 h but for some of them higher values seem obtainable e g urgons narbonne or créon d armagnac for the latter station the external scale seems indeed closer to 600 h due to the uncertainty of this estimate it is not possible to clearly tell if the latter difference is really significant and related to meteorological forcing nevertheless the position of the external scale is plausibly related to the weather macroweather transition scale that has been evidenced for numerous atmospheric fields lovejoy et al 2013 de lima and lovejoy 2015 the transition between the weather and macroweather regimes occurs at the lifetime of planetary meteorological structures i e at time scales of the order of a couple of weeks for meteorological variables the transition separates scaling regime respectively characterized by a small intermittency i e large scale macroweather and a stronger multifractal intermittency at smaller scales i e weather regime as explained above the slopes of the green lines on fig 4 provide the estimates of the moment scaling function k q for the orders q that have been used in previous computations the graph of the estimated k q function at peyrusse grande station is provided on fig 6 the round dots correspond to the empirical estimates we may notice that the values of k q are also given for higher moment orders up to 3 0 that have not been represented on fig 4 for readability purposes see fig 7 as expected the k q estimates are distributed along a convex curve the latter may then be fitted by the two parameter universal form recalled in section 3 the green curve is obtained by nonlinear optimization on the interval defined by q 0 2 5 more precisely the nelder mead method is used to find the couple of parameters that minimizes the quadratic distance between fixed k q estimates and the theoretical values predicted by eq 3 in this case the universal parameters estimates for peyrusse grande station are c 1 0 28 and α 1 51 for other stations more or less similar graphs may be obtained but some variability still exists in both estimates of α and c 1 figs 9 all the different k q function estimates were fitted within the interval 0 2 5 see fig 5 the obtained parameters are reported in table 3 as shown on table 3 some variability may be found within parameter estimates nevertheless c 1 remains always close to 0 25 0 3 and the observed variability does not seem related with the positions of the stations and or soil texture such estimates are significantly larger than the values closer to 0 1 or even less reported for other geophysical fields e g lovejoy and schertzer 2013 however some studies report large 0 3 estimates in the case of rainfall e g lovejoy et al 2008a at least at time scales 1 h verrier et al 2011 thus the relatively high value of c 1 that has been observed in this study for soil moisture could be a consequence of the large intermittency of the rainfall process concerning the index of multifractality α most estimates are found within the range 1 6 1 8 in this aspect the stations of créon d armagnac and urgons seem to differ significantly from the others with much lower α estimates closer to 1 3 1 4 interestingly these stations are relatively close to each other about 55 km and both located in the french department of landes at the most western part of the region covered by smosmania i e closer to the atlantic ocean and with significantly more sandy soil texture this could suggest a possible impact of these features on α however the parameter α characterizes the degree of nonlinearity of the k q curve and is known to be more difficult to estimate than c 1 this could also explain part of the observed difference despite the relative homogeneity of α estimates for the other stations 5 2 other depths by repeating the previous analysis to other depths a similar multifractal scaling was found in the range 128 h 1 h for all stations this is illustrated on fig 8 where moments of peyrusse grande 10 20 30 cm data follow a scaling law that could be extrapolated to external scales of the order of several hundreds of hours from the slopes of the green lines scaling exponents k q may be computed and then plotted on fig 8 bottom right on this figure each color is associated to one depth note that 5 cm depth estimates are also plotted on the same graph while the different curves globally follow the same shape they differ significantly from each other for low and high moment orders in this case high order moments are higher for 10 cm depth data than for other data while 20 cm depth data differ from the others for low moment orders these differences affect both estimates of multifractal parameters which can be checked by comparing the couples α c 1 at depths 5 cm and 20 cm indeed the latter are respectively equal to 1 51 0 28 and 0 79 0 40 part of the change may be explained by the partial linearization of the k q curve as the depth increases the limit case of linearity can theoretically be attained at α 0 i e monofractality case for all time series the parameters α and c 1 have been estimated at the different depths the results are summarized on figs 9a and 9b where estimates are given as a function of the station once again stations are sorted from the most western to the most eastern and are identified by their first three letters as deeper data are considered smaller values of α and larger values of c 1 are systematically obtained with a globally larger variability from one station to one another similar to fig 8 this change seems to be related to a less pronounced convexity of the k q curves as depth increases we may conclude that soil moisture at these depths still follows multifractal properties but with different k q scaling exponents especially at low and high order moments this is illustrated by a change in multifractal parameter estimates that is noticeable when compared to the relative homogeneity of the parameters for 5 cm depth data across different stations a possible explanation could reside in the impact of soil texture on soil moisture at the deeper layers for instance subsurface processes could cause a change of the scaling of some moment orders this change propagating to the multifractal parameters 6 multiscale entropy properties 6 1 mse analysis the nine surface 5 cm depth soil moisture time series are now analyzed within the mse framework for each series sample entropy is estimated at various coarse resolution time series obtained by the means of averages performed over non overlapping intervals of various durations τ chosen between 1 h i e the finest resolution available and 690 h we cannot degrade the time series to coarser resolutions since the sample entropy calculation can only be performed over coarse time series containing at least 100 points nogueira 2017 the estimated entropies are represented in logarithmic coordinates on fig 10 for the different time series once again mse curves are regularly shifted upwards to make the figure more readable mse curves are steeper at lower time scales and a bit flatter at larger scales the segmentation tool proposed by d errico 2017 was used to estimate the position of the transition between the two behaviors with a result close to 30 h due to the better sampling of the mse on the right of the figure only time scales within the range 650 h 30 h have been considered for fitting the exponents h are determined by linear regressions over this interval of time scales the values of h estimates and error bars may be found in table 4 estimates are comprised between 0 31 and 0 66 for a mean value of h 0 43 for all time series all the regressions have a very good coefficient of determination except in the case of the mouthoumet station despite the narrower scale range the results are partially coherent with the findings previously obtained by spectral analysis with often similar scaling exponents across stations see table 2 once again all time series have rather similar scaling properties which could be related to the sampling strategies all sensors being located in grassland on flat areas nevertheless it could be noted that the dispersion of the values of h is greater than the dispersion of spectral slopes this dispersion is nevertheless probably not representative of a better sensitivity of mse to local differences indeed h is estimated over a significantly narrower scale range than β which could lead to more dispersion in the estimates furthermore the soil moisture series collected at 10 cm 20 cm and 30 cm depths have been analyzed in a similar way the scaling exponents h obtained by fitting the mse curves are displayed on fig 11 all these exponents have been obtained by linear fits on the log log graph of mse τ for time scales in the range 30 h 650 h all linear regressions had an r2 0 94 except in the case of peyrusse grande where the fits are poorer fig 11 also confirms that the scaling exponents may depend on depth coherently with what was reported on fig 3 the scaling seems in general a bit steeper at greater depths the results of this section confirm that the scaling properties of soil moisture may be retrieved not only in terms of spectra and moments but also in terms of information content this was expectable since the signal information occurrence of unexpected structures is of course strongly constrained by the probability distribution of the signal at various resolutions nevertheless this result shows that multiscale entropy scaling can be found in non biological natural signals consistently with the findings by nogueira 2017 additionally our results show that mse scaling may be found in natural signals that follow multifractal statistics this could extend the findings of the literature that mainly focuses on monofractal brownian processes or natural processes assimilated to the former ones e g gao et al 2015 complementarily we may investigate which degree of redundancy may exist between the mse approach and the structure function approach i e to check if they estimate the same scaling properties or not indeed first order structure functions can be used to estimate the third parameter h of the fif model cf section 2 3 in the case of our dataset is h indeed close to the mse scaling parameter obtained above 6 2 comparison with first order structure functions in order to investigate this issue the first order structure functions defined by eq 4 have been estimated based on the surface soil moisture data from the nine stations the structure functions are displayed on fig 12 where they are regularly shifted in the vertical direction to improve readability it should be noted that on fig 12 the large time increments are on the right of the figure very small and very large time increments are not taken into account as they might be affected by sampling limitations on the middle of the fig 12 a scaling regime may be identified for 30 h δ t 1000 h this regime is representative of a scaling behavior of the form given by eq 5 in order to make the comparison with sect 6 1 easier the linear fit range was restricted to 30 h δ t 650 h good scaling results are obtained with an very small error bar on the slope estimate δ h 0 01 or smaller the scaling exponent does not vary much from one series to one another the mean value of h being equal to h 0 41 see values in table 5 we may now compare the estimates of h and h obtained for the different series fig 13 displays h as a function of h for the different time series for most stations estimates of h and h are very similar despite some differences larger than the regressions error bars however significant differences were found for two stations narbonne and savenès where the h estimates are much larger than their structure function counterparts it remains unclear if this is due to greater uncertainties in the estimates obtained by the mse approach and or an ability of the latter method to catch specific features at some stations this issue could be investigated in future studies since mse and structure function approaches may perform differently in the estimation of hurst like scaling parameters while the detailed comparison of the two methods still requires additional theoretical work we can already notice that each method has qualitatively identifiable practical advantages and drawbacks namely classical structure functions are more easy to use to analyze a large scale range but do not have direct interpretation in terms of signal information additionally they cannot estimate negative scaling exponents unless modified variants based on wavelets are used e g lovejoy and schertzer 2012 meanwhile mse algorithms are appropriate for information and complexity estimation but they are applicable over a relatively limited scale range due to computational constraints nogueira 2017 the mse framework also provides equations that seem more difficult to relate analytically to equations such as those governing the statistics of multifractal cascades for non unity orders of statistics eq 2 it could be interesting to try to investigate possible links with other theoretical notions such as the information dimension which contains both scaling and shannon entropy characterization the latter point is left as a perspective in this work however a better understanding of the possible relationship between multifractal scaling and mse scaling can already be achieved with the help of numerical tests this is the subject of the next section 7 expected relationship between h and multifractal parameters 7 1 numerical experiments the analysis presented in section 6 was aimed to test if h and h estimates could have close values in the empirical case of the study while the hypothesis h h has been tested numerically by nogueira 2017 in the case of fractional brownian motion processes where the structure function h is the unique scaling parameter the extension to the case of multifractal processes has not yet been investigated by theoretical or numerical approaches at least to the author s knowledge multifractal processes differ from fractional brownian motions by the existence of more nonlinear properties that are characterized by the parameters c 1 and α defined above a priori there is no theoretical reason to rule out a possible effect of c 1 and α on the mse scaling parameter therefore we might look for a possible functional relationship of the form h f h c 1 α while it is still unknown if this function f can be defined in closed form numerical tests can be performed to check if there is a systematic dependency of h on the three multifractal parameters in the following numerical tests are presented based on the multifractal simulation techniques of fif processes described by pecknold et al 1993 schertzer et al 2002 macor 2007 verrier et al 2011 the main steps are the following i generation of a unit extremal lévy stable noise with an asymmetry parameter equal to 1 and a stability parameter α identical to the multifractal α defined above ii multiplication by a normalizing multiplicative constant σ c 1 α 1 1 α iii convolution by a kernel proportional to t d α where d is the embedding space dimension i e d 1 for time series iv exponentiation v fractional integration of order h step i above is performed by applying the procedure described by chambers et al 1976 to a couple of independent simple random variables at each data point it is worth noting the procedure allows to store numerical realizations of these two simple input variables u and e with uniform and exponential distributions respectively cf pecknold et al 1993 3 and then to repeat the five step procedure with different sets of parameters h c 1 α therefore it is very easy to test different sets of parameters on the same probabilistic events i e numerical realizations numerical tests have been implemented in the following way twenty independent realizations of couples of u and e time series are first generated in order to build the experiment on twenty different probabilistic events then the procedure of simulation is applied for various sets of multifractal parameters h c 1 α in other words 20 synthetic multifractal time series are obtained for each set of parameters but the 20 random realizations used to generate the series are the same for all sets since synthetic multifractal time series can have numerical discrepancies at the highest frequencies it has been chosen to perform all numerical simulations based on time series of 218 points and then to average each of them over a series of disjoint intervals of 16 points this procedure provides 20 time series of 214 16384 points for each set of multifractal parameters in a second step mse analysis is applied to each individual time series and then the mse τ function is averaged over the 20 individual realizations available for each set of multifractal parameters the h exponent is then estimated from the averaged mse τ by performing a linear regression in log log coordinates over the whole range of available scales i e from 1 to 163 data points since sample entropy needs 100 data points to be computed 7 2 results examples of mses estimated from individual series are presented in log log coordinates on figs 14 and 15 fig 14 shows the mse τ obtained for a single random realization with α 2 and c1 0 05 the blue curve is obtained when h 0 and the green curve when h has been fixed to 0 4 it may be noticed that the effect of the fractional integration i e transition from the blue to the green curve changes both the height and the slope of the mse τ function in this individual case the hypothesis h h seems to hold when 0 4 but a moderate scaling is found in the h 0 fig 15 illustrate the case where the parameter c 1 changes while α 2 and h 0 based on a different individual realization the increase of c 1 leads to a drastic decrease of the entropy and seems also to increase the slope h of the mse curve these conclusions are globally confirmed when considering the h estimates obtained from the averaged mses figs 16 and 17 fig 16 shows the h estimate as a function of h with variable c 1 while α is fixed to 2 on the figure each curve corresponds to one value of c 1 comprised between 0 05 continuous blue curve and 0 55 dashed green curve with a spacing of 0 10 h is sampled in the range 0 0 7 with a spacing of 0 10 the first bisectrix is represented as a dashed black line for all curves h increases with h but does not follow the bisectrix except when c 1 is very small when h 0 5 all curves tends to get relatively close to each other meaning that when h is sufficiently high the influence of c 1 on h is relatively small on the contrary when h 0 4 the influence can become quite large with a systematic increase of h with c 1 confirming the observation of fig 15 in the case of a non integrated multiplicative cascade h 0 this can lead to an h estimate varying within the range 0 1 0 3 depending on the c 1 value regression error bars on h estimated from the average mse τ functions are not represented because they are very small inferior to 0 01 the possible influence of the α parameter coupled with h is presented on fig 17 where h is represented as a function of h with one curve for one value of α c 1 being fixed to 0 25 the parameter α has been chosen in the interval 1 5 2 with a spacing of 0 1 i e values usually encountered in geophysics and also reported in this study again h is an increasing function of h for all curves which also remain above the first bisectrix however h is a decreasing function of α such that the relationship between h and h tends to become closer to the first bisectrix when α 2 we may notice that the dependency of h on α is very limited for high values of α α 1 7 but becomes more pronounced for smaller values finally we may again notice that for high values of h all curves become close to the first bisectrix and increasingly undistinguishable from each other e g h 0 7 these numerical results show that the relationship between multifractal parameters and the mse scaling properties is more complex than originally anticipated and that a dependency on the three multifractal parameters should be expected in the general case however we may distinguish two basic cases for relatively high values of h 0 4 0 5 the relationship h h might still provide a useful work assumption since our results suggest that the fractional integration washes out the possible effects of the multifractal parameters α and c 1 in this case the mse scaling properties of a multifractal process are expectedly close to those of a fractional brownian motion which have been investigated by nogueira 2017 for lower values of h and in particular in the case of a non integrated multiplicative cascade h 0 the effect of α and c 1 is visible and results in a mse scaling exponent that is higher than h i e h h g h c 1 α the positive offset modeled by the function g is higher when c 1 increases or when α becomes significantly smaller than 2 interestingly the offset becomes very small when c 1 takes small values which illustrates that multifractal intermittency plays an important role in the difference h h while more exhaustive numerical tests and theoretical work remain to be done to quantify and understand the relationships between multifractal parameters and observed mse scaling laws some qualitative arguments may help to interpret the present observations first the effect of the fractional integration included in the fif model is similar to a scaling low pass filter that significantly attenuates the variability at the smallest scales it is therefore expectable that a fractionally integrated signal h 0 possesses more entropy at coarse resolutions than at fine resolutions this is obvious on fig 14 where we see that the effect of h is to strongly reduce entropy estimates at small scales i e on the left part of fig 14 moreover as already noted on fig 15 high c 1 parameter values also contribute to strongly reduce entropy this could seem a bit paradoxical since c 1 is known as an intermittency heterogeneity parameter however multifractal processes with high c 1 correspond to processes that exhibit slow variations most of the time while most of the variance is due to very strong and sparse peaks e g fig 10 in pecknold et al 1993 in this case sample entropies tend to decrease since repetitive patterns are or seem more frequent due to the existence of wide areas with small variations this effect is even more pronounced due to the increased standard deviation of the process when c 1 is large due to the contribution of extreme peaks indeed since the sample entropy builds its similarity criterion by using the standard deviation of the series see eq 6 it classifies events as similar more easily when large standard deviation and c 1 are involved we can notice that the decrease of entropy is expectably stronger at small scales where peaks are both very intense and cover a very small fraction of the time 7 3 application to smosmania empirical parameters finally we may come back to the results of section 6 since we have just demonstrated that the initial hypothesis h h may be too simplistic for multifractal processes in some situations by reporting the parameters h c 1 α estimated in sections 5 and 6 2 to the graph presented on fig 17 we obtain an expected parameter h between 0 4 and 0 5 however the empirical h estimates found in section 6 1 0 40 are less coherent with this expected parameter h 0 47 0 48 for multifractal parameters α 1 7 c1 0 25 h 0 40 than the one resulting from the naive h h hypothesis beyond possible estimation uncertainties a plausible explanation for this observation is the fact that the multifractal parameters c 1 and α are expected to be valid in the range of scales 128 h 1 h while h and h are valid in the range 650 h 30 h at scales 128 h i e beginning of the macroweather regime the flux moments have much slower variation with scale figs 4 and 5 which is equivalent to a strong decrease of the c 1 parameter this could explain why the empirical estimates of h are close to the structure function exponents since it is what is expected for low values of c 1 see fig 16 continuous blue curve especially when h is still relatively large 0 4 in this case 8 conclusions like other geophysical processes soil moisture is strongly variable over a rather wide range of time and space scales some previous literature papers advocated the existence of scaling and fractal properties over various ranges of scales in this study 8 year time series of surface soil moisture have been analyzed with the help of various multiscale analysis tools in order to investigate the existence of scaling laws the twelve sensors are located in the same area of about 300 200 km2 in southwestern france and the average distance between stations is of the order of a few dozens of kilometers for nine of these stations power spectra of surface soil moisture showed a red noise like 1 f 2 scaling over a large scale range of time scales 1 h τ 1000 h without any strong break in the scaling the scaling exponents are rather homogeneous at the surface layer and exhibit some variability at deeper horizons where spectra tend to become steeper in a second step multifractal analysis has been applied in order to identify the possible existence of scaling properties for non quadratic moment orders multifractality has also been observed in the range of scales comprised between 1 h and 128 h the moment scaling functions have been successfully fitted with the two parameter functional form predicted by the universal multifractal model at the surface 5 cm depth layer the obtained parameters showed a slightly greater dispersion than that of spectral slopes with c 1 0 2 0 3 and α 1 3 1 8 for surface data 5 cm depths however a greater dispersion has been found for data collected at deeper horizons 10 30 cm on average the depth affects the multifractality parameters more strongly than spectral slopes at 30 cm depth c1 is closer to 0 4 0 5 while α often becomes smaller than 1 this shift and this variability could be related to the soil composition while surface parameters are likely to be more representative of the influence of the meteorological forcing multiscale entropy has also been applied as a complementary scaling analysis tool devoted to the multiscale analysis of information content present in the series this approach had been originally developed in biology medicine research literature and has a good potential for analyzing time series in other scientific fields as noticed by nogueira 2017 a systematic relationship exists between mse scaling and spectral first order structure function scaling in the case of synthetic monofractal data and seems to hold for scaling geophysical observations mse analysis has been performed over the twelve smosmania surface time series showing the existence of scaling properties for the sample entropies estimated at various aggregation resolutions 30 650 h due to the strong constraints on sample entropy estimation the validity of mse scaling at larger scales could not be investigated this is a basic methodological limitation of the mse approach that is compensated by other advantages contrary to the usual structure function approach mse could be appropriate to analyze processes with negative hurst scaling exponents i e with h 0 or β 1 and has a rather direct interpretation in terms of information theory more generally our numerical results also demonstrated that the mse scaling properties are not limited to fbm like monofractals investigated by previous authors gao et al 2015 nogueira 2017 but should hold for synthetic and natural signals characterized by multifractal properties numerical tests were used to investigate the existence of a systematic relationship between the mse scaling parameter h and the three multifractal parameters h c 1 and α it has been observed that the relationship h f h c 1 α is more complex than in the monofractal case where h h and that in some cases the intermittency parameter c 1 and the multifractality parameter α can affect significantly mse scaling properties in other cases i e large h or low intermittency the approximation h h could be acceptable finally more theoretical work remains to be done to understand the relationships between mse scaling and fractal multifractal scaling properties

5592,concerns about climate change are amplifying interest in future rainfall extremes however there are big differences between the statistics of rainfall extremes obtained using future rainfall time series produced from various climate models such large uncertainties create a lot of confusion in establishing climate change adaptation measures looking at future rainfall extremes at a particular site yields increasing trends in some climate models and decreasing trends in others the spatial patterns of rate of change in rainfall extremes also vary widely depending on the climate model as a result they often do not gain the public s trust we believe that this difficulty in obtaining credibility does not come from a lack of theory or technique but from an approach that persuades the public of uncertain future rainfall extremes in this study we employed a novel approach to integrate a co variate of the not stationary peak over threshold pot generalized pareto distribution gpd model identified at each site with its future projection information for obtaining future rainfall extreme ensembles rainfall extremes are obtained from the observed rainfall time series using the pot method and the scale parameter among gpd parameters are applied as a function of surface air temperature sat or dew point temperature dpt at this time the threshold of the pot series is set to match the results of frequency analysis of the annual maximum series and the pot series for each site as much as possible the behavior of future rainfall extremes is analyzed by inputting the future sat or dat produced from various climate models into the non stationary frequency model using the co variate as a result of comparing the rainfall extremes obtained using the future rainfall time series directly with the future rainfall extremes obtained indirectly using the proposed method it was found that the proposed approach projected future design rainfall depths with much less variation between climate models the spatial pattern of rate of change was also consistent regardless of climate model the proposed method is expected to contribute to the public s confidence in future rainfall extremes under climate change scenarios and to be of practical help in formulating reasonable climate change adaptation policies keywords non stationary frequency analysis pot co variate climate change rainfall extremes 1 introduction since the 1950s many changes have been observed in climate phenomena including the frequent occurrence of extreme weather pachauri et al 2014 in recent decades surface air temperature sat has been continuously rising due to global warming and the frequency of rainfall extremes is increasing min et al 2011 cheng et al 2014 according to hettiarachchi et al 2018 rising temperatures due to climate change will exacerbate further damage from rainfall extremes since sat increases the amount of water in the atmosphere it directly affects the occurrence and intensity of rainfall events trenberth 2011 kunkel et al 2013 lee and kim 2018 in particular rainfall extremes in mid latitude regions are expected to increase due to global warming pall et al 2007 choi et al 2019 and the clausius clapeyron relationship provides a physical basis for understanding the sensitivity of rainfall extremes to global warming rate of change in future design rainfall depth using non stationary model with co variate and using stationary model with annual maximum series a rcp 4 5 and b rcp 8 5 the rate of change was based on the future year 2050 in most studies the approach to look at future rainfall extremes has taken a methodology that regards future rainfall data derived from global climate models gcms or regional climate models rcms as future observed data huntingford et al 2003 mailhot et al 2007 hanel and buishand 2011 willems et al 2012 seo et al 2015 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2017 and many others in other words most methods for estimating rainfall in future climates have focused on the down scaling outputs of gcms or rcms for hydrological applications through dynamic or statistical models prudhomme et al 2002 fowler et al 2007 maraun et al 2010 wilks 2010 however gcms and rcms have been shown to generate significant bias and uncertainty in relation to rainfall extremes alam and elshorbagy 2015 ning and bradley 2016 farnham et al 2018 therefore the reliability of future rainfall extremes at a particular site is generally low as can be seen from the results of fowler et al 2007 very different future rainfall extremes projections were obtained depending on what rcm was applied one attractive alternative proposed by lenderink and attema 2015 is the direct application of past temperature sensitivity scaling to future rainfall extremes estimates this concept is based on the fact that gcms or rcms produce more reliable and consistent results on temperature changes under climate change scenarios romps 2011 o gorman 2012 manola et al 2018 dahm et al 2019 sim et al 2019 according to diallo et al 2012 which investigated the behavior of future sat and rainfall based on a multi model gcm rcm ensemble the sat showed consistent future changes between climate models but the rainfall showed different future changes depending on gcms or rcms applied this study assumes that temperature is the main climatic variable associated with rainfall extremes changes this is based on previous findings that temperature is the recommended co variate for predicting rainfall and that temperature sensitivity implicitly explains the dynamics agilan and umamahesh 2017 ali and mishra 2017 wasko and sharma 2017 from these studies looking at the response of rainfall extremes to climate change from observed temperature and rainfall data will be one of the rational approaches o gorman 2012 in general frequency analysis is often used to quantify rainfall extremes in most water related design practices frequency analysis has been performed under the stationary assumption of rainfall data many studies that estimate the future design rainfall using frequency analysis considering climate change also estimate the future design rainfall from the frequency analysis of future rainfall data under the stationary assumption these studies assume that future rainfall data is stationary within future periods e g 2021 2050 divided at subjective intervals xu et al 2012 seo et al 2015 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2017 li et al 2017 so et al 2017 and many others however since the term climate change itself means that the stationary assumption is no longer valid studies on non stationary frequency analysis have been actively conducted beguería et al 2011 min et al 2011 westra et al 2013 sun et al 2015 mondal and mujumdar 2016 madsen et al 2017 gregersen et al 2017 and many others in non stationary frequency analysis time varying parameters are applied to probability distribution function pdf so that the non stationary nature of the data can be considered salas and obeysekera 2013 diffenbaugh et al 2017 time varying parameters are applied to various types of functions pdf s shape parameters are often set to constant lópez and francés 2013 but location or scale parameters are often considered to be functions of time or co variate non stationary models have been reported to provide more accurate results than stationary models mailhot et al 2007 and due to advances in numerical techniques for parameter estimation of pdfs the performance of non stationary models has been greatly improved over the last decade tramblay et al 2013 in addition recent studies have shown that non stationary frequency analysis using temperature related meteorological variables including el nino southern oscillation enso or sat dew point temperature dpt has been performed el adlouni et al 2007 lópez and francés 2013 losada et al 2012 examined the variation of precipitation patterns in response to sea surface temperature and enso and tramblay et al 2013 used the monthly sat as a co variate to examine the changes in design rainfall depth considering future climate change scenarios in addition agilan and umamahesh 2017 performed non stationary frequency analysis of generalized extreme value gev model in response to enso cycle however most existing studies have focused on constructing non stationary models of observational data tramblay et al 2012 mondal and mujumdar 2015 agilan and umamahesh 2017 salas et al 2018 and many others applications to climate change are mostly studies using hypothetical scenarios tramblay et al 2013 yilmaz et al 2014 sarhadi and soulis 2017 and many others based on several studies related to non stationary frequency analysis using sat or dpt as a co variate we derive future extreme rainfall ensemble by applying various future climate information on co variates directly to a non stationary frequency analysis in other words in this study we employed a novel approach to integrate a co variate of the not stationary peak over threshold pot generalized pareto distribution gpd model identified at each site with its future projection information for obtaining future rainfall extreme ensembles pot excesses are obtained using the pot method from the daily rainfall data of 60 sites operated by korea meteorological administration kma and the gpd whose scale parameter is a function of co variate is applied sat or dpt is used as a co variate for gpd and future sat and dpt ensemble obtained from various climate models are applied to non stationary models it is investigated that such empirical non stationary models between pot excess and sat or dpt can be used in building scenarios for future rainfall extremes possibly providing actionable information for policy makers or engineers we think the proposed approach therefore has potential for applications in future flood risk assessments where the available rainfall extremes obtained in most climate models are at present highly uncertain 2 methods 2 1 study area and meteorological data study area is the south korea region of the korean peninsula and the observation data of 60 sites operated by kma were used fig 1 information about the sites used is shown in table 1 the data used were daily rainfall depth daily sat and daily dpt a large number of sites were applied in this study and the data periods are different for each site since the data period plays a decisive role in ensuring the reliability of the frequency analysis it was not considered appropriate to reduce the data period of specific sites in order to set the same data period of the applied sites indeed the reason we applied the pot approach is to increase the number of possible data to better express the non stationarity inherent in the data although not shown in this study it was confirmed that fixing the data period from 1973 to 2017 has no significant effect on subsequent results in general the impact of global warming is materialized through gcms and future climate information obtained from gcms is used as the most common result of climate change projection however since the spatial resolution of gcms is about several hundred kilometers it is not appropriate to interpret the climate phenomena necessary for water resources business therefore it is reasonable to analyze future rainfall extremes using data obtained by dynamically downscaling the results of gcms using rcms in this study 16 combinations of future data obtained from two gcms hadgem2 ao and mpi esm lr four rcms regcm4 rsm mm5 and wrf and two representative concentration pathways rcp climate change scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 were applied since climate models do not provide future dpts directly dpt was recalculated using sat specific humidity and surface pressure provided by climate models table 2 provides detailed information on future climate information used previous studies park et al 2011 seo et al 2015 and many others have shown that rainfall extremes in the korean peninsula are heavily affected by local topography and large scale transport of moisture from the ocean to the korean peninsula the spatial scale of most gcms and some rcms is too coarse to address rainfall extremes from local convection tryhorn and degaetano 2011 rosa and collins 2013 therefore high resolution rcms are often used to simulate the evolution of rainfall extremes that occur below the spatial resolution of gcms and to identify potential changes in design rainfall kendon et al 2012 ban et al 2014 however a common problem with using rcm outputs directly in hydrological impact studies is that simulated rainfall extremes often present significant biases teutschbein and seibert 2010 arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 rcm biases can arise from errors in internal rcm physics or lateral boundary conditions provided by reanalysis data and gcm schoetter et al 2012 chen et al 2013 therefore bias correction is often necessary to match the rcm simulated rainfall with observations li et al 2017 for this reason tramblay et al 2013 recommended using a combination of dynamic down scaling and bias correction to analyze future scenarios of rainfall extremes various bias correction techniques themeßl et al 2012 lenderink and fowler 2017 and many others have been developed in this study the quantile mapping technique verified by many studies lee and kim 2018 choi et al 2019 sim et al 2019 and many others was applied the bias correction process using the quantile mapping technique was performed by site and month for reference the probability distribution required for the quantile mapping technique was determined by non parametric method using kernel smoothing technique however when performing bias correction of the annual maximum daily rainfall time series extracted from rcms the gev distribution was applied as the probability distribution required by the quantile mapping technique 2 2 generalized pareto distribution in general rainfall frequency analysis is performed using annual block maxima abm or pot approaches in abm approach it is often assumed that the annual maximum rainfall depth amr follows gev distribution and various studies have been conducted on this subject martins and stedinger 2000 katz et al 2002 gellens 2002 towler et al 2010 katz 2013 cheng et al 2014 since the abm approach considers only one event per year and completely ignores the information contained in other data many pot approaches have been studied that allow the selection of reasonable extreme events davison and smith 1990 roth et al 2012 gregersen et al 2015 liuzzo and freni 2015 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2017 and many others in other words since the pot approach creates larger data sets to enable more accurate parameter estimation of extreme value distributions several studies recommend using pot excesses instead of annual maxima as the extreme rainfall data input for frequency analysis re and barros 2009 tramblay et al 2013 yilmaz et al 2014 and many others pot excesses are generally assumed to be gpd coles et al 2001 in this study pot gpd was applied the cumulative probability distribution function cdf f x of gpd is given as follows hosking and wallis 1987 1 f x 1 1 k x x o α 1 k where the range of the random variable x is x o x α is the scale parameter and k is the shape parameter k 0 the threshold x o of gpd should be determined in advance the random variable x has a value larger than x o and the occurrence of x is assumed to follow the poisson distribution described by the annual incidence λ the annual incidence λ can be defined as the number of selected observations x x o divided by the observation years in order to ensure the independence of pot excesses observation data larger than x o should be set not to be consecutively selected ensuring this many studies perform de clustering procedures based on the time span between extreme events madsen et al 2002 ghosh and mallick 2011 roth et al 2012 gregersen et al 2017 and many others in this study individual storm events were first isolated from the daily rainfall time series applied inter event time definition is 1 day see kim and han 2010 then one storm event was set to select at most one daily rainfall depth as pot excesses since this event based separation procedure is performed before performing the pot approach it is valid regardless of the selected pot series censoring gregersen et al 2017 for reference the threshold of pot series was assumed to be stationary in this study there are studies considering the non stationarity of the threshold of pot series see tramblay et al 2012 but we gave the non stationarity only to the scale parameter of the gpd although various methods can be used to estimate parameters of gpd the maximum likelihood parameter estimation method is applied in this study considering that parameter estimation should be easy even when the scale parameter α is a function of co variate the parameters of gpd were estimated using an optimization technique that minimizes the negative log likelihood function nllh as follows 2 nllh n l n α 1 k i 1 n 1 k l n 1 k x i x o α where n is the number of pot excesses in this study a genetic algorithm was used for the optimization technique the design rainfall depth x t corresponding return period t year can be calculated as follows 3 x t x o α k 1 λ t k traditionally gpd assumes that observations are under a stationary state but a stationary assumption can be mitigated by assuming that one or more parameters of gpd depend on the order of occurrence of pot excesses theoretically all the parameters of gpd can be applied as a function of the order of occurrence of pot excesses but in this study the scale parameter α is defined as a function of co variate as follows um et al 2017 4 α i e a b z i where i is the order of occurrence of pot excesses x i 1 to n and co variate z i is a meteorological variable corresponding to pot excesses x i therefore gpd shows various forms in response to co variate z parameters a and b can be estimated using an optimization procedure that minimizes the negative log likelihood function as follows 5 nllh i 1 n l n α i 1 k i 1 n 1 k l n 1 k x i x o α i 2 3 meteorological co variate and optimal model selection as seen in lepore et al 2015 there is a strong scaling relationship between rainfall extremes and sats or rainfall extremes and dpts in this study sat or dpt was applied as a co variate of non stationary gpd it is unreasonable that only the sat or dpt on the day of rainfall is applied as a co variate since the korean peninsula has a temporary cooling effect when most rainfall occurs in the summer and when storm events affected by the ocean occur ali and mishra 2017 therefore the sat or dpt of the preceding t day where t 0 1 6 before pot excesses occurred was selected as co variate candidates in other words seven non stationary gpd models using sat of the preceding t day seven non stationary gpd models using the preceding t day dpt and one stationary gpd model were constructed see table 3 among these 15 models the minimum aic akaike information criterion model was selected as the optimal model and the aic can be calculated as follows akaike 1974 6 aic 2 n l l h 2 k where nllh is calculated using eqs 2 or 5 and k is the number of parameters of the applied model k 2 for stationary model and k 3 for non stationary models the selection of the optimal model is identified by applying aic akaike 1973 1974 we aimed to objectively identify the leading days of the sat or dpt as non stationary properties of rainfall extremes using akaike information criterion the application of this criterion is simple because it only requires estimation of the likelihood function for the candidate model defined by eq 5 burnham and anderson 2002 aic provides an implicit interpretation of the principle of parsimony that is central to model selection box and jenkins 1970 aic has a firm foundation in information theory from a mathematical point of view iliopoulou et al 2018 the procedure for identifying non stationarity and selecting the best model for each site are as follows 1 pot excesses and date data on occurrence of pot excesses to construct 15 models 2 determine gpd applicability 2 1 determine if scale parameter of gpd is negative 2 2 determination of adequacy of threshold of pot series see section 3 1 later 3 construct sat and dpt data of the preceding t day where t 0 1 6 from the day of the occurrence of pot excesses for the gpd applicable sites 4 parameter estimation for 15 models 5 aic is calculated for the candidate models 6 selecting the best co variate sat or dpt and preceding t day by comparing the resulting aic values or selecting the stationary model as the best model based on the resulting aic values 3 results and discussion 3 1 threshold selection in pot analysis threshold x o plays an important role in estimating model parameters and obtaining accurate estimates of design rainfall depth bader et al 2018 the threshold should be chosen high enough that pot excesses are sufficient to approximate gpd however selection of too high a threshold can increase the error of the estimated values of model parameters and design rainfall depth by reducing the sample size various methods have been proposed to select an appropriate threshold caeiro and gomes 2015 langousis et al 2016 bader et al 2018 and a suitable threshold was selected by plots and statistical indexes scarrott and macdonald 2012 in this study the mean residual life plot which is commonly used among various threshold selection methods was applied preferentially coles et al 2001 in addition the frequency analysis of rainfall extremes is mainly applied to gpd model of pot approach and gev model of abm approach therefore in this study the threshold of pot series is selected to estimate the design rainfall similar to the design rainfall obtained from the abm approach because the abm approach is the standard for the estimation of design rainfall depth in korea for direct comparison with the design rainfall depth obtained from the abm approach we determined that this setting was an essential and practical choice however since the stability of the parameter estimates should be ensured an unconditional threshold setting by comparison with the abm approach should be avoided coles et al 2001 katz et al 2002 tramblay et al 2013 therefore the threshold set by comparison with the abm approach needs to be compared with various rules of thumb including the mean residual life plot dumouchel 1983 ferreira et al 2003 bader et al 2018 we estimated the design rainfall depths of various return periods by applying pot excesses constructed from various thresholds to the stationary gpd model and then compared with the corresponding design rainfall depths estimated by applying amr to gev model the threshold that gives the smallest deviation between design rainfall depths estimated by the two approaches was chosen preferentially in addition the final threshold was determined after checking whether the selected threshold corresponds to be in a reasonable threshold range derived from the mean residual life plot the deviation diff between gpd model and gev model can be calculated as follows 7 diff 1 11 i 1 x t i gpd x t i gev 2 where x t i gpd is the design rainfall depth of return period t i year estimated using gpd model and x t i gev is the design rainfall depth of return period t i year estimated using gev model a total of 11 return periods including 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 and 200 years were used for the calculation of eq 7 fig 2 shows the mean residual life plot to obtain pot excesses as can be seen in fig 2 seoul site showed a curved section ranging from 0 to 40 mm so a range of 0 to 40 mm was excluded from the threshold candidates also since the number of pot excesses was smaller than the number of amrs in the range exceeding 110 mm upper limit in fig 2 a ranges of 110 mm or more were excluded from the threshold candidates a range of 40 80 mm in which the straight line segment appeared could be found to be in the appropriate threshold range within this range a threshold that minimizes the deviation between gpd model and gev model see eq 7 was finally determined x o 53 mm for seoul site the thresholds of the remaining sites including tongyeong site x o 78 mm were also determined through a similar analysis fig 3 shows the design rainfall depths corresponding to various return periods estimated at 52 sites where the gpd was analyzed as appropriate for reference it was found that deviation in the design rainfall estimates obtained using pot and abm approaches was in the range of 0 1 to 5 01 at all sites where gpd was appropriate 3 2 non stationary frequency analysis non stationary frequency analysis was performed using pot excesses constructed by applying the threshold determined in section 3 1 the optimal model was selected from the aic results of the 15 models listed in table 3 see table 4 table 4 shows the aic values for identifying non stationarity for 60 sites according to burnham and anderson 2002 the difference daic between the aic value of the best non stationary model and the aic value of the stationary model can be calculated from the results of the calculated daic both the stationary and non stationary model can be applied at sites where the daic is less than 2 whereas the non stationary model should be used at the sites where the daic is greater than 10 on the other hand it is preferable to use a non stationary model at sites where 2 daic 10 iliopoulou et al 2018 of the 60 sites used in this study a non stationary model was found to be applicable at 52 sites among these sites sat was selected as a co variate in 14 sites and dpt was selected in 38 sites most of the sats were selected 3 5 days prior to the occurrence of rainfall and dpt was mostly selected on the day of rainfall and 1 3 days before rainfall rainfall extremes in korea have shown mixed increasing and decreasing trends as reported in the previous researches kim et al 2017 choi et al 2019 however as can be seen in table 4 it is worth mentioning that the non stationarity of rainfall extremes cannot be assessed only based on a time series trend analysis table 4 shows rainfall extremes of 52 sites out of 60 sites have non stationary nature the performance of the non stationary gpd model over the observed pot excesses was evaluated for design rainfall depth of various return periods and design rainfall depth of return period 50 year were visually compared to the observed pot excesses see fig 4 the corresponding stationary design rainfall depth estimated from the stationary gpd model is also included horizontal dashed dotted blue line on the other hand the non stationary model s design rainfall depth fluctuated dashed dotted red line can be found to achieve various design rainfall depths in response to dpt the performance of the non stationary gpd model can be further highlighted by comparing the empirical pdfs of design rainfall depths obtained from the non stationary gpd model for two sat or dpt increasing scenarios that were selected as illustrative instances of climate change of lower and higher emission projections fig 5 shows the change in design rainfall depth for future sat or dpt increases as can be seen in fig 5 there is the obvious shift in the pdf between lower and higher emission scenarios as compared to the observed pdf it can be also found that there is a difference in the non exceedance probability of a certain rainfall depth between pdfs in addition since the non stationary model considering sat or dpt as a co variate can construct the distribution of the design rainfall depth corresponding to the distribution of the co variate the uncertainty of the design rainfall depth due to climate change can be quantitatively analyzed 3 3 design rainfall depth considering climate change in this section the estimated design rainfall depths directly using the future rainfall obtained from various climate models and the indirectly estimated design rainfall depths using the future sat or dpt were compared fig 6 shows the comparison procedure of the two methods sixteen future combinations were derived from various climate models and climate change scenarios future design rainfall depths were estimated after the bias of future rainfall sat and dpt was corrected using quantile mapping technique the trend analysis of projected sat and dpt was performed at each of 60 sites operated by kma first yearly sat and dpt time series were constructed by averaging yearly present and future daily sat and dpt time series produced by each of the 16 ensembles of rcp gcm rcm for each site from the yearly sat and dpt time series the trends of sat and dpt were analyzed using eqs 8 and 9 8 δ sat y β a y 2010 1 2 β b y 2010 2 9 δ dpt y β c y 2010 1 2 β d y 2010 2 where δ s a t y or δ d p t y is the yearly sat or dpt of the future year y minus the mean of the yearly sat or dpt time series for the present period 1981 2010 and the linear trend coefficients β a and β c and trend acceleration coefficients β b and β d were estimated using regression analysis in eqs 8 and 9 2010 represents the last year of the present period fig 7 a shows the observed present and future yearly sat time series and its trend curve derived in the form of eq 8 the trend acceleration component was not clearly seen but it was found that the linear trend component appeared clearly fig 7 b shows the rate of change of future sats obtained from the trend analysis of various future sat ensembles the sat is likely to increase in all future ensembles used and the sat growth rate is higher in rcp 8 5 scenarios than in rcp 4 5 scenarios on the other hand in terms of future rate of change compared to present the deviations between 16 future ensembles could be found not to be large fig 7 c and d show the results for dpt it was not significantly different from the sat pattern pot excesses of the daily rainfall depth were not suitable to use the same method as the trend analysis of sat and dpt due to the irregular nature of the rainfall time series instead in the case of pot excesses the overall degree of change between the mean of pot excesses in the present period and the mean of pot excesses in the future period was analyzed see fig 8 looking at fig 8 as a concept of rate of change the uncertainty of rainfall extremes simulated by rcms can be seen more clearly at the chupungreong site the rate of change in the mean of pot excesses is in the range of 11 to 25 for rcp 4 5 and 20 to 18 for rcp 8 5 the rate of change in the standard deviation of pot excesses is in the range of 23 to 83 for rcp 4 5 and 6 to 66 for rcp 8 5 the large uncertainty seen in the rate of change of the mean and standard deviation will propagate through the design rainfall depths that are subsequently calculated as a result of examining the present and future pot excesses at each of 60 sites it was difficult to find the consistency of rate of change by rcp scenarios as described above in the case of rainfall extremes inconsistent future projection results are usually derived depending on which climate model is applied so it would be a reasonable approach to look at changes in future rainfall extremes based on the increase in sat or dpt the problem posed when examining the changes of future pot excesses using the co variate based non stationary model is how much to reflect the increase or decrease in future sat or dpt for instance at namhae site when the scale parameter of gpd is composed of α i e x p a b sat i for namhae site the sat on the day when pot excesses occurred see table 4 the sat for estimating future scale parameters should be determined because of the lack of reliability of future rainfall extremes obtained from climate models as described above it was not reasonable to apply sat on the day of future pot excesses simulated from climate models as can be seen in fig 9 a regardless of rcp 4 5 or rcp 8 5 sats in future climate conditions are very likely to increase and future empirical cdfs can be found to take the form of a horizontally shifted present empirical cdf fig 9 b shows the empirical cdf of dpt at seoul site and there were no significant differences from the results of sat subsequently in this study the future scale parameters were determined to reflect the rate of change of sat or dpt simulated in present climate conditions and sat or dpt simulated in future climate conditions for example the scale parameter representing present climate conditions at namhae site can be determined as follows 10 α i e x p a b s a t o where sat o is the average of all sats observed in the days when pot excesses occurred in addition the scale parameter representing climate conditions in the future year y at namhae site can be given as follows 11 α i e x p a b s a t y where sat y is conceptually the average of sats simulated in days when pot excesses occur in the future year y and can be determined as follows 12 sat y s a t o δ sat y where δ sat y can be obtained by using eq 8 used in the trend analysis of sat a similar method using eqs 10 12 can be used for the sites where dpt was chosen as a co variate to determine the scale parameters of gpd representing present and future climate conditions for reference in the non stationary frequency analysis using co variate a form such as eqs 4 or 11 has been found in many literatures tramblay et al 2012 tramblay et al 2013 um et al 2017 this was conceived from an exponential regression approach where precipitation p is related to change in temperature δ t as p 2 p 1 1 γ δ t such that γ 0 068 is equivalent to clausius clapeyron like scaling of 6 8 c at 25 c that expresses the relationship between temperature and the logarithm of rainfall depth hardwick jones et al 2010 lepore et al 2015 ali and mishra 2017 sim et al 2019 and many others fig 10 shows the time evolution of the scale parameter of gpd at namhae site derived from various climate models regardless of the applied climate model it can be found that the scale parameter increases gradually toward the future since the scale parameter of gpd is proportional to the mean of pot excesses the increase in the scale parameter toward the future means that pot excesses also increase toward the future also since the scale parameter affects not only the mean of pot excesses but also the standard deviation the larger return period is the greater the increase in the future design rainfall depth is as can be seen from eq 3 this is illustrated in fig 11 the longer the return period the greater the rate of change in future design rainfall depths is consistent with the results of many studies including ganguli and coulibaly 2017 for each of the 16 projected future sats and dpts future design rainfall depths for various return periods were estimated from the chosen non stationary models see table 4 the non stationary models were applied to 52 sites out of 60 sites in the remaining eight sites it was assumed that climate change had no impact on rainfall extremes meanwhile for each of the 16 projected future daily rainfall time series future design rainfall depths for various return periods were also estimated from the stationary gpd model whose parameters estimated by using pot excesses simulated for the future period 2021 2050 in addition for each of daily rainfall time series simulated in present climate conditions eight ensembles at each site present design rainfall depths for various return periods were also estimated from the stationary gpd model whose parameters estimated by using pot excesses simulated for the present period 1981 2010 fig 12 shows the rate of change of the design rainfall depth estimated from co variate sat or dpt based non stationary models blue box plot and the rate of change of the design rainfall depth estimated using future annual maximum series directly red box plot the method of indirectly estimating the rate of change of rainfall extremes using the future sat or dpt made the difference of the rate of change derived from each climate model much smaller than the method of estimating the rate of change of the rainfall extremes directly using the future annual maximum series besides the difference in the rate of change between sites was projected to be relatively small the spatial range of the ensemble average of the rate of change was 5 to 30 under rcp 4 5 and 10 to 25 under rcp 8 5 when future annual maximum series were used directly it has also been found that the rate of change of the design rainfall depth derived from a specific climate model at several sites exceeds 100 on the other hand when using the sat or dpt the range was within 20 regardless of the rcp scenario from these results it could be more reasonable to use the projection results of future sat or dpt to investigate the behavior of future design rainfall depth changes for reference the average rate of change in the nation derived from the proposed method was calculated as 12 in other words future rainfall extremes were projected to increase by 12 over present rainfall extremes 4 discussion 4 1 future climate scenarios it is assumed that the relationship between temperature and rainfall does not change in future climates we agree that whatever the form of temperature and rainfall in future climates will differ from the past research results on this are also found chen et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 pfahl et al 2017 and many others however it is unreasonable to derive the results by reflecting these aspects in this study this assumption is not only used in this study confidence in predicting future rainfall extremes of gcms or rcms at a given site is generally low and one of the attractive alternatives could be the method proposed by lenderink and attema 2015 a method of directly applying past temperature sensitivity scaling to future rainfall extremes estimates this concept is based on the fact that gcms or rcms produce more reliable and consistent results on temperature changes under climate change scenarios romps 2011 o gorman 2012 manola et al 2018 dahm et al 2019 sim et al 2019 this study assumes that temperature is the main climatic variable associated with rainfall extremes changes this is based on a variety of studies in which temperature is the recommended co variate for predicting rainfall extremes and temperature sensitivity implicitly explains the dynamical factors agilan and umamahesh 2017 ali and mishra 2017 wasko and sharma 2017 these studies also consequently assume that the relationship between temperature and rainfall in the past does not change in future climates rainfall is related to temperature on a monthly zhao and khalil 1993 trenberth and shea 2005 king et al 2014 and daily lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 utsumi et al 2011 wasko and sharma 2014 basis changes in temperature can be attributed to storm intensity lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 wasko and sharma 2015 wasko et al 2016 type berg et al 2009 2013 and duration panthou et al 2014 wasko et al 2015 temperature has been also used as a co variate to project rainfall in future climates bates et al 2015 lenderink and attema 2015 wasko and sharma 2017 this study proposes a method to quantify future rainfall extremes using reliable temperature outputs of rcms johnson and sharma 2009 kendon et al 2008 stephens et al 2010 without depending on less reliable rainfall extremes outputs of gcms or rcms johnson and sharma 2009 for this purpose the effects of climate change on rainfall extremes have been investigated using information from trend analysis of temperature under climate change conditions in other words the temporal analogues approach i e palutikof et al 1987 krasovskaia and gottschalk 1992 was chosen among the various methodologies in the literature for creating future climate scenarios based on this frequently used methodology liuzzo and freni 2015 linear variability detected by trend analysis was used for climate projections see eqs 8 and 9 this assumes that future climate will have the same variability except for a linear trend if the aim is to study the effects of climate change on relatively small spatial scales such as the korean peninsula extrapolation of trends can be considered a valuable approach since climate is a powerful nonlinear system it is true that there are doubts about defining future climate scenarios like this however some assumptions are inevitable in the creation of future climate scenarios it is important to remember that future climate scenarios are only one of all possible climate realizations and are not intended to explicitly represent the actual future climate 4 2 uncertainty ensemble average and decision making how to reflect the impact of climate change on the estimation of design rainfall has been an old task for water practitioners and water policy makers in the early years future design rainfall was estimated using rainfall data projected from one climate model seo et al 2015 but since then it has been established that it is desirable to use the ensemble predicted by various climate models li et al 2017 in general there is no practical technique of identifying the ideal size of a climate model ensemble although some methods are established to optimize climate model predictions for the future based on present climate performance and give it the associated weight giorgi and mearns 2002 nevertheless a large multi model ensemble is needed to quantify all aspects of uncertainty in a probabilistic way in future climate change hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2017 at this point we looked back at the old task of water practitioners and water policy makers the reason why many researchers apply an ensemble approach based on several climate models and try to obtain better ensembles is to determine how much change factor in future design rainfall will eventually be we agree that different future scenarios are referring to different populations however it was thought that the change factor for water policy would eventually have to be given a single value at least at a single point and this single value would be ensemble averaging no matter what method was taken it is at this point that we have a problem if the deviation of ensemble members is too large i e the uncertainty is too large the policy decision by the ensemble average i e change factor will lose credibility looking at existing literatures xu et al 2012 so et al 2017 and many others and the results of this study see fig 12 that used directly future rainfall data to study future rainfall extremes future rainfall extremes at a specific site may increase in some climate models and decrease in other climate models and the spatial patterns of rate of change also vary widely depending on the climate model this great uncertainty prevents the outputs produced by many experts from gaining public confidence it is true that such very large deviations i e uncertainties are creating a lot of confusion in establishing climate change adaptation measures uncertainties about future projections should be taken into account when establishing acceptable climate change adaptation measures but it is very difficult to interpret these uncertainties and incorporate them into the decision making process nevertheless uncertainties about climate change scenarios should not be used as arguments to prevent the development of adaptation strategies in practice one of the urgent tasks facing water experts is to develop an adaptation strategy that is acceptable from these uncertain outcomes for future climates mailhot and duchesne 2010 it is impossible to verify future changes but it seems physically feasible that the rate of change in rainfall extremes should be spatially consistent one of the major constraints in changing design rainfall depth to reflect anthropogenic climate change is the lack of spatial coherence for future changes in design rainfall depth as found in this study see fig 12 this is because spatially consistent change signals are essential for changing legal guidelines that reflect climate change in design rainfall estimation li et al 2017 when considering future climate change the difference between the non stationary approach using future sat or dpt as a co variate and the stationary based approach using future rainfall extremes directly can be explained more clearly in fig 13 fig 13 a shows the ensemble average of the rate of change estimated using future annual maximum series obtained from the same gcm the change in future rainfall extreme was very different depending on which gcm was based the application of future annual maximum series obtained from hadgem2 ao was projected to result in a significant increase in rainfall extremes in the southern region on the other hand if future annual maximum series obtained from epi esm lr were applied the rainfall extremes in the northwestern inland region were projected to decrease significantly in particular the results from the two gcms in the northwestern inland region were dramatically different while hadgem2 ao projected future design rainfall depth to increase up to 30 future design rainfall depth projected from epi esm lr was projected to decrease up to 10 the spatial extent of the nationwide rate of change of design rainfall depth was relatively large ranging from 20 to 60 although not shown in the figure the difference in rate of change for rcp scenarios was difficult to discern fig 13 b shows the ensemble average of the rate of change estimated by the non stationary model with co variate of sat or dpt obtained from the same gcm it can be found that the difference depending on which gcm was based is greatly reduced regardless of the gcms applied rainfall extremes in the southern and northeastern regions were projected to increase relatively more the spatial extent of the rate of change was 0 15 for reference the rate of change is larger in rcp 8 5 than in rcp 4 5 in order to more directly compare the difference between the non stationary approach using future sat or dpt as a co variate and the stationary based approach using future rainfall extremes directly the rate of change obtained from a combination of specific climate models was plotted in fig 14 it is possible to recognize that very different projection results can be obtained when the rcm is different even though the same gcm is applied see fig 14 a for instance the rate of change of the future design rainfall depth at jinju site was 45 for regcm4 and 15 for rsm respectively the spatial range of the rate of change estimated by regcm4 was 20 to 60 while the spatial range of the rate of change estimated by rsm was 10 to 30 in addition hadgem2 ao regcm4 was expected to reduce rainfall extremes in the southwestern region but the results from hadgem2 ao rsm showed that rainfall extremes in almost all regions are likely to increase relatively evenly as shown in fig 14 b the non stationary approach using future sat or dpt as a co variate did not have a significant difference in rage of change even when other rcms were applied the biggest difference between 60 sites was seogwipo site but the difference of rage of change was only 2 58 8 75 for regcm4 and 6 17 for rsm the spatial pattern of the rate of change can also be found to be similar to the two climate model combinations to summarize the above results in the case of stationary based approach using future rainfall extremes directly projection results for future rainfall extremes were obtained very differently depending on which gcm rcm combination was applied also the spatial pattern of the rate of change of the design rainfall depth was very different for each gcm rcm combination in addition the rate of change at some sites was projected to be such an unbelievable value it would be very difficult to establish a climate change adaptation plan at the national level to reflect these results on the other hand in the case of non stationary approach using sat or dpt as a co variate projections of relatively consistent future rainfall extremes were obtained regardless of gcm rcm combination in addition the rate of change was also expected to be sufficiently realistic these facts suggest that it may be more reasonable to base future sat or dpt than to use uncertain future rainfall extremes directly when estimating design rainfall depth considering future climate change 5 conclusions in most studies the approach to looking at future rainfall extremes has taken the future rainfall data from gcms or rcms as future observations however gcms and rcms have been shown to generate significant bias and uncertainty in relation to rainfall extremes and very large deviations between the statistics of rainfall extremes obtained using future rainfall time series produced from a variety of climate models have led to much confusion in establishing climate change adaptation measures looking at future rainfall extremes at a particular site may lead to increasing trends in some climate models and decreasing trends in others the spatial patterns of rate of change in rainfall extremes also vary widely depending on the climate model this uncertainty prevents outputs from many experts from gaining public confidence we believe that this failure to achieve credibility does not come from a lack of theory or technique but from an approach that persuades the general public with uncertain future rainfall extremes in this study we proposed a new approach that integrates future sat and dpt projection information with co variate based non stationary pot gpd models identified at each site to obtain future rainfall extremes ensemble the idea of using sat or dpt as a co variate has already been studied in many literatures however most of the applications to climate change have been based on hypothetical scenarios in this study the future sat and dpt simulated by driving various climate models were applied to obtain future rainfall extremes unlike the abm method which uses only one data each year the pot method can increase the number of data used for analysis thus providing the advantage of high reliability for the estimated parameters and quantiles on the other hand there is a disadvantage that the results obtained are sensitive to the threshold for making pot series to solve this problem this study devised a method to determine the threshold of the pot approach that can best reproduce the design rainfall depth estimated by the abm approach as a result of applying the so called comparative search method to the 60 sites operated by kma the pot threshold for reproducing the design rainfall depth of the abm approach was determined within the appropriate threshold range indicated in the mean residual life plot at almost all sites given the fact that the abm approach has been applied in practice much more if the design rainfall depth estimated using the pot approach differs significantly from the design rainfall depth estimated using the abm approach practical problems will arise in practice therefore using the comparative search method to determine the threshold of the pot would be one of the practically useful methods the question of which co variates to apply in determining the design rainfall depth considering climate change is relatively clearly identified because of the limited information provided by climate models e g sat dpt and many others the question that arises is how to determine the lead time of co variates associated with rainfall extremes as can be seen from the results of this study how many days before the date of occurrence of pot excesses is set as the co variate of pot excesses plays an important role in the performance of the constructed model as a result of the 60 sites the number of sites better suited to coping with dpt was greater than that of sat the lead time was longer for the sat than for the dpt and many sites had a lead time longer than one day in light of the characteristics of rainfall in korea which is a monsoon climate region in east asia it was analyzed due to the surface cooling effect in rainfall extremes the pot approach can play an important role in reflecting the non stationarity of rainfall extremes the temporal trend of korea s daily amr time series has been reported to be difficult to detect a marked increase or decrease in trends in addition although not presented in this study there are not many sites that can detect the non stationarity of amr time series even if co variates are applied the reasons vary but the number of data used in the analysis may be one of the causes as the threshold of the pot approach was set to a relatively small value i e as the number of pot excesses increased the non stationarity based on co variates tended to be more clearly detected in the pot series of 52 of the 60 sites operated by kma the non stationary pot model was found to be more suitable than the stationary pot model since the estimated design rainfall depth in the non stationary frequency analysis using co variates has various values in response to the co variates an empirical probability distribution of the design rainfall depth can be derived in response to the probability distribution of the applied co variate these characteristics could play an important role in quantifying the uncertainty in design rainfall depth in light of climate change the behavior of future rainfall extremes obtained from various climate models varies greatly depending on the climate model used but the behavior of future sat and dpt is relatively consistent regardless of climate model one of the major constraints in changing design rainfall depths to reflect anthropogenic climate change is the lack of spatial coherence for future design rainfall depth changes this is because spatially consistent change signals are essential for establishing legal guidelines that reflect climate change in design rainfall depth estimation therefore future rainfall extremes behavior can be more reasonably projected if future sat or dpt behavior is reflected in a co variate based non stationary model constructed using the observed data characteristics in this line establishing a way to reflect the behavior of future co variates is one of the remaining tasks in this study a method of establishing co variates in future climate conditions was devised based on the rate of change of future yearly sat or dpt time series the linear trend analysis of the future yearly sat or dpt time series derived from various climate models was reflected in the non stationary pot gpd model constructed from the observed data from which projected changes in future design rainfall depth were considered as a result of applying various future climate information ensembles the spatial deviation between the rate of change in design rainfall depth for 50 year of return period in 2050 was within 10 in other words the spatial distribution of the rate of change derived from the co variate based non stationary pot gpd model was projected to be consistent regardless of which climate model was applied this deviation is much smaller than the spatial variation in the rate of change of design rainfall depth estimated from future rainfall extremes outputs of various climate models since the spatial distribution of the rate of change derived from a stationarity based approach that directly uses future rainfall extremes outputs from various climate models is very different depending on what climate model is applied it is practically difficult to expect such results to be accepted in national water resource climate change planning therefore investigating the behavior of future rainfall extremes using future sat or dpt projection results such as the one presented in this study would be one of the reasonable approaches finally it should be noted that the approach or results of this study do not mean that using temperature data is scientifically superior to using rainfall data simulated from climate models since temperatures are much less variable in time and space than rainfall although scaling studies at various temperature rainfall extremes have been reported the application of sat or dpt as a co variate for rainfall extremes is likely to introduce undesired excessive smoothness in rainfall extremes this may be a controversial issue that can be raised in almost all rainfall frequency analyzes based on co variates it should be emphasized that one of the tasks given to us now is to establish an acceptable scientific basis for practical climate change adaptation policies as mentioned above the approach proposed in this study can be convincingly accepted by the general public at such a level that the reliability of the rainfall data simulated from climate models is not assured based on this credibility the proposed approach is expected to contribute to the establishment of a reasonable climate change adaptation policy declaration of competing interest the authors

5592,concerns about climate change are amplifying interest in future rainfall extremes however there are big differences between the statistics of rainfall extremes obtained using future rainfall time series produced from various climate models such large uncertainties create a lot of confusion in establishing climate change adaptation measures looking at future rainfall extremes at a particular site yields increasing trends in some climate models and decreasing trends in others the spatial patterns of rate of change in rainfall extremes also vary widely depending on the climate model as a result they often do not gain the public s trust we believe that this difficulty in obtaining credibility does not come from a lack of theory or technique but from an approach that persuades the public of uncertain future rainfall extremes in this study we employed a novel approach to integrate a co variate of the not stationary peak over threshold pot generalized pareto distribution gpd model identified at each site with its future projection information for obtaining future rainfall extreme ensembles rainfall extremes are obtained from the observed rainfall time series using the pot method and the scale parameter among gpd parameters are applied as a function of surface air temperature sat or dew point temperature dpt at this time the threshold of the pot series is set to match the results of frequency analysis of the annual maximum series and the pot series for each site as much as possible the behavior of future rainfall extremes is analyzed by inputting the future sat or dat produced from various climate models into the non stationary frequency model using the co variate as a result of comparing the rainfall extremes obtained using the future rainfall time series directly with the future rainfall extremes obtained indirectly using the proposed method it was found that the proposed approach projected future design rainfall depths with much less variation between climate models the spatial pattern of rate of change was also consistent regardless of climate model the proposed method is expected to contribute to the public s confidence in future rainfall extremes under climate change scenarios and to be of practical help in formulating reasonable climate change adaptation policies keywords non stationary frequency analysis pot co variate climate change rainfall extremes 1 introduction since the 1950s many changes have been observed in climate phenomena including the frequent occurrence of extreme weather pachauri et al 2014 in recent decades surface air temperature sat has been continuously rising due to global warming and the frequency of rainfall extremes is increasing min et al 2011 cheng et al 2014 according to hettiarachchi et al 2018 rising temperatures due to climate change will exacerbate further damage from rainfall extremes since sat increases the amount of water in the atmosphere it directly affects the occurrence and intensity of rainfall events trenberth 2011 kunkel et al 2013 lee and kim 2018 in particular rainfall extremes in mid latitude regions are expected to increase due to global warming pall et al 2007 choi et al 2019 and the clausius clapeyron relationship provides a physical basis for understanding the sensitivity of rainfall extremes to global warming rate of change in future design rainfall depth using non stationary model with co variate and using stationary model with annual maximum series a rcp 4 5 and b rcp 8 5 the rate of change was based on the future year 2050 in most studies the approach to look at future rainfall extremes has taken a methodology that regards future rainfall data derived from global climate models gcms or regional climate models rcms as future observed data huntingford et al 2003 mailhot et al 2007 hanel and buishand 2011 willems et al 2012 seo et al 2015 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2017 and many others in other words most methods for estimating rainfall in future climates have focused on the down scaling outputs of gcms or rcms for hydrological applications through dynamic or statistical models prudhomme et al 2002 fowler et al 2007 maraun et al 2010 wilks 2010 however gcms and rcms have been shown to generate significant bias and uncertainty in relation to rainfall extremes alam and elshorbagy 2015 ning and bradley 2016 farnham et al 2018 therefore the reliability of future rainfall extremes at a particular site is generally low as can be seen from the results of fowler et al 2007 very different future rainfall extremes projections were obtained depending on what rcm was applied one attractive alternative proposed by lenderink and attema 2015 is the direct application of past temperature sensitivity scaling to future rainfall extremes estimates this concept is based on the fact that gcms or rcms produce more reliable and consistent results on temperature changes under climate change scenarios romps 2011 o gorman 2012 manola et al 2018 dahm et al 2019 sim et al 2019 according to diallo et al 2012 which investigated the behavior of future sat and rainfall based on a multi model gcm rcm ensemble the sat showed consistent future changes between climate models but the rainfall showed different future changes depending on gcms or rcms applied this study assumes that temperature is the main climatic variable associated with rainfall extremes changes this is based on previous findings that temperature is the recommended co variate for predicting rainfall and that temperature sensitivity implicitly explains the dynamics agilan and umamahesh 2017 ali and mishra 2017 wasko and sharma 2017 from these studies looking at the response of rainfall extremes to climate change from observed temperature and rainfall data will be one of the rational approaches o gorman 2012 in general frequency analysis is often used to quantify rainfall extremes in most water related design practices frequency analysis has been performed under the stationary assumption of rainfall data many studies that estimate the future design rainfall using frequency analysis considering climate change also estimate the future design rainfall from the frequency analysis of future rainfall data under the stationary assumption these studies assume that future rainfall data is stationary within future periods e g 2021 2050 divided at subjective intervals xu et al 2012 seo et al 2015 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2017 li et al 2017 so et al 2017 and many others however since the term climate change itself means that the stationary assumption is no longer valid studies on non stationary frequency analysis have been actively conducted beguería et al 2011 min et al 2011 westra et al 2013 sun et al 2015 mondal and mujumdar 2016 madsen et al 2017 gregersen et al 2017 and many others in non stationary frequency analysis time varying parameters are applied to probability distribution function pdf so that the non stationary nature of the data can be considered salas and obeysekera 2013 diffenbaugh et al 2017 time varying parameters are applied to various types of functions pdf s shape parameters are often set to constant lópez and francés 2013 but location or scale parameters are often considered to be functions of time or co variate non stationary models have been reported to provide more accurate results than stationary models mailhot et al 2007 and due to advances in numerical techniques for parameter estimation of pdfs the performance of non stationary models has been greatly improved over the last decade tramblay et al 2013 in addition recent studies have shown that non stationary frequency analysis using temperature related meteorological variables including el nino southern oscillation enso or sat dew point temperature dpt has been performed el adlouni et al 2007 lópez and francés 2013 losada et al 2012 examined the variation of precipitation patterns in response to sea surface temperature and enso and tramblay et al 2013 used the monthly sat as a co variate to examine the changes in design rainfall depth considering future climate change scenarios in addition agilan and umamahesh 2017 performed non stationary frequency analysis of generalized extreme value gev model in response to enso cycle however most existing studies have focused on constructing non stationary models of observational data tramblay et al 2012 mondal and mujumdar 2015 agilan and umamahesh 2017 salas et al 2018 and many others applications to climate change are mostly studies using hypothetical scenarios tramblay et al 2013 yilmaz et al 2014 sarhadi and soulis 2017 and many others based on several studies related to non stationary frequency analysis using sat or dpt as a co variate we derive future extreme rainfall ensemble by applying various future climate information on co variates directly to a non stationary frequency analysis in other words in this study we employed a novel approach to integrate a co variate of the not stationary peak over threshold pot generalized pareto distribution gpd model identified at each site with its future projection information for obtaining future rainfall extreme ensembles pot excesses are obtained using the pot method from the daily rainfall data of 60 sites operated by korea meteorological administration kma and the gpd whose scale parameter is a function of co variate is applied sat or dpt is used as a co variate for gpd and future sat and dpt ensemble obtained from various climate models are applied to non stationary models it is investigated that such empirical non stationary models between pot excess and sat or dpt can be used in building scenarios for future rainfall extremes possibly providing actionable information for policy makers or engineers we think the proposed approach therefore has potential for applications in future flood risk assessments where the available rainfall extremes obtained in most climate models are at present highly uncertain 2 methods 2 1 study area and meteorological data study area is the south korea region of the korean peninsula and the observation data of 60 sites operated by kma were used fig 1 information about the sites used is shown in table 1 the data used were daily rainfall depth daily sat and daily dpt a large number of sites were applied in this study and the data periods are different for each site since the data period plays a decisive role in ensuring the reliability of the frequency analysis it was not considered appropriate to reduce the data period of specific sites in order to set the same data period of the applied sites indeed the reason we applied the pot approach is to increase the number of possible data to better express the non stationarity inherent in the data although not shown in this study it was confirmed that fixing the data period from 1973 to 2017 has no significant effect on subsequent results in general the impact of global warming is materialized through gcms and future climate information obtained from gcms is used as the most common result of climate change projection however since the spatial resolution of gcms is about several hundred kilometers it is not appropriate to interpret the climate phenomena necessary for water resources business therefore it is reasonable to analyze future rainfall extremes using data obtained by dynamically downscaling the results of gcms using rcms in this study 16 combinations of future data obtained from two gcms hadgem2 ao and mpi esm lr four rcms regcm4 rsm mm5 and wrf and two representative concentration pathways rcp climate change scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 were applied since climate models do not provide future dpts directly dpt was recalculated using sat specific humidity and surface pressure provided by climate models table 2 provides detailed information on future climate information used previous studies park et al 2011 seo et al 2015 and many others have shown that rainfall extremes in the korean peninsula are heavily affected by local topography and large scale transport of moisture from the ocean to the korean peninsula the spatial scale of most gcms and some rcms is too coarse to address rainfall extremes from local convection tryhorn and degaetano 2011 rosa and collins 2013 therefore high resolution rcms are often used to simulate the evolution of rainfall extremes that occur below the spatial resolution of gcms and to identify potential changes in design rainfall kendon et al 2012 ban et al 2014 however a common problem with using rcm outputs directly in hydrological impact studies is that simulated rainfall extremes often present significant biases teutschbein and seibert 2010 arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 rcm biases can arise from errors in internal rcm physics or lateral boundary conditions provided by reanalysis data and gcm schoetter et al 2012 chen et al 2013 therefore bias correction is often necessary to match the rcm simulated rainfall with observations li et al 2017 for this reason tramblay et al 2013 recommended using a combination of dynamic down scaling and bias correction to analyze future scenarios of rainfall extremes various bias correction techniques themeßl et al 2012 lenderink and fowler 2017 and many others have been developed in this study the quantile mapping technique verified by many studies lee and kim 2018 choi et al 2019 sim et al 2019 and many others was applied the bias correction process using the quantile mapping technique was performed by site and month for reference the probability distribution required for the quantile mapping technique was determined by non parametric method using kernel smoothing technique however when performing bias correction of the annual maximum daily rainfall time series extracted from rcms the gev distribution was applied as the probability distribution required by the quantile mapping technique 2 2 generalized pareto distribution in general rainfall frequency analysis is performed using annual block maxima abm or pot approaches in abm approach it is often assumed that the annual maximum rainfall depth amr follows gev distribution and various studies have been conducted on this subject martins and stedinger 2000 katz et al 2002 gellens 2002 towler et al 2010 katz 2013 cheng et al 2014 since the abm approach considers only one event per year and completely ignores the information contained in other data many pot approaches have been studied that allow the selection of reasonable extreme events davison and smith 1990 roth et al 2012 gregersen et al 2015 liuzzo and freni 2015 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2017 and many others in other words since the pot approach creates larger data sets to enable more accurate parameter estimation of extreme value distributions several studies recommend using pot excesses instead of annual maxima as the extreme rainfall data input for frequency analysis re and barros 2009 tramblay et al 2013 yilmaz et al 2014 and many others pot excesses are generally assumed to be gpd coles et al 2001 in this study pot gpd was applied the cumulative probability distribution function cdf f x of gpd is given as follows hosking and wallis 1987 1 f x 1 1 k x x o α 1 k where the range of the random variable x is x o x α is the scale parameter and k is the shape parameter k 0 the threshold x o of gpd should be determined in advance the random variable x has a value larger than x o and the occurrence of x is assumed to follow the poisson distribution described by the annual incidence λ the annual incidence λ can be defined as the number of selected observations x x o divided by the observation years in order to ensure the independence of pot excesses observation data larger than x o should be set not to be consecutively selected ensuring this many studies perform de clustering procedures based on the time span between extreme events madsen et al 2002 ghosh and mallick 2011 roth et al 2012 gregersen et al 2017 and many others in this study individual storm events were first isolated from the daily rainfall time series applied inter event time definition is 1 day see kim and han 2010 then one storm event was set to select at most one daily rainfall depth as pot excesses since this event based separation procedure is performed before performing the pot approach it is valid regardless of the selected pot series censoring gregersen et al 2017 for reference the threshold of pot series was assumed to be stationary in this study there are studies considering the non stationarity of the threshold of pot series see tramblay et al 2012 but we gave the non stationarity only to the scale parameter of the gpd although various methods can be used to estimate parameters of gpd the maximum likelihood parameter estimation method is applied in this study considering that parameter estimation should be easy even when the scale parameter α is a function of co variate the parameters of gpd were estimated using an optimization technique that minimizes the negative log likelihood function nllh as follows 2 nllh n l n α 1 k i 1 n 1 k l n 1 k x i x o α where n is the number of pot excesses in this study a genetic algorithm was used for the optimization technique the design rainfall depth x t corresponding return period t year can be calculated as follows 3 x t x o α k 1 λ t k traditionally gpd assumes that observations are under a stationary state but a stationary assumption can be mitigated by assuming that one or more parameters of gpd depend on the order of occurrence of pot excesses theoretically all the parameters of gpd can be applied as a function of the order of occurrence of pot excesses but in this study the scale parameter α is defined as a function of co variate as follows um et al 2017 4 α i e a b z i where i is the order of occurrence of pot excesses x i 1 to n and co variate z i is a meteorological variable corresponding to pot excesses x i therefore gpd shows various forms in response to co variate z parameters a and b can be estimated using an optimization procedure that minimizes the negative log likelihood function as follows 5 nllh i 1 n l n α i 1 k i 1 n 1 k l n 1 k x i x o α i 2 3 meteorological co variate and optimal model selection as seen in lepore et al 2015 there is a strong scaling relationship between rainfall extremes and sats or rainfall extremes and dpts in this study sat or dpt was applied as a co variate of non stationary gpd it is unreasonable that only the sat or dpt on the day of rainfall is applied as a co variate since the korean peninsula has a temporary cooling effect when most rainfall occurs in the summer and when storm events affected by the ocean occur ali and mishra 2017 therefore the sat or dpt of the preceding t day where t 0 1 6 before pot excesses occurred was selected as co variate candidates in other words seven non stationary gpd models using sat of the preceding t day seven non stationary gpd models using the preceding t day dpt and one stationary gpd model were constructed see table 3 among these 15 models the minimum aic akaike information criterion model was selected as the optimal model and the aic can be calculated as follows akaike 1974 6 aic 2 n l l h 2 k where nllh is calculated using eqs 2 or 5 and k is the number of parameters of the applied model k 2 for stationary model and k 3 for non stationary models the selection of the optimal model is identified by applying aic akaike 1973 1974 we aimed to objectively identify the leading days of the sat or dpt as non stationary properties of rainfall extremes using akaike information criterion the application of this criterion is simple because it only requires estimation of the likelihood function for the candidate model defined by eq 5 burnham and anderson 2002 aic provides an implicit interpretation of the principle of parsimony that is central to model selection box and jenkins 1970 aic has a firm foundation in information theory from a mathematical point of view iliopoulou et al 2018 the procedure for identifying non stationarity and selecting the best model for each site are as follows 1 pot excesses and date data on occurrence of pot excesses to construct 15 models 2 determine gpd applicability 2 1 determine if scale parameter of gpd is negative 2 2 determination of adequacy of threshold of pot series see section 3 1 later 3 construct sat and dpt data of the preceding t day where t 0 1 6 from the day of the occurrence of pot excesses for the gpd applicable sites 4 parameter estimation for 15 models 5 aic is calculated for the candidate models 6 selecting the best co variate sat or dpt and preceding t day by comparing the resulting aic values or selecting the stationary model as the best model based on the resulting aic values 3 results and discussion 3 1 threshold selection in pot analysis threshold x o plays an important role in estimating model parameters and obtaining accurate estimates of design rainfall depth bader et al 2018 the threshold should be chosen high enough that pot excesses are sufficient to approximate gpd however selection of too high a threshold can increase the error of the estimated values of model parameters and design rainfall depth by reducing the sample size various methods have been proposed to select an appropriate threshold caeiro and gomes 2015 langousis et al 2016 bader et al 2018 and a suitable threshold was selected by plots and statistical indexes scarrott and macdonald 2012 in this study the mean residual life plot which is commonly used among various threshold selection methods was applied preferentially coles et al 2001 in addition the frequency analysis of rainfall extremes is mainly applied to gpd model of pot approach and gev model of abm approach therefore in this study the threshold of pot series is selected to estimate the design rainfall similar to the design rainfall obtained from the abm approach because the abm approach is the standard for the estimation of design rainfall depth in korea for direct comparison with the design rainfall depth obtained from the abm approach we determined that this setting was an essential and practical choice however since the stability of the parameter estimates should be ensured an unconditional threshold setting by comparison with the abm approach should be avoided coles et al 2001 katz et al 2002 tramblay et al 2013 therefore the threshold set by comparison with the abm approach needs to be compared with various rules of thumb including the mean residual life plot dumouchel 1983 ferreira et al 2003 bader et al 2018 we estimated the design rainfall depths of various return periods by applying pot excesses constructed from various thresholds to the stationary gpd model and then compared with the corresponding design rainfall depths estimated by applying amr to gev model the threshold that gives the smallest deviation between design rainfall depths estimated by the two approaches was chosen preferentially in addition the final threshold was determined after checking whether the selected threshold corresponds to be in a reasonable threshold range derived from the mean residual life plot the deviation diff between gpd model and gev model can be calculated as follows 7 diff 1 11 i 1 x t i gpd x t i gev 2 where x t i gpd is the design rainfall depth of return period t i year estimated using gpd model and x t i gev is the design rainfall depth of return period t i year estimated using gev model a total of 11 return periods including 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 and 200 years were used for the calculation of eq 7 fig 2 shows the mean residual life plot to obtain pot excesses as can be seen in fig 2 seoul site showed a curved section ranging from 0 to 40 mm so a range of 0 to 40 mm was excluded from the threshold candidates also since the number of pot excesses was smaller than the number of amrs in the range exceeding 110 mm upper limit in fig 2 a ranges of 110 mm or more were excluded from the threshold candidates a range of 40 80 mm in which the straight line segment appeared could be found to be in the appropriate threshold range within this range a threshold that minimizes the deviation between gpd model and gev model see eq 7 was finally determined x o 53 mm for seoul site the thresholds of the remaining sites including tongyeong site x o 78 mm were also determined through a similar analysis fig 3 shows the design rainfall depths corresponding to various return periods estimated at 52 sites where the gpd was analyzed as appropriate for reference it was found that deviation in the design rainfall estimates obtained using pot and abm approaches was in the range of 0 1 to 5 01 at all sites where gpd was appropriate 3 2 non stationary frequency analysis non stationary frequency analysis was performed using pot excesses constructed by applying the threshold determined in section 3 1 the optimal model was selected from the aic results of the 15 models listed in table 3 see table 4 table 4 shows the aic values for identifying non stationarity for 60 sites according to burnham and anderson 2002 the difference daic between the aic value of the best non stationary model and the aic value of the stationary model can be calculated from the results of the calculated daic both the stationary and non stationary model can be applied at sites where the daic is less than 2 whereas the non stationary model should be used at the sites where the daic is greater than 10 on the other hand it is preferable to use a non stationary model at sites where 2 daic 10 iliopoulou et al 2018 of the 60 sites used in this study a non stationary model was found to be applicable at 52 sites among these sites sat was selected as a co variate in 14 sites and dpt was selected in 38 sites most of the sats were selected 3 5 days prior to the occurrence of rainfall and dpt was mostly selected on the day of rainfall and 1 3 days before rainfall rainfall extremes in korea have shown mixed increasing and decreasing trends as reported in the previous researches kim et al 2017 choi et al 2019 however as can be seen in table 4 it is worth mentioning that the non stationarity of rainfall extremes cannot be assessed only based on a time series trend analysis table 4 shows rainfall extremes of 52 sites out of 60 sites have non stationary nature the performance of the non stationary gpd model over the observed pot excesses was evaluated for design rainfall depth of various return periods and design rainfall depth of return period 50 year were visually compared to the observed pot excesses see fig 4 the corresponding stationary design rainfall depth estimated from the stationary gpd model is also included horizontal dashed dotted blue line on the other hand the non stationary model s design rainfall depth fluctuated dashed dotted red line can be found to achieve various design rainfall depths in response to dpt the performance of the non stationary gpd model can be further highlighted by comparing the empirical pdfs of design rainfall depths obtained from the non stationary gpd model for two sat or dpt increasing scenarios that were selected as illustrative instances of climate change of lower and higher emission projections fig 5 shows the change in design rainfall depth for future sat or dpt increases as can be seen in fig 5 there is the obvious shift in the pdf between lower and higher emission scenarios as compared to the observed pdf it can be also found that there is a difference in the non exceedance probability of a certain rainfall depth between pdfs in addition since the non stationary model considering sat or dpt as a co variate can construct the distribution of the design rainfall depth corresponding to the distribution of the co variate the uncertainty of the design rainfall depth due to climate change can be quantitatively analyzed 3 3 design rainfall depth considering climate change in this section the estimated design rainfall depths directly using the future rainfall obtained from various climate models and the indirectly estimated design rainfall depths using the future sat or dpt were compared fig 6 shows the comparison procedure of the two methods sixteen future combinations were derived from various climate models and climate change scenarios future design rainfall depths were estimated after the bias of future rainfall sat and dpt was corrected using quantile mapping technique the trend analysis of projected sat and dpt was performed at each of 60 sites operated by kma first yearly sat and dpt time series were constructed by averaging yearly present and future daily sat and dpt time series produced by each of the 16 ensembles of rcp gcm rcm for each site from the yearly sat and dpt time series the trends of sat and dpt were analyzed using eqs 8 and 9 8 δ sat y β a y 2010 1 2 β b y 2010 2 9 δ dpt y β c y 2010 1 2 β d y 2010 2 where δ s a t y or δ d p t y is the yearly sat or dpt of the future year y minus the mean of the yearly sat or dpt time series for the present period 1981 2010 and the linear trend coefficients β a and β c and trend acceleration coefficients β b and β d were estimated using regression analysis in eqs 8 and 9 2010 represents the last year of the present period fig 7 a shows the observed present and future yearly sat time series and its trend curve derived in the form of eq 8 the trend acceleration component was not clearly seen but it was found that the linear trend component appeared clearly fig 7 b shows the rate of change of future sats obtained from the trend analysis of various future sat ensembles the sat is likely to increase in all future ensembles used and the sat growth rate is higher in rcp 8 5 scenarios than in rcp 4 5 scenarios on the other hand in terms of future rate of change compared to present the deviations between 16 future ensembles could be found not to be large fig 7 c and d show the results for dpt it was not significantly different from the sat pattern pot excesses of the daily rainfall depth were not suitable to use the same method as the trend analysis of sat and dpt due to the irregular nature of the rainfall time series instead in the case of pot excesses the overall degree of change between the mean of pot excesses in the present period and the mean of pot excesses in the future period was analyzed see fig 8 looking at fig 8 as a concept of rate of change the uncertainty of rainfall extremes simulated by rcms can be seen more clearly at the chupungreong site the rate of change in the mean of pot excesses is in the range of 11 to 25 for rcp 4 5 and 20 to 18 for rcp 8 5 the rate of change in the standard deviation of pot excesses is in the range of 23 to 83 for rcp 4 5 and 6 to 66 for rcp 8 5 the large uncertainty seen in the rate of change of the mean and standard deviation will propagate through the design rainfall depths that are subsequently calculated as a result of examining the present and future pot excesses at each of 60 sites it was difficult to find the consistency of rate of change by rcp scenarios as described above in the case of rainfall extremes inconsistent future projection results are usually derived depending on which climate model is applied so it would be a reasonable approach to look at changes in future rainfall extremes based on the increase in sat or dpt the problem posed when examining the changes of future pot excesses using the co variate based non stationary model is how much to reflect the increase or decrease in future sat or dpt for instance at namhae site when the scale parameter of gpd is composed of α i e x p a b sat i for namhae site the sat on the day when pot excesses occurred see table 4 the sat for estimating future scale parameters should be determined because of the lack of reliability of future rainfall extremes obtained from climate models as described above it was not reasonable to apply sat on the day of future pot excesses simulated from climate models as can be seen in fig 9 a regardless of rcp 4 5 or rcp 8 5 sats in future climate conditions are very likely to increase and future empirical cdfs can be found to take the form of a horizontally shifted present empirical cdf fig 9 b shows the empirical cdf of dpt at seoul site and there were no significant differences from the results of sat subsequently in this study the future scale parameters were determined to reflect the rate of change of sat or dpt simulated in present climate conditions and sat or dpt simulated in future climate conditions for example the scale parameter representing present climate conditions at namhae site can be determined as follows 10 α i e x p a b s a t o where sat o is the average of all sats observed in the days when pot excesses occurred in addition the scale parameter representing climate conditions in the future year y at namhae site can be given as follows 11 α i e x p a b s a t y where sat y is conceptually the average of sats simulated in days when pot excesses occur in the future year y and can be determined as follows 12 sat y s a t o δ sat y where δ sat y can be obtained by using eq 8 used in the trend analysis of sat a similar method using eqs 10 12 can be used for the sites where dpt was chosen as a co variate to determine the scale parameters of gpd representing present and future climate conditions for reference in the non stationary frequency analysis using co variate a form such as eqs 4 or 11 has been found in many literatures tramblay et al 2012 tramblay et al 2013 um et al 2017 this was conceived from an exponential regression approach where precipitation p is related to change in temperature δ t as p 2 p 1 1 γ δ t such that γ 0 068 is equivalent to clausius clapeyron like scaling of 6 8 c at 25 c that expresses the relationship between temperature and the logarithm of rainfall depth hardwick jones et al 2010 lepore et al 2015 ali and mishra 2017 sim et al 2019 and many others fig 10 shows the time evolution of the scale parameter of gpd at namhae site derived from various climate models regardless of the applied climate model it can be found that the scale parameter increases gradually toward the future since the scale parameter of gpd is proportional to the mean of pot excesses the increase in the scale parameter toward the future means that pot excesses also increase toward the future also since the scale parameter affects not only the mean of pot excesses but also the standard deviation the larger return period is the greater the increase in the future design rainfall depth is as can be seen from eq 3 this is illustrated in fig 11 the longer the return period the greater the rate of change in future design rainfall depths is consistent with the results of many studies including ganguli and coulibaly 2017 for each of the 16 projected future sats and dpts future design rainfall depths for various return periods were estimated from the chosen non stationary models see table 4 the non stationary models were applied to 52 sites out of 60 sites in the remaining eight sites it was assumed that climate change had no impact on rainfall extremes meanwhile for each of the 16 projected future daily rainfall time series future design rainfall depths for various return periods were also estimated from the stationary gpd model whose parameters estimated by using pot excesses simulated for the future period 2021 2050 in addition for each of daily rainfall time series simulated in present climate conditions eight ensembles at each site present design rainfall depths for various return periods were also estimated from the stationary gpd model whose parameters estimated by using pot excesses simulated for the present period 1981 2010 fig 12 shows the rate of change of the design rainfall depth estimated from co variate sat or dpt based non stationary models blue box plot and the rate of change of the design rainfall depth estimated using future annual maximum series directly red box plot the method of indirectly estimating the rate of change of rainfall extremes using the future sat or dpt made the difference of the rate of change derived from each climate model much smaller than the method of estimating the rate of change of the rainfall extremes directly using the future annual maximum series besides the difference in the rate of change between sites was projected to be relatively small the spatial range of the ensemble average of the rate of change was 5 to 30 under rcp 4 5 and 10 to 25 under rcp 8 5 when future annual maximum series were used directly it has also been found that the rate of change of the design rainfall depth derived from a specific climate model at several sites exceeds 100 on the other hand when using the sat or dpt the range was within 20 regardless of the rcp scenario from these results it could be more reasonable to use the projection results of future sat or dpt to investigate the behavior of future design rainfall depth changes for reference the average rate of change in the nation derived from the proposed method was calculated as 12 in other words future rainfall extremes were projected to increase by 12 over present rainfall extremes 4 discussion 4 1 future climate scenarios it is assumed that the relationship between temperature and rainfall does not change in future climates we agree that whatever the form of temperature and rainfall in future climates will differ from the past research results on this are also found chen et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 pfahl et al 2017 and many others however it is unreasonable to derive the results by reflecting these aspects in this study this assumption is not only used in this study confidence in predicting future rainfall extremes of gcms or rcms at a given site is generally low and one of the attractive alternatives could be the method proposed by lenderink and attema 2015 a method of directly applying past temperature sensitivity scaling to future rainfall extremes estimates this concept is based on the fact that gcms or rcms produce more reliable and consistent results on temperature changes under climate change scenarios romps 2011 o gorman 2012 manola et al 2018 dahm et al 2019 sim et al 2019 this study assumes that temperature is the main climatic variable associated with rainfall extremes changes this is based on a variety of studies in which temperature is the recommended co variate for predicting rainfall extremes and temperature sensitivity implicitly explains the dynamical factors agilan and umamahesh 2017 ali and mishra 2017 wasko and sharma 2017 these studies also consequently assume that the relationship between temperature and rainfall in the past does not change in future climates rainfall is related to temperature on a monthly zhao and khalil 1993 trenberth and shea 2005 king et al 2014 and daily lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 utsumi et al 2011 wasko and sharma 2014 basis changes in temperature can be attributed to storm intensity lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 wasko and sharma 2015 wasko et al 2016 type berg et al 2009 2013 and duration panthou et al 2014 wasko et al 2015 temperature has been also used as a co variate to project rainfall in future climates bates et al 2015 lenderink and attema 2015 wasko and sharma 2017 this study proposes a method to quantify future rainfall extremes using reliable temperature outputs of rcms johnson and sharma 2009 kendon et al 2008 stephens et al 2010 without depending on less reliable rainfall extremes outputs of gcms or rcms johnson and sharma 2009 for this purpose the effects of climate change on rainfall extremes have been investigated using information from trend analysis of temperature under climate change conditions in other words the temporal analogues approach i e palutikof et al 1987 krasovskaia and gottschalk 1992 was chosen among the various methodologies in the literature for creating future climate scenarios based on this frequently used methodology liuzzo and freni 2015 linear variability detected by trend analysis was used for climate projections see eqs 8 and 9 this assumes that future climate will have the same variability except for a linear trend if the aim is to study the effects of climate change on relatively small spatial scales such as the korean peninsula extrapolation of trends can be considered a valuable approach since climate is a powerful nonlinear system it is true that there are doubts about defining future climate scenarios like this however some assumptions are inevitable in the creation of future climate scenarios it is important to remember that future climate scenarios are only one of all possible climate realizations and are not intended to explicitly represent the actual future climate 4 2 uncertainty ensemble average and decision making how to reflect the impact of climate change on the estimation of design rainfall has been an old task for water practitioners and water policy makers in the early years future design rainfall was estimated using rainfall data projected from one climate model seo et al 2015 but since then it has been established that it is desirable to use the ensemble predicted by various climate models li et al 2017 in general there is no practical technique of identifying the ideal size of a climate model ensemble although some methods are established to optimize climate model predictions for the future based on present climate performance and give it the associated weight giorgi and mearns 2002 nevertheless a large multi model ensemble is needed to quantify all aspects of uncertainty in a probabilistic way in future climate change hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2017 at this point we looked back at the old task of water practitioners and water policy makers the reason why many researchers apply an ensemble approach based on several climate models and try to obtain better ensembles is to determine how much change factor in future design rainfall will eventually be we agree that different future scenarios are referring to different populations however it was thought that the change factor for water policy would eventually have to be given a single value at least at a single point and this single value would be ensemble averaging no matter what method was taken it is at this point that we have a problem if the deviation of ensemble members is too large i e the uncertainty is too large the policy decision by the ensemble average i e change factor will lose credibility looking at existing literatures xu et al 2012 so et al 2017 and many others and the results of this study see fig 12 that used directly future rainfall data to study future rainfall extremes future rainfall extremes at a specific site may increase in some climate models and decrease in other climate models and the spatial patterns of rate of change also vary widely depending on the climate model this great uncertainty prevents the outputs produced by many experts from gaining public confidence it is true that such very large deviations i e uncertainties are creating a lot of confusion in establishing climate change adaptation measures uncertainties about future projections should be taken into account when establishing acceptable climate change adaptation measures but it is very difficult to interpret these uncertainties and incorporate them into the decision making process nevertheless uncertainties about climate change scenarios should not be used as arguments to prevent the development of adaptation strategies in practice one of the urgent tasks facing water experts is to develop an adaptation strategy that is acceptable from these uncertain outcomes for future climates mailhot and duchesne 2010 it is impossible to verify future changes but it seems physically feasible that the rate of change in rainfall extremes should be spatially consistent one of the major constraints in changing design rainfall depth to reflect anthropogenic climate change is the lack of spatial coherence for future changes in design rainfall depth as found in this study see fig 12 this is because spatially consistent change signals are essential for changing legal guidelines that reflect climate change in design rainfall estimation li et al 2017 when considering future climate change the difference between the non stationary approach using future sat or dpt as a co variate and the stationary based approach using future rainfall extremes directly can be explained more clearly in fig 13 fig 13 a shows the ensemble average of the rate of change estimated using future annual maximum series obtained from the same gcm the change in future rainfall extreme was very different depending on which gcm was based the application of future annual maximum series obtained from hadgem2 ao was projected to result in a significant increase in rainfall extremes in the southern region on the other hand if future annual maximum series obtained from epi esm lr were applied the rainfall extremes in the northwestern inland region were projected to decrease significantly in particular the results from the two gcms in the northwestern inland region were dramatically different while hadgem2 ao projected future design rainfall depth to increase up to 30 future design rainfall depth projected from epi esm lr was projected to decrease up to 10 the spatial extent of the nationwide rate of change of design rainfall depth was relatively large ranging from 20 to 60 although not shown in the figure the difference in rate of change for rcp scenarios was difficult to discern fig 13 b shows the ensemble average of the rate of change estimated by the non stationary model with co variate of sat or dpt obtained from the same gcm it can be found that the difference depending on which gcm was based is greatly reduced regardless of the gcms applied rainfall extremes in the southern and northeastern regions were projected to increase relatively more the spatial extent of the rate of change was 0 15 for reference the rate of change is larger in rcp 8 5 than in rcp 4 5 in order to more directly compare the difference between the non stationary approach using future sat or dpt as a co variate and the stationary based approach using future rainfall extremes directly the rate of change obtained from a combination of specific climate models was plotted in fig 14 it is possible to recognize that very different projection results can be obtained when the rcm is different even though the same gcm is applied see fig 14 a for instance the rate of change of the future design rainfall depth at jinju site was 45 for regcm4 and 15 for rsm respectively the spatial range of the rate of change estimated by regcm4 was 20 to 60 while the spatial range of the rate of change estimated by rsm was 10 to 30 in addition hadgem2 ao regcm4 was expected to reduce rainfall extremes in the southwestern region but the results from hadgem2 ao rsm showed that rainfall extremes in almost all regions are likely to increase relatively evenly as shown in fig 14 b the non stationary approach using future sat or dpt as a co variate did not have a significant difference in rage of change even when other rcms were applied the biggest difference between 60 sites was seogwipo site but the difference of rage of change was only 2 58 8 75 for regcm4 and 6 17 for rsm the spatial pattern of the rate of change can also be found to be similar to the two climate model combinations to summarize the above results in the case of stationary based approach using future rainfall extremes directly projection results for future rainfall extremes were obtained very differently depending on which gcm rcm combination was applied also the spatial pattern of the rate of change of the design rainfall depth was very different for each gcm rcm combination in addition the rate of change at some sites was projected to be such an unbelievable value it would be very difficult to establish a climate change adaptation plan at the national level to reflect these results on the other hand in the case of non stationary approach using sat or dpt as a co variate projections of relatively consistent future rainfall extremes were obtained regardless of gcm rcm combination in addition the rate of change was also expected to be sufficiently realistic these facts suggest that it may be more reasonable to base future sat or dpt than to use uncertain future rainfall extremes directly when estimating design rainfall depth considering future climate change 5 conclusions in most studies the approach to looking at future rainfall extremes has taken the future rainfall data from gcms or rcms as future observations however gcms and rcms have been shown to generate significant bias and uncertainty in relation to rainfall extremes and very large deviations between the statistics of rainfall extremes obtained using future rainfall time series produced from a variety of climate models have led to much confusion in establishing climate change adaptation measures looking at future rainfall extremes at a particular site may lead to increasing trends in some climate models and decreasing trends in others the spatial patterns of rate of change in rainfall extremes also vary widely depending on the climate model this uncertainty prevents outputs from many experts from gaining public confidence we believe that this failure to achieve credibility does not come from a lack of theory or technique but from an approach that persuades the general public with uncertain future rainfall extremes in this study we proposed a new approach that integrates future sat and dpt projection information with co variate based non stationary pot gpd models identified at each site to obtain future rainfall extremes ensemble the idea of using sat or dpt as a co variate has already been studied in many literatures however most of the applications to climate change have been based on hypothetical scenarios in this study the future sat and dpt simulated by driving various climate models were applied to obtain future rainfall extremes unlike the abm method which uses only one data each year the pot method can increase the number of data used for analysis thus providing the advantage of high reliability for the estimated parameters and quantiles on the other hand there is a disadvantage that the results obtained are sensitive to the threshold for making pot series to solve this problem this study devised a method to determine the threshold of the pot approach that can best reproduce the design rainfall depth estimated by the abm approach as a result of applying the so called comparative search method to the 60 sites operated by kma the pot threshold for reproducing the design rainfall depth of the abm approach was determined within the appropriate threshold range indicated in the mean residual life plot at almost all sites given the fact that the abm approach has been applied in practice much more if the design rainfall depth estimated using the pot approach differs significantly from the design rainfall depth estimated using the abm approach practical problems will arise in practice therefore using the comparative search method to determine the threshold of the pot would be one of the practically useful methods the question of which co variates to apply in determining the design rainfall depth considering climate change is relatively clearly identified because of the limited information provided by climate models e g sat dpt and many others the question that arises is how to determine the lead time of co variates associated with rainfall extremes as can be seen from the results of this study how many days before the date of occurrence of pot excesses is set as the co variate of pot excesses plays an important role in the performance of the constructed model as a result of the 60 sites the number of sites better suited to coping with dpt was greater than that of sat the lead time was longer for the sat than for the dpt and many sites had a lead time longer than one day in light of the characteristics of rainfall in korea which is a monsoon climate region in east asia it was analyzed due to the surface cooling effect in rainfall extremes the pot approach can play an important role in reflecting the non stationarity of rainfall extremes the temporal trend of korea s daily amr time series has been reported to be difficult to detect a marked increase or decrease in trends in addition although not presented in this study there are not many sites that can detect the non stationarity of amr time series even if co variates are applied the reasons vary but the number of data used in the analysis may be one of the causes as the threshold of the pot approach was set to a relatively small value i e as the number of pot excesses increased the non stationarity based on co variates tended to be more clearly detected in the pot series of 52 of the 60 sites operated by kma the non stationary pot model was found to be more suitable than the stationary pot model since the estimated design rainfall depth in the non stationary frequency analysis using co variates has various values in response to the co variates an empirical probability distribution of the design rainfall depth can be derived in response to the probability distribution of the applied co variate these characteristics could play an important role in quantifying the uncertainty in design rainfall depth in light of climate change the behavior of future rainfall extremes obtained from various climate models varies greatly depending on the climate model used but the behavior of future sat and dpt is relatively consistent regardless of climate model one of the major constraints in changing design rainfall depths to reflect anthropogenic climate change is the lack of spatial coherence for future design rainfall depth changes this is because spatially consistent change signals are essential for establishing legal guidelines that reflect climate change in design rainfall depth estimation therefore future rainfall extremes behavior can be more reasonably projected if future sat or dpt behavior is reflected in a co variate based non stationary model constructed using the observed data characteristics in this line establishing a way to reflect the behavior of future co variates is one of the remaining tasks in this study a method of establishing co variates in future climate conditions was devised based on the rate of change of future yearly sat or dpt time series the linear trend analysis of the future yearly sat or dpt time series derived from various climate models was reflected in the non stationary pot gpd model constructed from the observed data from which projected changes in future design rainfall depth were considered as a result of applying various future climate information ensembles the spatial deviation between the rate of change in design rainfall depth for 50 year of return period in 2050 was within 10 in other words the spatial distribution of the rate of change derived from the co variate based non stationary pot gpd model was projected to be consistent regardless of which climate model was applied this deviation is much smaller than the spatial variation in the rate of change of design rainfall depth estimated from future rainfall extremes outputs of various climate models since the spatial distribution of the rate of change derived from a stationarity based approach that directly uses future rainfall extremes outputs from various climate models is very different depending on what climate model is applied it is practically difficult to expect such results to be accepted in national water resource climate change planning therefore investigating the behavior of future rainfall extremes using future sat or dpt projection results such as the one presented in this study would be one of the reasonable approaches finally it should be noted that the approach or results of this study do not mean that using temperature data is scientifically superior to using rainfall data simulated from climate models since temperatures are much less variable in time and space than rainfall although scaling studies at various temperature rainfall extremes have been reported the application of sat or dpt as a co variate for rainfall extremes is likely to introduce undesired excessive smoothness in rainfall extremes this may be a controversial issue that can be raised in almost all rainfall frequency analyzes based on co variates it should be emphasized that one of the tasks given to us now is to establish an acceptable scientific basis for practical climate change adaptation policies as mentioned above the approach proposed in this study can be convincingly accepted by the general public at such a level that the reliability of the rainfall data simulated from climate models is not assured based on this credibility the proposed approach is expected to contribute to the establishment of a reasonable climate change adaptation policy declaration of competing interest the authors

5593,the impoundment of a large riverine reservoir creates a series of tributary bays in its original tributaries the increase in the water level and decrease in the velocity may result in the degradation of the water quality in the tributary bays the thermal conditions can also change in the mainstream of the reservoir and tributary bays density flow induced by temperature differences often occurs in tributary bays which likely influences the water exchange between the tributary bays and mainstream of the reservoir and the nutrient concentration in the tributary bays to examine the seasonal variation in the circulation pattern and water exchange in the tributary bay a three dimensional numerical model was established for the lower reach of the xiangxi river a tributary of the three gorges reservoir the model was calibrated and validated using field measured data and the results indicate that it can be used to simulate the thermal hydrodynamic circulations in the tributary bay the model simulated results show that the water circulation patterns vary depending on the season the bottom layer intrusive currents from the three gorges reservoir generally occur in the normal running period and early discharging period while surface layer intrusive currents are dominant in the rest of the year and middle layer intrusive currents occasionally occur in the flooding period and early impounding period based on the model simulated results the water fluxes in the cross sections in the tributary bay were calculated and the factors controlling the fluxes were examined the results show that the thermal conditions in the tributary bay and mainstream of the reservoir are the predominant factors controlling the water exchange between the tributary bay and mainstream of the reservoir although the inflow from the tributary is relatively small the water exchange between the tributary bay and mainstream of the reservoir is significant the results show that that the water within the intrusion limit is renewed more than five times in an operation period however the water exchange in the upper reach of the tributary bay is weak especially during the discharging period of the three gorges reservoir this may be due to the combined effects of small inflow from the upper reach of the xiangxi river and weak intrusive currents from the mainstream of the three gorges reservoir in the upper reach of the tributary bay keywords temperature circulation flux water exchange tributary bay three gorges reservoir 1 introduction the three gorges dam tgd is a large dam located in the upper reach of the yangtze river yr it was impounded in 2003 the three gorges reservoir tgr formed along the main channel of the yr the tgr has been fully operated since 2010 its water level fluctuates between 145 and 175 m annually han et al 2018 due to the large inflow and pollution reduction algae blooms have not been observed in the mainstream of the yr since its impoundment the backwaters which are also present in the lower reaches of the tributaries of the tgr form tens of tributary bays in the upstream of the tgd since the initial impoundment of the tgr in 2003 algae blooms frequently occur in the tributary bays and thus the safety of the water usage and water quality are endangered cai and hu 2006 gao et al 2018 li et al 2008 2018 lian et al 2014 liu et al 2012a shao 2008 tang et al 2018 ye et al 2006 zhu et al 2013 the environmental problems have attracted the attention from the company running the reservoir government and scholars to improve the water quality and control the algae blooms in the tributary bays of the tgr many field observations holbach et al 2014 ye and cai 2011 zhao et al 2016 and numerical studies gao et al 2018 ji et al 2017 mao et al 2015 yu et al 2018 have been conducted to explore the algae bloom mechanism in the tributary bays previous studies indicated that the algae blooms in the tributary bays of the tgr is mainly related to the thermal stratification hydrodynamics and nutrient concentrations xu et al 2011 and ma et al 2015 suggested that water temperature is the most important property of the freshwater system which is related to the algae growth in fact water temperature difference will lead to water density difference and it may change the mass transport processes due to the density flow because of the temperature difference between the tributary bays and the mainstream of the tgr the water density and temperature in the tributary bays vary from the mainstream of tgr to the upper reach of the tributary bays due to the inflow from the tributary watershed water level variation in the reservoir and weather changes the stratification may be disturbed and vertical circulation and mixing may occur in the tributary bays ji 2017 liu et al 2012a ma 2015 nowlin et al 2004 ji et al 2010a studied the characteristics of density flows in the xiangxi bay xxb of the tgr using field data and reported that the water flow in vertical direction is mainly controlled by the temperature difference between the water in the mainstream of the tgr and tributary bay liu et al 2012a reported that vertical mixing is an important factor controlling the chlorophyll a concentration in fact the vertical mixing is closely related to the temperature stratification recently ji et al 2017 studied the effects of the water level increase on the temperature stratification and algae blooms in the xxb their results showed that the chlorophyll a concentration increases when the water in the mainstream of the reservoir intrudes into the tributary bay near the water surface or in the middle layer all above mentioned studies indicated that the operation of the tgr and the intrusion flows induced by the water temperature difference are important factors relating to the algae blooms in the tributary bays although long term monitoring could depict the patterns of vertical circulation most of these studies bie et al 2013 ji et al 2010a used data prior to 2010 that is prior to the normal operation of the tgr and up to now few studies examined the physical mechanism controlling the variation of the water flow nonetheless most of the existing studies including numerical simulations and field monitoring bie et al 2013 ji et al 2010a lian et al 2014 ma et al 2015 considered the tributary bays as long and narrow channels due to the water level rising and the water surface expansion the tributary bays may present considerable lateral movements that change the physical and chemical conditions in the lateral direction which may be related to the algae growth in this region the source of nutrients is also important for the algae blooms in the tributary bays many studies holbach et al 2013 li et al 2008 luo et al 2014 ye et al 2006a indicated that the algae blooms in the tributary bays are related to the nutrients from both the mainstream of the tgr and the xxb due to the temperature and density difference the water from the mainstream of the tgr intrudes into the tributary bays as form of density flow and it brings the nutrients in the mainstream into the tributary bays huang et al 2014 ji et al 2010b liu et al 2012a previous studies showed that the inflow from the upper reach of the xiangxi river xxr is rich in phosphate and the algae growth is often limited by the nitrate supply while the concentration of nitrate is higher in the mainstream of the tgr yang et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 yang et al 2015 have reported that 80 of the nitrogen and 60 of the phosphorus imported into the xxb originate from the tgr under certain water temperature solar radiation conditions and n p ratio the nitrate from the mainstream of the tgr stimulates the growth of algae and may result in algae blooms li et al 2008 luo et al 2014 ye et al 2006a however the density flow in the tributary bays change seasonally due to the variations of the water level and temperature under this condition the water and nutrient transport between the mainstream of the reservoir and the tributary bays should present seasonal characteristics however previous studies were only concerned with the annual fluxes of nutrients but the temporal and spatial variations in the water and nutrient fluxes in the tributary bays of the tgr were largely ignored holbach et al 2014 yang et al 2015 field observations indicated that the occurrences of the algae blooms in the tributary bays of the tgr vary depending on the season and the most severe algae blooms occur in spring and summer gao et al 2018 liu et al 2012b xu et al 2011 zhu et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 without basic data on the seasonal water flux the contributions of the seasonal nutrient input from the tgr and the seasonal variation of algae blooms in the tributary bays could not be explained in previous studies to effectively control the eutrophication and algae blooms in the tributary bays it is necessary to investigate the seasonal variations of the density flows and water fluxes in the tributary bays of the tgr the xxb of the tgr in the low reach of the xxr presents notable temperature induced water flow throughout the year in this study a three dimensional 3d numerical model was established for the xxb to simulate the water movement and temperature variation based on the model simulated results the water flow patterns and temporal variation in the water flux in the xxb were studied and the factors dominating the variation in the water flux in such a tributary bay were examined the 3d movement is also presented and its potential influence on the ecological environment is discussed 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the tgr is in the upper reach of the yr in south china fig 1 and controls a 1 million km2 catchment as a riverine reservoir the tgr is very long and reaches 667 km when the water level is 175 m above sea level based on average sea level at wusong china in the end of autumn and in winter the total surface area of the reservoir is 1084 km2 and the total storage capacity is 39 3 109 m3 when the water level is 175 m above sea level the tgr is in a subtropical region and the water temperature varies seasonally the average annual temperature is 17 6 c gao et al 2018 ministry of envrionment protection of the people s republic of china 2014 the water level in the tgr is controlled based on the operation rule co determined by the three gorges station and water resource administration see fig 2 c the impounding period of the reservoir begins in the end of august during this period water from the upper reach of the yr is stored in the reservoir and the water level gradually increases the impounding period ends in mid or end october when the water level reaches 175 m subsequently the tgr enters the normal running period during the normal running period the main operation purpose is to maintain the high water level of 175 m to meet the water requirements for electricity generation and the navigation downstream of the tgd in winter however because of the decreased inflow during winter the water level slowly decreases in the end of the normal running period the discharging period begins in january and the water level in the reservoir decreases until mid june the water level is set to 145 m in the end of spring to prepare for the upcoming flooding period mid june to august during the flooding period the water level is maintained at 145 m to ensure that the reservoir has a large enough capacity to store the floodwater simultaneously the three gorges power station is operated as required by the electricity network along with flooding peak occurrences the water level in the reservoir fluctuates and the floodwater in the yr is controlled to ensure the safety of the region in the downstream of the tgr generally the seasonal water level fluctuation results in a residence time of the whole tgr ranging from 8 to 81 days holbach et al 2014 the xxr is a tributary of the yr located 30 km upstream of the tgd fig 1b the mainstream of the xxr is 94 km and the watershed is 3099 km2 with the annual average discharge of 47 3 m3 s and a peak value of 300 m3 s before the impoundment of the tgr water quickly flowed through the xxr into the mainstream of the yr because of the large slope of the riverbed 2 7 therefore no algae blooms were reported in the xxr before the impoundment of the tgr however after the completion of the tgd the water level increased and the water velocity dramatically decreased in the lower reach of the xxr forming a tributary bay xxb in its lower reach 2 2 model description and setup after the impoundment of the tgr the width of the water surface in the lower reach of the xxr expanded to 300 600 m however the vertical water movement is relatively weak compared to that in horizontal direction for such conditions the shallow water equations using the boussinesq approximation are suitable to describe the water movement in the xxb in this study delft3d flow a 3d numerical model was used to simulate the water flow and thermal conditions in the xxb delft3d flow is part of delft3d a 3d hydro environment numerical simulation software developed by deltares 2013 it solves the shallow water and temperature equations using an orthogonal curvilinear grid in the horizontal direction and z coordinate or σ coordinate deltares 2013 in the vertical direction with the application of the alternative direction implicitly adi method the delft3d flow efficiently solves the shallow water equations in the horizontal direction 2d the vertical velocity is computed based on the integration of the mass conservation equations with horizontal velocities averaged over the water depth in delft3d flow the vertical eddy diffusion caused by turbulence mixing is calculated using the k ε turbulence model and the horizontal eddy viscosity and diffusivity coefficients are constants deltares 2013 the study area covers the xxb and a reach of the tgr near the tgr xxb confluence fig 1b c the number of grid cells in the xxb is 407 in the longitudinal direction and 16 in the lateral direction with a cell dimension of 100 m 40 m longitudinal lateral in the mainstream of the tgr the number of cells is 69 in the longitudinal direction and 20 in the lateral direction with a cell dimension of 150 m 70 m longitudinal lateral because the bed slope in the study area is rather steep the slope reaches 0 5 in the lateral direction the use of the σ coordinate will introduce numerical errors to the locations of density isosurfaces cornelissen 2004 thus the z coordinate was used in this study in total there are 100 vertical layers with thicknesses of 1 5 m and 4 0 m of the upper 80 and lower 20 layers respectively however the calculation in the xxb is only based on the upper 80 layers because the bed level is higher than that in the mainstream of the tgr based on this grid the time step of the calculation is set to 30 s the model contains three open boundaries fig 1b the upper xxb boundary is located north of zhaojun town which is near the confluence of the two main tributaries of the xxr the open boundary was defined by the daily average discharge and water temperature observed at the xingshan gauge fig 2a and d the open upstream boundary of the mainstream of the tgr is located near guizhou town fig 1b and was specified using the water discharge and temperature predicted by the 1d model sun et al 2019 of the tgr fig 2b and d the open downstream boundary of the mainstream of the tgr is 4 km downstream of the tgr xxb confluence and was specified using the water level fig 2c and temperature values from the 1d model fig 2d sun et al 2019 the riverbed was set as an impermeable slip boundary the bed friction was modeled using manning s equation because the water level fluctuates the shorelines also vary to account for this phenomenon and maintain the conservation of the mass and momentum a wetting and drying algorithm deltares 2013 was applied to determine the location of the model boundary the meteorological conditions influence the water movement and temperature the heat flux and wind stress at the water surface were considered in this study the heat flux between the air water surface was calculated using the excess temperature option of delft3d flow which calculates heat flux as a function of the temperature difference between the air and water surface deltares 2013 the wind stress at the water surface was calculated using the equation suggested by qin 1980 because very limited observed meteorological data were available for the mountainous area we used the daily data obtained at the xiangxi meteorological observation station fig 2e and f the station is located in the north of the study area but it is the meteorological observation station closest to the study area 10 km from the upper xxb boundary that can be used to specify the meteorological conditions in the study area using the model we simulated the temperature variation and water flow in the xxb in 2010 which represents the first year of normal tgr operation the simulation started on december 1 2009 with a cold start the velocity was set to zero and the temperature was set to the arithmetical mean of values of the open boundaries because of the lack of data for the open boundary in 2009 the boundary condition before january 1 2010 was same as that in december 2010 2 3 calibration and validation the model was calibrated and validated using the field measured temperature and velocity data gao et al 2018 liu et al 2012a at the sampling locations shown in fig 1c the calibration results show that better agreements between the field measured and the model simulated results are achieved when the horizontal eddy viscosity diffusivity and bed friction coefficient manning s coefficient were set to 1 0 m2 s 0 2 m2 s and 0 01 s m1 3 respectively herein the mean absolute error mae mae i 1 n x obs i x model i n and root mean square error rmse rmse i 1 n x obs i x model i 2 n were used to determine the accuracy of the simulations fig 3 shows the comparisons between the model simulated and field measured temperature distributions the vertical temperature profiles predicted by the model generally conforms the field measured temperature with the locations of thermocline agreeing to the field measurements at most of the observation stations fig 3 mae ranges from 0 38 to 2 23 c and rms ranges from 0 51 to 2 48 c however the discrepancy between the model simulated and field measured results in the upper reach of the xxb a10 is greater than those in the lower and middle reaches this may be attributed to the influence of the upper xxb boundary and shallow water depth in the upper reach in fact we assumed a uniform water temperature at depth at the upper xxb boundary due to the absence of water temperature data in vertical direction additionally the lower number of vertical layer also constrains the model ability to represent the water temperature profiles generally for most of the tributary bay the model simulated result agrees well with the field measurement which means the model established in this study can predict the temperature stratification in the xxb well fig 4 shows the comparisons between model simulated and field measured velocities the mae ranges from 0 021 to 0 061 m s and rms ranges from 0 026 to 0 068 m s the model performed well in the direction of the water currents the model velocities generally agree well with the measurements discrepancies may be due to inaccurate meteorological conditions such as the air temperature and wind because daily temperature and wind data were used in this research deviations from the measured velocity may be due to instantaneous variations in the temperature and wind at a time scale under one hour the calibration and validation shown above indicate that the model can represent the thermal and hydrodynamic features in the xxb and the statistics parameters indicate that the accuracy of the model is acceptable 2 4 pearson correlation analysis pearson correlation analysis is one of the methods generally used to examine the dependences among multiple variables in this study it was used to study the relationships between the water fluxes and their potential relating parameters generally the water fluxes between the xxb and tgr are related to the inflows from the upper reach of the xxr and yr which are considered in the analysis in existing studies the daily water level fluctuations dwlf have been considered to have significant effects on the chlorophyll a concentration in the xxb lian et al 2014 ma et al 2015 yang et al 2013 this suggests that the dwlf is one of the keys factors affecting the water fluxes moreover we have also considered that the thermal conditions water temperature differences in the tributary bay and the mainstream of the tgr are the factors affecting the fluxes because of the existence of density flows in the xxb therefore the temperature stratification in the xxb and temperature differences between the xxb and tgr are also examined 3 results 3 1 velocity distributions in the longitudinal vertical plane fig 5 shows the model simulated velocity in the longitudinal vertical plane along the thalweg within the xxb for five different periods the intrusive upstreamward and downward downstreamward currents are represented by warm and cool colors respectively the vertical spatial scale including the vertical velocity component in fig 5 was magnified to clearly show the water flow the intrusive and downward currents occur throughout the year while the vertical velocity components are rather small in most parts of the xxb the water from the mainstream of the tgr intrudes into the xxb through the bottom surface or middle layers these intrusive currents reach up to 35 km upstream of the tgr xxb confluence the inflow from the upper reach of the xxr usually enters the tributary bay through the bottom layer this downward current moves to the middle and lower reaches or even enters the tgr if there is no bottom layer intrusive current from the mainstream of the tgr the water flow pattern in the xxb varies seasonally in the first two months january and february of the discharging period the tgr water intrudes into the xxb in form of bottom layer intrusive currents and causes downward currents in the surface layer as the water level decreases from 175 m to 160 m fig 5a under these conditions a counterclockwise circulation oriented towards the upper reach of the xxr forms in the lower and middle reaches of the xxb the water inflow from the upper reach of the xxr extends to the lower reach through the bottom layer after meeting the inflow from the upper reach of the xxr that flows near the bottom the intrusive currents rise up and become middle layer intrusion currents in the middle reach of the xxb the water flow pattern changes in march and the water from the tgr enters the xxb through the surface layer as a result a large clockwise circulation occurs in the lower and middle reaches fig 5b however middle layer intrusive currents occasionally occur in the flooding period fig 5c which leads to the formation of two reversed circulations in the middle and lower reaches in the beginning of the impounding period middle layer intrusive currents occur but change to surface layer intrusive currents fig 5d with the impounding process in the end of the impounding period the intrusive currents sink to the bottom and the bottom layer intrusive currents last throughout the normal running period fig 5e 3 2 temperature distribution fig 6 shows the temperature distributions along the thalweg of the xxb for five different periods same as fig 5 together with the vertical temperature distributions in the mainstream of the tgr the water flow patterns are also shown in this figure grey arrows the temperature difference between the surface and bottom in the mainstream of the tgr is generally small during the winter the temperature difference between the surface and bottom is only 0 25 c the temperature difference is slightly enhanced 1 c during part time of the discharging and impounding periods during which the thermocline appears near the bottom and the temperature in the upper part of the water column is nearly homogenous the results generally agree with the field measurements reported by long et al 2016 the seasonal water temperature patterns in the xxb show a similar trend to those in the tgr but the temperature stratification in the xxb is more noticeable compared with that in the tgr in the beginning of the discharging period the water temperature stratification is relatively weak as shown in fig 6a especially in the lower reach of the xxb in which the water temperature difference between the surface and bottom is 0 5 c the inflow from the upper reach of the xxr is 3 c cooler than the surface layer water near the upper boundary of the xxb due to the entrainment of intrusive current from the tgr and the detrainment of inflow from the upstream of the xxr ayala et al 2014 the vertical temperature difference is attenuated in the middle reach during the middle and late discharging periods the temperature stratification in the xxb is enhanced and the temperature difference between the surface and bottom reaches 6 c fig 5b along the thalweg of the xxb the temperature at the water surface gradually increases from the lower reach to the upper reach in april and may the noticeable temperature stratification during this time indicates weak vertical mixing especially near the water surface under this condition the warm water entering the xxb from the tgr remains at the surface after entering the xxb the surface water coming from the tgr heats gradually as it flows to the the upper reach of the xxb the thermal stratification phenomenon becomes more notable during the flooding period see fig 6c the temperature contours stretch into the xxb through the upper middle layers forming a three layer stratification pattern in the xxb and a thin layer of warmer water near the water surface this is considered to be the consequence of high air temperatures during this period similar to the situation during the middle and late discharging periods the existence of a thin layer of warmer water indicates weak vertical mixing during the flooding period the vertical temperature difference in the xxb becomes smaller during the impounding period see fig 6d after the completion of the impoundment the vertical temperature difference in the xxb further decreases as the water in the tgr enters through the bottom layer during the normal running period the temperature contours stretch into the xxb along the bottom of the lower reach of the xxb at the same time the temperature of the water in the xxb is slightly warmer especially in the middle reach and surface layer in the lower reach but the inflow from the upper reach of the xxr is colder see fig 6e therefore the inflow water from the upper reach of the xxr spreads to the bottom as it moves downstream and then mixes with the warm water from the tgr in the middle reach 3 3 relationships of the temperature on the flow pattern because the water is well mixed in the tgr water temperatures and velocities at the surface and bottom of the mainstream of the tgr are almost equal however the vertical mixing in the xxb is weak and the water temperatures and velocities vary with the depth in this study the model simulated vertical distributions of the temperature and currents at station xx fig 1c are used to represent the thermal and hydrodynamic conditions in the lower reach of the xxb the model simulated depth average water temperature and velocity at station yr fig 1c represent the conditions in the mainstream of the tgr fig 7 shows the variation in the water currents and thermal conditions in the beginning of the discharging period that is in the end of winter and early spring the water temperatures in both the xxb and tgr decrease in the lower reach of the xxb the water temperature at the surface is slightly higher than that in the bottom the temperature difference is 1 c at the same time the water temperature in the tgr is generally slightly lower than that in the bottom of the lower reach of the xxb this indicates that the water in the tgr is denser than that in the bottom of the xxb because of the minor density difference the dense water from the tgr moves to the bottom of the xxb the water temperatures in both the xxb and tgr reach their lowest values in the end of february subsequently the water temperatures and vertical temperature difference in the xxb increase in the middle of the discharging period the water temperature in the tgr increases faster than that at the bottom of the xxb and its value is closer to that of the surface layer of the xxb thus the water density in the tgr is equal to or lower than that at the surface of the xxb during the flooding period the water from the tgr may intrude in the xxb through the middle layer fig 7b several mechanisms contribute to this phenomenon firstly the water temperatures in both the tgr and xxb are high but high precipitation induced floods frequently occur in the upstream region of the yr due to the floods the water temperature in the tgr decreases and is closer to that in the middle layer of the xxb the weak vertical mixing in the xxb is another important reason for middle layer intrusive currents see figs 5c and 6c based on the weak mixing the high air temperature in the summer continuously heats the water at the surface keeping its temperature higher than that in the tgr in addition the inflow from the upper reach of the xxr which originates in the mountains and is generally colder flows towards the tgr near the bottom of the xxb fig 5c under this condition the warm water at the surface of the xxb is less affected by the cold water and the surface of the waterbody can maintain its high temperature the increased flux from the upper reach of the xxr fig 2a brings more cool water to the bottom of the xxb and further enlarges the temperature difference between the surface and bottom therefore the temperature in the tgr may be close to that of the middle layer of the xxb and the water in the tgr enters the xxb as middle layer intrusive currents however the occurrence of middle layer intrusive currents is not temporally continuous but interrupted by the appearance of surface layer intrusive currents because of significant variations in the hydrodynamic and thermal conditions in the end of the flooding period the depth at which the water temperature of the xxb is equal to that in the tgr is deeper and the water temperature in the tgr is closer to that of the middle layer in the xxb fig 7a this phenomenon is related to the plunging of the water temperature in the tgr fig 7a which is the result of a medium flood fig 2b compared with the middle layer intrusive currents in the flooding period more temporally continuous middle layer intrusive currents are observed in the beginning of the impounding period this is related to the decreased discharge from the tgd which dampens the fierce hydrodynamic and thermal variations by increasing the temporal lags of the hydrodynamic and thermal processes between the tgr and the upstream yr zhou et al 2019 due to the further decrease in the temperature of air and inflow water from the upstream of the xxr the water temperature in the xxb also decreases then the water temperature in the tgr is equal to or higher than that at the surface of the xxb therefore surface layer intrusive currents occur in the middle of the impounding period this condition ends in the late impounding period with the completion of the impoundment of the tgr the temperature stratification in the xxb becomes weaker as the water temperature in the tgr decrease it becomes colder than that at the bottom of the xxb and the water in the tgr enters the xxb in form of bottom layer intrusive currents 3 4 fluxes in the tributary bay fig 8 plots the annual water fluxes the volume of water flowing through a cross section per second in the xxb in the lower reach fig 8d f both intrusive and downward currents exist the maximum values of the two fluxes reach up to 1100 m3 s however the inflow from the upper reach of the xxr is relatively small the maximum is only 300 m3 s in the flooding period fig 2a to examine the temperature effect on the water flux we ran the same model for the whole year 2010 without considering the water temperature difference the temperature on the boundaries was set to 15 c equal to the initial temperature in the area and the heat flux between the air and water was ignored it was found that the water flux values at the cross sections are almost equal to the inflow from the upper reach of the xxr and there is no flux to the upstream of the xxr when the water level decreases under this condition the stratified water currents and the water flows shown in fig 5 disappear considering similar variations in the intrusive and downward currents it can be concluded that larger fluxes of the intrusive and downward currents in the xxb are the results of water flows induced by the temperature difference between the tgr and xxb however in the middle and upper reaches of the xxb cross sections 10 km from the confluence fig 8a d the flux of intrusive currents decreases the statistical analysis shows that the correlation coefficients ccs between the net flux and inflow from the upper reach of the xxr range from 0 59 to 0 65 in the middle and upper reaches of the xxb compared with the value ranging from 0 23 to 0 52 at the cross sections in the lower reach 0 10 km upstream from the confluence the higher values in the upper and middle reaches indicate that the water currents in the upper reach are significantly influenced by the inflow from the upper reach of the xxr generally the net fluxes of all cross sections are directed downward during most of the year upward net fluxes occur during the flooding and impounding periods in the lower and middle reaches the examination of the net fluxes during the discharging period indicates a period of upward net flux fig 8c f and this phenomenon is related to the water level increase during this period from the end of april to the beginning of may this is due to the mass balance in the xxb and suggests that the upward net flux is related to the rising water level in the tgr the water fluxes in all cross sections present seasonal variations especially in the cross sections in the lower reach generally the fluxes of both the intrusive and downward currents during the normal running and discharging periods are smaller than those in the flooding period and early impounding period in the cross sections in the lower reach the water fluxes start to decrease in the end of january and reach minima in the middle of march the fluxes then increased again until the beginning of may the fluxes fluctuate in the flooding and impounding periods and the maximum values are achieved during the flooding period with the completion of the impoundment of the tgr in the end of october both the fluxes of the intrusive and downward currents in the lower reach decrease the cross sections in the upper and middle reaches show similar trends but the amplitudes of the fluctuations are relatively smaller this may be due to the reduced influence of the mainstream of the tgr in this region 3 5 water exchange between the xiangxi river and three gorges reservoir 3 5 1 intrusion limit the end of the intrusive currents in the xxb is defined as the intrusion limit the distance between the intrusion limit and confluence is defined as the intrusion distance fig 9 a shows the temporal variation in the intrusion distance in the beginning of the discharging period the intrusion distance is 36 km the intrusion limit retreats at the beginning of march when the intrusive currents change from bottom layer to surface layer the distance ranges from 23 to 32 km during the rest of the discharging period the intrusion distance ranges from 29 to 34 km during the flooding period with small fluctuations due to the effect of the rising water level the intrusion distance can reach up to 35 km during the impounding period in the beginning of the discharging period the water level in the tributary bay is high and the backwater length is large the retreated intrusion limit during the discharging period corresponds to the decrease in the water level in the tgr and negative gradient of the hydrostatical pressure in the xxb during most of the discharging period the water inflow from the upper reach of the xxr is not very large fig 9b presents the monthly average ratio of the discharge in the mainstream of the tgr to the inflow from the upper reach of the xxr the discharge ratio decreases in the discharging period this corresponds to the decrease in the intrusion distance during this period during the flooding period the intrusion distance increases with increasing discharge ratio the variance of the intrusion distance in this period is closely related to the peak floods in the tgr two peak floods occur in the tgr that is one in the end of july and the other one at the end of august correspondingly the intrusion distance increases during these two phases yellow brackets in fig 9a however the intrusion distance in the flooding period is shorter than that in the early discharging period this is the result of the lower water level and shorter backwater in the flooding period because of the water level in the impounding period the intrusion limit moves to the upper reach even though the discharge ratio between the tgr and xxr varies significantly in the normal running period the intrusion distance remains stable this should be attributed to the decreasing fluxes in the tgr and the xxr which do not have notable effects on the intrusive currents in the xxb during this period the high water level and long backwater are favor to the intrusive currents extending to the upper reach of the xxb due to buoyance caused by density stratification holbach et al 2014 3 5 2 seasonal intrusion flux from the middle to the end of the discharging period in spring the water originating from the tgr intrudes into the xxb through the surface layer sinks to the bottom near the intrusion limit and flows out of the xxb in form of bottom layer downward currents the inflow from the upper reach of the xxr enters the bay as bottom layer currents therefore the water intruding from the tgr mainly moves within the intrusion limit considering the existence of the circulation and small inflow from the upper reach of the xxr the water within the intrusion limit can be regarded as separated from the water beyond the intrusion limit and the residence time within the intrusion limit can be estimated from the flux of the intrusive current to quantify the water exchange between the xxb and tgr because the similar circulations caused by density flows exist in the xxb throughout the year the assumption and method can be extended to other operation periods fig 10 a presents the volume of water flowing through the cross sections in the xxb from the middle to the end of the discharging period spring 3 4 109 m3 of water intrudes into the xxb and 3 7 109 m3 flows out through the confluence zone the total volume of water within the intrusion limit during spring is 6 3 108 m3 s when the water level is 175 m above sea level when the water level decreases to 145 m the volume is only 3 22 108 m3 based on these data we can estimate that the residence time within the intrusion limit ranges from 8 5 to 17 5 days during the middle and late discharging period similarly the monthly average residence time was obtained fig 10b the result indicates that the water in the middle and lower reaches of the xxb is renewed more than five times from the middle to the late discharging period the total volume of water entering the xxb from the tgr during the flooding period in summer is almost equal to that during the middle and late discharging period but the total volume of water flowing through each cross section in the middle and upper reaches increases because of the intrusion limit 30 km from the confluence fig 9a the increasing flux of the currents significantly influences the upper reach of the xxb this facilitates the water exchange in the upper reach of the xxb during the flooding period the residence time in the downstream of the intrusion limit becomes smaller 7 1 8 5 days fig 10b and the water within the intrusion limit is renewed approximately ten times in the flooding period during the impounding period the total volume of water entering the xxb increases by 50 compared with that during the flooding and middle and late discharging periods correspondingly the volume of water flowing out of the xxb also increases in the upper reach the volume of intrusive water increases while the volume of water flowing downward decreases compared with that during the flooding period this indicates that the upper reach of the xxb is influenced by the rising water level the rising water level in the tgr may inhibit the downward currents from the upper reach of the xxr because of the increase in the water level the residence time reaches 9 3 days in september and the water within the intrusion limit is renewed more than five times during the impounding period the impounding period is shorter than other periods and it lasts for 55 days 3 6 velocity and temperature in the cross sections fig 11 shows the distributions of the longitudinal velocity at six cross sections of the xxb the contours of the velocity at the cross sections of the upper reach are generally horizontal this indicates that the water currents in the upper reach are almost uniform in the horizontal direction at a cross section which may be the result of weak lateral currents however the velocity contours at the cross sections near the confluence incline in all operation periods the trend is more notable near the bottom and the speed in the east of the thalweg of the xxb is larger than that in the west in fact this should be related to the lateral momentum transport in the cross sections near the confluence zone the confluent flow may be responsible for this phenomenon morell et al 2014 zinger et al 2013 however the inclining velocity contours in the cross sections far from the confluence zone 5 km away should be due to the asymmetry and curvature of the tributary channel see fig 1c to further study the water movements the lateral currents in the xxb are also presented fig 12 shows the currents at the three types of cross sections straight channel bend channel and near the confluence of which locations are shown fig 1c in each operation period of the tgr lateral currents occur in all three types of cross sections but they are more noticeable in the cross section near the confluence zone fig 12a d where the magnitude of the lateral currents can reach 0 02 m s which is in the same order as the velocity component in the longitudinal direction generally up to three circulations may form at a cross section due to the lateral currents the number of circulations at a cross section is related to the patterns of the intrusive currents during the flooding and early impounding periods water from the tgr intrudes into the xxb as middle layer intrusive currents near the confluence three layers of currents are observed at the cross section see fig 11b correspondingly two lateral circulations form between two neighboring layers in the cross section near the confluence fig 12b during the other periods the water from the mainstream of the tgr intrudes as surface layer or bottom layer currents and only two layers of currents are observed in the cross section near the confluence in this situation only one clockwise or counterclockwise circulation occurs in the cross section near the confluence the first and second rows in fig 12 present the lateral currents in the cross sections of the straight and bend channels in the middle reach of the xxb respectively the strength of the lateral currents is smaller compared with that near the confluence the maximum speed of the lateral currents in the two cross sections 0 005 m s is observed near the bottom the lateral currents in the bend channel have higher speeds than those in the straight channel in the straight channel one or two circulations may form by lateral currents which is similar to the situation in the cross section near the confluence it shows that the bend channel enhances the lateral water movements and mixing although the speed of the longitudinal currents is relatively small the lateral currents can cause additional vertical currents and thus contribute to the vertical transport of nutrients and algae which may be related to the algae growth with the lateral currents the water temperature in a cross section also differs lewis and rhoads 2015 ramón et al 2013 fig 13 shows the water temperature distributions in the cross sections of different channel types the flooding period is used as an example which is similar to the other periods the water temperature in the surface area is almost equal in a cross section however the contours of the water temperature in the cross sections below the water surface are not horizontal especially in the cross sections near the confluence which indicates that the thermal condition is 3d the inclination of temperature contours in the bend channels are smaller compared with those in the cross sections near the confluence this is related to the weaker lateral currents in the cross sections of the bend channel compared with those near the confluence the contours of the water temperature in the cross section of the straight channel are almost horizontal and the 3d characteristics of the thermal conditions disappear in the straight channel 3 7 factors influencing the fluxes in the tributary bay using the pearson correlation analysis the correlation coefficients among the variables daily average of model simulated results listed in table 1 at station xx fig 1c are calculated for the discharging flooding and impounding periods respectively table 1 shows a part of the correlation matrices of the variables mentioned above and manifests the correlations between the water fluxes and other parameters it shows that the fluxes of the intrusive and downward currents in the xxb are closely related as mentioned in section 3 3 these relationships indicate longitudinal vertical circulations in the xxb table 1 shows that high ccs exist between the thermal conditions and fluxes of the intrusive and downward currents during the discharging period the temperature differences between the tgr and middle layer of the xxb as well as the temperature difference between the tgr and bottom layer of the xxb show the closest correlations with the fluxes of the intrusive and downward currents in the discharging period however the fluxes of the intrusive and downward currents have weak correlations with the temperature difference between the tgr and that at the water surface of the xxb this is related to the surface layer intrusive currents during the discharging period which means that the water temperature at the surface of the xxb is dominated by the water from the tgr the ccs of the fluxes and temperature difference between the surface and bottom of the xxb are also high these relationships suggest that the difference in the thermal conditions between the xxr and tgr is one of the factors controlling the water exchange between the xxb and tgr during the discharging period during the flooding period the ccs of the thermal conditions are still large and the thermal conditions continue to be the predominant factor influencing the fluxes of the intrusive and downward currents in the xxb however during summer the ccs between the temperature differences and fluxes of the intrusive and downward currents become smaller than in spring nevertheless the cc between the flux of the intrusive currents and dwlf increases during the flooding period in this period the water level in the reservoir significantly fluctuates because of the appearances of flooding peaks in the mainstream of the tgr the fluctuations result in the water into and out of the xxb the cc between the flux of the downward currents and inflow from the upper reach of the xxr also increases this may be due to the increasing inflow from the upper reach of the xxr considering the close relationship between the intrusive and downward currents in the xxb the increasing inflow from the upper reach of the xxr enhances the intrusive currents from the tgr and contributes to the water exchange in the lower reach of the xxb during the impounding period the fluxes of the intrusive and downward currents in the xxb are related to the temperature difference between the tgr and middle layer of the xxb the fluxes have weak relationships with the differences between the temperature in the tgr and those at the surface and bottom of the xxb p 0 05 except for the flux of the intrusive currents and temperature difference between the tgr and surface of the xxb besides the ccs of the two fluxes and the temperature difference between the surface and bottom of the xxb are also relatively large with values of 0 43 and 0 42 respectively the fluxes of the intrusive and downward currents in the xxb weakly correlate with the inflows from the upper reach of the xxr and yr considering that the ccs between the two fluxes and inflows from the upper reach of the xxr and yr range from 0 23 to 0 35 moreover the dwlf does not present a significant relationship with the fluxes of the intrusive and downward currents the statistical analysis indicates that the net flux is mainly controlled by the dwlf and the inflows from the upper reach of the xxr and yr during the discharging and impounding periods among the parameters the net flux has a closer relationship with the dwlf with ccs reaching up to 0 80 in the impounding period nevertheless the effects of the fluxes of inflows from the upper reach of the xxr and yr are relatively small compared with that of the dwlf generally the statistical analysis shows that the fluxes of the intrusive and downward currents between the xxb and tgr are related to the thermal stratifications in the xxb and the difference in the thermal conditions between the xxb and tgr is the dominant factor affecting the water exchange between them the relationships are significant during the discharging period but weak during the impounding period the dwlf is the dominant factor controlling the net flux but has a small influence on the fluxes of the intrusive and downward currents in the xxb especially during the discharging and impounding periods therefore the strengths of the intrusive and downward currents are dominated by the thermal conditions in the xxb and tgr although the dwlf controls the total volume of water flowing into and out of the xxb the fluxes of the intrusive and downward currents are also related to the inflow from the upper reach of the yr however these correlations are weak during the impounding period the inflow from the upper reach of the xxr affects the net flux during the discharging and flooding periods during the flooding period the downward flux shows a significant correlation with the inflow from the upper reach of the xxr but the relationship is weak during the other periods 4 discussion most of early studies on algae blooms were concentrated on the pollution load from the tributary watershed and decreased water velocity in the tributary bays cao et al 2009 li et al 2008 ye et al 2009 ye et al 2006b to better understand the water quality and the hydrodynamic conditions in the tributary bays filed measurements were conducted it was found that the intrusive currents from the mainstream of the tgr often occur in the tributary bays with different depth ji et al 2010a ji et al 2010b even though the different water flow patterns have been found in existing studies ji et al 2010a ji et al 2017 ji et al 2010b mao et al 2015 before this study details of the evolution process of these flow patterns over an annual cycle have not been fully investigated and the seasonally varying flux due to these circulations has not been fully understood due to the limited field observations and model simulations in this study the water flows in the xxb were simulated for a whole year after the normal operation of the tgr using a validated 3d numerical model the simulation produced continuous flow and temperature data for analyzing the density circulation variation and the related mechanism generally the patterns of the intrusive currents from the tgr are closely related to the temperature distributions in the xxb and tgr intrusive currents often occur at the depth at which the temperature is identical to that in the tgr because of the low speed the surface water temperature in the xxb is prone to be affected by the meteorological conditions the bottom layer intrusive currents represent the dominant flow pattern of the xxb in the normal running period and early discharging period surface layer intrusive currents represent the dominant flow pattern in other periods with middle layer intrusive currents occurring during the flooding period and beginning of the impounding period occasionally due to the significant vertical temperature difference and weak mixing in the vertical direction the model results showed that the vertical temperature difference exists in the xxb for the whole year it is very distinguished from the condition in the mainstream of the tgr where the water column is well mixed in the vertical direction yang et al 2017 have realized this difference and proposed the applicability of the critical depth theory sverdrup 1953 which suggested that the surface mixing depth measured by vertical temperature variation liu et al 2012a is a critical factor determining algae blooms in such tributary bays the results of simulation in this study showed that the temperature stratification in spring and summer is more intensive indicating a weak vertical mixing during these periods with the combination of the higher temperature these conditions may be favor to the algae growth in fact observed data showed that the most server algae blooms often occur in spring and summer according to the model results in this study these observed data could be considered as an evidence to the applicability of the critical depth theory generally the water in the mainstream of the tgr intrudes into the xxb for 15 34 km with the short distance occurring in spring the analysis on the variation in the intrusion distance suggested that the location of the intrusion limit is not only controlled by the water level and backwater length but it is also related to the momentum of the water in the upper reach of the xxb and the mainstream of the tgr holbach et al 2014 analyzed the driving forces responding to the long intrusion limit in the tributary bay and pointed out that the dominant factor are the buoyance force caused by density stratification and the momentum of the intrusive water the results of the current study confirmed this hypothesis and showed the detailed variation in the intrusion limit which may be useful for further investigations of the algae bloom mechanism in the tributary bays with the intrusive currents due to the temperature induced density differences the water exchange between the xxb and the mainstream of the tgr is amplified although the inflow from the upper reach of the xxb is relatively small the average fluxes of the intrusive and downward currents in the lower reaches of the xxb can reach 6 times of the inflow discharge from the upstream of the xxb even under the condition of water level decreasing indicating a significant water exchange in this region due to the density flows which was also confirmed by the result of pearson correlation analysis however the intrusive and downward currents in the middle and upper reaches of the xxb are much weak in fact existing studies indicated that the most of algae blooms occur in the middle reach of the xxb li et al 2018 liu et al 2012b mao et al 2015 tian 2012 which can be explained by the results in this study it also showed that the fluxes of both the intrusive and downward currents are relative small during the normal running and discharging periods this phenomenon corresponds to the short intrusion distance in the two periods and indicates the weak hydrodynamic condition moreover existing studies have shown that algae blooms often occur in spring middle and end discharging period and summer flooding period gao et al 2018 liu et al 2012b xu et al 2011 zhu et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 on one hand this should be related to the warm water temperature during these periods on the other hand this also may be the result of proper mixing ratio of water from the tgr and upstream of the xxr in spring and summer even the flux of intrusive current is small it may provide right amount of nitrogen at the right time which just match the phosphorus from the tributary watershed while in the impounding period large amount of water from the tgr may destroy the ratio which constrain the growth of algae however this is just an assumption and it need to be justified by field investigation in the current study a 3d model was used to simulate the flow field and temperature distribution the result of the model simulation showed that the water movement and temperature in the xxb present obvious 3d characteristics the characteristics are more obvious near the confluence between the tgr and the xxb and in the bend channels that located in the middle and lower reaches of the xxb in these regions the lateral velocity that has the same order of the longitudinal velocity should have effects on the water transport both in longitudinal and lateral directions the result indicated that ignoring the lateral currents when studying the hydrodynamic thermal conditions and nutrient level along the thalweg of the xxb might cause problems among the tributaries of the tgr the xxb is a tributary bay with less bend channels even under this condition the 3d characteristics is obvious considering the similar situation of density flows in other tributaries bays in the tgr there should be more obvious 3d characteristics 5 conclusion in this study a 3d numerical model was established to investigate the thermal hydrodynamic processes in the xxb the model was calibrated and validated using field measured data the model predictions agree with the field measured data thus the model can be used to simulate the thermal hydrodynamic processes in the xxb the model results show that notable density flows occur in the xxb due to the water temperature difference between the xxb and mainstream of the tgr and that the water flow patterns vary depending on the season the analysis of the correlations among the water flow patterns water level variation water fluxes and thermal conditions indicates that the temperature difference is the predominant factor controlling the water flow patterns and the water exchange between the xxb and mainstream of the tgr the bottom layer intrusive current from the mainstream of the tgr represents the general flow pattern in the normal running period and early discharging period in the xxb however the surface layer intrusive currents are dominant in the rest of the year with middle layer intrusive currents occasionally occurring in the flooding period and early impounding period because of significant temperature stratification the fluxes of intrusive and downward currents caused by the water temperature difference are significant in the xxb although the inflow from the upper reach of the xxr is relatively small a large volume of water from the mainstream of the tgr intrudes into the xxb with a residence time of 7 1 18 5 days in the lower and middle reaches and the water within the intrusion limit being renewed at least five times during an operation period this means that the intrusive currents contribute to the water exchange between the xxb and mainstream of the tgr and could change the nutrient composition in the xxb the water movements and temperature distribution are 3d in the xxb significant lateral currents also occur in the xxb in the lower reach of the tributary bay the speed of the lateral currents reaches the same level as that of the longitudinal vertical movement the lateral currents also induce a temperature variation in the lateral direction these facts indicate that the hydrodynamic and thermal conditions in the xxb are affected by the 3d movements through which the water flows into and out of the bay thus the complex movements and thermal conditions may influence the interactive fluxes between the xxb and mainstream of the tgr and the algae growth declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

5593,the impoundment of a large riverine reservoir creates a series of tributary bays in its original tributaries the increase in the water level and decrease in the velocity may result in the degradation of the water quality in the tributary bays the thermal conditions can also change in the mainstream of the reservoir and tributary bays density flow induced by temperature differences often occurs in tributary bays which likely influences the water exchange between the tributary bays and mainstream of the reservoir and the nutrient concentration in the tributary bays to examine the seasonal variation in the circulation pattern and water exchange in the tributary bay a three dimensional numerical model was established for the lower reach of the xiangxi river a tributary of the three gorges reservoir the model was calibrated and validated using field measured data and the results indicate that it can be used to simulate the thermal hydrodynamic circulations in the tributary bay the model simulated results show that the water circulation patterns vary depending on the season the bottom layer intrusive currents from the three gorges reservoir generally occur in the normal running period and early discharging period while surface layer intrusive currents are dominant in the rest of the year and middle layer intrusive currents occasionally occur in the flooding period and early impounding period based on the model simulated results the water fluxes in the cross sections in the tributary bay were calculated and the factors controlling the fluxes were examined the results show that the thermal conditions in the tributary bay and mainstream of the reservoir are the predominant factors controlling the water exchange between the tributary bay and mainstream of the reservoir although the inflow from the tributary is relatively small the water exchange between the tributary bay and mainstream of the reservoir is significant the results show that that the water within the intrusion limit is renewed more than five times in an operation period however the water exchange in the upper reach of the tributary bay is weak especially during the discharging period of the three gorges reservoir this may be due to the combined effects of small inflow from the upper reach of the xiangxi river and weak intrusive currents from the mainstream of the three gorges reservoir in the upper reach of the tributary bay keywords temperature circulation flux water exchange tributary bay three gorges reservoir 1 introduction the three gorges dam tgd is a large dam located in the upper reach of the yangtze river yr it was impounded in 2003 the three gorges reservoir tgr formed along the main channel of the yr the tgr has been fully operated since 2010 its water level fluctuates between 145 and 175 m annually han et al 2018 due to the large inflow and pollution reduction algae blooms have not been observed in the mainstream of the yr since its impoundment the backwaters which are also present in the lower reaches of the tributaries of the tgr form tens of tributary bays in the upstream of the tgd since the initial impoundment of the tgr in 2003 algae blooms frequently occur in the tributary bays and thus the safety of the water usage and water quality are endangered cai and hu 2006 gao et al 2018 li et al 2008 2018 lian et al 2014 liu et al 2012a shao 2008 tang et al 2018 ye et al 2006 zhu et al 2013 the environmental problems have attracted the attention from the company running the reservoir government and scholars to improve the water quality and control the algae blooms in the tributary bays of the tgr many field observations holbach et al 2014 ye and cai 2011 zhao et al 2016 and numerical studies gao et al 2018 ji et al 2017 mao et al 2015 yu et al 2018 have been conducted to explore the algae bloom mechanism in the tributary bays previous studies indicated that the algae blooms in the tributary bays of the tgr is mainly related to the thermal stratification hydrodynamics and nutrient concentrations xu et al 2011 and ma et al 2015 suggested that water temperature is the most important property of the freshwater system which is related to the algae growth in fact water temperature difference will lead to water density difference and it may change the mass transport processes due to the density flow because of the temperature difference between the tributary bays and the mainstream of the tgr the water density and temperature in the tributary bays vary from the mainstream of tgr to the upper reach of the tributary bays due to the inflow from the tributary watershed water level variation in the reservoir and weather changes the stratification may be disturbed and vertical circulation and mixing may occur in the tributary bays ji 2017 liu et al 2012a ma 2015 nowlin et al 2004 ji et al 2010a studied the characteristics of density flows in the xiangxi bay xxb of the tgr using field data and reported that the water flow in vertical direction is mainly controlled by the temperature difference between the water in the mainstream of the tgr and tributary bay liu et al 2012a reported that vertical mixing is an important factor controlling the chlorophyll a concentration in fact the vertical mixing is closely related to the temperature stratification recently ji et al 2017 studied the effects of the water level increase on the temperature stratification and algae blooms in the xxb their results showed that the chlorophyll a concentration increases when the water in the mainstream of the reservoir intrudes into the tributary bay near the water surface or in the middle layer all above mentioned studies indicated that the operation of the tgr and the intrusion flows induced by the water temperature difference are important factors relating to the algae blooms in the tributary bays although long term monitoring could depict the patterns of vertical circulation most of these studies bie et al 2013 ji et al 2010a used data prior to 2010 that is prior to the normal operation of the tgr and up to now few studies examined the physical mechanism controlling the variation of the water flow nonetheless most of the existing studies including numerical simulations and field monitoring bie et al 2013 ji et al 2010a lian et al 2014 ma et al 2015 considered the tributary bays as long and narrow channels due to the water level rising and the water surface expansion the tributary bays may present considerable lateral movements that change the physical and chemical conditions in the lateral direction which may be related to the algae growth in this region the source of nutrients is also important for the algae blooms in the tributary bays many studies holbach et al 2013 li et al 2008 luo et al 2014 ye et al 2006a indicated that the algae blooms in the tributary bays are related to the nutrients from both the mainstream of the tgr and the xxb due to the temperature and density difference the water from the mainstream of the tgr intrudes into the tributary bays as form of density flow and it brings the nutrients in the mainstream into the tributary bays huang et al 2014 ji et al 2010b liu et al 2012a previous studies showed that the inflow from the upper reach of the xiangxi river xxr is rich in phosphate and the algae growth is often limited by the nitrate supply while the concentration of nitrate is higher in the mainstream of the tgr yang et al 2017 zheng et al 2018 yang et al 2015 have reported that 80 of the nitrogen and 60 of the phosphorus imported into the xxb originate from the tgr under certain water temperature solar radiation conditions and n p ratio the nitrate from the mainstream of the tgr stimulates the growth of algae and may result in algae blooms li et al 2008 luo et al 2014 ye et al 2006a however the density flow in the tributary bays change seasonally due to the variations of the water level and temperature under this condition the water and nutrient transport between the mainstream of the reservoir and the tributary bays should present seasonal characteristics however previous studies were only concerned with the annual fluxes of nutrients but the temporal and spatial variations in the water and nutrient fluxes in the tributary bays of the tgr were largely ignored holbach et al 2014 yang et al 2015 field observations indicated that the occurrences of the algae blooms in the tributary bays of the tgr vary depending on the season and the most severe algae blooms occur in spring and summer gao et al 2018 liu et al 2012b xu et al 2011 zhu et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 without basic data on the seasonal water flux the contributions of the seasonal nutrient input from the tgr and the seasonal variation of algae blooms in the tributary bays could not be explained in previous studies to effectively control the eutrophication and algae blooms in the tributary bays it is necessary to investigate the seasonal variations of the density flows and water fluxes in the tributary bays of the tgr the xxb of the tgr in the low reach of the xxr presents notable temperature induced water flow throughout the year in this study a three dimensional 3d numerical model was established for the xxb to simulate the water movement and temperature variation based on the model simulated results the water flow patterns and temporal variation in the water flux in the xxb were studied and the factors dominating the variation in the water flux in such a tributary bay were examined the 3d movement is also presented and its potential influence on the ecological environment is discussed 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the tgr is in the upper reach of the yr in south china fig 1 and controls a 1 million km2 catchment as a riverine reservoir the tgr is very long and reaches 667 km when the water level is 175 m above sea level based on average sea level at wusong china in the end of autumn and in winter the total surface area of the reservoir is 1084 km2 and the total storage capacity is 39 3 109 m3 when the water level is 175 m above sea level the tgr is in a subtropical region and the water temperature varies seasonally the average annual temperature is 17 6 c gao et al 2018 ministry of envrionment protection of the people s republic of china 2014 the water level in the tgr is controlled based on the operation rule co determined by the three gorges station and water resource administration see fig 2 c the impounding period of the reservoir begins in the end of august during this period water from the upper reach of the yr is stored in the reservoir and the water level gradually increases the impounding period ends in mid or end october when the water level reaches 175 m subsequently the tgr enters the normal running period during the normal running period the main operation purpose is to maintain the high water level of 175 m to meet the water requirements for electricity generation and the navigation downstream of the tgd in winter however because of the decreased inflow during winter the water level slowly decreases in the end of the normal running period the discharging period begins in january and the water level in the reservoir decreases until mid june the water level is set to 145 m in the end of spring to prepare for the upcoming flooding period mid june to august during the flooding period the water level is maintained at 145 m to ensure that the reservoir has a large enough capacity to store the floodwater simultaneously the three gorges power station is operated as required by the electricity network along with flooding peak occurrences the water level in the reservoir fluctuates and the floodwater in the yr is controlled to ensure the safety of the region in the downstream of the tgr generally the seasonal water level fluctuation results in a residence time of the whole tgr ranging from 8 to 81 days holbach et al 2014 the xxr is a tributary of the yr located 30 km upstream of the tgd fig 1b the mainstream of the xxr is 94 km and the watershed is 3099 km2 with the annual average discharge of 47 3 m3 s and a peak value of 300 m3 s before the impoundment of the tgr water quickly flowed through the xxr into the mainstream of the yr because of the large slope of the riverbed 2 7 therefore no algae blooms were reported in the xxr before the impoundment of the tgr however after the completion of the tgd the water level increased and the water velocity dramatically decreased in the lower reach of the xxr forming a tributary bay xxb in its lower reach 2 2 model description and setup after the impoundment of the tgr the width of the water surface in the lower reach of the xxr expanded to 300 600 m however the vertical water movement is relatively weak compared to that in horizontal direction for such conditions the shallow water equations using the boussinesq approximation are suitable to describe the water movement in the xxb in this study delft3d flow a 3d numerical model was used to simulate the water flow and thermal conditions in the xxb delft3d flow is part of delft3d a 3d hydro environment numerical simulation software developed by deltares 2013 it solves the shallow water and temperature equations using an orthogonal curvilinear grid in the horizontal direction and z coordinate or σ coordinate deltares 2013 in the vertical direction with the application of the alternative direction implicitly adi method the delft3d flow efficiently solves the shallow water equations in the horizontal direction 2d the vertical velocity is computed based on the integration of the mass conservation equations with horizontal velocities averaged over the water depth in delft3d flow the vertical eddy diffusion caused by turbulence mixing is calculated using the k ε turbulence model and the horizontal eddy viscosity and diffusivity coefficients are constants deltares 2013 the study area covers the xxb and a reach of the tgr near the tgr xxb confluence fig 1b c the number of grid cells in the xxb is 407 in the longitudinal direction and 16 in the lateral direction with a cell dimension of 100 m 40 m longitudinal lateral in the mainstream of the tgr the number of cells is 69 in the longitudinal direction and 20 in the lateral direction with a cell dimension of 150 m 70 m longitudinal lateral because the bed slope in the study area is rather steep the slope reaches 0 5 in the lateral direction the use of the σ coordinate will introduce numerical errors to the locations of density isosurfaces cornelissen 2004 thus the z coordinate was used in this study in total there are 100 vertical layers with thicknesses of 1 5 m and 4 0 m of the upper 80 and lower 20 layers respectively however the calculation in the xxb is only based on the upper 80 layers because the bed level is higher than that in the mainstream of the tgr based on this grid the time step of the calculation is set to 30 s the model contains three open boundaries fig 1b the upper xxb boundary is located north of zhaojun town which is near the confluence of the two main tributaries of the xxr the open boundary was defined by the daily average discharge and water temperature observed at the xingshan gauge fig 2a and d the open upstream boundary of the mainstream of the tgr is located near guizhou town fig 1b and was specified using the water discharge and temperature predicted by the 1d model sun et al 2019 of the tgr fig 2b and d the open downstream boundary of the mainstream of the tgr is 4 km downstream of the tgr xxb confluence and was specified using the water level fig 2c and temperature values from the 1d model fig 2d sun et al 2019 the riverbed was set as an impermeable slip boundary the bed friction was modeled using manning s equation because the water level fluctuates the shorelines also vary to account for this phenomenon and maintain the conservation of the mass and momentum a wetting and drying algorithm deltares 2013 was applied to determine the location of the model boundary the meteorological conditions influence the water movement and temperature the heat flux and wind stress at the water surface were considered in this study the heat flux between the air water surface was calculated using the excess temperature option of delft3d flow which calculates heat flux as a function of the temperature difference between the air and water surface deltares 2013 the wind stress at the water surface was calculated using the equation suggested by qin 1980 because very limited observed meteorological data were available for the mountainous area we used the daily data obtained at the xiangxi meteorological observation station fig 2e and f the station is located in the north of the study area but it is the meteorological observation station closest to the study area 10 km from the upper xxb boundary that can be used to specify the meteorological conditions in the study area using the model we simulated the temperature variation and water flow in the xxb in 2010 which represents the first year of normal tgr operation the simulation started on december 1 2009 with a cold start the velocity was set to zero and the temperature was set to the arithmetical mean of values of the open boundaries because of the lack of data for the open boundary in 2009 the boundary condition before january 1 2010 was same as that in december 2010 2 3 calibration and validation the model was calibrated and validated using the field measured temperature and velocity data gao et al 2018 liu et al 2012a at the sampling locations shown in fig 1c the calibration results show that better agreements between the field measured and the model simulated results are achieved when the horizontal eddy viscosity diffusivity and bed friction coefficient manning s coefficient were set to 1 0 m2 s 0 2 m2 s and 0 01 s m1 3 respectively herein the mean absolute error mae mae i 1 n x obs i x model i n and root mean square error rmse rmse i 1 n x obs i x model i 2 n were used to determine the accuracy of the simulations fig 3 shows the comparisons between the model simulated and field measured temperature distributions the vertical temperature profiles predicted by the model generally conforms the field measured temperature with the locations of thermocline agreeing to the field measurements at most of the observation stations fig 3 mae ranges from 0 38 to 2 23 c and rms ranges from 0 51 to 2 48 c however the discrepancy between the model simulated and field measured results in the upper reach of the xxb a10 is greater than those in the lower and middle reaches this may be attributed to the influence of the upper xxb boundary and shallow water depth in the upper reach in fact we assumed a uniform water temperature at depth at the upper xxb boundary due to the absence of water temperature data in vertical direction additionally the lower number of vertical layer also constrains the model ability to represent the water temperature profiles generally for most of the tributary bay the model simulated result agrees well with the field measurement which means the model established in this study can predict the temperature stratification in the xxb well fig 4 shows the comparisons between model simulated and field measured velocities the mae ranges from 0 021 to 0 061 m s and rms ranges from 0 026 to 0 068 m s the model performed well in the direction of the water currents the model velocities generally agree well with the measurements discrepancies may be due to inaccurate meteorological conditions such as the air temperature and wind because daily temperature and wind data were used in this research deviations from the measured velocity may be due to instantaneous variations in the temperature and wind at a time scale under one hour the calibration and validation shown above indicate that the model can represent the thermal and hydrodynamic features in the xxb and the statistics parameters indicate that the accuracy of the model is acceptable 2 4 pearson correlation analysis pearson correlation analysis is one of the methods generally used to examine the dependences among multiple variables in this study it was used to study the relationships between the water fluxes and their potential relating parameters generally the water fluxes between the xxb and tgr are related to the inflows from the upper reach of the xxr and yr which are considered in the analysis in existing studies the daily water level fluctuations dwlf have been considered to have significant effects on the chlorophyll a concentration in the xxb lian et al 2014 ma et al 2015 yang et al 2013 this suggests that the dwlf is one of the keys factors affecting the water fluxes moreover we have also considered that the thermal conditions water temperature differences in the tributary bay and the mainstream of the tgr are the factors affecting the fluxes because of the existence of density flows in the xxb therefore the temperature stratification in the xxb and temperature differences between the xxb and tgr are also examined 3 results 3 1 velocity distributions in the longitudinal vertical plane fig 5 shows the model simulated velocity in the longitudinal vertical plane along the thalweg within the xxb for five different periods the intrusive upstreamward and downward downstreamward currents are represented by warm and cool colors respectively the vertical spatial scale including the vertical velocity component in fig 5 was magnified to clearly show the water flow the intrusive and downward currents occur throughout the year while the vertical velocity components are rather small in most parts of the xxb the water from the mainstream of the tgr intrudes into the xxb through the bottom surface or middle layers these intrusive currents reach up to 35 km upstream of the tgr xxb confluence the inflow from the upper reach of the xxr usually enters the tributary bay through the bottom layer this downward current moves to the middle and lower reaches or even enters the tgr if there is no bottom layer intrusive current from the mainstream of the tgr the water flow pattern in the xxb varies seasonally in the first two months january and february of the discharging period the tgr water intrudes into the xxb in form of bottom layer intrusive currents and causes downward currents in the surface layer as the water level decreases from 175 m to 160 m fig 5a under these conditions a counterclockwise circulation oriented towards the upper reach of the xxr forms in the lower and middle reaches of the xxb the water inflow from the upper reach of the xxr extends to the lower reach through the bottom layer after meeting the inflow from the upper reach of the xxr that flows near the bottom the intrusive currents rise up and become middle layer intrusion currents in the middle reach of the xxb the water flow pattern changes in march and the water from the tgr enters the xxb through the surface layer as a result a large clockwise circulation occurs in the lower and middle reaches fig 5b however middle layer intrusive currents occasionally occur in the flooding period fig 5c which leads to the formation of two reversed circulations in the middle and lower reaches in the beginning of the impounding period middle layer intrusive currents occur but change to surface layer intrusive currents fig 5d with the impounding process in the end of the impounding period the intrusive currents sink to the bottom and the bottom layer intrusive currents last throughout the normal running period fig 5e 3 2 temperature distribution fig 6 shows the temperature distributions along the thalweg of the xxb for five different periods same as fig 5 together with the vertical temperature distributions in the mainstream of the tgr the water flow patterns are also shown in this figure grey arrows the temperature difference between the surface and bottom in the mainstream of the tgr is generally small during the winter the temperature difference between the surface and bottom is only 0 25 c the temperature difference is slightly enhanced 1 c during part time of the discharging and impounding periods during which the thermocline appears near the bottom and the temperature in the upper part of the water column is nearly homogenous the results generally agree with the field measurements reported by long et al 2016 the seasonal water temperature patterns in the xxb show a similar trend to those in the tgr but the temperature stratification in the xxb is more noticeable compared with that in the tgr in the beginning of the discharging period the water temperature stratification is relatively weak as shown in fig 6a especially in the lower reach of the xxb in which the water temperature difference between the surface and bottom is 0 5 c the inflow from the upper reach of the xxr is 3 c cooler than the surface layer water near the upper boundary of the xxb due to the entrainment of intrusive current from the tgr and the detrainment of inflow from the upstream of the xxr ayala et al 2014 the vertical temperature difference is attenuated in the middle reach during the middle and late discharging periods the temperature stratification in the xxb is enhanced and the temperature difference between the surface and bottom reaches 6 c fig 5b along the thalweg of the xxb the temperature at the water surface gradually increases from the lower reach to the upper reach in april and may the noticeable temperature stratification during this time indicates weak vertical mixing especially near the water surface under this condition the warm water entering the xxb from the tgr remains at the surface after entering the xxb the surface water coming from the tgr heats gradually as it flows to the the upper reach of the xxb the thermal stratification phenomenon becomes more notable during the flooding period see fig 6c the temperature contours stretch into the xxb through the upper middle layers forming a three layer stratification pattern in the xxb and a thin layer of warmer water near the water surface this is considered to be the consequence of high air temperatures during this period similar to the situation during the middle and late discharging periods the existence of a thin layer of warmer water indicates weak vertical mixing during the flooding period the vertical temperature difference in the xxb becomes smaller during the impounding period see fig 6d after the completion of the impoundment the vertical temperature difference in the xxb further decreases as the water in the tgr enters through the bottom layer during the normal running period the temperature contours stretch into the xxb along the bottom of the lower reach of the xxb at the same time the temperature of the water in the xxb is slightly warmer especially in the middle reach and surface layer in the lower reach but the inflow from the upper reach of the xxr is colder see fig 6e therefore the inflow water from the upper reach of the xxr spreads to the bottom as it moves downstream and then mixes with the warm water from the tgr in the middle reach 3 3 relationships of the temperature on the flow pattern because the water is well mixed in the tgr water temperatures and velocities at the surface and bottom of the mainstream of the tgr are almost equal however the vertical mixing in the xxb is weak and the water temperatures and velocities vary with the depth in this study the model simulated vertical distributions of the temperature and currents at station xx fig 1c are used to represent the thermal and hydrodynamic conditions in the lower reach of the xxb the model simulated depth average water temperature and velocity at station yr fig 1c represent the conditions in the mainstream of the tgr fig 7 shows the variation in the water currents and thermal conditions in the beginning of the discharging period that is in the end of winter and early spring the water temperatures in both the xxb and tgr decrease in the lower reach of the xxb the water temperature at the surface is slightly higher than that in the bottom the temperature difference is 1 c at the same time the water temperature in the tgr is generally slightly lower than that in the bottom of the lower reach of the xxb this indicates that the water in the tgr is denser than that in the bottom of the xxb because of the minor density difference the dense water from the tgr moves to the bottom of the xxb the water temperatures in both the xxb and tgr reach their lowest values in the end of february subsequently the water temperatures and vertical temperature difference in the xxb increase in the middle of the discharging period the water temperature in the tgr increases faster than that at the bottom of the xxb and its value is closer to that of the surface layer of the xxb thus the water density in the tgr is equal to or lower than that at the surface of the xxb during the flooding period the water from the tgr may intrude in the xxb through the middle layer fig 7b several mechanisms contribute to this phenomenon firstly the water temperatures in both the tgr and xxb are high but high precipitation induced floods frequently occur in the upstream region of the yr due to the floods the water temperature in the tgr decreases and is closer to that in the middle layer of the xxb the weak vertical mixing in the xxb is another important reason for middle layer intrusive currents see figs 5c and 6c based on the weak mixing the high air temperature in the summer continuously heats the water at the surface keeping its temperature higher than that in the tgr in addition the inflow from the upper reach of the xxr which originates in the mountains and is generally colder flows towards the tgr near the bottom of the xxb fig 5c under this condition the warm water at the surface of the xxb is less affected by the cold water and the surface of the waterbody can maintain its high temperature the increased flux from the upper reach of the xxr fig 2a brings more cool water to the bottom of the xxb and further enlarges the temperature difference between the surface and bottom therefore the temperature in the tgr may be close to that of the middle layer of the xxb and the water in the tgr enters the xxb as middle layer intrusive currents however the occurrence of middle layer intrusive currents is not temporally continuous but interrupted by the appearance of surface layer intrusive currents because of significant variations in the hydrodynamic and thermal conditions in the end of the flooding period the depth at which the water temperature of the xxb is equal to that in the tgr is deeper and the water temperature in the tgr is closer to that of the middle layer in the xxb fig 7a this phenomenon is related to the plunging of the water temperature in the tgr fig 7a which is the result of a medium flood fig 2b compared with the middle layer intrusive currents in the flooding period more temporally continuous middle layer intrusive currents are observed in the beginning of the impounding period this is related to the decreased discharge from the tgd which dampens the fierce hydrodynamic and thermal variations by increasing the temporal lags of the hydrodynamic and thermal processes between the tgr and the upstream yr zhou et al 2019 due to the further decrease in the temperature of air and inflow water from the upstream of the xxr the water temperature in the xxb also decreases then the water temperature in the tgr is equal to or higher than that at the surface of the xxb therefore surface layer intrusive currents occur in the middle of the impounding period this condition ends in the late impounding period with the completion of the impoundment of the tgr the temperature stratification in the xxb becomes weaker as the water temperature in the tgr decrease it becomes colder than that at the bottom of the xxb and the water in the tgr enters the xxb in form of bottom layer intrusive currents 3 4 fluxes in the tributary bay fig 8 plots the annual water fluxes the volume of water flowing through a cross section per second in the xxb in the lower reach fig 8d f both intrusive and downward currents exist the maximum values of the two fluxes reach up to 1100 m3 s however the inflow from the upper reach of the xxr is relatively small the maximum is only 300 m3 s in the flooding period fig 2a to examine the temperature effect on the water flux we ran the same model for the whole year 2010 without considering the water temperature difference the temperature on the boundaries was set to 15 c equal to the initial temperature in the area and the heat flux between the air and water was ignored it was found that the water flux values at the cross sections are almost equal to the inflow from the upper reach of the xxr and there is no flux to the upstream of the xxr when the water level decreases under this condition the stratified water currents and the water flows shown in fig 5 disappear considering similar variations in the intrusive and downward currents it can be concluded that larger fluxes of the intrusive and downward currents in the xxb are the results of water flows induced by the temperature difference between the tgr and xxb however in the middle and upper reaches of the xxb cross sections 10 km from the confluence fig 8a d the flux of intrusive currents decreases the statistical analysis shows that the correlation coefficients ccs between the net flux and inflow from the upper reach of the xxr range from 0 59 to 0 65 in the middle and upper reaches of the xxb compared with the value ranging from 0 23 to 0 52 at the cross sections in the lower reach 0 10 km upstream from the confluence the higher values in the upper and middle reaches indicate that the water currents in the upper reach are significantly influenced by the inflow from the upper reach of the xxr generally the net fluxes of all cross sections are directed downward during most of the year upward net fluxes occur during the flooding and impounding periods in the lower and middle reaches the examination of the net fluxes during the discharging period indicates a period of upward net flux fig 8c f and this phenomenon is related to the water level increase during this period from the end of april to the beginning of may this is due to the mass balance in the xxb and suggests that the upward net flux is related to the rising water level in the tgr the water fluxes in all cross sections present seasonal variations especially in the cross sections in the lower reach generally the fluxes of both the intrusive and downward currents during the normal running and discharging periods are smaller than those in the flooding period and early impounding period in the cross sections in the lower reach the water fluxes start to decrease in the end of january and reach minima in the middle of march the fluxes then increased again until the beginning of may the fluxes fluctuate in the flooding and impounding periods and the maximum values are achieved during the flooding period with the completion of the impoundment of the tgr in the end of october both the fluxes of the intrusive and downward currents in the lower reach decrease the cross sections in the upper and middle reaches show similar trends but the amplitudes of the fluctuations are relatively smaller this may be due to the reduced influence of the mainstream of the tgr in this region 3 5 water exchange between the xiangxi river and three gorges reservoir 3 5 1 intrusion limit the end of the intrusive currents in the xxb is defined as the intrusion limit the distance between the intrusion limit and confluence is defined as the intrusion distance fig 9 a shows the temporal variation in the intrusion distance in the beginning of the discharging period the intrusion distance is 36 km the intrusion limit retreats at the beginning of march when the intrusive currents change from bottom layer to surface layer the distance ranges from 23 to 32 km during the rest of the discharging period the intrusion distance ranges from 29 to 34 km during the flooding period with small fluctuations due to the effect of the rising water level the intrusion distance can reach up to 35 km during the impounding period in the beginning of the discharging period the water level in the tributary bay is high and the backwater length is large the retreated intrusion limit during the discharging period corresponds to the decrease in the water level in the tgr and negative gradient of the hydrostatical pressure in the xxb during most of the discharging period the water inflow from the upper reach of the xxr is not very large fig 9b presents the monthly average ratio of the discharge in the mainstream of the tgr to the inflow from the upper reach of the xxr the discharge ratio decreases in the discharging period this corresponds to the decrease in the intrusion distance during this period during the flooding period the intrusion distance increases with increasing discharge ratio the variance of the intrusion distance in this period is closely related to the peak floods in the tgr two peak floods occur in the tgr that is one in the end of july and the other one at the end of august correspondingly the intrusion distance increases during these two phases yellow brackets in fig 9a however the intrusion distance in the flooding period is shorter than that in the early discharging period this is the result of the lower water level and shorter backwater in the flooding period because of the water level in the impounding period the intrusion limit moves to the upper reach even though the discharge ratio between the tgr and xxr varies significantly in the normal running period the intrusion distance remains stable this should be attributed to the decreasing fluxes in the tgr and the xxr which do not have notable effects on the intrusive currents in the xxb during this period the high water level and long backwater are favor to the intrusive currents extending to the upper reach of the xxb due to buoyance caused by density stratification holbach et al 2014 3 5 2 seasonal intrusion flux from the middle to the end of the discharging period in spring the water originating from the tgr intrudes into the xxb through the surface layer sinks to the bottom near the intrusion limit and flows out of the xxb in form of bottom layer downward currents the inflow from the upper reach of the xxr enters the bay as bottom layer currents therefore the water intruding from the tgr mainly moves within the intrusion limit considering the existence of the circulation and small inflow from the upper reach of the xxr the water within the intrusion limit can be regarded as separated from the water beyond the intrusion limit and the residence time within the intrusion limit can be estimated from the flux of the intrusive current to quantify the water exchange between the xxb and tgr because the similar circulations caused by density flows exist in the xxb throughout the year the assumption and method can be extended to other operation periods fig 10 a presents the volume of water flowing through the cross sections in the xxb from the middle to the end of the discharging period spring 3 4 109 m3 of water intrudes into the xxb and 3 7 109 m3 flows out through the confluence zone the total volume of water within the intrusion limit during spring is 6 3 108 m3 s when the water level is 175 m above sea level when the water level decreases to 145 m the volume is only 3 22 108 m3 based on these data we can estimate that the residence time within the intrusion limit ranges from 8 5 to 17 5 days during the middle and late discharging period similarly the monthly average residence time was obtained fig 10b the result indicates that the water in the middle and lower reaches of the xxb is renewed more than five times from the middle to the late discharging period the total volume of water entering the xxb from the tgr during the flooding period in summer is almost equal to that during the middle and late discharging period but the total volume of water flowing through each cross section in the middle and upper reaches increases because of the intrusion limit 30 km from the confluence fig 9a the increasing flux of the currents significantly influences the upper reach of the xxb this facilitates the water exchange in the upper reach of the xxb during the flooding period the residence time in the downstream of the intrusion limit becomes smaller 7 1 8 5 days fig 10b and the water within the intrusion limit is renewed approximately ten times in the flooding period during the impounding period the total volume of water entering the xxb increases by 50 compared with that during the flooding and middle and late discharging periods correspondingly the volume of water flowing out of the xxb also increases in the upper reach the volume of intrusive water increases while the volume of water flowing downward decreases compared with that during the flooding period this indicates that the upper reach of the xxb is influenced by the rising water level the rising water level in the tgr may inhibit the downward currents from the upper reach of the xxr because of the increase in the water level the residence time reaches 9 3 days in september and the water within the intrusion limit is renewed more than five times during the impounding period the impounding period is shorter than other periods and it lasts for 55 days 3 6 velocity and temperature in the cross sections fig 11 shows the distributions of the longitudinal velocity at six cross sections of the xxb the contours of the velocity at the cross sections of the upper reach are generally horizontal this indicates that the water currents in the upper reach are almost uniform in the horizontal direction at a cross section which may be the result of weak lateral currents however the velocity contours at the cross sections near the confluence incline in all operation periods the trend is more notable near the bottom and the speed in the east of the thalweg of the xxb is larger than that in the west in fact this should be related to the lateral momentum transport in the cross sections near the confluence zone the confluent flow may be responsible for this phenomenon morell et al 2014 zinger et al 2013 however the inclining velocity contours in the cross sections far from the confluence zone 5 km away should be due to the asymmetry and curvature of the tributary channel see fig 1c to further study the water movements the lateral currents in the xxb are also presented fig 12 shows the currents at the three types of cross sections straight channel bend channel and near the confluence of which locations are shown fig 1c in each operation period of the tgr lateral currents occur in all three types of cross sections but they are more noticeable in the cross section near the confluence zone fig 12a d where the magnitude of the lateral currents can reach 0 02 m s which is in the same order as the velocity component in the longitudinal direction generally up to three circulations may form at a cross section due to the lateral currents the number of circulations at a cross section is related to the patterns of the intrusive currents during the flooding and early impounding periods water from the tgr intrudes into the xxb as middle layer intrusive currents near the confluence three layers of currents are observed at the cross section see fig 11b correspondingly two lateral circulations form between two neighboring layers in the cross section near the confluence fig 12b during the other periods the water from the mainstream of the tgr intrudes as surface layer or bottom layer currents and only two layers of currents are observed in the cross section near the confluence in this situation only one clockwise or counterclockwise circulation occurs in the cross section near the confluence the first and second rows in fig 12 present the lateral currents in the cross sections of the straight and bend channels in the middle reach of the xxb respectively the strength of the lateral currents is smaller compared with that near the confluence the maximum speed of the lateral currents in the two cross sections 0 005 m s is observed near the bottom the lateral currents in the bend channel have higher speeds than those in the straight channel in the straight channel one or two circulations may form by lateral currents which is similar to the situation in the cross section near the confluence it shows that the bend channel enhances the lateral water movements and mixing although the speed of the longitudinal currents is relatively small the lateral currents can cause additional vertical currents and thus contribute to the vertical transport of nutrients and algae which may be related to the algae growth with the lateral currents the water temperature in a cross section also differs lewis and rhoads 2015 ramón et al 2013 fig 13 shows the water temperature distributions in the cross sections of different channel types the flooding period is used as an example which is similar to the other periods the water temperature in the surface area is almost equal in a cross section however the contours of the water temperature in the cross sections below the water surface are not horizontal especially in the cross sections near the confluence which indicates that the thermal condition is 3d the inclination of temperature contours in the bend channels are smaller compared with those in the cross sections near the confluence this is related to the weaker lateral currents in the cross sections of the bend channel compared with those near the confluence the contours of the water temperature in the cross section of the straight channel are almost horizontal and the 3d characteristics of the thermal conditions disappear in the straight channel 3 7 factors influencing the fluxes in the tributary bay using the pearson correlation analysis the correlation coefficients among the variables daily average of model simulated results listed in table 1 at station xx fig 1c are calculated for the discharging flooding and impounding periods respectively table 1 shows a part of the correlation matrices of the variables mentioned above and manifests the correlations between the water fluxes and other parameters it shows that the fluxes of the intrusive and downward currents in the xxb are closely related as mentioned in section 3 3 these relationships indicate longitudinal vertical circulations in the xxb table 1 shows that high ccs exist between the thermal conditions and fluxes of the intrusive and downward currents during the discharging period the temperature differences between the tgr and middle layer of the xxb as well as the temperature difference between the tgr and bottom layer of the xxb show the closest correlations with the fluxes of the intrusive and downward currents in the discharging period however the fluxes of the intrusive and downward currents have weak correlations with the temperature difference between the tgr and that at the water surface of the xxb this is related to the surface layer intrusive currents during the discharging period which means that the water temperature at the surface of the xxb is dominated by the water from the tgr the ccs of the fluxes and temperature difference between the surface and bottom of the xxb are also high these relationships suggest that the difference in the thermal conditions between the xxr and tgr is one of the factors controlling the water exchange between the xxb and tgr during the discharging period during the flooding period the ccs of the thermal conditions are still large and the thermal conditions continue to be the predominant factor influencing the fluxes of the intrusive and downward currents in the xxb however during summer the ccs between the temperature differences and fluxes of the intrusive and downward currents become smaller than in spring nevertheless the cc between the flux of the intrusive currents and dwlf increases during the flooding period in this period the water level in the reservoir significantly fluctuates because of the appearances of flooding peaks in the mainstream of the tgr the fluctuations result in the water into and out of the xxb the cc between the flux of the downward currents and inflow from the upper reach of the xxr also increases this may be due to the increasing inflow from the upper reach of the xxr considering the close relationship between the intrusive and downward currents in the xxb the increasing inflow from the upper reach of the xxr enhances the intrusive currents from the tgr and contributes to the water exchange in the lower reach of the xxb during the impounding period the fluxes of the intrusive and downward currents in the xxb are related to the temperature difference between the tgr and middle layer of the xxb the fluxes have weak relationships with the differences between the temperature in the tgr and those at the surface and bottom of the xxb p 0 05 except for the flux of the intrusive currents and temperature difference between the tgr and surface of the xxb besides the ccs of the two fluxes and the temperature difference between the surface and bottom of the xxb are also relatively large with values of 0 43 and 0 42 respectively the fluxes of the intrusive and downward currents in the xxb weakly correlate with the inflows from the upper reach of the xxr and yr considering that the ccs between the two fluxes and inflows from the upper reach of the xxr and yr range from 0 23 to 0 35 moreover the dwlf does not present a significant relationship with the fluxes of the intrusive and downward currents the statistical analysis indicates that the net flux is mainly controlled by the dwlf and the inflows from the upper reach of the xxr and yr during the discharging and impounding periods among the parameters the net flux has a closer relationship with the dwlf with ccs reaching up to 0 80 in the impounding period nevertheless the effects of the fluxes of inflows from the upper reach of the xxr and yr are relatively small compared with that of the dwlf generally the statistical analysis shows that the fluxes of the intrusive and downward currents between the xxb and tgr are related to the thermal stratifications in the xxb and the difference in the thermal conditions between the xxb and tgr is the dominant factor affecting the water exchange between them the relationships are significant during the discharging period but weak during the impounding period the dwlf is the dominant factor controlling the net flux but has a small influence on the fluxes of the intrusive and downward currents in the xxb especially during the discharging and impounding periods therefore the strengths of the intrusive and downward currents are dominated by the thermal conditions in the xxb and tgr although the dwlf controls the total volume of water flowing into and out of the xxb the fluxes of the intrusive and downward currents are also related to the inflow from the upper reach of the yr however these correlations are weak during the impounding period the inflow from the upper reach of the xxr affects the net flux during the discharging and flooding periods during the flooding period the downward flux shows a significant correlation with the inflow from the upper reach of the xxr but the relationship is weak during the other periods 4 discussion most of early studies on algae blooms were concentrated on the pollution load from the tributary watershed and decreased water velocity in the tributary bays cao et al 2009 li et al 2008 ye et al 2009 ye et al 2006b to better understand the water quality and the hydrodynamic conditions in the tributary bays filed measurements were conducted it was found that the intrusive currents from the mainstream of the tgr often occur in the tributary bays with different depth ji et al 2010a ji et al 2010b even though the different water flow patterns have been found in existing studies ji et al 2010a ji et al 2017 ji et al 2010b mao et al 2015 before this study details of the evolution process of these flow patterns over an annual cycle have not been fully investigated and the seasonally varying flux due to these circulations has not been fully understood due to the limited field observations and model simulations in this study the water flows in the xxb were simulated for a whole year after the normal operation of the tgr using a validated 3d numerical model the simulation produced continuous flow and temperature data for analyzing the density circulation variation and the related mechanism generally the patterns of the intrusive currents from the tgr are closely related to the temperature distributions in the xxb and tgr intrusive currents often occur at the depth at which the temperature is identical to that in the tgr because of the low speed the surface water temperature in the xxb is prone to be affected by the meteorological conditions the bottom layer intrusive currents represent the dominant flow pattern of the xxb in the normal running period and early discharging period surface layer intrusive currents represent the dominant flow pattern in other periods with middle layer intrusive currents occurring during the flooding period and beginning of the impounding period occasionally due to the significant vertical temperature difference and weak mixing in the vertical direction the model results showed that the vertical temperature difference exists in the xxb for the whole year it is very distinguished from the condition in the mainstream of the tgr where the water column is well mixed in the vertical direction yang et al 2017 have realized this difference and proposed the applicability of the critical depth theory sverdrup 1953 which suggested that the surface mixing depth measured by vertical temperature variation liu et al 2012a is a critical factor determining algae blooms in such tributary bays the results of simulation in this study showed that the temperature stratification in spring and summer is more intensive indicating a weak vertical mixing during these periods with the combination of the higher temperature these conditions may be favor to the algae growth in fact observed data showed that the most server algae blooms often occur in spring and summer according to the model results in this study these observed data could be considered as an evidence to the applicability of the critical depth theory generally the water in the mainstream of the tgr intrudes into the xxb for 15 34 km with the short distance occurring in spring the analysis on the variation in the intrusion distance suggested that the location of the intrusion limit is not only controlled by the water level and backwater length but it is also related to the momentum of the water in the upper reach of the xxb and the mainstream of the tgr holbach et al 2014 analyzed the driving forces responding to the long intrusion limit in the tributary bay and pointed out that the dominant factor are the buoyance force caused by density stratification and the momentum of the intrusive water the results of the current study confirmed this hypothesis and showed the detailed variation in the intrusion limit which may be useful for further investigations of the algae bloom mechanism in the tributary bays with the intrusive currents due to the temperature induced density differences the water exchange between the xxb and the mainstream of the tgr is amplified although the inflow from the upper reach of the xxb is relatively small the average fluxes of the intrusive and downward currents in the lower reaches of the xxb can reach 6 times of the inflow discharge from the upstream of the xxb even under the condition of water level decreasing indicating a significant water exchange in this region due to the density flows which was also confirmed by the result of pearson correlation analysis however the intrusive and downward currents in the middle and upper reaches of the xxb are much weak in fact existing studies indicated that the most of algae blooms occur in the middle reach of the xxb li et al 2018 liu et al 2012b mao et al 2015 tian 2012 which can be explained by the results in this study it also showed that the fluxes of both the intrusive and downward currents are relative small during the normal running and discharging periods this phenomenon corresponds to the short intrusion distance in the two periods and indicates the weak hydrodynamic condition moreover existing studies have shown that algae blooms often occur in spring middle and end discharging period and summer flooding period gao et al 2018 liu et al 2012b xu et al 2011 zhu et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 on one hand this should be related to the warm water temperature during these periods on the other hand this also may be the result of proper mixing ratio of water from the tgr and upstream of the xxr in spring and summer even the flux of intrusive current is small it may provide right amount of nitrogen at the right time which just match the phosphorus from the tributary watershed while in the impounding period large amount of water from the tgr may destroy the ratio which constrain the growth of algae however this is just an assumption and it need to be justified by field investigation in the current study a 3d model was used to simulate the flow field and temperature distribution the result of the model simulation showed that the water movement and temperature in the xxb present obvious 3d characteristics the characteristics are more obvious near the confluence between the tgr and the xxb and in the bend channels that located in the middle and lower reaches of the xxb in these regions the lateral velocity that has the same order of the longitudinal velocity should have effects on the water transport both in longitudinal and lateral directions the result indicated that ignoring the lateral currents when studying the hydrodynamic thermal conditions and nutrient level along the thalweg of the xxb might cause problems among the tributaries of the tgr the xxb is a tributary bay with less bend channels even under this condition the 3d characteristics is obvious considering the similar situation of density flows in other tributaries bays in the tgr there should be more obvious 3d characteristics 5 conclusion in this study a 3d numerical model was established to investigate the thermal hydrodynamic processes in the xxb the model was calibrated and validated using field measured data the model predictions agree with the field measured data thus the model can be used to simulate the thermal hydrodynamic processes in the xxb the model results show that notable density flows occur in the xxb due to the water temperature difference between the xxb and mainstream of the tgr and that the water flow patterns vary depending on the season the analysis of the correlations among the water flow patterns water level variation water fluxes and thermal conditions indicates that the temperature difference is the predominant factor controlling the water flow patterns and the water exchange between the xxb and mainstream of the tgr the bottom layer intrusive current from the mainstream of the tgr represents the general flow pattern in the normal running period and early discharging period in the xxb however the surface layer intrusive currents are dominant in the rest of the year with middle layer intrusive currents occasionally occurring in the flooding period and early impounding period because of significant temperature stratification the fluxes of intrusive and downward currents caused by the water temperature difference are significant in the xxb although the inflow from the upper reach of the xxr is relatively small a large volume of water from the mainstream of the tgr intrudes into the xxb with a residence time of 7 1 18 5 days in the lower and middle reaches and the water within the intrusion limit being renewed at least five times during an operation period this means that the intrusive currents contribute to the water exchange between the xxb and mainstream of the tgr and could change the nutrient composition in the xxb the water movements and temperature distribution are 3d in the xxb significant lateral currents also occur in the xxb in the lower reach of the tributary bay the speed of the lateral currents reaches the same level as that of the longitudinal vertical movement the lateral currents also induce a temperature variation in the lateral direction these facts indicate that the hydrodynamic and thermal conditions in the xxb are affected by the 3d movements through which the water flows into and out of the bay thus the complex movements and thermal conditions may influence the interactive fluxes between the xxb and mainstream of the tgr and the algae growth declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

asia sea the previous studies for this region revealed significant enhancement in extreme events and seasonal variabilities in rainfall in this study the frequency and intensity based rainfall extremity analysis was carried out by utilizing a number of rainfall extreme indices e g dry days wet days 90p 95p and 99p a seasonal non parametric mann kendall test was applied to detect significant increase and decrease of rainfall the possible causes for the acceleration and variabilities of rainfall were investigated by analyzing the impact of large scale ocean atmospheric climate interactions

significant increase of rainfall amount in most of sea regions while a minimal decrease was also found over some regions the rainfall indices displayed substantial intra decadal variabilities over the sea region the intra decadal percent of change analysis based on rainfall extreme indices revealed significant changes in rainfall extremes over sea which also evidenced the computed acceleration in rainfall over the region the correlation analysis based findings exhibited that a strong correlation existed between the sea rainfall and the large scale global climate indices generated based on the ocean atmosphere climate interactions after regionalization of the sea the global climate indices based results described the spatiotemporal variabilities in rainfall which were computed over sea regions the global climate indices such as el nino 3 4 4 0 soi noi and mjo suggested significant correlations with the seasonal rainfall and the rainfall extreme indices and highlighted that their collinearities vary within regions as per variations in the monsoon keywords rainfall variability southeast asia rainfall indices global climate indices correlation analysis 1 introduction the

wet day rainfall amount and intensity these regional studies showed that the sea regions have highly variable rainfall patterns during monsoons and are potentially under significant impact from climate change many studies also analyzed the interactions of rainfall variabilities in sea monsoons with the coupled ocean atmospheric phenomenon wang and chang 2012 mishra and dinapoli 2014 loo et al 2015 mandapaka et al 2017 mandapaka et al 2017 indicated that the extremity of the sea monsoon in terms of rainfall events would increase with the decrease of the madden julian oscillation mjo active phases xavier et al 2014 concluded that the convectively suppressed phases of mjo tend to reduce the probability of rainfall extremes and the stronger mjo events would enhance the probability of extreme rainfall events the sea region is also highly vulnerable to the influence of el nino southern oscillation enso which is known to have direct impact on the extreme events such as droughts and floods e g ward et al 2014 villafuerte and matsumoto 2015 sun et al 2015 räsänen et al 2016 kondo et al 2018 li et al 2018 räsänen et al 2016 found that most of the extreme events i e wet and dry over sea occurred during enso events especially during march to may li et al 2018 found a correlation between extreme rainfall events and enso over singapore during 1980 2013 and an enhanced intra annual variability in extreme rainfall during enso periods furthermore a few studies explored the impact of other global climate indices such as southern oscillation index soi northern oscillation index noi and quasi biennial oscillation qbo index over the sea regions and mentioned about their significance on the prediction of monsoon rainfall and extreme rainfall mandapaka et al 2017 lee 2015 tangang 2001 found a strong correlation between qbo and malaysian rainfall anomalies and linked the malaysian peninsula climate variabilities with the qbo band yan et al 2011 explained the significance of soi index to quantify the seasonal climatic variabilities in western and eastern pacific equatorial regions with relation to el nino and la nina events the direct correlation of noi was not well evaluated over sea regions but their effects on soi and enso were explained by mandapaka et al 2017 a study conducted by stilgoe 2016 showed a correlation between noi and darwin and equatorial region rainfall australia melgarejo et al 2017 explored the enso and soi based indices to analyze the precipitation extremes over mexican region generally the spatial and temporal correlations between rainfall and the highly variable sea monsoon conditions especially over long time scales are poorly studied villafuerte and matsumoto 2015 studied over sea utilizing aphrodite rainfall 1951 2007 and observed higher extreme rainfall during la nina and low rainfall during el nino kim et al 2018 utilized seven different sources of datasets including aphrodite for the rainfall analysis over the asia region and revealed that there are robust differences among the datasets exhibiting extreme precipitation statistics nevertheless aphrodite dataset still shows some limitations over sea region yatagai et al 2012 van den besselaar et al 2017 singh and qin 2019 studied gridded rainfall over sea and indicated that aphrodite rainfall is somewhat underestimating in some regions in comparison to the gap filled version of sa obs gridded datasets and other gridded rainfall products in addition a holistic study on the direct correlations between global climate indices i e soi noi qbo and noi and seasonal rainfall of sea is rather limited thus the objective of this study is to utilize a long term 1951 2014 grid based 0 5 0 5 rainfall dataset for exploring the historical rainfall characteristics in sea region the rainfall dataset was produced by merging sa obs van den besselaar et al 2017 and princeton sheffield et al 2006 el kenawy et al 2016 grid based rainfall with a few data assimilation operations singh et al 2019 the spatiotemporal seasonality and extreme rainfall variabilities will be investigated and compared with findings from other studies moreover multiple global climate indices will be utilized to find out their potential linkages to rainfall variabilities over sea regions 2 methodology 2 1 general climatology of sea and data utilized fig 1 shows the southeast asia map with different sub regions to be studied the selected study domain has latitudes ranging from 13 s to 26 n and longitudes ranging from 89 e to 149 e covering around 4 5 million km2 the sea region includes both mainland and maritime portions and is characterized by tropical hot and humid climate and abundant rainfall most of sea region owns wet and dry seasons driven by seasonal changes in winds or monsoon mandapaka et al 2017 the mainland sea region mainly including laos thailand vietnam cambodia and myanmar is primarily affected by asian summer monsoon system and the maritime portion involving malaysia singapore indonesia philippines brunei papua new guinea west papua and darwin etc normally experiences the largest rain events during the boreal winter mandapaka et al 2017 overall the climatology of sea region is highly complex and the rainfall patterns exhibit strong spatiotemporal variations loo et al 2015 this is due to the geographical differences caused by spreading of multiple size islands nearby seas wang and chang 2012 mandapaka et al 2017 gave more details on discussing the sea seasonality and complexity issues to study long term historical rainfall variations over sea many gridded rainfall datasets are made available the southeast asia observed sa obs dataset provided under the southeast asian climate assessment and dataset saca d project http sacad database bmkg go id offers high resolution sea precipitation data up to 0 25 0 25 covering the period 1981 2014 besselaar et al 2017 the princeton rainfall dataset provided by the terrestrial hydrology research group princeton university provides a 0 50 0 50 grid scale rainfall from 1948 to 2008 http hydrology princeton edu data pgf php for the entire world sheffield et al 2006 el kenawy et al 2016 the sa obs shows several large gaps at different areas of sea a data assimilation work was recently carried out by singh and qin 2019 to improve the data quality of sa obs and merge princeton 1951 1980 and sa obs datasets 1981 2014 together by using gap filling and bias correction techniques the full time series 1951 2014 of rainfall dataset is generated at 0 50 0 50 grid scale and is used in this study to perform long term rainfall assessment at regional and smaller scales 2 2 seasonal and intra decadal rainfall analysis the sea demonstrated a very complex climatology as compared to other regions mandapaka et al 2017 to understand the seasonality or rainfall patterns at different smaller regions or at specific country level the entire time series 1951 2014 of rainfall has been averaged on a monthly basis at each grid point the monthly decomposition of long term rainfall in a spatial domain is helpful in identifying different monsoon systems i e asian summer monsoon and boreal winter monsoon with their seasonal rainfall patterns at different regions of sea in this study the spatial resolution has been interpolated to a grid resolution at 0 5 0 5 scale 50 km2 by using the standard gaussian process regression method ingram et al 2005 ingram et al 2005 stahl et al 2006 the multi decadal shifts in rainfall in a spatial domain has been analyzed by dividing the whole time series ts into equal intra decadal ts years i e 16 years i ts1 1951 1966 ii ts2 1967 1982 iii ts3 1983 1998 and iv ts4 1999 2014 these intra decadal variations are computed to quantify the magnitude of change in rainfall as per the evolution of time many previous studies used the intra decadal and intra annual variations to quantify the rainfall changes in a given time range singh and goyal 2016 however investigation of the intra decadal rainfall variations over sea as a whole is rarely reported mainly due to limited availability of a long term gap free rainfall dataset over this region ratna et al 2017 van den besselaar et al 2017 2 3 generation of rainfall extreme indices after the decomposition of rainfall ts into four equal ts sets the standard rainfall extreme indices reis such as consecutive wet days wetd consecutive dry days dryd rainfall events between 2 mm and 20 mm rt2 20 rainfall events 10 mm grt10 rainfall events 20 mm grt20 rainfall events 40 mm grt40 and maximum 1 day rainfall depth max1d are generated as per the guidelines provided in previous studies li et al 2018 mandapaka et al 2017 singh and goyal 2016 zhang et al 2011 the characteristics and description of various reis are highlighted in table 1 these reis are able to highlight changes based on the amount of rainfall rainfall frequencies and rainfall intensities and could be used to help explore the annual and intra decadal changes of rainfall extremes and to validate consequences of climate change in the context of sea regions the computation of reis is based on daily rainfall at grid level and usage of spatial interpolation i e gaussian for the generation of extreme indices we did not consider the rainfall values less than 1 mm i e minimum threshold across all grids singh and goyal 2016 kruger 2006 apart from these frequencies and intensity based indices the percentage of change analysis has been performed to quantify the variation in the rainfall extreme cases between two ts sets ts1 1951 1966 is considered as a baseline scenario and the relative changes of other ts sets are calculated with respect to the baseline data e g ts1 ts2 ts1 ts3 and ts1 ts4 2 4 seasonal and spatiotemporal trend analysis a non parametric mann kendall mk test is applied to detect significant increase or decrease in monthly rainfall and reis at each grid mann 1945 kendall 1975 such a test has been extensively used in identifying trends in hydro meteorological time series singh and goyal 2016 li et al 2018 the monthly statistics of mk test z score explore the seasonal variability in rainfall across all regions and the test of reis highlight the extremity of rainfall singh and goyal 2016 in mk test the idea is that if a consistent trend is present the signal values will tend to increase or decrease frequently each value is likened to every value preceding it in the time series singh and goyal 2016 in a mk test the positive coefficient values z value indicate an increasing trend of the rainfall with time and the negative ones show a decrease a significance level α of 0 5 was taken to define the local significance level in a two sided test as per the significance level used i e α 0 5 the z value greater than 1 96 indicates a significant increase in rainfall and that lower than 1 96 denotes a significant decrease 2 5 global climate indices a climate index can be defined as the modest diagnostic quantity which is utilized to demonstrate a geophysical system or circulation pattern many climate indices such as el nino soi qbo noi mjo and global mean land and ocean temperature index gmloti have been generated by various methods the warming of ocean is termed as el nino and the cooling of ocean is termed as la nina events and the atmospheric change is called southern oscillation so sun et al 2015 the effect of el nino events over sea regions shows warm and dry conditions while during la nina events regions such as malay peninsula philippines and indonesia represent wet conditions soman and slingo 1997 this coupled system drives the climate and vary year to year the soi is the oldest indicator of the el nino southern oscillation esno phases e g el nino la nina and neutral it represents the pressure differences between the tahiti and darwin at sea level yan et al 2011 when el nino events occur the sea level pressure reduces below average in tahiti region and rises above average in darwin region and the soi index will be negative the el nino 3 4 denoted as nino3 4 hereafter bounded by 5 n to 5 s from 170 w to 120 w and el nino 4 denoted as nino4 hereafter bounded by 5 s 5 n and 160 e 150 w indexes are computed based on the sea surface temperatures sst in many studies the utmost frequently used region is the nino3 4 and the most usually utilized threshold is a positive sst departure from standard greater than or equal to 0 5 c trenberth 2016 in most cases the soi is used to describe the intensity of el nino and la nina events the noi represents climate variability as per the alteration in sea level pressure slp anomalies over the north pacific high nph in the ne pacific nep and near darwin region australia schwing et al 2002 this index is mainly generated to understand the extratropical impact of el nino and la nina events in this study we include some parts of darwin region and bamaga region australia hence the noi is used to find out their significance on the rainfall variability in these regions as its effect has been highlighted by stilgoe 2016 the mjo is defined as the intraseasonal oscillations in global tropics many studies revealed that mjo has significant impact on the intraseasonal variabilities of rainfall distributions over sea mandapaka et al 2017 lim et al 2017 it is also found that the mjo activity is partially linked to the enso bergman et al 2001 the mjo associated 850 hpa zonal wind anomalies zwa generated using real time multivariate mjo series 1 rmm1 and real time multivariate mjo series 2 rmm2 methods has been found most useful in describing mjo changes wheeler and hendon 2004 similarly the qbo index tangang 2001 and gmloti li et al 2018 have been used to explain the climatic variability over the sea the qbo circulates eastward from the eastern indian ocean to the pacific ocean via sea region tangang 2001 the glmoti is considered an anomaly index in this study the values used in the glmoti are the scalar anomalies li et al 2018 apart from these global indexes the sst anomalies over the sea regions monthly averaged in interdecadal time periods i e 1961 1990 and 1981 2010 are used to signify the precipitation variability 2 6 regionalization and lag correlation analysis the main purpose of the regionalization is to assess the rainfall variability and extremity at smaller and local levels for the regionalization of sea the whole region is divided into six regions fig 1 based on the existing and reported rainfall variations ratna et al 2017 the r1 region includes mainly myanmar vietnam thailand laos and cambodia and is dominated by the south asian summer monsoon the r2 region including indonesia and malaysia is dominated by boreal winter season the r3 region including philippines is more influenced by the south asian summer monsoon system and the r4 one including areas of indonesia and west papua is mostly dominated by boreal winter monsoon system the r5 region covers mainly papua new guinea and has more variable rainfall response than west papua the r6 is categorized to highlight the rainfall variabilities over a few areas of darwin and bamaga region australia fig 1 the correlation analysis has been performed between the seasonal rainfall averaged across all regions r1 to r6 the pearson correlation coefficient hauke and kossowski 2011 is computed between each global climate indices and monthly rainfall by taking monthly lags in the global climate indices corresponding to the monthly rainfall time series in total 12 lags for 12 months scenarios 1951 2014 are generated based on a monthly lag and then correlation analysis is performed to find out the existing relation between the monthly rainfall averaged at each region i e total six regions fig 1 and global climate indices a few studies used lag correlation to find out the linkage between regional and global variables abbot and marohasy 2015 in this study both negative and positive correlations are considered but only the absolute correlation values are used in discussion after monthly correlation analysis the collinearity is determined between the annual averaged rainfall indices and global climate indices in all six regions the monthly lag scenarios all 12 lag scenarios for the given time series 1951 2014 are averaged on an annual time step and then correlation analysis is performed between the regional averaged rainfall extreme indices reis and the global climate indices the correlation analysis of rainfall extremity is to explore how well the global geo physical processes e g esno mjo etc could capture the extreme rainfall values the time series bar charts are plotted for all large scale global climate indices on a monthly time step to highlight the regional seasonality that can be visualized in these indices 3 results and discussions 3 1 sea monsoon characteristics and seasonality over the region the monthly changes of rainfall over sea region is analyzed first with details provided in fig s1 of the supplementary material overall the monthly rainfall over sea is highly variable from january to december the areas including thailand myanmar few area laos cambodia vietnam and luzon philippines receive maximum rainfall during april to september months these regions are mainly characterized by south asian summer monsoon sasm system over these regions the maximum rainfall is recorded during july and august months varying from 500 mm to 630 mm the may june months are recorded as the transitional months between pre monsoon and monsoon seasons for sasm during april the rainfall recorded is relatively low 100 mm 150 mm over the mainland sea luzon philippines the coastal areas of cambodia and thailand are the wettest regions during july august september months the monthly rainfall over regions of malaysia singapore sumatra java kalimantan sulawesi brunei west papua papua new guinea and davao philippines show higher rainfall magnitudes from october to march these regions are mostly characterized by the boreal winter season bws or australia summer monsoon asa systems over these regions the maximum rainfall is recorded during december and january varying from 400 mm to 620 mm the month of october shows notable rainfall variability in comparison to september and november for example the amount of rainfall during september is significant 300 mm 500 mm for regions characterized by the sasm but it suddenly drops in october 100 mm 250 mm hence october is recorded as the transitional month between post monsoon and monsoon seasons for bws cruz et al 2012 during february and march the rainfall are relatively low 140 mm 350 mm over malay peninsula and sumatra regions as compared to those from october to december the malaysia singapore and kalimantan regions are recorded as the wettest regions during december while davao philippines has maximum rainfall during december and january the darwin and bamaga regions australia show maximum rainfall during december to march 350 mm 500 mm and the west papua region showed high rainfall than east papua during the bws overall the sea monsoon climatology is found highly diverse and the rainfall significantly varies across the whole sea region from january to december a similar observation was previously assessed by misra and dinapoli 2014 and mandapaka et al 2017 utilizing 16 years trmm rainfall dataset mandapaka et al 2017 also revealed that the coastal areas of cambodia and thailand were wetter during sasm season while in december regions like malaya peninsula sumatra kalimantan and java received larger amount of rainfall the month of october is recorded as a critical month for the transition of rainfall between sasm and bws the regions such as malaysia singapore indonesia and philippines are mostly influenced by the bws monsoon system however they show a perceptible variability in receiving maximum amount of rainfall within the season i e from october to march lim et al 2017 previously described the intra seasonal variations in the trmm based rainfall utilizing 14 years data over sea during bws and concluded that the variation in mjo brings these rainfall changes 3 2 magnitude of change in rainfall extremes in intra decadal time series durations figs 2 6 show the percentage of change in the computed reis between various ts durations i e ts1 1951 1966 ts2 1967 1982 ts3 1983 1998 and ts4 1999 2014 the blue and red colors over the scale bar demonstrate increase and decrease in the rainfall changes respectively the time series of ts1 is used as the baseline period and any further changes in other time series are computed with respect to the baseline data fig 2a c show the percentages of change in mean rainfall from fig 2a ts1 1951 1966 and ts2 1967 1982 do not highlight much variation in the mean rainfall except for a few areas in sumatra 1 10 decrease malaysia 1 5 decrease and laos and thailand 1 6 increase the darwin australia also indicates a slight increase of rainfall 1 6 from fig 2b the rainfall increases over laos and hanoi vietnam 20 and aceh and north sumatra 5 15 during ts3 a slight decrease in rainfall amount is detected over the coastal regions of cambodia 5 8 malaysia 5 south sumatra 5 kalimantan 5 8 west java and papua new guinea 5 8 from fig 2c the regions of cambodia thailand laos vietnam philippines except luzon papua darwin and north east kalimantan show a remarkable increase in the rainfall amount 20 50 particularly in the coastal areas of vietnam and cambodia 50 60 from fig 2d to f the max1d for ts2 ts3 and ts4 increases significantly as compared to ts1 in most regions across sea the regions of cambodia thailand laos vietnam philippines except luzon papua darwin and north east kalimantan show an enormous increase in the daily rainfall intensity from 1951 to 2014 20 80 whereas a few patches like aceh south sumatra and west sumatra show a slight decrease the southern tip of malay peninsula and singapore do not show significant changes in terms of max1d fig 3a c present the percentages of change in dryds during different intra decadal ts sets the percentage of change computed between ts1 and ts2 does not show much difference across the whole sea fig 3a while in ts3 i e fig 3b dryds would decrease in most regions 20 50 the maximum decreases are observed over aceh north sumatra brunei north and east kalimantan and west papua regions while slight increases 20 are found over south kalimantan and papua new guinea regions almost similar patterns of dryds are observed in light of ts1 vs ts4 fig 3c endo et al 2009 analyzed rainfall data from 1950 to 2000 and indicated that the consecutive dryds are decreasing in sea region where the bws monsoon system dominates fig 3d f highlight the percentages of change in the wetds during different intra decadal ts sets the percentage of change computed between ts1 and ts2 shows a slight increase of wetds over laos vietnam and thailand regions fig 3d loo et al 2015 stated that the frequency of rainfall extreme is significantly changing over sea due to global warming and climate change the variability in the monsoon rainfall has significantly affected the number of wetds over the sea zou and zhou 2016 loo et al 2015 fig 3e shows that the magnitude of wetds in ts3 would increase significantly in most sea regions 20 50 the more drastic changes can be seen over aceh laos vietnam thailand north sumatra brunei north and east kalimantan and west papua regions while a slight decrease 15 20 is observed over south kalimantan and papua new guinea regions a similar pattern of wetds is observed in case of ts1 vs ts4 fig 3f overall dryds would decrease over most of sea regions except for papua new guinea and west kalimantan that show an opposite trend however java regions do not show significant changes the wetds would increase in most of the sea regions and the maximum magnitude of change is recorded in the most recent decade i e ts4 fig 4a c present the percentages of change in the number of rainfall events occurred between 2 mm and 20 mm rt2 20 which highlight the change in rainfall intensities during different intra decadal ts groups from fig 4a a slight increase 5 20 in event counts i e rt2 20 is observed over laos vietnam coastal areas of thailand and cambodia sumatra and luzon philippines regions while papua malaysia singapore java and west kalimantan regions show a slight decrease 5 8 from fig 4b ts1 vs ts3 and 4c ts1 vs ts4 the regions of thailand laos cambodia vietnam aceh sumatra philippines darwin west papua and east and north kalimantan show significant changes 10 80 in terms of event counts while papua new guinea and west and central kalimantan regions indicate a decrease 5 15 collectively all the intensity based rainfall indices showed a notable increase of rainfall extreme events over sea regions fig 4d to 4f show the count of the grt20 in intra decadal ts groups ts1 vs ts2 shows a substantial increase in the percentage 5 30 of grt20 over vietnam cambodia east java bali west papua and papua new guinea regions while west sumatra west kalimantan philippines and malaysia show a slight decrease in the percentage of grt20 as per the comparison between ts1 vs ts3 the coastal areas of cambodia vietnam and west sumatra show a substantial decrease in the percentage of grt20 fig 4e as for ts1 vs ts4 fig 4f the thailand cambodia coastal areas of vietnam davao philippines west south east kalimantan and papua regions show a substantial increase 20 60 in grt20 fig 5a c illustrate increase and decrease in the percentages of change of grt40 across all sea region the intra decadal plots demonstrate an increase in the rainfall intensity across most of the regions a significant diversity in the percentage of change in grt40 can be observed over sea among all ts groups the aceh brunei thailand coastal areas cambodia coastal areas malaysia singapore kalimantan and few areas over papua regions show an enormous increase 10 80 in the grt40 observed in all ts groups mishra and dinapoli 2014 similarly mandapaka et al 2017 found that these regions corresponded to the largest number of wet spells and were influenced by the bws rainfall during cold surge days the probability of extreme rainfall events exceeds the threshold of normal rainfall through november december january february over the malaysia singapore south west sumatra and kalimantan maximum up to 80 lim et al 2017 however the regions such as laos few areas myanmar few areas sumatra east kalimantan few areas and philippines few areas show a slight decrease in grt40 the maximum magnitude of change in grt40 is observed in fig 5c i e ts1 vs ts4 these observations demonstrate that in the recent past few years the intensity of extreme events of rainfall has enhanced from fig 4 the intensity based indices collectively indicates a large increase in the high intensity rainfall events in most of the region fig 5d f demonstrate the ts variations of 90p in terms of percentage of change fig 5d e show very slight decrease e g sumatra java thailand and west kalimantan and increase e g philippines papua and vietnam in rainfall however fig 5f indicates a significant increase in rainfall over southern vietnam and cambodia kalimantan and papua regions and a decrease over sumatra and java regions similar results can be seen in terms of 95p fig 6a c and 99p fig 6d f based indices a significant change in rainfall has been recorded from the intradecadal ts sets the percentile based rainfall extreme indices clearly show that rainfall has increased in most of the parts over southern vietnam cambodia kalimantan philippines and papua regions fig 6a f 3 3 rainfall trends the trend analysis as shown in fig 7 is carried out over sea based on monthly rainfall 1951 2014 and climate extreme indices the mann kendall mk test is applied to detect significant increase and decrease in rainfall and their extreme cases 3 3 1 monthly rainfall trends fig 7 shows the results of mk test applied in the monthly rainfall time series 1951 2014 across all grids in sea the observations reveal a significant change of the rainfall trend from january to december regarding january jan and february feb trends the plots fig 7a and b show that vietnam thailand coastal areas laos and north sumatra region few areas have a significant decrease in rainfall z value recorded as 2 to 4 while kalimantan davao philippines and papua show a significant increase z value recorded as 2 to 4 however in february fig 7b the west and central kalimantan regions show a slight decrease of rainfall z is computed 2 in march fig 7c the vietnam thailand coastal areas cambodia and laos showed opposite trends and recorded a significant increase z is 2 of rainfall over the region while in kalimantan sumatra java and malaysia few areas a significant decrease is observed in april and may fig 7d and e trends are found very similar to february result fig 7b for the rainfall trends computed from february to may a consistent decrease z is recorded 1 96 is observed over malaysia and several regions of sumatra the malaysia and sumatra receive a significant amount of rainfall during february march and april months as they are associated with bws in june fig 7f the coastal areas of thailand cambodia vietnam papua sumatra and small area of malaysia show an increase in rainfall while the coastal areas of myanmar vietnam hue and da nang and malaysia show a decrease in rainfall in july and august fig 7g and h the areas corresponded to sasm system mostly show an increase in rainfall however the coastal areas of myanmar malaya peninsula java and papua new guinea show a significant decrease in july and august the singapore and nearby areas did not show any notable trend in september the coastal areas of myanmar malaya peninsula including singapore kalimantan and sumatra show a significant increase in the rainfall amount fig 7i in october and november the areas affected by bws indicates a decrease in rainfall while the areas influenced by sasm show an increase fig 7j and k in december a significant increase in rainfall amount is found over regions corresponding to sasm system fig 7l while a decrease is detected for myanmar some area coastal areas of cambodia and vietnam overall the increasing rainfall trends during monsoon season clarifies the enhancement of rainfall and their extremity over sea in sasm season and justifies the recently occurred disastrous extreme events in southern thailand and vietnam floods manton et al 2001 loo et al 2015 this also indicates that the regions subject to sasm are becoming drier during non rainy season and more prone to floods during monsoon season shamshuddin et al 2016 tangang et al 2017 3 3 2 trends in rainfall

papua new guinea show a significant increase z 1 96 other indices such as grt10 fig 8c and grt20 fig 8d demonstrate a significant increase in rainfall intensities over coastal areas of cambodia vietnam and papua some areas while thailand some areas java some areas malay peninsula some areas and brunei show a significant decrease in rainfall intensities fig 8c and d fig 8e shows a significant decrease in grt40 over sumatra and increase in grt40 over coastal areas of thailand cambodia vietnam malay peninsula papua and north kalimantan the maximum intensity of rainfall increases over coastal areas of thailand cambodia vietnam malay peninsula papua and north kalimantan and decreases over sumatra and hanoi vietnam fig 8f the mk test results also indicate a significant increase in moderate to extreme rainfall events grt10 and grt20 over the coastal areas of cambodia vietnam and papua some areas while thailand some areas java some areas and malay peninsula some areas show slight decrease which is consistent with the findings from earlier researchers xavier et al 2014 mandapaka et al 2017 the mk trends from percentile based indices fig 8g i also revealed a significant increase of rainfall in regions such as cambodia vietnam and some parts of papua and a decrease in regions such as some parts of thailand java malay peninsula and brunei these trends are consistent to the analysis results of percentage of change due to increasing global warming singh et al 2019 and sst as shown in the supplementary material fig s7 the acceleration of moisture into the atmosphere may lead to increase of rainfall amount frequency and intensity manton et al 2001 wentz 2007 3 4 global climate indices fig 9 presents monthly scenarios 1952 2014 of different global climate indices viz

monthly time series trends of nino3 4 and nino4 illustrating large fluctuations in their peaks fig 9d clearly indicates an increase in gmlot the nino3 4 and nino4 based on the sst c have significant impacts on sea in this study the strength of nino and soi which can be visualized by the extreme peaks is correlated with the rainfall amount and rainfall extremes when the nino index is lower e g during la nina events the annual rainfall becomes higher over the continents and the frequency and intensity of rainfall tend to become higher than normal the soi demonstrates the variation between the atmospheric pressure at sea level at tahiti and darwin when a la nina event occurs the pressure responses oppositely positive index the soi index is used to highlight the month to month fluctuations unrelated to nino3 4 and nino4 fig 9c because soi index is created on the sea level pressure at just two specific stations one can observe that the soi varies between 5 5 to 5 5 fig 9b representing several extreme cases during the year 1951 2014 in case of the soi index the positive soi values ranged 4 8 highlighted the la nina events and represent higher wet spells the warming of ocean is associated with el nino and it has significant impact on the weather pattern the nino indices show a large number of extreme high peaks in their time series which may lead to rainfall extreme

differences related with mjo indexes are obvious the month to month fluctuations in mjo time series indexes can be seen in fig 9c large mjo amplitude peaks implies the strong cycle of mjo and several large peaks can be observed in fig 9c the high mjo amplitude peaks are mostly recorded during january february march months overall the extreme high and low peaks can be seen in all global climate indices the monthly mean sst shows decadal increase in the temperature highlighting monthly spatial variation over sea supplementary material fig s7 in this study sst is used to highlight the temperature variations between the atmosphere and ocean which is computed at the top millimeter of the ocean the monthly mean temperature scenarios during the years 1961 1990 and 1981 2010 show a substantial change in the temperature range across all sea around 1 c increment in temperature ranges can be observed over sea based on their spatial patterns as per plots of two different decades i e

indices and sea rainfall regionalization of rainfall monthly fig 1 has been carried out to highlight the regional correlation of rainfall with the global climate indices over sea for the analysis the monthly time series 1951 2014 rainfall and global climate indexes are utilized a monthly lag is computed for 12 months for all global climate indices with respect to monthly rainfall and then correlation is computed at 95 confidence interval between lagged time series of global indexes and regional averaged monthly rainfall time series to highlight the significant positive significant negative and non significant correlations a correlation matrix has been prepared the significance in correlation analysis is computed using p value test at 95 confidence interval fig 10 presents the region wise correlation between lagged 12 steps corresponding to each month time series of global indexes and rainfall at 95 confidence interval highlighting significance of correlations from fig 10a f lag 1 l1 represents an one month lag and lag 12 l12 represents a twelve months lag the lag based correlation has been computed mainly to highlight the strongest influence of each global climate indices with rainfall amounts and rainfall extremes abbot and marohasy 2015 in the formulation of monsoon system long term atmospheric processes are involved schepen et al 2012 therefore it is necessary to enumerate the evidence supporting the use of numerous lagged climate indices for analyzing seasonal rainfall behaviour and extremes the lagged global indices which has the strongest influence on rainfall could be used as a suitable predictor for the rainfall forecasting schepen et al 2012 all regions show substantial correlations with global climate indices which are either positively or negatively correlated regional 1 r1 covers myanmar laos thailand cambodia and vietnam in r1 the nino 3 4 4 0 and mjo amplitude show around 40 and 22 correlation with rainfall fig 10a in

influenced by sasm system and it shows a significant increase in rainfall during monsoon season r1 exhibits a strong correlation 40 between rainfall and nino indexes under different lags nino is found positively correlated with rainfall within seven ten months lags the positive correlation could lead to the rainfall extremes over r1 the negative correlation may occur due to the short term lags of the global climate indices and shifting of their peaks between the two variables i e rainfall and global climate index the higher correlation coefficient representing the active warming cooling of the tropical continent during el nino la nina events the mjo amplitude shows mostly negative correlation around 20 22 with rainfall at long and short lags the other indices such as gmlot mean temperature

around 20 positive correlation with rainfall at short lags fig 10f overall the global climate indices such as nino 3 4 4 0 mjo rmm1 mjo amplitude soi noi and gmlot represent significant positive and significant negative correlations with rainfall 18 to 48 across all regions under different lag scenarios the other indices such as mjo rmm2 and qbo also exhibit 10 to 15 correlations with rainfall across all regions with different lags the existing correlations 20 to 48 between sea regional rainfall and global climate indices available at a very large scale provide an asset to explore the monsoon and rainfall characteristics over sea regions these correlations highlighted that there is a strong linkage between regional and global variables but global climate indices have diverse relationship with each regional rainfall and monsoon climatology based on the results it is observed that the other regions such as r4 r5 and r6 also represent strong correlations with most of the global climate indices fig 10 under multiple lags the correlation coefficients 0 25 computed under multiple monthly lags show a strong influence of nino soi mjo and gmlot over the two monsoon systems i e sasm and bws and highlight a consistent time lag existing between these indexes and occurrence of rainfall overall the identity of the most influential climate index is very variable and this is dependent on selection of regions magnitude of lag duration and strength of the influence 3 5 2 correlations between global climate indices and rainfall extreme indices figs 11 13 present the correlations between global climate indices and rainfall extreme indices across all regions under twelve lags of annual average global indices we also computed the significant correlations at 95 confidence interval by applying p value test applicable to pearson correlation method the significant correlation has been marked with sign figs 11 13 for this analysis the annual average time series of all global climate indices is considered from figs 11 13 the lags of the global indices and the region wise extreme climate indices are shown at x and y axes respectively fig 11a i show the correlation between dryds and global climate indices from fig 11a and b the nino 3 4 and 4 0 indicates significant correlations i e mostly positive with dryds across regions of r2 r3 r4 and r5 i e ranging from 0 20 to 0 80 under multiple lags particularly the region of r5 0 15 to 0 78 shows a strong positive correlation under lags of l5 to l12 in addition relatively large variations are observed for the correlation coefficient values in r2 0 20 to 0 45 r4 0 15 to 0 55 and r5 0 15 to 0 78 in fig 11c dryds are mainly positively correlated with the soi index in most of the regions except for r2 regions of r2 r4 and r5 demonstrate more significant fluctuations of the correlation coefficient values under multiple lags in comparison to those of r1 r3 and r6 this implies that in case of high soi the dryds would be lower as mk test results have already shown that the dryds are decreasing over most of regions during the year 1951 2014 fig 11d e and f show correlations between dryds and mjo rmm1 rmm2 and amplitude under different lags the correlations computed between dryds and mjo rmm1 positively and negatively correlated 0 20 to 0 20 rmm2 mostly positively correlated 0 20 to 0 30 do not show notable variations across all regions whereas fig 11f shows that dryds and mjo amplitude are mostly positively correlated across all regions mandapaka et al 2017 reported that due to strong mjo activity over the region the well spells increased during 1998 to 2016 the percentage of change analyses and mk test statistics from figs 3 to 8 also showed that the rainfall extreme events enhanced in these regions fig 11g shows strong negative correlations between dryds and gmlot across most regions under multiple lags except for r5 this signifies that the land and ocean temperatures pose strong influences on the wet and dry spells over the region the correlation coefficients computed between dryd and qbo range from 0 05 to 0 10 fig 11h which does not show significant correlation fig 11i illustrates that the dryd and noi are mostly positively correlated at r1 r2 and r4 and the correlations at r3 are mostly negative fig 11j 11r present the correlations between wet days wetd and all global climate indices under different lags the results seem to be rather opposite to those of dryd in case of wetd the nino indices computed have mostly negative correlation coefficients and soi has mostly positive ones fig 11j k and l these correlation coefficients show a strong relationship between the rainfall frequencies e g wet and dry spells and global climate indices which could be helpful to explore the rainfall extreme behaviour over sea regions likewise other indices also behave oppositely to dryd across all regions under different lags the results shown in fig 11 generally prove that there is a strong correlation between the regional rainfall indices i e dryd and wetd and the global climate indices such as nino3 4 nino4 soi and gmlot fig 12 presents the results of correlations between global climate indices and rainfall extreme indices of grt10 and grt20 under different lags from fig 12a and b the nino3 4 and nino4 have mostly negative correlations with grt10 ranges from 0 70 to 0 25 across all regions the soi index shows notable positive correlations with grt10 ranges 0 10 to 0 75 across all regions and most lags fig 12c fig 12d f illustrate the correlations between mjo rmm1 rmm2 and amplitude and grt10 the result between mjo rmm1 and grt10 shows moderate correlation ranges from 0 20 to 0 20 while mjo rmm2 and mjo amplitude demonstrate strong linkages with grt10 from fig 12g gmlot shows positive correlations with grt10 from 0 05 to 0 40 in most regions except for r2 from 0 20 to 0 the qbo displays mostly minor correlations with grt10 fig 12h while noi shows a strong correlation with grt10 across most regions from 0 15 to 0 60 fig 12i fig 12j r present the results associated with grt20 the nino3 4 and nino4 are found having in majority negative correlations with grt20 ranges from 0 25 to 0 68 across most regions except for r1 fig 12j and k whereas r2 r4 and r5 indicate somewhat mixed positive and negative results under multiple lags from fig 12l the soi index displays a strong positive correlation with grt20 ranges from 0 20 to 0 75 in most cases however for r1 relatively lower levels of correlations are found in most lags in terms of mjo correlations from fig 12m to 12o mjo rmm1 and mjo amplitude appear to have moderate ranges of correlation coefficients with grt20 while mjo rmm2 seems to have more noticeable negative correlations in regions of r2 r4 and r5 from 0 45 to 0 10 under different lags from fig 12p gmlot shows positive correlations with grt20 ranges from 0 02 to 0 40 in most regions although coefficient ranges are rather narrow under different lags the qbo displays consistently low correlations with grt20 in most conditions fig 12q while noi has demonstrated strong positive correlations with grt20 from 0 20 to 0 58 in most regions particularly for r3 fig 12r fig 13 shows the correlation results between various global climate indices and rainfall extreme indices of grt40 and max1d from fig 13a and 13b the nino3 4 and nino4 demonstrate mixed positive and negative results ranges from 0 50 to 0 35 across all regions r1 r5 and r6 display almost zero correlations while r3 indicates rather significant negative correlations under most lags figurers 13a and 13b the soi index illustrates a significant positive correlation with grt40 ranges from 0 10 to 0 60 in many regions except for r2 fig 13c fig 13d to13f highlight the correlations between mjo rmm1 rmm2 and amplitude and grt40 the correlations computed are generally in the moderate range i e from 0 35 to 0 20 however r4 in fig 13e and r1 in fig 13f have demonstrated relatively significant negative correlations from 0 40 to 0 20 compared with others from fig 13g gmlot shows strong positive correlations with grt40 ranges from 0 15 to 0 42 in all regions although the variation range in each region is small qbo generally displays minor correlations with grt40 fig 13h while noi shows moderate to strong correlations with grt40 across most regions particularly in r3 fig 13i the mjo rmm1 does not exhibit much sensitivity for grt40 while mjo rmm2 and mjo amplitude are found more sensitive in most regions it appears that r1 and r3 have mostly positive correlation results in fig 13d and 13e while other regions have negative ones these observations show a strong influence of mjo indexes over sasm and bws monsoon systems as r1 and r3 are mostly influenced by sasm system and other regions are mostly affected by bws mandapaka et al 2017 lim et al 2017 fig 13j 13r present the correlation analysis results between max1d and global climate indices from fig 13j and 13 k nino3 4 and nino4 demonstrate relatively weak correlations with max1d whereas r4 has shown more notable negative correlations from l10 to l12 similarly the soi index accounts a generally low correlation with max1d in most cases except for r4 which appears to have some positive correlations under higher numbers of lags fig 13m 13o highlight results between mjo rmm1 rmm2 and amplitude and max1d mjo rmm1 and mjo rmm2 generally demonstrate low to moderate variations of correlations with max1d ranges from 0 20 to 0 35 with r4 stands out to have more notable negative correlations in terms of mjo amplitude fig 13o most indices are negatively correlated and r1 has shown significantly negative correlations from fig 13p gmlot appears to have notable positive correlations with max1d ranges from 0 20 to 0 40 mainly in r2 r4 r5 and r6 it is also found that the correlation results are insensitive to the number of lags the results with qbo fig 13q are generally similar to gmlot where there are positive correlations in r2 r4 r5 and r6 but with insensitive ranges from fig 13r noi has minor negative correlations with max1d across most regions additional results of correlation matrix between percentile based rainfall extreme indices such as 90p 95p and 99p and global climate indices are available in the supplementary material s i e figures s9 and s10 generally the analysis results reveal that the frequency based rainfall extreme indices such as dryd and wetd are significantly correlated with the nino and gmlot in most regions and therefore these global indices could be useful to help predict the frequency based changes in rainfall extremes over sea the indices of grt20 and grt40 have shown their sensitivity to nino mostly negative under multiple lags soi mostly positive under multiple lags mjo rmm2 and noi thus these global climate indices may be utilized to help predict rainfall under moderate extreme conditions the correlation analysis performed between rainfall extremes and global climate indices reveals a significant linkage between large and small scale processes which is helpful to explore short and long term climate extremity and variability over the sea region similar analysis can be performed in other regions with different or similar variables for the benefit of disaster and risk assessment e g floods and droughts under climate change 4 conclusion this study investigated the rainfall variability and their causes over the sea region based on a grid based long term 1951 2014 dataset the seasonality of sea monsoon system has been explored and the spatial distribution of rainfall was analyzed over the region the rainfall extreme indices were generated and analyzed in the intra decadal time series domains the change in rainfall was observed in each intra decadal time scales the results highlighted a significant change in the rainfall over sea and the variability and extremity of rainfall were enhanced during the historical time period 1951 to 2014 the non parametric mann kendall test showed a significant increase in rainfall amounts and also exhibited a decrease over some regions of sea the dryds were decreasing and wetds were increasing in most of the sea regions the rainfall events such as grt10 grt20 and grt40 have also increased during the historical time 1951 2014 the coastal areas of thailand cambodia vietnam malay peninsula and kalimantan regions showed significant increase in the number of rainfall extreme events the march september october and november months have recorded most critical months for rainfall variability the global climate indices were utilized to understand the rainfall extremity over the sea most of the indices such as nino indexes soi and mjo exhibited a strong influence on the monsoon rainfall over sea the rainfall extreme indices and global climate indices showed a significant correlation during the long term time scale 1951 2014 the correlation coefficients based assessment of sea rainfall and their extremity provide an insight of the over assessment under two different monsoon conditions over the highly variable sea region the correlation analysis performed between global scale climate indices and regional rainfall indices helped to understand the complex

5594,this study utilized a long term 1951 2014 moderate resolution observed gridded 0 5 0 5 rainfall dataset to analyze long term and short term rainfall variability and the seasonality in southeast asia sea the previous studies for this region revealed significant enhancement in extreme events and seasonal variabilities in rainfall in this study the frequency and intensity based rainfall extremity analysis was carried out by utilizing a number of rainfall extreme indices e g dry days wet days 90p 95p and 99p a seasonal non parametric mann kendall test was applied to detect significant increase and decrease of rainfall the possible causes for the acceleration and variabilities of rainfall were investigated by analyzing the impact of large scale ocean atmospheric climate interactions through global climate indices such as el nino 3 4 and 4 0 southern oscillation index soi madden julian oscillation mjo global mean land and ocean temperature index qbo and noi our results displayed a significant increase of rainfall amount in most of sea regions while a minimal decrease was also found over some regions the rainfall indices displayed substantial intra decadal variabilities over the sea region the intra decadal percent of change analysis based on rainfall extreme indices revealed significant changes in rainfall extremes over sea which also evidenced the computed acceleration in rainfall over the region the correlation analysis based findings exhibited that a strong correlation existed between the sea rainfall and the large scale global climate indices generated based on the ocean atmosphere climate interactions after regionalization of the sea the global climate indices based results described the spatiotemporal variabilities in rainfall which were computed over sea regions the global climate indices such as el nino 3 4 4 0 soi noi and mjo suggested significant correlations with the seasonal rainfall and the rainfall extreme indices and highlighted that their collinearities vary within regions as per variations in the monsoon keywords rainfall variability southeast asia rainfall indices global climate indices correlation analysis 1 introduction the southeast asia sea region has significant variability in their monsoon systems which is strongly correlated with other weather systems such as siberian high and arctic oscillation mishra and dinapoli 2014 loo et al 2015 the countries of sea such as myanmar vietnam thailand laos cambodia and philippines except for a few island areas are largely influenced by south asian summer monsoon system that brings heavy rainfall during may to september while those like malaysia singapore indonesia and papua new guinea regions and near islands receive heavy rainfall over boreal winter monsoon mostly during november to march johnson 1987 feng et al 2010 tyrlis et al 2013 xavier et al 2014 ngo duc et al 2017 over the past decades many studies revealed complex variations in the annual cycle of rainfall over sea regions aldrian and susanto 2003 juneng and tangang 2005 lau and wang 2006 elaborated the interactions of wind terrain rainfall and monsoon circulations wang and chang 2012 mishra and dinapoli 2014 and explored the impact of climate change at both local and large scales ipcc 2013 loo et al 2015 lu et al 2015 singh et al 2019 raghavan et al 2017 in terms of climate extreme events in sea region a few studies predicted significant changes in the monsoon system of sea due to increasing temperature and shifting of monsoon rainfall in the late 21st century schewe and levermann 2012 shamshuddin et al 2016 cruz et al 2012 found significant variabilities in south asia summer monsoon rainfall and observed a decrease in rainfall amount total over philippines based on the aphrodite rainfall 1951 2007 misra and dinapoli 2014 analyzed that the length of the wet period of sea summer monsoon system seems to be a very strong climate system of the sea loo et al 2015 found a large shift in the monsoon rainfall over sea around 70 from the normal in the late 21st century and early 22nd century tangang et al 2017 studied over indonesia utilizing daily rainfall data 1971 2012 from 97 gauges and demonstrated that frequent fluctuations in consecutive wet and dry conditions mostly occurred in the west and east respectively wong et al 2018 indicated that the rainfall amount increased over malaysia during 1975 to 2006 due to winter monsoon li et al 2018 studied singapore region utilizing observed rainfall data 1980 2013 and revealed a significant increase in both wet day rainfall amount and intensity these regional studies showed that the sea regions have highly variable rainfall patterns during monsoons and are potentially under significant impact from climate change many studies also analyzed the interactions of rainfall variabilities in sea monsoons with the coupled ocean atmospheric phenomenon wang and chang 2012 mishra and dinapoli 2014 loo et al 2015 mandapaka et al 2017 mandapaka et al 2017 indicated that the extremity of the sea monsoon in terms of rainfall events would increase with the decrease of the madden julian oscillation mjo active phases xavier et al 2014 concluded that the convectively suppressed phases of mjo tend to reduce the probability of rainfall extremes and the stronger mjo events would enhance the probability of extreme rainfall events the sea region is also highly vulnerable to the influence of el nino southern oscillation enso which is known to have direct impact on the extreme events such as droughts and floods e g ward et al 2014 villafuerte and matsumoto 2015 sun et al 2015 räsänen et al 2016 kondo et al 2018 li et al 2018 räsänen et al 2016 found that most of the extreme events i e wet and dry over sea occurred during enso events especially during march to may li et al 2018 found a correlation between extreme rainfall events and enso over singapore during 1980 2013 and an enhanced intra annual variability in extreme rainfall during enso periods furthermore a few studies explored the impact of other global climate indices such as southern oscillation index soi northern oscillation index noi and quasi biennial oscillation qbo index over the sea regions and mentioned about their significance on the prediction of monsoon rainfall and extreme rainfall mandapaka et al 2017 lee 2015 tangang 2001 found a strong correlation between qbo and malaysian rainfall anomalies and linked the malaysian peninsula climate variabilities with the qbo band yan et al 2011 explained the significance of soi index to quantify the seasonal climatic variabilities in western and eastern pacific equatorial regions with relation to el nino and la nina events the direct correlation of noi was not well evaluated over sea regions but their effects on soi and enso were explained by mandapaka et al 2017 a study conducted by stilgoe 2016 showed a correlation between noi and darwin and equatorial region rainfall australia melgarejo et al 2017 explored the enso and soi based indices to analyze the precipitation extremes over mexican region generally the spatial and temporal correlations between rainfall and the highly variable sea monsoon conditions especially over long time scales are poorly studied villafuerte and matsumoto 2015 studied over sea utilizing aphrodite rainfall 1951 2007 and observed higher extreme rainfall during la nina and low rainfall during el nino kim et al 2018 utilized seven different sources of datasets including aphrodite for the rainfall analysis over the asia region and revealed that there are robust differences among the datasets exhibiting extreme precipitation statistics nevertheless aphrodite dataset still shows some limitations over sea region yatagai et al 2012 van den besselaar et al 2017 singh and qin 2019 studied gridded rainfall over sea and indicated that aphrodite rainfall is somewhat underestimating in some regions in comparison to the gap filled version of sa obs gridded datasets and other gridded rainfall products in addition a holistic study on the direct correlations between global climate indices i e soi noi qbo and noi and seasonal rainfall of sea is rather limited thus the objective of this study is to utilize a long term 1951 2014 grid based 0 5 0 5 rainfall dataset for exploring the historical rainfall characteristics in sea region the rainfall dataset was produced by merging sa obs van den besselaar et al 2017 and princeton sheffield et al 2006 el kenawy et al 2016 grid based rainfall with a few data assimilation operations singh et al 2019 the spatiotemporal seasonality and extreme rainfall variabilities will be investigated and compared with findings from other studies moreover multiple global climate indices will be utilized to find out their potential linkages to rainfall variabilities over sea regions 2 methodology 2 1 general climatology of sea and data utilized fig 1 shows the southeast asia map with different sub regions to be studied the selected study domain has latitudes ranging from 13 s to 26 n and longitudes ranging from 89 e to 149 e covering around 4 5 million km2 the sea region includes both mainland and maritime portions and is characterized by tropical hot and humid climate and abundant rainfall most of sea region owns wet and dry seasons driven by seasonal changes in winds or monsoon mandapaka et al 2017 the mainland sea region mainly including laos thailand vietnam cambodia and myanmar is primarily affected by asian summer monsoon system and the maritime portion involving malaysia singapore indonesia philippines brunei papua new guinea west papua and darwin etc normally experiences the largest rain events during the boreal winter mandapaka et al 2017 overall the climatology of sea region is highly complex and the rainfall patterns exhibit strong spatiotemporal variations loo et al 2015 this is due to the geographical differences caused by spreading of multiple size islands nearby seas wang and chang 2012 mandapaka et al 2017 gave more details on discussing the sea seasonality and complexity issues to study long term historical rainfall variations over sea many gridded rainfall datasets are made available the southeast asia observed sa obs dataset provided under the southeast asian climate assessment and dataset saca d project http sacad database bmkg go id offers high resolution sea precipitation data up to 0 25 0 25 covering the period 1981 2014 besselaar et al 2017 the princeton rainfall dataset provided by the terrestrial hydrology research group princeton university provides a 0 50 0 50 grid scale rainfall from 1948 to 2008 http hydrology princeton edu data pgf php for the entire world sheffield et al 2006 el kenawy et al 2016 the sa obs shows several large gaps at different areas of sea a data assimilation work was recently carried out by singh and qin 2019 to improve the data quality of sa obs and merge princeton 1951 1980 and sa obs datasets 1981 2014 together by using gap filling and bias correction techniques the full time series 1951 2014 of rainfall dataset is generated at 0 50 0 50 grid scale and is used in this study to perform long term rainfall assessment at regional and smaller scales 2 2 seasonal and intra decadal rainfall analysis the sea demonstrated a very complex climatology as compared to other regions mandapaka et al 2017 to understand the seasonality or rainfall patterns at different smaller regions or at specific country level the entire time series 1951 2014 of rainfall has been averaged on a monthly basis at each grid point the monthly decomposition of long term rainfall in a spatial domain is helpful in identifying different monsoon systems i e asian summer monsoon and boreal winter monsoon with their seasonal rainfall patterns at different regions of sea in this study the spatial resolution has been interpolated to a grid resolution at 0 5 0 5 scale 50 km2 by using the standard gaussian process regression method ingram et al 2005 ingram et al 2005 stahl et al 2006 the multi decadal shifts in rainfall in a spatial domain has been analyzed by dividing the whole time series ts into equal intra decadal ts years i e 16 years i ts1 1951 1966 ii ts2 1967 1982 iii ts3 1983 1998 and iv ts4 1999 2014 these intra decadal variations are computed to quantify the magnitude of change in rainfall as per the evolution of time many previous studies used the intra decadal and intra annual variations to quantify the rainfall changes in a given time range singh and goyal 2016 however investigation of the intra decadal rainfall variations over sea as a whole is rarely reported mainly due to limited availability of a long term gap free rainfall dataset over this region ratna et al 2017 van den besselaar et al 2017 2 3 generation of rainfall extreme indices after the decomposition of rainfall ts into four equal ts sets the standard rainfall extreme indices reis such as consecutive wet days wetd consecutive dry days dryd rainfall events between 2 mm and 20 mm rt2 20 rainfall events 10 mm grt10 rainfall events 20 mm grt20 rainfall events 40 mm grt40 and maximum 1 day rainfall depth max1d are generated as per the guidelines provided in previous studies li et al 2018 mandapaka et al 2017 singh and goyal 2016 zhang et al 2011 the characteristics and description of various reis are highlighted in table 1 these reis are able to highlight changes based on the amount of rainfall rainfall frequencies and rainfall intensities and could be used to help explore the annual and intra decadal changes of rainfall extremes and to validate consequences of climate change in the context of sea regions the computation of reis is based on daily rainfall at grid level and usage of spatial interpolation i e gaussian for the generation of extreme indices we did not consider the rainfall values less than 1 mm i e minimum threshold across all grids singh and goyal 2016 kruger 2006 apart from these frequencies and intensity based indices the percentage of change analysis has been performed to quantify the variation in the rainfall extreme cases between two ts sets ts1 1951 1966 is considered as a baseline scenario and the relative changes of other ts sets are calculated with respect to the baseline data e g ts1 ts2 ts1 ts3 and ts1 ts4 2 4 seasonal and spatiotemporal trend analysis a non parametric mann kendall mk test is applied to detect significant increase or decrease in monthly rainfall and reis at each grid mann 1945 kendall 1975 such a test has been extensively used in identifying trends in hydro meteorological time series singh and goyal 2016 li et al 2018 the monthly statistics of mk test z score explore the seasonal variability in rainfall across all regions and the test of reis highlight the extremity of rainfall singh and goyal 2016 in mk test the idea is that if a consistent trend is present the signal values will tend to increase or decrease frequently each value is likened to every value preceding it in the time series singh and goyal 2016 in a mk test the positive coefficient values z value indicate an increasing trend of the rainfall with time and the negative ones show a decrease a significance level α of 0 5 was taken to define the local significance level in a two sided test as per the significance level used i e α 0 5 the z value greater than 1 96 indicates a significant increase in rainfall and that lower than 1 96 denotes a significant decrease 2 5 global climate indices a climate index can be defined as the modest diagnostic quantity which is utilized to demonstrate a geophysical system or circulation pattern many climate indices such as el nino soi qbo noi mjo and global mean land and ocean temperature index gmloti have been generated by various methods the warming of ocean is termed as el nino and the cooling of ocean is termed as la nina events and the atmospheric change is called southern oscillation so sun et al 2015 the effect of el nino events over sea regions shows warm and dry conditions while during la nina events regions such as malay peninsula philippines and indonesia represent wet conditions soman and slingo 1997 this coupled system drives the climate and vary year to year the soi is the oldest indicator of the el nino southern oscillation esno phases e g el nino la nina and neutral it represents the pressure differences between the tahiti and darwin at sea level yan et al 2011 when el nino events occur the sea level pressure reduces below average in tahiti region and rises above average in darwin region and the soi index will be negative the el nino 3 4 denoted as nino3 4 hereafter bounded by 5 n to 5 s from 170 w to 120 w and el nino 4 denoted as nino4 hereafter bounded by 5 s 5 n and 160 e 150 w indexes are computed based on the sea surface temperatures sst in many studies the utmost frequently used region is the nino3 4 and the most usually utilized threshold is a positive sst departure from standard greater than or equal to 0 5 c trenberth 2016 in most cases the soi is used to describe the intensity of el nino and la nina events the noi represents climate variability as per the alteration in sea level pressure slp anomalies over the north pacific high nph in the ne pacific nep and near darwin region australia schwing et al 2002 this index is mainly generated to understand the extratropical impact of el nino and la nina events in this study we include some parts of darwin region and bamaga region australia hence the noi is used to find out their significance on the rainfall variability in these regions as its effect has been highlighted by stilgoe 2016 the mjo is defined as the intraseasonal oscillations in global tropics many studies revealed that mjo has significant impact on the intraseasonal variabilities of rainfall distributions over sea mandapaka et al 2017 lim et al 2017 it is also found that the mjo activity is partially linked to the enso bergman et al 2001 the mjo associated 850 hpa zonal wind anomalies zwa generated using real time multivariate mjo series 1 rmm1 and real time multivariate mjo series 2 rmm2 methods has been found most useful in describing mjo changes wheeler and hendon 2004 similarly the qbo index tangang 2001 and gmloti li et al 2018 have been used to explain the climatic variability over the sea the qbo circulates eastward from the eastern indian ocean to the pacific ocean via sea region tangang 2001 the glmoti is considered an anomaly index in this study the values used in the glmoti are the scalar anomalies li et al 2018 apart from these global indexes the sst anomalies over the sea regions monthly averaged in interdecadal time periods i e 1961 1990 and 1981 2010 are used to signify the precipitation variability 2 6 regionalization and lag correlation analysis the main purpose of the regionalization is to assess the rainfall variability and extremity at smaller and local levels for the regionalization of sea the whole region is divided into six regions fig 1 based on the existing and reported rainfall variations ratna et al 2017 the r1 region includes mainly myanmar vietnam thailand laos and cambodia and is dominated by the south asian summer monsoon the r2 region including indonesia and malaysia is dominated by boreal winter season the r3 region including philippines is more influenced by the south asian summer monsoon system and the r4 one including areas of indonesia and west papua is mostly dominated by boreal winter monsoon system the r5 region covers mainly papua new guinea and has more variable rainfall response than west papua the r6 is categorized to highlight the rainfall variabilities over a few areas of darwin and bamaga region australia fig 1 the correlation analysis has been performed between the seasonal rainfall averaged across all regions r1 to r6 the pearson correlation coefficient hauke and kossowski 2011 is computed between each global climate indices and monthly rainfall by taking monthly lags in the global climate indices corresponding to the monthly rainfall time series in total 12 lags for 12 months scenarios 1951 2014 are generated based on a monthly lag and then correlation analysis is performed to find out the existing relation between the monthly rainfall averaged at each region i e total six regions fig 1 and global climate indices a few studies used lag correlation to find out the linkage between regional and global variables abbot and marohasy 2015 in this study both negative and positive correlations are considered but only the absolute correlation values are used in discussion after monthly correlation analysis the collinearity is determined between the annual averaged rainfall indices and global climate indices in all six regions the monthly lag scenarios all 12 lag scenarios for the given time series 1951 2014 are averaged on an annual time step and then correlation analysis is performed between the regional averaged rainfall extreme indices reis and the global climate indices the correlation analysis of rainfall extremity is to explore how well the global geo physical processes e g esno mjo etc could capture the extreme rainfall values the time series bar charts are plotted for all large scale global climate indices on a monthly time step to highlight the regional seasonality that can be visualized in these indices 3 results and discussions 3 1 sea monsoon characteristics and seasonality over the region the monthly changes of rainfall over sea region is analyzed first with details provided in fig s1 of the supplementary material overall the monthly rainfall over sea is highly variable from january to december the areas including thailand myanmar few area laos cambodia vietnam and luzon philippines receive maximum rainfall during april to september months these regions are mainly characterized by south asian summer monsoon sasm system over these regions the maximum rainfall is recorded during july and august months varying from 500 mm to 630 mm the may june months are recorded as the transitional months between pre monsoon and monsoon seasons for sasm during april the rainfall recorded is relatively low 100 mm 150 mm over the mainland sea luzon philippines the coastal areas of cambodia and thailand are the wettest regions during july august september months the monthly rainfall over regions of malaysia singapore sumatra java kalimantan sulawesi brunei west papua papua new guinea and davao philippines show higher rainfall magnitudes from october to march these regions are mostly characterized by the boreal winter season bws or australia summer monsoon asa systems over these regions the maximum rainfall is recorded during december and january varying from 400 mm to 620 mm the month of october shows notable rainfall variability in comparison to september and november for example the amount of rainfall during september is significant 300 mm 500 mm for regions characterized by the sasm but it suddenly drops in october 100 mm 250 mm hence october is recorded as the transitional month between post monsoon and monsoon seasons for bws cruz et al 2012 during february and march the rainfall are relatively low 140 mm 350 mm over malay peninsula and sumatra regions as compared to those from october to december the malaysia singapore and kalimantan regions are recorded as the wettest regions during december while davao philippines has maximum rainfall during december and january the darwin and bamaga regions australia show maximum rainfall during december to march 350 mm 500 mm and the west papua region showed high rainfall than east papua during the bws overall the sea monsoon climatology is found highly diverse and the rainfall significantly varies across the whole sea region from january to december a similar observation was previously assessed by misra and dinapoli 2014 and mandapaka et al 2017 utilizing 16 years trmm rainfall dataset mandapaka et al 2017 also revealed that the coastal areas of cambodia and thailand were wetter during sasm season while in december regions like malaya peninsula sumatra kalimantan and java received larger amount of rainfall the month of october is recorded as a critical month for the transition of rainfall between sasm and bws the regions such as malaysia singapore indonesia and philippines are mostly influenced by the bws monsoon system however they show a perceptible variability in receiving maximum amount of rainfall within the season i e from october to march lim et al 2017 previously described the intra seasonal variations in the trmm based rainfall utilizing 14 years data over sea during bws and concluded that the variation in mjo brings these rainfall changes 3 2 magnitude of change in rainfall extremes in intra decadal time series durations figs 2 6 show the percentage of change in the computed reis between various ts durations i e ts1 1951 1966 ts2 1967 1982 ts3 1983 1998 and ts4 1999 2014 the blue and red colors over the scale bar demonstrate increase and decrease in the rainfall changes respectively the time series of ts1 is used as the baseline period and any further changes in other time series are computed with respect to the baseline data fig 2a c show the percentages of change in mean rainfall from fig 2a ts1 1951 1966 and ts2 1967 1982 do not highlight much variation in the mean rainfall

present the percentages of change in dryds during different intra decadal ts sets the percentage of change computed between ts1 and ts2 does not show much difference across the whole sea fig 3a while in ts3 i e fig 3b dryds would decrease in most regions 20 50 the maximum decreases are observed over aceh north sumatra brunei north and east kalimantan and west papua regions while slight increases 20 are found over south kalimantan and papua new guinea regions almost similar patterns of dryds are observed in light of ts1 vs ts4 fig 3c endo et al 2009 analyzed rainfall data from 1950 to 2000 and indicated that the consecutive dryds are decreasing in sea region where the bws monsoon system dominates fig 3d f highlight the percentages of change in the wetds during different intra decadal ts sets the percentage of change computed between ts1 and ts2 shows a slight increase of wetds over laos vietnam and thailand regions fig 3d loo et al 2015 stated that the frequency of rainfall extreme is significantly changing over sea due to global warming and climate change the variability in the monsoon rainfall has significantly affected the number of wetds over the sea zou and zhou 2016 loo et al 2015 fig 3e shows that the magnitude of wetds in ts3 would increase significantly in most sea regions 20 50 the more drastic changes can be seen over aceh laos vietnam thailand north sumatra brunei north and east kalimantan and west papua regions while a slight decrease 15 20 is observed over south kalimantan and papua new guinea regions a similar pattern of wetds is observed in case of ts1 vs ts4 fig 3f overall dryds would decrease over most of sea regions except for papua new guinea and west kalimantan that show an opposite trend however java regions do not show significant changes the wetds would increase in most of the sea regions and the maximum magnitude of change is recorded in the most recent decade i e ts4 fig 4a c present the percentages of change in the number of rainfall events occurred between 2 mm and 20 mm rt2 20 which highlight the change in rainfall intensities during different intra decadal ts groups from fig 4a a slight increase 5 20 in event counts i e rt2 20 is observed over laos vietnam coastal areas of thailand and cambodia sumatra and luzon philippines regions while papua malaysia singapore java and west kalimantan regions show a slight decrease 5 8 from fig 4b ts1 vs ts3 and 4c ts1 vs ts4 the regions of thailand laos cambodia vietnam aceh sumatra philippines darwin west papua and east and north kalimantan show significant changes 10 80 in terms of event counts while papua new guinea and west and central kalimantan regions indicate a decrease 5 15 collectively all the intensity based rainfall indices showed a notable increase of rainfall extreme events over sea regions fig 4d to 4f show the count of the grt20 in intra decadal ts groups ts1 vs ts2 shows a substantial increase in the percentage 5 30 of grt20 over vietnam cambodia east

the coastal areas of cambodia vietnam and west sumatra show a substantial decrease in the percentage of grt20 fig 4e as for ts1 vs ts4 fig 4f the thailand cambodia coastal areas of vietnam davao philippines west south east kalimantan and papua regions show a substantial increase 20 60 in grt20 fig 5a c illustrate increase and decrease in the percentages of change of grt40 across all sea region the intra decadal plots demonstrate an increase in the rainfall intensity across most of the regions a significant diversity in the percentage of change in grt40 can be observed over sea among all ts groups the aceh brunei thailand coastal areas cambodia coastal areas malaysia singapore kalimantan and few areas over papua regions show an enormous increase 10 80 in the grt40 observed in all ts groups mishra and dinapoli 2014 similarly mandapaka et al 2017 found that these regions corresponded to the largest number of wet spells and were influenced by the bws rainfall during cold surge days the probability of extreme rainfall events exceeds the threshold of normal rainfall through november december january february over the malaysia singapore south west sumatra and kalimantan maximum up to 80 lim et al 2017 however the regions such as laos few areas myanmar few areas sumatra east kalimantan few areas and philippines few areas show a slight decrease in grt40 the maximum magnitude of change in grt40 is observed in fig 5c i e ts1 vs ts4 these observations demonstrate that in the recent past few years the intensity of extreme events of rainfall has enhanced from fig 4 the intensity based indices collectively indicates a large increase in the high intensity rainfall events in most of the region fig 5d f demonstrate the ts variations of 90p in terms of percentage of change fig 5d e show very slight decrease e g sumatra java thailand and west kalimantan and increase e g philippines papua and vietnam in rainfall however fig 5f indicates a significant increase in rainfall over southern vietnam and cambodia kalimantan and papua regions and a decrease over sumatra and java regions similar results can be seen in terms of 95p fig 6a c and 99p fig 6d f based indices a significant change in rainfall has been recorded from the intradecadal ts sets the percentile based rainfall extreme indices clearly show that rainfall has increased in most of the parts over southern vietnam cambodia kalimantan philippines and papua regions fig 6a f 3 3 rainfall trends the trend analysis as shown in fig 7 is carried out over sea based on monthly rainfall 1951 2014 and climate extreme indices the mann kendall mk test is applied to detect significant increase and decrease in rainfall and their extreme cases 3 3 1 monthly rainfall trends fig 7 shows the results of mk test applied in the monthly rainfall time series 1951 2014 across all grids in sea the observations reveal a significant change of the rainfall trend from january to december regarding january jan and february feb trends the plots fig 7a and b show that vietnam thailand coastal areas laos and north sumatra region few areas have a significant decrease in rainfall z value recorded as 2 to 4 while kalimantan davao philippines and papua show a significant increase z value recorded as 2 to 4 however in february fig 7b the west and central kalimantan regions show a slight decrease of rainfall z is computed 2 in march fig 7c the vietnam thailand coastal areas cambodia and laos showed opposite trends and recorded a significant increase z is 2 of rainfall over the region while in kalimantan sumatra java and malaysia few areas a significant decrease is observed in april and may fig 7d and e trends are found very similar to february result fig 7b for the rainfall trends computed from february to may a consistent decrease z is recorded 1 96 is observed over malaysia and several regions of sumatra the malaysia and sumatra receive a significant amount of rainfall during february march and april months as they are associated with bws in june fig 7f the coastal areas of thailand cambodia vietnam papua sumatra and small area of malaysia show an increase in rainfall while the coastal areas of myanmar vietnam hue and da nang and malaysia show a decrease in rainfall in july and august fig 7g and h the areas corresponded to sasm system mostly show an increase in rainfall however the coastal areas of myanmar malaya peninsula java and papua new guinea show a significant decrease in july and august the singapore and nearby areas did not show any notable trend in september the coastal areas of myanmar malaya peninsula including singapore kalimantan and sumatra show a significant increase in the rainfall amount fig 7i in october and november the areas affected by bws indicates a decrease in rainfall while the areas influenced by sasm show an increase fig 7j and k in december a significant increase in rainfall amount is found over regions corresponding to sasm system fig 7l while a decrease is detected for myanmar some area coastal areas of cambodia and vietnam overall the increasing rainfall trends during monsoon season clarifies the enhancement of rainfall and their extremity over sea in sasm season and justifies the recently occurred disastrous extreme events in southern thailand and vietnam floods manton et al 2001 loo et al 2015 this also indicates that the regions subject to sasm are becoming drier during non rainy season and more prone to floods during monsoon season shamshuddin et al 2016 tangang et al 2017 3 3 2 trends in rainfall

papua new guinea show a significant increase z 1 96 other indices such as grt10 fig 8c and grt20 fig 8d demonstrate a significant increase in rainfall intensities over coastal areas of cambodia vietnam and papua some areas while thailand some areas java some areas malay peninsula some areas and brunei show a significant decrease in rainfall intensities fig 8c and d fig 8e shows a significant decrease in grt40 over sumatra and increase in grt40 over coastal areas of thailand cambodia vietnam malay peninsula papua and north kalimantan the maximum intensity of rainfall increases over coastal areas of thailand cambodia vietnam malay peninsula papua and north kalimantan and decreases over sumatra and hanoi vietnam fig 8f the mk test results also indicate a significant increase in moderate to extreme rainfall events grt10 and grt20 over the coastal areas of cambodia vietnam and papua some areas while thailand some areas java some areas and malay peninsula some areas show slight decrease which is consistent with the findings from earlier researchers xavier et al 2014 mandapaka et al 2017 the mk trends from percentile based indices fig 8g i also revealed a significant increase of rainfall in regions such as cambodia vietnam and some parts of papua and a decrease in regions such as some parts of thailand java malay peninsula and brunei these trends are consistent to the analysis results of percentage of change due to increasing global warming singh et al 2019 and sst as shown in the supplementary material fig s7 the acceleration of moisture into the atmosphere may lead to increase of rainfall amount frequency and intensity manton et al 2001 wentz 2007 3 4 global climate indices fig 9 presents monthly scenarios 1952 2014 of different global climate indices viz

monthly time series trends of nino3 4 and nino4 illustrating large fluctuations in their peaks fig 9d clearly indicates an increase in gmlot the nino3 4 and nino4 based on the sst c have significant impacts on sea in this study the strength of nino and soi which can be visualized by the extreme peaks is correlated with the rainfall amount and rainfall extremes when the nino index is lower e g during la nina events the annual rainfall becomes higher over the continents and the frequency and intensity of rainfall tend to become higher than normal the soi demonstrates the variation between the atmospheric pressure at sea level at tahiti and darwin when a la nina event occurs the pressure responses oppositely positive index the soi index is used to highlight the month to month fluctuations unrelated to nino3 4 and nino4 fig 9c because soi index is created on the sea level pressure at just two specific stations one can observe that the soi varies between 5 5 to 5 5 fig 9b representing several extreme cases during the year 1951 2014 in case of the soi index the positive soi values ranged 4 8 highlighted the la nina events and represent higher wet spells the warming of ocean is associated with el nino and it has significant impact on the weather pattern the nino indices show a large number of extreme high peaks in their time series which may lead to rainfall extreme events fig 9a and b the noi also shows several extreme peaks 11 to 8 in the plotted time series during 1952 2006 fig 9f the real time multivariate mjo series rmm indexes combine cloud amount and winds at upper and lower levels of the atmosphere which highlight the temporal variability in atmosphere fig 9c these indexes provide a measure of the strength and location of the mjo intra seasonal differences related with mjo indexes are obvious the month to month fluctuations in mjo time series indexes can be seen in fig 9c large mjo amplitude peaks implies the strong cycle of mjo and several large peaks can be observed in fig 9c the high mjo amplitude peaks are mostly recorded during january february march months overall the extreme high and low peaks can be seen in all global climate indices the monthly mean sst shows decadal increase in the temperature highlighting monthly spatial variation over sea supplementary material fig s7 in this study sst is used to highlight the temperature variations between the atmosphere and ocean which is computed at the top millimeter of the ocean the monthly mean temperature scenarios during the years 1961 1990 and 1981 2010 show a substantial change in the temperature range across all sea around 1 c increment in temperature ranges can be observed over sea based on their spatial patterns as per plots of two different decades i e 1961 1990 and 1981 2010 the maximum change is observed during march july august september months supplementary material fig s7 the warming of ocean is related to the forming of clouds and has a strong

indices and sea rainfall regionalization of rainfall monthly fig 1 has been carried out to highlight the regional correlation of rainfall with the global climate indices over sea for the analysis the monthly time series 1951 2014 rainfall and global climate indexes are utilized a monthly lag is computed for 12 months for all global climate indices with respect to monthly rainfall and then correlation is computed at 95 confidence interval between lagged time series of global indexes and regional averaged monthly rainfall time series to highlight the significant positive significant negative and non significant correlations a correlation matrix has been prepared the significance in correlation analysis is computed using p value test at 95 confidence interval fig 10 presents the region wise correlation between lagged 12 steps corresponding to each month time series of global indexes and rainfall at 95 confidence interval highlighting significance of correlations from fig 10a f lag 1 l1 represents an one month lag and lag 12 l12 represents a twelve months lag the lag based correlation has been computed mainly to highlight the strongest influence of each global climate indices with rainfall amounts and rainfall extremes abbot and marohasy 2015 in the formulation of monsoon system long term atmospheric processes are involved schepen et al 2012 therefore it is necessary to enumerate the evidence supporting the use of numerous lagged climate indices for analyzing seasonal rainfall behaviour and extremes the lagged global indices which has the strongest influence on rainfall could be used as a suitable predictor for the rainfall forecasting schepen et al 2012 all regions show substantial correlations with global climate indices which are either positively or negatively correlated regional 1 r1 covers myanmar laos thailand cambodia and vietnam in r1 the nino 3 4 4 0 and mjo amplitude show around 40 and 22 correlation with rainfall fig 10a in

influenced by sasm system and it shows a significant increase in rainfall during monsoon season r1 exhibits a strong correlation 40 between rainfall and nino indexes under different lags nino is found positively correlated with rainfall within seven ten months lags the positive correlation could lead to the rainfall extremes over r1 the negative correlation may occur due to the short term lags of the global climate indices and shifting of their peaks between the two variables i e rainfall and global climate index the higher correlation coefficient representing the active warming cooling of the tropical continent during el nino la nina events the mjo amplitude shows mostly negative correlation around 20 22 with rainfall at long and short lags the other indices such as gmlot mean temperature

correlation positive during short lags and negative during long lags between the global climate indices such as nino mjo soi and rainfall 20 40 illustrating a resilient relationship between enso and mjo in both regions i e r1 and r2 the nino indexes show a strong interaction with rainfall and significant positive and negative trends this relationship explores the seasonal variability in rainfall over these regions during strong mjo active phases in bws the chances of consecutive wet days may be enhanced over the region mandapaka et al 2017 if the correlation coefficient computed between the

papua west papua and central papua region fig 1 in r4 fig 10d the indices such as soi mjo rmm1 nino3 4 noi nino4 and gmlot show significant correlations i e around 18 to 40 with rainfall where nino3 4 and nino4 demonstrate significant negative correlations in long lags i e l7 l12 and significant positive correlations in short lags l1 l5 nino4 and nino3 4 highlight around 35 40 negative correlation with rainfall at long lags fig 10d the indices such as soi mjo rmm1 noi and gmlot show positive correlation with rainfall at long lags while nino3 4 shows around 40 correlation with rainfall at short lags fig 10d mjo rmm2 and mjo amp found non significant over r4 fig 8d region 5 r5 and region 6 r6 cover papua new guinea and australia darwin and bamaga regions respectively fig 1 in r5 fig 8e the nino3 4 shows a positive correlation 28 with rainfall at short lags and negative correlation 38 at long lags i e l7 l12 the other indices such as mjo rmm1 and soi display positive correlation 20 22 with rainfall at long lags while mjo amplitude shows positive correlation 20 at short lags fig 10e in r6 fig 10f the nino3 4 shows a significant positive correlation with rainfall 40 at short lags and a significant negative correlation 40 at long lags i e l7 12 the other indices such as soi and mjo rmm1 show around 20 positive correlation with rainfall at long lags while the mjo amplitude shows around 20 positive correlation with rainfall at short lags fig 10f overall the global climate indices such as nino 3 4 4 0 mjo rmm1 mjo amplitude soi noi and gmlot represent significant positive and significant negative correlations with rainfall 18 to 48 across all regions under different lag scenarios the other indices such as mjo rmm2 and qbo also exhibit 10 to 15 correlations with rainfall across all regions with different lags the existing correlations 20 to 48 between sea regional rainfall and global climate indices available at a very large scale provide an asset to explore the monsoon and rainfall characteristics over sea regions these correlations highlighted that there is a strong linkage between regional and global variables but global climate indices have diverse relationship with each regional rainfall and monsoon climatology based on the results it is observed that the other regions such as r4 r5 and r6 also represent strong correlations with most of the global climate indices fig 10 under multiple lags the correlation coefficients 0 25 computed under multiple monthly lags show a strong influence of nino soi mjo and gmlot over the two monsoon systems i e sasm and bws and highlight a consistent time lag existing between these indexes and occurrence of rainfall overall the identity of the most influential climate index is very variable and this is dependent on selection of regions magnitude of lag duration and strength of the influence 3 5 2 correlations between global climate indices and rainfall extreme indices figs 11 13 present the correlations between global climate indices and rainfall extreme indices across all regions under twelve lags of annual average global indices we also computed the significant correlations at 95 confidence interval by applying p value test applicable to pearson correlation method the significant correlation has been marked with sign figs 11 13 for this analysis the annual average time series of all global climate indices is considered from figs 11 13 the lags of the global indices and the region wise extreme climate indices are shown at x and y axes respectively fig 11a i show the correlation between dryds and global climate indices from fig 11a and b the nino 3 4 and 4 0 indicates significant correlations i e mostly positive with dryds across regions of r2 r3 r4 and r5 i e ranging from 0 20 to 0 80 under multiple lags particularly the region of r5 0 15 to 0 78 shows a strong positive correlation under lags of l5 to l12 in addition relatively large variations are observed for the correlation coefficient values in r2 0 20 to 0 45 r4 0 15 to 0 55 and r5 0 15 to 0 78 in fig 11c dryds are mainly positively correlated with the soi index in most of the regions except for r2 regions of r2 r4 and r5 demonstrate more significant fluctuations of the correlation coefficient values under multiple lags in comparison to those of r1 r3 and r6 this implies that in case of high soi the dryds would be lower as mk test results have already shown that the dryds are decreasing over most of regions during the year 1951 2014 fig 11d e and f show correlations between dryds and mjo rmm1 rmm2 and amplitude under different lags the correlations computed between dryds and mjo rmm1 positively and negatively correlated 0 20 to 0 20 rmm2 mostly positively correlated 0 20 to 0 30 do not show notable variations across all regions whereas fig 11f shows that dryds and mjo amplitude are mostly positively correlated across all regions mandapaka et al 2017 reported that due to strong mjo activity over the region the well spells increased during 1998 to 2016 the percentage of change analyses and mk test statistics from figs 3 to 8 also showed that the rainfall extreme events enhanced in these regions fig 11g shows strong negative correlations between dryds and gmlot across most regions under multiple lags except for r5 this signifies that the land and ocean temperatures pose strong influences on the wet and dry spells over the region the correlation coefficients computed between dryd and qbo range from 0 05 to 0 10 fig 11h which does not show significant correlation fig 11i illustrates that the dryd and noi are mostly positively correlated at r1 r2 and r4 and the correlations at r3 are mostly negative fig 11j 11r present the correlations between wet days wetd and all global climate indices under different lags the results seem to be rather opposite to those of dryd in case of wetd the nino indices computed have mostly negative correlation coefficients and soi has mostly positive ones fig 11j k and l these correlation coefficients show a strong relationship between the rainfall frequencies e g wet and dry spells and global climate indices which could be helpful to explore the rainfall extreme behaviour over sea regions likewise other indices also behave oppositely to dryd across all regions under different lags the results shown in fig 11 generally prove that there is a strong correlation between the regional rainfall indices i e dryd and wetd and the global climate indices such as nino3 4 nino4 soi and gmlot fig 12 presents the results of correlations between global climate indices and rainfall extreme indices of grt10 and grt20 under different lags from fig 12a and b the nino3 4 and nino4 have mostly negative correlations with grt10 ranges from 0 70 to 0 25 across all regions the soi index shows notable positive correlations with grt10 ranges 0 10 to 0 75 across all regions and most lags fig 12c fig 12d f illustrate the correlations between mjo rmm1 rmm2 and amplitude and grt10 the result between mjo rmm1 and grt10 shows moderate correlation ranges from 0 20 to 0 20 while mjo rmm2 and mjo amplitude demonstrate strong linkages with grt10 from fig 12g gmlot shows positive correlations with grt10 from 0 05 to 0 40 in most regions except for r2 from 0 20 to 0 the qbo displays mostly minor correlations with grt10 fig 12h while noi shows a strong correlation with grt10 across most regions from 0 15 to 0 60 fig 12i fig 12j r present the results associated with grt20 the nino3 4 and nino4 are found having in majority negative correlations with grt20 ranges from 0 25 to 0 68 across most regions except for r1 fig 12j and k whereas r2 r4 and r5 indicate somewhat mixed positive and negative results under multiple lags from fig 12l the soi index displays a strong positive correlation with grt20 ranges from 0 20 to 0 75 in most cases however for r1 relatively lower levels of correlations are found in most lags in terms of mjo correlations from fig 12m to 12o mjo rmm1 and mjo amplitude appear to have moderate ranges of correlation coefficients with grt20 while mjo rmm2 seems to have more noticeable negative correlations in regions of r2 r4 and r5 from 0 45 to 0 10 under different lags from fig 12p gmlot shows positive correlations with grt20 ranges from 0 02 to 0 40 in most regions although coefficient ranges are rather narrow under different lags the qbo displays consistently low correlations with grt20 in most conditions fig 12q while noi has demonstrated strong positive correlations with grt20 from 0 20 to 0 58 in most regions particularly for r3 fig 12r fig 13 shows the correlation results between various global climate indices and rainfall extreme indices of grt40 and max1d from fig 13a and 13b the nino3 4 and nino4 demonstrate mixed positive and negative results ranges from 0 50 to 0 35 across all regions r1 r5 and r6 display almost zero correlations while r3 indicates rather significant negative correlations under most lags figurers 13a and 13b the soi index illustrates a significant positive correlation with grt40 ranges from 0 10 to 0 60 in many regions except for r2 fig 13c fig 13d to13f highlight the correlations between mjo rmm1 rmm2 and amplitude and grt40 the correlations computed are generally in the moderate range i e from 0 35 to 0 20 however r4 in fig 13e and r1 in fig 13f have demonstrated relatively significant negative correlations from 0 40 to 0 20 compared with others from fig 13g gmlot shows strong positive correlations with grt40 ranges from 0 15 to 0 42 in all regions although the variation range in each region is small qbo generally displays minor correlations with grt40 fig 13h while noi shows moderate to strong correlations with grt40 across most regions particularly in r3 fig 13i the mjo rmm1 does not exhibit much sensitivity for grt40 while mjo rmm2 and mjo amplitude are found more sensitive in most regions it appears that r1 and r3 have mostly positive correlation results in fig 13d and 13e while other regions have negative ones these observations show a strong influence of mjo indexes over sasm and bws monsoon systems as r1 and r3 are mostly influenced by sasm system and other regions are mostly affected by bws mandapaka et al 2017 lim et al 2017 fig 13j 13r present the correlation analysis results between max1d and global climate indices from fig 13j and 13 k nino3 4 and nino4 demonstrate relatively weak correlations with max1d whereas r4 has shown more notable negative correlations from l10 to l12 similarly the soi index accounts a generally low correlation with max1d in most cases except for r4 which appears to have some positive correlations under higher numbers of lags fig 13m 13o highlight results between mjo rmm1 rmm2 and amplitude and max1d mjo rmm1 and mjo rmm2 generally demonstrate low to moderate variations of correlations with max1d ranges from 0 20 to 0 35 with r4 stands out to have more notable negative correlations in terms of mjo amplitude fig 13o most indices are negatively correlated and r1 has shown significantly negative correlations from fig 13p gmlot appears to have notable positive correlations with max1d ranges from 0 20 to 0 40 mainly in r2 r4 r5 and r6 it is also found that the correlation results are insensitive to the number of lags the results with qbo fig 13q are generally similar to gmlot where there are positive correlations in r2 r4 r5 and r6 but with insensitive ranges from fig 13r noi has minor negative correlations with max1d across most regions additional results of correlation matrix between percentile based rainfall extreme indices such as 90p 95p and 99p and global climate indices are available in the supplementary material s i e figures s9 and s10 generally the analysis results reveal that the frequency based rainfall extreme indices such as dryd and wetd are significantly correlated with the nino and gmlot in most regions and therefore these global indices could be useful to help predict the frequency based changes in rainfall extremes over sea the indices of grt20 and grt40 have shown their sensitivity to nino mostly negative under multiple lags soi mostly positive under multiple lags mjo rmm2 and noi thus these global climate indices may be utilized to help predict rainfall under moderate extreme conditions the correlation analysis performed between rainfall extremes and global climate indices reveals a significant linkage between large and small scale processes which is helpful to explore short and long term climate extremity and variability over the sea region similar analysis can be performed in other regions with different or similar variables for the benefit of disaster and risk assessment e g floods and droughts under climate change 4 conclusion this study investigated the rainfall variability and their causes over the sea region based on a grid based long term 1951 2014 dataset the seasonality of sea monsoon system has been explored and the spatial distribution of rainfall was analyzed over the region the rainfall extreme indices were generated and analyzed in the intra decadal time series domains the change in rainfall was observed in each intra decadal time scales the results highlighted a significant change in the rainfall over sea and the variability and extremity of rainfall were enhanced during the historical time period 1951 to 2014 the non parametric mann kendall test showed a significant increase in rainfall amounts and also exhibited a decrease over some regions of sea the dryds were decreasing and wetds were increasing in most of the sea regions the rainfall events such as grt10 grt20 and grt40 have also increased during the historical time 1951 2014 the coastal areas of thailand cambodia vietnam malay peninsula and kalimantan regions showed significant increase in the number of rainfall extreme events the march september october and november months have recorded most critical months for rainfall variability the global climate indices were utilized to understand the rainfall extremity over the sea most of the indices such as nino indexes soi and mjo exhibited a strong influence on the monsoon rainfall over sea the rainfall extreme indices and global climate indices showed a significant correlation during the long term time scale 1951 2014 the correlation coefficients based assessment of sea rainfall and their extremity provide an insight of the over assessment under two different monsoon conditions over the highly variable sea region the correlation analysis performed between global scale climate indices and regional rainfall indices helped to understand the complex climatology of sea and the observations could be utilized for disaster risk reduction and adaptation planning under climate change declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have
