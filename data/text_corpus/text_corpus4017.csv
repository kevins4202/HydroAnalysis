20085,there is a crucial need to achieve a more sustainable management of the world s water resources with serious water scarcity and water pollution the trans basin movement of water faces major environmental and engineering challenges and remains controversial therefore improved management of water within basins offers more feasible options to enhance the efficiency of water use this paper aimed to find out the bottlenecks of integrated catchment management summarizes the research frontier about integrated catchment management and put forwards some measures mainly include taking the interaction impacts among water land and other factors into consideration evaluating the effectiveness and impacts on different systems of decisions and policies based on appropriate methods and strengthening watershed management capacity this paper provides decision making information for integrated catchment management the government should strengthen the scientific research in the relationship between water sector and other sectors and account trans basin water resources flow moreover participation of different stakeholders is one of key points to promote the success of integrated water resources management iwrm much of the evidence in this paper is from the heihe river basin which is the second largest inland river basin in china while this evidence comes from a specific area the integrated economic and environmental modeling presented in this paper can usefully be applied to river basin management elsewhere indeed the international collaboration of researchers evident in this paper is a testament to the worldwide interest in freshwater management issues keywords integrated water resources management watershed management capacity input output analysis virtual water resources trade off analysis decision support system 1 introduction since the catchment is recognized as an appropriate scale for natural resource planning and management integrated water resources management iwrm at basin level has emerged as the major paradigm for managing natural resources prato and herath 2007 iwrm can be defined as the coordinated planning and management of land water and other environmental resources for their equitable efficient and sustainable use at the catchment scale batchelor 1999 with the intensification of human activities on natural interference the integrated management of natural resources is becoming increasingly important this catchment based approach helps to achieve a balance between the interdependent roles of resources protection and resource utilization nowadays most researches related to integrated water resources management iwrm were mainly concentrated on single elements or the interaction effect between two elements especially the water or land resources zia et al 2013 analyzed the impact of agricultural activities on water quality deng et al 2015 took heihe river basin of china as study object to analyze the impacts of land use and land cover changes on surface energy and water balance whitehead et al 2009 summarized the potential impacts of climate change on surface water quality however there are interaction influences among water resources land resources and human behaviors as we have known so far there are few scholars research coercing effects of different resources in catchment because their complex relationship the sharp conflict between resources demand and available natural resources is one of the largest threats to sustainable development of ecosystem and socio economic systems from the perspective of resource and environment management the main reason for this conflict is irrational use of natural resources and environmental management under this background this paper aimed to analyze coercing impacts among the main management elements evaluate the effectiveness of decisions or policies related to water resources management based on trade off analysis put forward effective measures for watershed management following this introduction section 2 analyzes the management elements and their relationships next section 3 summarizes the methods related to integrated river basin management based on trade off analysis section 4 puts forward some measures of strengthening watershed management capacity section 5 concludes additionally the framework for integrated water resources management is shown in fig 1 2 elements of integrated water resources management in order to realize the sustainable development of catchment iwrm is gradually recognized in the academic culture giupponi et al 2004 the elements of water resources management mainly include water soil atmosphere biology and human beings fig 2 from the perspective of single element water is an essential resource for guaranteeing socio economic development and maintaining healthy ecosystems land is the material basis on which human beings live and develop the atmosphere is necessary for the survival of man and other biology biology includes plants animals and microorganism which is great significance to human beings inevitably they also pose a threat to humanity for example flood and disease the elements of water soil atmosphere and biology are all affected by human life and production behavior therefore we should use and manage them reasonably in terms of water resources management the management of water mainly refers to the water resources allocation soil refers to the land use plan atmosphere refers to the air environmental protection biology refers to the conservation of biodiversity human beings refer to the human activities and decision making behavior less than 1 of the world s fresh water is accessible for direct human uses berrittella et al 2007 attention is increasingly being paid to water resources because of extreme pressure from economic growth and corresponding changes of the patterns of life as well as the serious water scarcity induced by climate change and anthropogenic activities the growing scarcity of fresh water has been caused by a rapid increase in water demand to develop economies improve the environment support people s daily life and sustain development in many regions of the world watkins 2006 the water resource management and land use patterns are intrinsically linked with each other the provision of water resources is closely related to the hydrological processes which are considered to be affected mainly by climate and land use cover changes in the catchments anthropogenic land use and land cover changes lucc have dramatically altered the earth s land surface margono et al 2012 and played a vital role in reshaping the catchments ecosystem the largescale land use cover dynamics exerted huge impacts on the surface energy and water balance through biochemical and biophysical processes twine et al 2004 liu and deng 2011 deng et al 2012a b huang et al 2013 besides the surface roughness albedo and other properties which affect exchanges of water and energy between the land surface and the atmosphere will be altered by the conversion of natural ecosystems to irrigated agriculture leading to various changes of the surface energy and net radiation in different seasons kueppers and snyder 2012 different land use types have different land cover characteristics which play different roles in ecosystem services supply liu et al 2019 the change of land use resources quantity spatial pattern and land use type will cause the change of natural environment and ecological process beyond that lucc will lead to changes in biological populations deng et al 2008 and 2011a have developed the computable general equilibrium models of land use change cgeluc and dynamics of land system dls for policy simulation and lucc modeling which are useful tools for sustainable resources management the cgeluc is a mechanistic model based on microeconomic theory and can not only effectively reflect mechanisms in structural changes in regional land use but also provide support for water resources management strategies deng 2011b 2011c the dls is a collection of programs that simulates pattern changes in lucc under given land use scenarios by integrating several driving factors of spatial pattern changes land use conversion rules and dynamic spatiotemporal processes of land use changes deng et al 2010a b deng 2011c combining the cgeluc and dls model it can be applied to simulate and predict regional lucc including water resources under different scenarios jin et al 2017 the atmosphere quality affected by two aspects which are human activities and air purification capacity of the ecosystems with the development of industry a large number of harmful gas emission led to worse air quality global warming and even acid rain the ecosystem has the function of purifying the atmosphere air pollution occurs when the amount of pollutants emitted exceeds the carrying capacity of the ecosystem biodiversity also lost by the urban expansion and global climate change from the above analysis relationships among these five elements are complexed and a slight move in one may affect the whole situation of natural and socio economic system in the process of water resources management the interaction relationships among water land and other factors are key point in designing and implementing integrated approaches 3 integrated water resources management based on trade off analysis trade off is a fundamental concept in economics while being especially applied in an evolutionary context garland 2014 trade off of implementation effects of management strategies occurs when human interventions for example economic development or environment protection policy or water resource allocation strategy enhances the output of an economy while negatively affects the nature ecosystems conversely some managerial decisions related to one management element may result in the status change of other elements the consideration of improvement of the ecosystem status as the unique objective in the design and prioritization of management actions may lead to undesired negative consequences for human well being as a result of a decrease in the level of certain ecosystem services terrado et al 2016 the consideration of costs and benefits of measures should be progressively included in the decision making progress adams 2014 in addition trade off analysis of ecosystem services can help to identify optimal decision points to balance the costs and benefits of the diverse human uses of ecosystems deng et al 2016 the methods of trade off the decisions mainly include cost effectiveness analysis cea balana et al 2011 berbel et al 2011 cost benefit analysis cba del saz salazar et al 2009 martin ortega et al 2011 honey rosés et al 2013 multiple criteria decision analysis mcda and scenario analysis in a generic sense cea is a technique for identifying the least cost option for meeting a specific physical objective outcome balana et al 2011 cba is superior to cea because in cba both the costs and benefits are accounted in monetary terms while cea in physical terms furthermore cea does not consider the effects of management actions on human well being resulting from changes in the provision of ecosystem services multiple criteria decision analysis mcda provides a suitable conceptual framework for evaluating water resources management decisions using a variety of methods including multiple criteria utility functions ideal point electre goal programming analytical hierarchy process benefit cost analysis and others janssen 1992 which avoid many of the limitations of single criterion input output analysis is a comprehensive method that presents the trade and flow between sectors in national economy compiling resources accounts embedded input output io tables at more specific regional level with higher accuracy such as a county level io tables can explore optimal solutions of resource competitions between natural and economic development and further clarifying characteristics of regional differences to advance the input output analysis deng et al 2014a made efforts the first time to compile io table at county level in the heihe river basin of china which not only advances our io table database but also engines further regional economic analysis they succeed in compiling water resource extended io table at county level which also consists of water consumption meanwhile deng et al 2014b has provided detailed principles which is of great significance for repeatable practices in other similar regions additionally deng et al 2010a also developed a 1 km area percentage data model 1 km apdm which can be used to monitor water resources examine the flow of water resources and to identify the spatiotemporal characteristics of land conversions between water body and other land uses covers and internal conversions between water body types the 1 km apdm is a feasible and important tool to trace the spatiotemporal patterns of the water body conversions at a finer resolution implementing iwrm means dealing with highly complex and uncertain decision making contexts lerner et al 2011 scenario analysis is good at dealing with uncertainties through highlighting central elements of a possible future the un provided the most quoted definition un 1992 a process to promote the coordinated development and management of water land and related resources in order to maximize the resultant economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems therefore iwrm can be enhanced through water resource modeling and land use planning with the exploration on the interconnections between lucc and regional ecosystem services the solutions for improving water resources management level are no longer limited to one or two elements and the research on the interaction mechanism of lucc and ecosystem services could offer another accessible path for iwrm with the uncertainty of implementation effect of management actions and policies the costs and benefits should be forecasted using proper models which could help prioritizing actions that provide win win results for both human wellbeing and ecosystem status 4 strengthening watershed management capacity poor management of natural resources is the main contributor to the environment pollution low resources use efficiency and productivity natural resources management is one of the key panaceas for coordinating social economic development and eco environmental construction in catchments 4 1 establishing a decision support system for integrated water resources management due to the complex relationship among the management elements decisions about one element may affect the situation of other elements and iwrm presents difficult challenges to planners and decision makers holzkämper et al 2012 therefore to establish integrated basin management systems is one of the primary directions in water resource management however most of the current systems are a single element management system and don t reflect the mutual influence between the elements even the existing management system of these single elements also has shortcomings taking the principles of water resource cycling as an example parallel eco hydrological and socioeconomic water cycling models have limited comprehensive understanding of water circulation and water use because there are interactive feedbacks between eco hydrological and socioeconomic water cycling processes models and the relations between them are not one way direct impacts or responses however the principles eco hydrological and socioeconomic water cycling simultaneously don t be taken into consideration in the design of management system therefore the management system should not only combine natural processes and social learning but also integrate the interaction of all elements in the process of designing iwrm 4 2 fostering the scientific research in the connection of the water sector to other sectors iwrm should foster the connection of the water sector to other sectors and support the overall development process ribbe et al 2017 water is an important factor of production contributing both directly and indirectly to economic activity across all sectors and regions as a primary input to all goods and services the available quantity and quality of water can affect the production of goods and services and thus influence economic activity therefore researchers and policy makers are exploring ways to coordinate economic production and water use rosegrant et al 2000 sivapalan et al 2012 hack 2015 an input output i o table embedded with the water or land natural resources account is frequently used to evaluate the economic value of resources in various sectors at both national and regional scales guan and hubacek 2008 deng et al 2014a b dalin et al 2015 although the extended i o models that incorporate water accounts can help analyze virtual water flows among different production sectors in an economy they are not appropriate for modeling the whole economic system i o models do not take into account the transactions and transfers of income between different types of economic agents such as households enterprises governments and external institutional sectors in the economic system holland and wyeth 1993 pyatt 1999 a social accounting matrix sam is an extended i o table that adds factors for production and institutional sectors households firms and government stone 1978 it includes interindustry links between transactions normally found in i o accounts and income transactions and transfers between different types of economic entities such as households governments businesses and external institutions pyatt and thorbecke 1976 adding the water or land natural resources accounting to the traditional sam model would form the corresponding resources embedded social accounting matrix which is an innovative way to form a comprehensive framework for understanding the relationship between natural resources or other elements and socioeconomic development it could be widely used in water resources management 1 to evaluate how natural resources is reallocated within the economy in response to changes in final demand and changes in the technical natural resources requirements of economic activities and consumers llop 2013 2 to investigate the impact of policy for example land reform policies throughout the catchment economy juana 2006 3 to help clarify how natural resources flows among different sectors therefore sam is an important tool for exploring the distribution mechanism of natural resources in the national economic system when external shocks occur such as investment changes and industrial transformation cazcarro et al 2010 4 3 overall management of natural resources allocation in water resources how to allocate the natural resources especially water resources reasonably is one of the key aspects to develop in a sustainable way in the upper middle and lower catchment conflicts often arise in the when water users in upper middle and lower basin compete for a limited water supply first the government should balance the equality of water supply the equality of water supply not only includes water allocation in upper middle and lower basins but also between the natural ecosystems and socioeconomic system although the agricultural output value per unit water may be much lower than the industry output value water supply for agricultural needs to be guarantee on the basis of ensuring water demand in various industries measures of improving efficiency must be adopted in different sectors government can improve the agriculture water use efficiency through the adjustment of planting structure extending water saving irrigation techniques and cultivation techniques improve the industrial water use efficiency by developing recycled water technology and increasing repetitive use rate of industrial water third keep the sustainability of water resources water resources need be utilized economically both now and in the future such that the environment is not harmed wang et al 2008 in other words on the premise of ensuring ecological water use the surplus water can be reasonably allocated for domestic water and industrial production water 4 4 accounting trans basin water resources flow trans basin water resources flow included the virtual water trade flow embodied in the traded products in addition to the physical water flow virtual water was defined by allan 1997 as the water embedded in internationally traded goods based on economic theory the multi regional input output mrio model is a useful tool for capturing the economic relationships among different regions and sectors and is based on the input output io table method formulated by leontief table 1 the mrio model has the ability to trace the spatial transfers of ecological and environmental damage it has been widely used to investigate virtual water footprints dalin et al 2015 white et al 2015 mubako et al 2013 based on multi regional input output data at different level we can account the trans basin virtual water resources flow at county prefecture or province level through accounting the virtual water flow we can get the total water consumption amount and know about the water flows direction between different regions thus provide basic information for establishing virtual water compensation mechanism 5 conclusions many factors account for the difficulty in achieving effective integrated resource management it mainly includes that the relationships among management elements are complexed and uncertain natural resources flow embedded in the trade are difficult due to lacked data on regional trade integrated water resources model is not reasonable without considering interactive feedbacks about ecosystems and socio economic systems effectiveness of decisions and policies about iwrm is uncertain therefore this paper addresses some of these concerns summarize the research frontier about iwrm and put forwards some measures mainly include taking the interaction relationships among water land and other factors into consideration determining the appropriate rates of increase in the labor force as well as in the availability of water or land resources will help china to use and protect resources efficiently evaluating the effectiveness and impacts on different systems of decisions and policies based on appropriate methods the key to mitigate water stress is improving water use efficiency whereas the efficiency benefits will be highly compensated by the increased water demand caused by developed economy and strengthening watershed management capacity such as establishing a decision support system strengthening the scientific research in the relationship between water sector and other sectors accounting trans basin water resources flow besides these participation of different stakeholders is one of key points to promote the success of iwrm iwrm is a continuous process that involves decision making and scientific study with the aim of achieving particular goals in the future in order to achieve sustainable water utilization water agreements laws institutions organizations and scientific projects all need to be improved and modified to meet different needs furthermore it is necessary to develop strong communication channels between organizations and local communities to provide social initiative and guarantee to help implementation of iwrm additionally river basin management institutions and scientific river basin study should closely work together for integrated river basin management and development acknowledgments this research was supported by

it mainly includes that the relationships among management elements are complexed and uncertain natural resources flow embedded in the trade are difficult due to lacked data on regional trade integrated water resources model is not reasonable without considering interactive feedbacks about ecosystems and socio economic systems effectiveness of decisions and policies about iwrm is uncertain therefore this paper addresses some of these concerns summarize the research frontier about iwrm and put forwards some measures mainly include taking the interaction relationships among water land and other factors into consideration determining the appropriate rates of increase in the labor force as well as in the availability of water or land resources will help china to use and protect resources efficiently evaluating the effectiveness and impacts on different systems of decisions and policies based on appropriate methods the key to mitigate water stress is improving water use efficiency whereas the efficiency benefits will be highly compensated by the increased water demand caused by developed economy and strengthening watershed management capacity such as establishing a decision support system strengthening the scientific research in the relationship between water sector and other sectors accounting trans basin water resources flow besides these participation of different stakeholders is one of key points to promote the success of iwrm iwrm is a continuous process that involves decision making and scientific study with the aim of achieving particular goals in the future in order to achieve sustainable water utilization water agreements laws institutions organizations and scientific projects all need to be improved and modified to meet different needs furthermore it is necessary to develop strong communication channels between organizations and local communities to provide social initiative and guarantee to help implementation of iwrm additionally river basin management institutions and scientific river basin study should closely work together for integrated river basin management and development acknowledgments this research was supported by

20086,in response to water insecurity and its associated socio environmental consequences households develop and use diverse coping strategies including water storage water reuse rainwater harvesting water treatment water sharing and borrowing from social networks illegal connections to public networks buying water from private vendors consumption of beverages in place of water and fetching water from distant sources to meet their daily water needs however some of these strategies are associated with adverse health impacts on households this review aims to examine the health implications of water insecurity coping strategies the results indicate that coping strategies such as prolonged water storage is associated with diarrheal diseases and non communicable diseases diabetes is more prevalent in households that use sugary beverages as a coping strategy in addition water sharing and borrowing from social networks exacerbate water related psychosocial stress including anxiety worry and anger finally fetching water from long distances is associated with muscle skeletal pains and injuries future studies are needed to understand water insecurity coping mechanisms biomedical and psychosocial consequences these would help practitioners develop programs and policies that could be implemented to improve coping mechanisms while limiting their biomedical and psychological effects keywords coping mechanisms health water insecurity biomedical impacts psychosocial impacts data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water security is the ability to access affordable adequate reliable and safe water for healthy life and wellbeing 19 thus households are considered water insecure when one or more of the above dimensions of water insecurity is compromised or unachievable consequently affecting health and wellbeing in the face of water insecurity individuals and households employ diverse coping strategies in response to their water needs for instance households faced with water insecurity are forced to walk long distances to access water others recycle or purify water from unsafe sources before use a meta ethnography authored by achore et al 1 2 identified water storage construction of alternative water sources water sharing and borrowing from social networks buying water from private vendors water management and reuse illegal connections to public water networks and water harvesting as some of the coping strategies adopted by households to deal with water insecurity issues the study also reported that water insecurity significantly affects poor households since they rely on labour intensive time consuming and short term coping measures similarly venkataramanan et al 47 also found that people cope with water insecurity by changing routines searching for alternative sources or moving entirely to new areas that guarantee water availability fetching water from these alternative sources often in most cases entails travelling long distances to access water points that are far from the households premises and waiting in queues for long periods previous research shows that water insecurity is associated with emotional distress 18 20 41 diarrhoea 49 and increased risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes 18 with women and children particularly the poor greatly affected about 700 children die daily from diarrhea related illnesses 7 this number is projected to increase by 2050 48 although it is well established that the water insecure households develop coping strategies to address their water needs 1 2 3 9 36 37 47 we know little about the health implications of these coping strategies on individuals and households therefore this review aims to examine the health impact of the coping strategies employed by households in the face of water insecurity by doing so practitioners can develop programs and policies that improve coping mechanisms while minimizing their negative health impacts 1 1 the coping strategies and health nexus in the event of water insecurity households develop coping strategies coping refers to the behavioural and cognitive efforts that individuals and households use to deal with the challenges and demands of their environment 55 these efforts can be proactive such as seeking out new water sources or constructing alternative water sources or reactive such as purifying water from unsafe sources or rationing water consumption 3 coping strategies can be classified based on the dimensions of water insecurity that they address such as access use quality and reliability 47 while coping strategies can effectively address water insecurity they may also negatively affect health and wellbeing 47 56 common coping strategies include water storage water reuse rainwater harvesting water treatment water sharing and borrowing from social networks illegal connections to public networks purchasing water from private vendors drinking beverages instead of water and fetching water from distant sources 1 2 47 coping strategies can provide a short term solution to households immediate challenges and help mitigate the negative impacts of water insecurity however it is important to recognize that these strategies are often a necessary response to water insecurity and may represent a trade off where the alternative may be worse thus it is crucial to recognize that these strategies may negatively impact health and wellbeing addressing the root causes of water insecurity is crucial in order to ensure that households have access to safe and reliable water sources health impacts in this review refers to the physical mental and social consequences of coping strategies on the wellbeing of individuals and households 41 53 these impacts can be both direct such as the transmission of waterborne diseases through the use of unsafe water sources 49 and indirect such as the impact of time and energy spent collecting water on other activities such as education and employment 3 it is important to consider the multidimensional nature of health impacts as they can have both short term and long term consequences 18 and can vary depending on the specific coping strategy and context in which it is used 36 by acknowledging the diverse range of health impacts associated with coping strategies we can better understand the trade offs and challenges faced by households and work towards more sustainable and effective solutions to water insecurity 2 methodology this scoping review was conducted using 58 framework which allows for assessing emerging evidence and identifying gaps in research scoping reviews are particularly useful for exploring topics that have not been thoroughly reviewed and clarifying concepts in the literature 57 58 by using a scoping review we aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the literature on the health impacts of coping strategies used by households to address water insecurity 2 1 literature search strategy using various search terms studies of possible interest were found in the databases embase medline science direct cinahl via ebscohost pubmed and global health see table 1 the author and a librarian came up with the search plan the only papers considered were peer reviewed ones that were also authored in english there were no time constraints and we included papers from all countries there were no methodological limitations which was crucial for identifying a variety of evidence pertaining to the subject of interest individual article titles and abstracts were reviewed after each database search to see if they were pertinent to the review s subject the review excluded reports and studies that had not undergone peer review see appendix 1 2 2 data management and extraction we implemented a thorough screening process to carefully select high quality and relevant studies for this review we first screened the titles and abstracts of all identified articles only those that explicitly examined the health implications of coping strategies used by households to address water insecurity were included in the full text review any discrepancies were resolved through consensus we then analyzed and synthesized the included studies highlighting the most prominent and relevant themes related to the relationship between coping strategies and household health in the context of water insecurity 3 results and discussion a total of 19 521 studies were identified through searches of multiple electronic databases including embase medline science direct cinahl via ebscohost pubmed and global health after removing 2301 duplicates and screening the remaining 17 223 studies 16 611 articles were removed abstracts of the remaining 612 studies were then screened resulting in the exclusion of 517 studies finally full texts of the remaining 41 studies were screened and 10 were subsequently excluded this left a final sample of 31 eligible peer reviewed articles that met the inclusion criteria for this review the screening process is summarized in the adapted preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses flow diagram fig 1 a summary of the charted data is presented in appendix a 3 1 coping strategies and their related health implications coping strategies identified include replacing water with sugar sweetened drinks buying and drinking water from alternative sources sharing or borrowing water and walking long distances to fetch water these coping strategies have been associated with some biomedical and psychosocial health implications see fig 2 3 2 consumption of sugar sweetened beverages ssbs it is well established that water insecurity and its resultant dehydration can influence the use of sugar sweetened beverages ssbs as a coping strategy 16 25 the consumption of ssbs as a coping strategy for water insecurity is a behaviour that occurs in specific socio economic contexts for example hanrahan et al 16 found that in the black tickle region of canada the cost and availability of ssbs like pepsi and coke has resulted in their high usage over bottled water similarly mosites et al 25 found that lack of water supply in rural alaska was associated with high ssb consumption this represents a classic situation where the trade off is worse some of the reviewed studies 25 16 highlighted how the use of ssbs as a coping strategy negatively affect the health of consumers for instance mosites et al 25 indicated that increased use of ssbs in place of water results in an increased risk of diabetes gastrointestinal infections and chronic diseases like obesity therefore it is important to examine the extent to which these health consequences are experienced by households that use ssbs as a coping strategy for water insecurity in addition the long term effects of using ssbs as a coping strategy should also be considered while consuming ssbs may provide short term hydration it is possible that it could also exacerbate long term health problems and create additional financial burdens for households examining the long term impacts of such coping strategies would provide a complete understanding of its effectiveness and potential drawbacks it is worth noting that the studies on this topic have some limitations for example hanrahan et al 16 only examined the choice of ssbs in one specific region of canada which may not be representative of other areas additionally mosites et al 25 did not control for other factors that may influence ssb consumption such as individual preferences or marketing efforts by beverage companies these limitations should be considered when interpreting the findings of these studies and when making recommendations based on them 3 3 water storage and consumption of contaminated water water storage is a coping strategy frequently employed by households experiencing water insecurity intermittent water supply often requires households to store water for future use 38 however research has shown that water storage can increase the risk of contamination 12 this contamination can occur at the water source during transportation 30 or during storage and is often due to the use of dirty containers and utensils 12 for example in their study gasana et al 12 found that 53 of stored water samples in rwanda had higher coliform levels than at the source indicating increased contamination during storage and transportation in addition 43 4 of household water was contaminated at storage due to dirty containers and utensils a survey conducted by nastiti et al 27 in urban bandung indonesia found that 99 of the 70 households surveyed used water storage as a coping mechanism still many of their storage containers were not properly maintained 24 nounkeu et al 30 also found that drinking water stored for six days or more in west cameroon was always contaminated the risk of contamination increases with the time that water is stored as pathogen contamination can occur through frequent extraction from dirty containers and utensils 27 24 30 the consumption of water from contaminated sources or storage tanks has been linked to a range of negative health outcomes including cholera diarrhea intestinal worms and typhoid 12 22 30 42 50 for example nounkeu et al 30 found that 79 of children from water insecure households experienced diarrhea episodes compared to 21 of children from water secure households additionally lee et al 22 reported that each extra 10 l of water stored in a home was associated with a 33 increase in the risk of diarrhea these studies highlight the high risk of water contamination and the potential for negative health consequences for households relying on water storage as a coping strategy for water insecurity 3 4 water sharing and borrowing water water sharing and borrowing are common coping strategies for households facing water insecurity issues particularly in resource constrained settings in low and middle income countries where communities are often communal 17 52 households may borrow water from their neighbours to pay it back in the future 1 2 8 44 however during public health outbreaks such as ebola and covid 19 public health measures often advise households to stay at home which can pose a problem for households without access to water as they may have to defy these measures to fulfill their daily water needs potentially exposing themselves to infectious diseases 63 28 the risks of contracting infectious diseases through water sharing and borrowing can be significant for example a study by stoler et al 43 found that 70 9 of households experienced water related issues that could undermine covid 19 control strategies or disease treatment furthermore water sharing often involves using common or shared sites 43 64 while borrowing water may involve contact with the borrower increasing the risk of infectious diseases 49 in addition to the risks of transmissible diseases borrowing water is associated with psychosocial and psycho emotional health impacts 4 5 6 understanding the underlying motivations for water sharing and borrowings such as the lack of access to reliable water sources or financial constraints can help inform interventions and policies to address the root causes of water insecurity 3 5 acquiring water from distant sources walking for long distances to acquire water is one of the common coping strategies employed by households battling with water insecurity 1 2 47 16 35 43 the physical demands of carrying water for long distances including the weight of the water filled containers and the often challenging terrain can lead to a range of health problems these include slips and falls neck and back pain and muscle skeletal injuries such as fractures 14 15 21 31 32 35 39 the prevalence of these health problems vary by context and gender for instance compared to their urban counterparts rural households walk long distances in search of safe drinking water 25 21 12 mostly because they do not have the financial resources to dig boreholes or buy water from private vendors acquiring water and its associated health impacts such as musculoskeletal diseases disproportionately affect women and children particularly the girl child 21 39 in many resource constrained contexts women and children are typically primarily responsible for fetching water for household needs some of the reviewed studies 47 39 21 reported higher rates of injury and other health problems among women and children who fetch water for example one of the studies 21 found that female heads of household or child caretakers carrying water on their heads reported the highest levels of head chest and neck pain similarly rosinger et al 35 found that 20 4 of households in lowland bolivia reported that someone in their family had been injured while collecting water with women being the most commonly injured additionally the time and energy spent fetching water can negatively impact health spending more time in search of water affects educational attainment and employment opportunities for the girl child and women respectively 8 44 time spent on this activity may result in girls missing school falling behind in their studies or even dropping out of school altogether this cooper vince et al 11 and wutich and ragsdale 53 argued can lead to reduced economic and employment opportunities in the future the physical strain of carrying heavy water containers for long distances can also lead to muscle skeletal injuries such as foot related injuries and accidents 13 21 for adults the time and energy spent on water collection can also have negative impacts on their health these negative health outcomes may be prolonged because of the lack of financial resources to access healthcare facilities 44 beyond this three of the studies 4 65 16 highlighted that the stress and anxiety associated with the uncertainty of water availability and the time and effort required to collect water can have negative impacts on mental health including anxiety and frustration embarrassment negative identity marginalization and poor self efficacy for instance primary water providers begin to worry about the distance they have to travel to acquire water 3 6 buying water from alternative sources acquiring water from alternative sources such as water vendors or tanker transport can significantly impact households health water from these sources is often contaminated potentially leading to gastrointestinal and infectious diseases 44 60 the lack of regulation in these water provision systems significantly contributes to health risks because regulators do not test water sources vendors do not pay attention to contaminants in point water sources increasing the chances of selling contaminated water to consumers 14 in addition accessing water from alternative sources can also have economic impacts on households buying water from vendors or tanker transport can be financially burdensome particularly for low income households 53 this can lead to households adopting other coping strategies such as skipping meals or consuming less nutritious food to afford water 16 furthermore obtaining water from alternative sources can also be physically demanding particularly for women and children 50 the time and energy spent on water collection can be detrimental to physical health leading to muscle skeletal injuries and fatigue 27 35 one of the key findings of the review literature on the health implications of this coping strategy on household finances the use of certain coping strategies such as buying water from alternative sources can pose a significant financial burden on households particularly those with limited financial resources and often can result in trade offs with other important household expenses such as food and healthcare 25 29 34 65 for instance in addition to the financial impacts buying water from private vendors or practicing poor hygiene may also have negative consequences on food security potentially affecting food availability access and utilization 29 3 7 psychosocial health implications of coping strategies water related emotional distress can be exacerbated during the process of coping with water insecurity 54 factors such as fear of running out of water frustration with water collection and management conflict within households and upset with others outside the household can all contribute to water related stress 54 the need to fetch water from alternative sources at night can also evoke emotional distress and increase the risk of violence particularly for women who may be targeted for assault or robbery 40 factors such as the cost of water distance to a water source presence of visitors marital status and size of the family may contribute to psychosocial distress related to water insecurity 46 according to stoler et al 44 marcantonio 23 and wutich et al 51 seven mechanisms contribute to water related stress worry about illness and health problems conflict within households and communities status loss or social failure loss of connection to meaningful places reduced autonomy or opportunities poverty deprivation and uncertainty and unjust or unfair treatment borrowing water from neighbours has been found to be particularly associated with psychosocial stress including feelings of shame and embarrassment 8 water insecure households particularly those headed by women have been found to have higher rates of stress anxiety and psychological distress compared to water secure households 30 stigmatization and feelings of worthlessness may also affect the emotional state of women unable to meet the water needs of their households 10 44 high levels of mental health symptoms including depression and anxiety have been reported in water insecure communities 8 households that feel unsafe collecting water have been found to experience more chronic stress than those who feel safe 66 safety concerns may arise when water sources or the surrounding area are uninhabited vegetated and have little activity which can be a particular concern for women and children who may be more vulnerable to violence and exploitation unchecked coping with water insecurity may also lead to depression 53 the fear of running out of water and being unable to access alternative sources in the future can negatively impact households 4 9 in their study in ethiopia thomas and godfrey 46 found that some households reported feeling a sense of hopelessness and helplessness related to their water insecurity the burden of water collection can also lead to fatigue and exhaustion which can affect cognitive functioning and decision making abilities 44 4 conclusion this paper explored the various coping strategies employed by households in the face of water insecurity we found that households devise various coping strategies to mitigate water insecurity such as buying water from vendors consuming sugar sweetened beverages drinking contaminated water sharing and borrowing water and carrying water for long distances in addition households may rely on social networks for support during water shortages however these coping strategies accompany many health outcomes such as malnutrition diabetes obesity gastrointestinal illnesses infectious diseases muscle skeletal injuries and anxiety and stress for instance households employ water storage as a coping strategy to mitigate intermittent water insecurity which is associated with an increased risk of contamination similarly carrying water for long distances as a coping strategy is associated with muscle skeletal injuries such as foot related injuries and accidents it is important to prioritize long term household water security solutions in policy agendas to address water insecurity and improve household health this may involve investing in infrastructure and governance to improve access to safe and reliable water sources and address social and systemic inequalities contributing to water insecurity the evidence of health impacts of coping mechanisms can support arguments that many households cannot sufficiently cope with water insecurity as individual entities based on the discussions in 67 and 68 it is clear that there are several opportunities for improving household water security and empowering households to address water insecurity these include adopting utility scale service models for safe water and clean cooking rather than relying on improved versions of household scale delivery models additionally addressing poverty threats and gender norms and providing infrastructure training and ongoing resourcing can help ensure water security measures effectiveness and sustainability despite challenges such as the financial burden of internet access on low income households and the inconsistency in risk reporting these opportunities offer a potential solution to improving household water security and addressing water insecurity to address these issues and minimize the biomedical and psychosocial impacts of water insecurity it is recommended that researchers and practitioners form more transdisciplinary partnerships and conduct further systematic studies on the links between water insecurity coping strategies and mental health outcomes additionally comprehensive studies on water driven migration as a coping strategy are needed to inform institutional and policy reforms and strengthen efforts to minimize water insecurity migration and its related health implications 4 1 recommendations for future studies the review studies were mostly cross sectional studies in nature to establish causation understand and address the health risks faced by water insecure households future studies can conduct randomized control trials to examine the health implications of coping strategies employed by households this will provide robust evidence on the specific health implications of the coping strategies outlined in addition further research should be conducted to compare urban and rural communities this will help us fully understand the complex issues in these areas and devise targeted interventions in doing so these studies should engage with institutional political and economic processes as they will be critical in understanding the disparities that shape access to water infrastructure and the health risks declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a 
20086,in response to water insecurity and its associated socio environmental consequences households develop and use diverse coping strategies including water storage water reuse rainwater harvesting

fractures 14 15 21 31 32 35 39 the prevalence of these health problems vary by context and gender for instance compared to their urban counterparts rural households walk long distances in search of safe drinking water 25 21 12 mostly because they do not have the financial resources to dig boreholes or buy water from private vendors acquiring water and its associated health impacts such as musculoskeletal diseases disproportionately affect women and children particularly the girl child 21 39 in many resource constrained contexts women and children are typically primarily responsible for fetching water for household needs some of the reviewed studies 47 39 21 reported higher rates of injury and other health problems among women and children who fetch water for example one of the studies 21 found that female heads of household or child caretakers carrying water on their heads reported the highest levels of head chest and neck pain similarly rosinger et al 35 found that 20 4 of households in lowland bolivia reported that someone in their family had been injured while collecting water with women being the most commonly injured additionally the time and energy spent fetching water can negatively impact health spending more time in search of water affects educational attainment and employment opportunities for the girl child and women respectively 8 44 time spent on this activity may result in girls missing school falling behind in their studies or even dropping out of school altogether this cooper vince et al 11 and wutich and ragsdale 53 argued can lead to reduced economic and employment opportunities in the future the physical strain of carrying heavy water containers for long distances can also lead to muscle skeletal injuries such as foot related injuries and accidents 13 21 for adults the time and energy spent on water collection can also have negative impacts on their health these negative health outcomes may be prolonged because of the lack of financial resources to access healthcare facilities 44 beyond this three of the studies 4 65 16 highlighted that the stress and anxiety associated with the uncertainty of water availability and the time and effort required to collect water can have negative impacts on mental health including anxiety and frustration embarrassment negative identity marginalization and poor self efficacy for instance primary water providers begin to worry about the distance they have to travel to acquire water 3 6 buying water from alternative sources acquiring water from alternative sources such as water vendors or tanker transport can significantly impact households health water from these sources is often contaminated potentially leading to gastrointestinal and infectious diseases 44 60 the lack of regulation in these water provision systems significantly contributes to health risks because regulators do not test water sources vendors do not pay attention to contaminants in point water sources increasing the chances of selling contaminated water to consumers 14 in addition accessing water from alternative sources can also have economic impacts on households buying water from vendors or tanker transport can be financially burdensome particularly for low income households 53 this can lead to households adopting other coping strategies such as skipping meals or consuming less nutritious food to afford water 16 furthermore obtaining water from alternative sources can also be physically demanding particularly for women and children 50 the time and energy spent on water collection can be detrimental to physical health leading to muscle skeletal injuries and fatigue 27 35 one of the key findings of the review literature on the health implications of this coping strategy on household finances the use of certain coping strategies such as buying water from alternative sources can pose a significant financial burden on households particularly those with limited financial resources and often can result in trade offs with other important household expenses such as food and healthcare 25 29 34 65 for instance in addition to the financial impacts buying water from private vendors or practicing poor hygiene may also have negative consequences on food security potentially affecting food availability access and utilization 29 3 7 psychosocial health implications of coping strategies water related emotional distress can be exacerbated during the process of coping with water insecurity 54 factors such as fear of running out of water frustration with water collection and management conflict within households and upset with others outside the household can all contribute to water related stress 54 the need to fetch water from alternative sources at night can also evoke emotional distress and increase the risk of violence particularly for women who may be targeted for assault or robbery 40 factors such as the cost of water distance to a water source presence of visitors marital status and size of the family may contribute to psychosocial distress related to water insecurity 46 according to stoler et al 44 marcantonio 23 and wutich et al 51 seven mechanisms contribute to water related stress worry about illness and health problems conflict within households and communities status loss or social failure loss of connection to meaningful places reduced autonomy or opportunities poverty deprivation and uncertainty and unjust or unfair treatment borrowing water from neighbours has been found to be particularly associated with psychosocial stress including feelings of shame and embarrassment 8 water insecure households particularly those headed by women have been found to have higher rates of stress anxiety and psychological distress compared to water secure households 30 stigmatization and feelings of worthlessness may also affect the emotional state of women unable to meet the water needs of their households 10 44 high levels of mental health symptoms including depression and anxiety have been reported in water insecure communities 8 households that feel unsafe collecting water have been found to experience more chronic stress than those who feel safe 66 safety concerns may arise when water sources or the surrounding area are uninhabited vegetated and have little activity which can be a particular concern for women and children who may be more vulnerable to violence and exploitation unchecked coping with water insecurity may also lead to depression 53 the fear of running out of water and being unable to access alternative sources in the future can negatively impact households 4 9 in their study in ethiopia thomas and godfrey 46 found that some households reported feeling a sense of hopelessness and helplessness related to their water insecurity the burden of water collection can also lead to fatigue and exhaustion which can affect cognitive functioning and decision making abilities 44 4 conclusion this paper explored the various coping strategies employed by households in the face of water insecurity we found that households devise various coping strategies to mitigate water insecurity such as buying water from vendors consuming sugar sweetened beverages drinking contaminated water sharing and borrowing water and carrying water for long distances in addition households may rely on social networks for support during water shortages however these coping strategies accompany many health outcomes such as malnutrition diabetes obesity gastrointestinal illnesses infectious diseases muscle skeletal injuries and anxiety and stress for instance households employ water storage as a coping strategy to mitigate intermittent water insecurity which is associated with an increased risk of contamination similarly carrying water for long distances as a coping strategy is associated with muscle skeletal injuries such as foot related injuries and accidents it is important to prioritize long term household water security solutions in policy agendas to address water insecurity and improve household health this may involve investing in infrastructure and governance to improve access to safe and reliable water sources and address social and systemic inequalities contributing to water insecurity the evidence of health impacts of coping mechanisms can support arguments that many households cannot sufficiently cope with water insecurity as individual entities based on the discussions in 67 and 68 it is clear that there are several opportunities for improving household water security and empowering households to address water insecurity these include adopting utility scale service models for safe water and clean cooking rather than relying on improved versions of household scale delivery models additionally addressing poverty threats and gender norms and providing infrastructure training and ongoing resourcing can help ensure water security measures effectiveness and sustainability despite challenges such as the financial burden of internet access on low income households and the inconsistency in risk reporting these opportunities offer a potential solution to improving household water security and addressing water insecurity to address these issues and minimize the biomedical and psychosocial impacts of water insecurity it is recommended that researchers and practitioners form more transdisciplinary partnerships and conduct further systematic studies on the links between water insecurity coping strategies and mental health outcomes additionally comprehensive studies on water driven migration as a coping strategy are needed to inform institutional and policy reforms and strengthen efforts to minimize water insecurity migration and its related health implications 4 1 recommendations for future studies the review studies were mostly cross sectional studies in nature to establish causation understand and address the health risks faced by water insecure households future studies can conduct randomized control trials to examine the health implications of coping strategies employed by households this will provide robust evidence on the specific health implications of the coping strategies outlined in addition further research should be conducted to compare urban and rural communities this will help us fully understand the complex issues in these areas and devise targeted interventions in doing so these studies should engage with institutional political and economic processes as they will be critical in understanding the disparities that shape access to water infrastructure and the health risks declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a 
20087,compound weather and climate events have obtained increasing attention in recent years in the context of anthropogenic climate change compound pluvial fluvial flooding cpff usually referring to the superposition of heavy local rainfall in urban areas and riverbank overflow is however rarely investigated we perform a systematic literature review on this emerging topic and identify knowledge gaps major knowledge gaps concern the dependence between pluvial and fluvial flooding and thus the co occurrence probability and its past and possible future changes although it is expected that cpff increases in a warming world we could not identify a single attempt to understand temporal changes more systematic and comprehensive data collection and process documentation particularly for pluvial and flash floods are required to better understand and assess cpff another major gap is the limitation of cpff studies to hazard assessments implementing damage models would allow with modest effort to transfer hazard statements into risk statements this would allow in turn to understand the scale of the problem in terms of societal relevance keywords compound events compound pluvial and fluvial flooding hazard and risk assessment literature review data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction compound weather and climate events are combinations of multiple drivers and or hazards that contribute to societal or environmental risk 68 such events have found increasing attention in recent years owing to several reasons firstly anthropogenic climate change has already shifted and will continue to shift the distributions of virtually all climate variables 23 and some of their dependencies 69 it is thus expected that the likelihood of compound events will change over decadal to multi decadal timescales secondly present precaution and protection measures are typically designed and operated based on univariate approaches using historical data these measures could be overwhelmed in coping with the effects from compound events 9 63 finally recent progress in process simulation computing power availability of high resolution data and in statistical and data mining methods allow to better understand compound events and their impacts 71 an important sub class of compound weather and climate events is compound flooding when the flood impact is caused by more than one variable or hazard an example is the 2002 flood in the city of dresden germany table 1 which was hit by four consecutive floods of different type owing to the same large scale atmospheric situation firstly intensive rainfall led to pluvial flooding as the sewage system was overwhelmed followed on the next day by flash floods of the smaller rivers lockwitzbach and weißeritz with a delay of a few days the river elbe inundated areas of the city and finally high groundwater levels lasting for several months brought further damage 58 another example is hurricane harvey in texas in 2017 where pluvial river and coastal flooding co occurred 52 the latter type that is compound fluvial and coastal flooding is comparatively well investigated 14 16 22 29 39 52 65 66 in contrast the superposition of pluvial and fluvial flooding i e compound pluvial fluvial flooding cpff fig 1 has been little explored 47 pluvial flooding is understood as flooding from rainfall generated overland flow and ponding before the runoff enters any watercourse drainage or sewer system or because it cannot enter it as the system is full 10 49 it is bound to high intensity rainfall and characterized by small space time scales with event footprints in the order of some hundred square meters to a few square kilometers and event durations in the order of a few minutes to a few hours 36 fluvial flooding that is inundation from excessive water levels of water courses can be separated based on the spatial temporal scales into river flooding and flash flooding fluvial river flooding occurs at spatial scales from several hundreds to thousands of square kilometers and temporal scales from 1 day to several weeks while flash floods are characterized by smaller spatial extent and concentration times in the order of minutes up to a few hours with high flow velocities river flooding is mainly caused by excessive rainfall and in some regions also by snowmelt and is typically modulated by the antecedent catchment state 37 38 flash floods are generally induced by high intensity short duration rainstorms and rapid catchment response 37 10 38 cpff can be caused by the same rainfall event as in the case of the 2015 flood in cockermouth uk table 1 which was triggered by an extratropical cyclone induced torrential rain storm however cpff can also be caused by unrelated atmospheric events for instance a flood wave traveling through a river basin inundates an urban area while a local rainfall event generated by another weather system hits the same area such a situation has occurred for instance during the carlisle flood in 2005 and east belfast flood in 2007 table 1 the occurrence of cpff does not require the different flood types to exactly co occur in time it is sufficient that the different events occur within such a period that the consequences of the preceding event are aggravated by the succeeding events an example is the chongqing flood in 2020 table 1 where local heavy rainfall was followed by record breaking river peak discharges hence cpff events can emerge because the inundation of the first event is still ongoing while the second event occurs cpff is a particular concern for cities owing to dense population and assets 46 high fractions of impervious areas favoring overland flow and rapid flow concentration 17 the fact that many cities are located at riverbanks or even at river confluences further aggravates cpff risks 2 40 given the global migration to cities and the associated development of urban areas and infrastructure 46 and the observed and expected increase of extreme rainfall due to climate change in many regions around the world 34 43 67 the relevance of cpff is expected to increase flood hazard and risk assessments are often restricted to a single flood type e g 18 72 51 and studies considering the combination of pluvial and fluvial flooding are rare 2 54 this negligence may be an effect of their different space time scales and the different processes involved research on pluvial flooding typically investigates the interaction of the surface inundation and the sewer system 49 48 whereas studies on fluvial flooding rather focus on catchment and river system processes sometimes including the effects and failures of flood defense systems 36 given the expected relevance of cpff in an increasingly urbanized and warmer world we review the literature on assessing the hazards and risk from compound pluvial fluvial flooding identify research gaps and discuss ways to address these gaps of this emerging research area in our review we define hazard as the processes and their characteristics that lead to flooding whereas the term risk includes the impacts of flooding on people and assets 2 literature review on compound pluvial and fluvial flooding cpff we conducted a systematic literature review on the assessment of compound pluvial fluvial flooding by searching for the following topic related keywords fluvial flood keyword alternatives river flood river overflowing and pluvial flood alternatives surface overflowing surface water flood urban waterlogging and compound alternatives concurrent combined flood among titles abstracts and paper keywords in the databases web of science sciencedirect and scopus 13 papers were identified as relevant to cpff hazard modelling and risk assessment and listed in table 2 some papers mentioned in table 1 are not included in table 2 since they only describe cpff events but do not attempt to assess the hazard or risk of cpff our systematic literature search identified chen et al 9 as the first to quantify the consequences of cpff combining urban rainfall scenarios of different return periods with river flood scenarios since then researchers mainly investigated the combination of pluvial and fluvial flooding in small scale study areas ranging from below 1 km2 to about 100 km2 we identified only one large scale study namely the study by bates et al 4 addressing pluvial fluvial and coastal flood hazard in the entire conterminous us typically specific historical events are simulated 40 59 or a range of synthetic pluvial and fluvial scenarios for various return periods are designed and combined in a simulation framework 2 4 9 25 42 47 54 56 64 several studies conclude that the co occurrence of pluvial and fluvial floods aggravates flood hazard compared to the individual pluvial or fluvial scenarios 9 2 7 47 56 54 though its occurrence is comparatively rare inundation extent and depth are typically larger when the pluvial and fluvial floods co occur compared to their isolated occurrence 9 2 47 40 56 64 54 for instance the mean inundation depth and area increase by 19 9 and 43 2 respectively when combining the 100 year pluvial flood with the river flood scenario compared to fluvial flooding alone for the stockbridge area uk 9 depending on individual magnitudes and location characteristics either pluvial 2 40 or fluvial floods 25 can dominate cpff flood hazard the literature analysis reveals that the dependence structure of cpff is poorly understood and rarely considered usually the two processes are assumed to be either fully dependent namely river peak discharge coinciding with rainfall event of the same occurrence probability 25 54 or fully independent 9 56 64 in the latter case combinations of single flood types of different return periods are investigated for instance n m combinations of n pluvial scenarios with m fluvial scenarios only two studies 2 47 considered the two flood types as partially dependent both fixing the co occurrence probability of pluvial and fluvial flooding to 0 2 this probability was estimated from the typical length of the monsoon flooding season and the typical number and duration of fluvial and pluvial flooding events in terms of modelling techniques applied in cpff assessments the inundation process is simulated by 2d hydrodynamic models in nearly all reviewed studies rainfall runoff processes leading to fluvial flooding have been simulated by hydrological models driven by output from stochastic weather generators 42 7 54 25 alternatively fluvial flood peaks have been directly derived from flood frequency analysis 9 2 47 56 64 4 the effect of the sewerage system is neglected in some studies given the lack of data or arguing that the system is poorly maintained and thus quickly clogged 2 66 or that it is not expected to play a significant role 47 some studies have used 1d sewer system models 9 59 64 25 or a simplified approach subtracting the capacity of the sewer system from the rainfall 40 54 the interface between river channels and urban inundation areas when both pluvial and fluvial flooding occur should be carefully treated when coupling the fluvial and pluvial domain models 18 overall our literature search shows that one way coupling between rainfall runoff and hydrodynamic modelling is the preferred approach in assessing cpff with simulated or designed river channel discharge as the boundary conditions for inundation modelling all identified cpff studies focus on flood hazard that is we could not identify a single attempt to quantify the associated damages as specific damage models considering the effects of fluvial e g 51 and pluvial inundation e g 50 have been developed transferring cpff hazard statements into risk statements seems to be a worthwhile goal to be reached with modest effort 3 knowledge gaps in assessing cpff hazard and risk 3 1 understanding cpff occurrence probabilities and intensities and their past and future changes we argue that an important knowledge gap is the understanding and quantification of the occurrence probability of cpff which hinges on the dependence between the fluvial and pluvial flood types 69 depending on the catchment size triggering rainfall and runoff dynamics pluvial and fluvial flooding might be considered as independent when the triggering rainfall events are distinct an example is a large scale monsoon driven river flood superimposed by local torrential rain 2 with decreasing catchment size the dependence of pluvial and fluvial floods is expected to increase in small catchments one can expect the occurrence of cpff events triggered by the same rainfall event with only a short time delay between both flood types making them virtually indistinguishable the relevant question to be answered is then if the different inundation types temporarily coincide only partially coincide or not at all the lack of observational records of cpff as pluvial flooding is often not systematically documented and the rarity of cpff events hamper the estimation of the co occurrence frequencies the dependence between pluvial and fluvial flood processes is thus largely unknown quantifying the dependence and modelling the co occurrence based on observations which is a frequent approach for other compound events for instance compound hot and dry events 19 and compound coastal flooding 12 is hardly possible many modelling studies rely on simple assumptions of co occurrence probabilities in form of scenarios 2 9 42 56 systematic and comprehensive data collection on cpff events is a prerequisite for quantifying co occurrence probabilities and for designing scenarios and selecting modelling tools for cpff hazard and risk assessment hence multi site and multi variable observations of meteorological hydrological and hydraulic processes and impacts of cpff events should be enforced and events should be systematically documented a good example is the database of kaiser et al 26 with a comprehensive documentation of flash and pluvial floods in germany this database accommodates a wealth of information on 23800 flood events including for instance event and catchment characteristics information on available measurements and geodata and insurance claims nevertheless cpff events might remain rare or even singular realizations within the range of climate variability to address the estimation of co occurrence probabilities and associated intensities approaches of synthetic event realizations within the range of assumed climate variability as for instance possible with stochastic weather generators and hydrological models 7 should be assessed alternatively climate and hydrological re analysis can be used to quantify the co occurrence of pluvial and fluvial floods at poorly monitored sites however this approach depends on the ability of the re analysis to plausibly represent the processes that led to cpff which is a particular challenge for pluvial flooding given the rarity of cpff and the lack of systematic data collection it is very challenging to analyze past changes cpff based on observational records for instance repeated occurrences of cpff at the same location have not been documented in the reviewed literature we could not identify studies that assess past trends in cpff events either using observations or reanalysis products nor studies that assess possible future changes in cpff probabilities and intensities the question how cpff have changed in the past and how it might change in the future is thus open for other types of compound event past and possible future changes have been studied for instance increasing past and or future trends have been reported for compound hot and dry events 20 compound riverine and coastal flood 13 14 and compound storm surge and rainfall coastal floods 61 these changes are explained by changes in the single hazards and in the dependence structure 53 due to observed 5 31 32 and expected future increases 11 43 44 in short duration rainfall intensities in a warmer climate following the super clausius clapeyron scaling 30 the probability of pluvial floods is expected to have increased and will further increase in many regions around the world in areas with constant or increasing propensity of fluvial flooding this may lead to increasing cpff occurrence probabilities moreover changes in the timing of the occurrence of fluvial and pluvial floods 6 may change the cpff occurrence probability these effects remain however unexplored to address the knowledge gap of past and future changes in cpff characteristics climate and hydrological re analysis and climate model projections can be employed however great care is required and it needs to be assessed whether these models are able to represent the occurrence and intensity of cpff and of their drivers an alternative to the traditional methodology of future projections i e select emission scenarios use ensembles of climate model simulations correct for biases downscale to the relevant scale and drive impact models e g hydrological and hydraulic models to simulate flooding are tales of future weather 21 and more generally the storyline approach 55 1 storylines aim at providing realistic events in present and future climate related to the vulnerabilities of the system of interest for instance hazeleger et al 21 demonstrated how high resolution numerical weather prediction models conditioned on the boundary conditions from coupled climate model simulations of future climate could provide realistic future scenarios of compound coastal flooding 3 2 understanding cpff processes and developing scenarios for cpff hazard and risk assessment cpff results from the co occurrence of different processes each described by various variables pluvial flood occurrence is mainly controlled by rainfall intensity and volume infiltration capacity and the capacity of the drainage network the variables controlling fluvial flooding include rainfall and snowmelt characteristics antecedent catchment state catchment response floodwave propagation in the stream network and potentially flood protection failure thieken et al 58 argue that pluvial and fluvial flooding are associated with different pathways that is the floodwater takes different routes to reach and damage elements at risk such people or buildings these different pathways and the different possibilities to warn people to undertake precautionary or emergency measures and to implement flood protection affect the hazard e g inundation depths velocities and risk e g damage affected population hence the relevant processes and their interactions leading to cpff and its impact need to be identified and translated into adequate scenarios to quantify cpff hazard and risk leonard et al 33 proposes a framework based on influence diagrams for analyzing compound events although not targeting specifically at cpff this framework starts from the possible impacts thus termed a bottom up approach and identifies processes and their combinations leading to them an influence diagram is a graphical and statistical tool which formalizes the process of identifying the variables on which the impact variables depend as well as the structure of the statistical dependence between variables 3 8 33 it thus supports the development of an adequate model structure to quantify risk there are other approaches aiming at identifying an adequate set of scenarios for risk assessments such as what if analysis storylines explorative modeling backward inference or failure mode and effects analysis 35 such methods can be used to develop cpff scenarios by identifying key parameters and processes exploring cpff pathways and by investigating the sensitivity of cpff hazard and risk to changes in the drivers an example for the exploration of cpff pathways is an analysis to what extent the lagged occurrence of pluvial and fluvial flooding may block major evacuation pathways and affect disaster management if the processes and their interactions can be sufficiently well described a formal probabilistic approach seems appropriate for instance a stochastic weather generator can be coupled to hydrological hydrodynamic and damage models a weather generator provides long times series e g several thousand years of continuous and spatially coherent precipitation and possibly other climate variables 7 41 depending on the scale either daily or sub daily models can be applied when sub daily stochastic models cannot be well parameterized due to the lack of high resolution climate data less demanding temporal disaggregation procedures should be considered 45 7 these time series of synthetic weather are then propagated through the model chain and the results are analyzed to estimate cpff probabilities intensities pathways and finally risk as this approach may be computationally expensive a reduced set of scenarios for example associated with certain return periods may be more feasible in cases where compound events do not have a precedent but a potential to occur the storyline approach may be particularly useful 70 both approaches that is fully probabilistic approaches and single scenarios such as storylines or a set of scenarios associated with certain return periods rely on various domain models covering atmospheric rainfall runoff river network floodplain and urban inundation drainage network and damage processes as indicated by the literature review these domain models can be realized in very different degrees of sophistication or can even be omitted for instance the consideration of the drainage network ranges from detailed modelling of pipeline networks and manholes to capacity abstraction approaches 15 48 4 conclusions our systematic literature review on the assessment of cpff reveals that little work has been done to understand and quantify cpff the dependence structure of these compound events is a major knowledge gap pluvial and fluvial flooding are often assumed to be either fully dependent or fully independent although it is widely expected that cpff will gain importance in a warmer climate past and future variations of cpff have not been explored the reviewed literature suggests that cpff is more severe than pluvial or fluvial floods of the same magnitude happening individually however the data base is small and does not allow to quantify the scale of this increase in severity on data alone re analysis data and or stochastic weather generators could be used to fill the data gap however the climate or synthetic data must be evaluated properly to ensure that the spatial and temporal resolution are sufficient for the hazard or study case to be analyzed we argue that more systematic and comprehensive data collection and process documentation particularly for pluvial and small scale flash floods are required to better understand and assess cpff all identified studies focus on cpff hazard a modest effort by implementing damage models would allow to go from hazard statements to

pluvial and fluvial floods aggravates flood hazard compared to the individual pluvial or fluvial scenarios 9 2 7 47 56 54 though its occurrence is comparatively rare inundation extent and depth are typically larger when the pluvial and fluvial floods co occur compared to their isolated occurrence 9 2 47 40 56 64 54 for instance the mean inundation depth and area increase by 19 9 and 43 2 respectively when combining the 100 year pluvial flood with the river flood scenario compared to fluvial flooding alone for the stockbridge area uk 9 depending on individual magnitudes and location characteristics either pluvial 2 40 or fluvial floods 25 can dominate cpff flood hazard the literature analysis reveals that the dependence structure of cpff is poorly understood and rarely considered usually the two processes are assumed to be either fully dependent namely river peak discharge coinciding with rainfall event of the same occurrence probability 25 54 or fully independent 9 56 64 in the latter case combinations of single flood types of different return periods are investigated for instance n m combinations of n pluvial scenarios with m fluvial scenarios only two studies 2 47 considered the two flood types as partially dependent both fixing the co occurrence probability of pluvial and fluvial flooding to 0 2 this probability was estimated from the typical length of the monsoon flooding season and the typical number and duration of fluvial and pluvial flooding events in terms of modelling techniques applied in cpff assessments the inundation process is simulated by 2d hydrodynamic models in nearly all reviewed studies rainfall runoff processes leading to fluvial flooding have been simulated by hydrological models driven by output from stochastic weather generators 42 7 54 25 alternatively fluvial flood peaks have been directly derived from flood frequency analysis 9 2 47 56 64 4 the effect of the sewerage system is neglected in some studies given the lack of data or arguing that the system is poorly maintained and thus quickly clogged 2 66 or that it is not expected to play a significant role 47 some studies have used 1d sewer system models 9 59 64 25 or a simplified approach subtracting the capacity of the sewer system from the rainfall 40 54 the interface between river channels and urban inundation areas when both pluvial and fluvial flooding occur should be carefully treated when coupling the fluvial and pluvial domain models 18 overall our literature search shows that one way coupling between rainfall runoff and hydrodynamic modelling is the preferred approach in assessing cpff with simulated or designed river channel discharge as the boundary conditions for inundation modelling all identified cpff studies focus on flood hazard that is we could not identify a single attempt to quantify the associated damages as specific damage models considering the effects of fluvial e g 51 and pluvial inundation e g 50 have been developed transferring cpff hazard statements into risk statements seems to be a worthwhile goal to be reached with modest effort 3 knowledge gaps in assessing cpff hazard and risk 3 1 understanding cpff occurrence probabilities and intensities and their past and future changes we argue that an important knowledge gap is the understanding and quantification of the occurrence probability of cpff which hinges on the dependence between the fluvial and pluvial flood types 69 depending on the catchment size triggering rainfall and runoff dynamics pluvial and fluvial flooding might be considered as independent when the triggering rainfall events are distinct an example is a large scale monsoon driven river flood superimposed by local torrential rain 2 with decreasing catchment size the dependence of pluvial and fluvial floods is expected to increase in small catchments one can expect the occurrence of cpff events triggered by the same rainfall event with only a short time delay between both flood types making them virtually indistinguishable the relevant question to be answered is then if the different inundation types temporarily coincide only partially coincide or not at all the lack of observational records of cpff as pluvial flooding is often not systematically documented and the rarity of cpff events hamper the estimation of the co occurrence frequencies the dependence between pluvial and fluvial flood processes is thus largely unknown quantifying the dependence and modelling the co occurrence based on observations which is a frequent approach for other compound events for instance compound hot and dry events 19 and compound coastal flooding 12 is hardly possible many modelling studies rely on simple assumptions of co occurrence probabilities in form of scenarios 2 9 42 56 systematic and comprehensive data collection on cpff events is a prerequisite for quantifying co occurrence probabilities and for designing scenarios and selecting modelling tools for cpff hazard and risk assessment hence multi site and multi variable observations of meteorological hydrological and hydraulic processes and impacts of cpff events should be enforced and events should be systematically documented a good example is the database of kaiser et al 26 with a comprehensive documentation of flash and pluvial floods in germany this database accommodates a wealth of information on 23800 flood events including for instance event and catchment characteristics information on available measurements and geodata and insurance claims nevertheless cpff events might remain rare or even singular realizations within the range of climate variability to address the estimation of co occurrence probabilities and associated intensities approaches of synthetic event realizations within the range of assumed climate variability as for instance possible with stochastic weather generators and hydrological models 7 should be assessed alternatively climate and hydrological re analysis can be used to quantify the co occurrence of pluvial and fluvial floods at poorly monitored sites however this approach depends on the ability of the re analysis to plausibly represent the processes that led to cpff which is a particular challenge for pluvial flooding given the rarity of cpff and the lack of systematic data collection it is very challenging to analyze past changes cpff based on observational records for instance repeated occurrences of cpff at the same location have not been documented in the reviewed literature we could not identify studies that assess past trends in cpff events either using observations or reanalysis products nor studies that assess possible future changes in cpff probabilities and intensities the question how cpff have changed in the past and how it might change in the future is thus open for other types of compound event past and possible future changes have been studied for instance increasing past and or future trends have been reported for compound hot and dry events 20 compound riverine and coastal flood 13 14 and compound storm surge and rainfall coastal floods 61 these changes are explained by changes in the single hazards and in the dependence structure 53 due to observed 5 31 32 and expected future increases 11 43 44 in short duration rainfall intensities in a warmer climate following the super clausius clapeyron scaling 30 the probability of pluvial floods is expected to have increased and will further increase in many regions around the world in areas with constant or increasing propensity of fluvial flooding this may lead to increasing cpff occurrence probabilities moreover changes in the timing of the occurrence of fluvial and pluvial floods 6 may change the cpff occurrence probability these effects remain however unexplored to address the knowledge gap of past and future changes in cpff characteristics climate and hydrological re analysis and climate model projections can be employed however great care is required and it needs to be assessed whether these models are able to represent the occurrence and intensity of cpff and of their drivers an alternative to the traditional methodology of future projections i e select emission scenarios use ensembles of climate model simulations correct for biases downscale to the relevant scale and drive impact models e g hydrological and hydraulic models to simulate flooding are tales of future weather 21 and more generally the storyline approach 55 1 storylines aim at providing realistic events in present and future climate related to the vulnerabilities of the system of interest for instance hazeleger et al 21 demonstrated how high resolution numerical weather prediction models conditioned on the boundary conditions from coupled climate model simulations of future climate could provide realistic future scenarios of compound coastal flooding 3 2 understanding cpff processes and developing scenarios for cpff hazard and risk assessment cpff results from the co occurrence of different processes each described by various variables pluvial flood occurrence is mainly controlled by rainfall intensity and volume infiltration capacity and the capacity of the drainage network the variables controlling fluvial flooding include rainfall and snowmelt characteristics antecedent catchment state catchment response floodwave propagation in the stream network and potentially flood protection failure thieken et al 58 argue that pluvial and fluvial flooding are associated with different pathways that is the floodwater takes different routes to reach and damage elements at risk such people or buildings these different pathways and the different possibilities to warn people to undertake precautionary or emergency measures and to implement flood protection affect the hazard e g inundation depths velocities and risk e g damage affected population hence the relevant processes and their interactions leading to cpff and its impact need to be identified and translated into adequate scenarios to quantify cpff hazard and risk leonard et al 33 proposes a framework based on influence diagrams for analyzing compound events although not targeting specifically at cpff this framework starts from the possible impacts thus termed a bottom up approach and identifies processes and their combinations leading to them an influence diagram is a graphical and statistical tool which formalizes the process of identifying the variables on which the impact variables depend as well as the structure of the statistical dependence between variables 3 8 33 it thus supports the development of an adequate model structure to quantify risk there are other approaches aiming at identifying an adequate set of scenarios for risk assessments such as what if analysis storylines explorative modeling backward inference or failure mode and effects analysis 35 such methods can be used to develop cpff scenarios by identifying key parameters and processes exploring cpff pathways and by investigating the sensitivity of cpff hazard and risk to changes in the drivers an example for the exploration of cpff pathways is an analysis to what extent the lagged occurrence of pluvial and fluvial flooding may block major evacuation pathways and affect disaster management if the processes and their interactions can be sufficiently well described a formal probabilistic approach seems appropriate for instance a stochastic weather generator can be coupled to hydrological hydrodynamic and damage models a weather generator provides long times series e g several thousand years of continuous and spatially coherent precipitation and possibly other climate variables 7 41 depending on the scale either daily or sub daily models can be applied when sub daily stochastic models cannot be well parameterized due to the lack of high resolution climate data less demanding temporal disaggregation procedures should be considered 45 7 these time series of synthetic weather are then propagated through the model chain and the results are analyzed to estimate cpff probabilities intensities pathways and finally risk as this approach may be computationally expensive a reduced set of scenarios for example associated with certain return periods may be more feasible in cases where compound events do not have a precedent but a potential to occur the storyline approach may be particularly useful 70 both approaches that is fully probabilistic approaches and single scenarios such as storylines or a set of scenarios associated with certain return periods rely on various domain models covering atmospheric rainfall runoff river network floodplain and urban inundation drainage network and damage processes as indicated by the literature review these domain models can be realized in very different degrees of sophistication or can even be omitted for instance the consideration of the drainage network ranges from detailed modelling of pipeline networks and manholes to capacity abstraction approaches 15 48 4 conclusions our systematic literature review on the assessment of cpff reveals that little work has been done to understand and quantify cpff the dependence structure of these compound events is a major knowledge gap pluvial and fluvial flooding are often assumed to be either fully dependent or fully independent although it is widely expected that cpff will gain importance in a warmer climate past and future variations of cpff have not been explored the reviewed literature suggests that cpff is more severe than pluvial or fluvial floods of the same magnitude happening individually however the data base is small and does not allow to quantify the scale of this increase in severity on data alone re analysis data and or stochastic weather generators could be used to fill the data gap however the climate or synthetic data must be evaluated properly to ensure that the spatial and temporal resolution are sufficient for the hazard or study case to be analyzed we argue that more systematic and comprehensive data collection and process documentation particularly for pluvial and small scale flash floods are required to better understand and assess cpff all identified studies focus on cpff hazard a modest effort by implementing damage models would allow to go from hazard statements to

20088,conventional flood frequency analysis ffa may underestimate flood quantiles and increase hydraulic infrastructure vulnerability in changing climates this study uses annual maximum streamflow data from 17 hydrologic stations along west flowing rivers in kerala india for non stationary ns ffa the generalized extreme value model with a linear temporal location parameter worked effectively for five stations kidangoor and pattazhy stations must account for non stationarity for longer return periods rps 50 years whereas neeleeswaram and perumannu stations must for shorter rps 50 years an extensive study was conducted for neeleswaram station periyar basin by simulating ns models incorporating four large scale climate oscillations as covariates the stationary assumption underestimated flood return levels of 2 year rp by about 61 which increases the flood risk leading to failure of hydraulic infrastructures it was observed that the best fitted climate based ns model achieves stationary return level of 150 years rp at 25 years rp itself the study proved that the climate based ns models captured the 2018 august floods in periyar basin better than stationary and time based models the regional variability in ff curve behaviour concludes that nsffa for kerala cannot be generalised and must be done at a local scale keywords flood frequency analysis infrastructure streamflow non stationary climate oscillations flood risk data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction anthropogenic activities are currently overriding natural climate variability causing irreversible climate change the human contribution to rise in global temperature has alarmingly amplified earth s natural greenhouse effect hotter air holds more water vapour causing heavier downpours floods and hydraulic infrastructure damage floods droughts heatwaves and other climate extremes are more likely to occur due to global warming frequency analysisof extremes is one of the most accepted statistical applications within hydrology flood frequency analysis ffa is commonly used to relate the frequency of extreme runoff or river flow occurrences to their intensity by employing probability distribution functions ff studies require long term peak discharge data which is scarce ffa plays a dynamic role in supplying flood return levels for different return periods which are utilised in the construction of storm water drainage systems culverts dams levees sewer bridges ff curves are needed to analyse flood return levels and determine the optimum hydraulic structural design parameters without over or under designing them flood return levels support flood insurance zoning procedures in addition to hydraulic design conventionally ffa assumes flood data is independent identically distributed and unbiased to anthropogenic changes in hydrological systems i e assumption of stationarity where distribution parameters are space time independent for easy computation as per 5th ipcc report extreme events are time varying due to anthropogenic activities and climate change 14 consequently stationary s ffa will not fulfil future hydroclimatic conditions leading to significant allegations 30 hence non stationary ns ffa dominates the hydrology communities by modifying the existing standards for effectively managing the hydraulic structures 19 in nsffa distribution parameters must be considered dynamic over time and may fluctuate with covariates such local temperature or climatic oscillations that can influence heavy rainfall and floods 16 making nsffa models more complex and difficult to handle 9 initially time was the only covariate in nsffa used to depict temporal trend 4 5 39 40 45 many researchers have developed ns models varying distribution parameters linearly and non linearly with multiple covariates to perform nsffa villarini et al 40 41 adopted time maximum daily rainfall and density of population as a covariate in generalized additive models for location shape and scale parameters for ffa ouarda and charron 29 performed nsffa with trends and climatic variation as covariates for generalized extreme value gev

goodness of fit gof india is among the worst flood hit countries in asia extreme flooding has resulted from catastrophic spatial and temporal fluctuation in the country s rainfall patterns with 80 of the annual total falling in just 3 to 4 months june to september roxy et al 34 found that extreme precipitation episodes in central india tripled from 1951 to 2015 the significant large scale flood

kerala floods 2018 42 india s diverse climate makes generalisations difficult for flood conditions to address the nation s diverse flood threats extreme flood events must be handled at both national and local levels wmo et al 43 correctly noted that there is no universal flood solutions that successful flood risk reduction measures are site specific although oceanic circulations indian summer monsoon precipitation have been widely established 10 17 21 22 31 33 35 little research has been done on how large scale oceanic atmospheric circulation may be related to floods in indian river basins 27 kerala s recent significant flooding and extensive rainfall in 2018 serve as a stark reminder of how severe the country s extreme flooding may be kerala is recognised for its abundant water resources which are supplied by 44 rivers according to india meteorological department imd 13 kerala has seen above average rainfall from the start of june 2018 with the deviations from normal being 15 in june 18 in july and 164 in august august 1 19 2018 the state was unprepared for this downpour forcing 35 dams to be opened by august 2018 to avoid dam failure the 2018 kerala floods one of the worst in almost a century caught the attention of the media scientists and politicians encouraging them to critically analyse this horrific catastrophe in various sectors the hydro climatological perspective of kerala floods 12 25 combined effect of extreme rainfall and reservoir storage 26 role of dams on the periyar floods 38 case study on kakki reservoir management 31 satellite based flood assessment 42 flood impact assessment by field investigation and post flood survey 21 social sensing of kerala 2018 flood impacts 46 are a few of the noteworthy contributions that have been made in relation to this rare extreme event only few studies have been carried out lingering around the ffa of kerala drissia et al 7 analysed daily and flood discharge of 43 gauging stations in kerala s west flowing rivers wfrs and constructed regional frequency curves incorporating watershed characteristics to estimate flood magnitude using l moments technique 8 to the best of our knowledge there have been no studies undertaken in kerala that utilise the idea of non stationarity to create ff curves that account for a warming planet the realisation that using traditional ff curves in the future will inevitably underestimate flood quantiles threatening the state s critical infrastructure prompted an immediate re evaluation of the state s hydraulic infrastructure design in light of climate induced nsffa of streamflows in kerala rivers in this study the annual maximum streamflow dataset of 17 stations of the wfrs of kerala over different districts were considered for ffa in a s as well as ns context as a first attempt of solving the issue this study looked at the simplest time dependent ns framework of location and scale distribution parameters and the effect of climatic variables for a crucial location in the periyar basin in relation to the great kerala floods of 2018 the goal of this exercise was to demonstrate how climate based ns models as opposed to stationary and time based models more accurately capture the complexity and dynamics of climate change specifically this research aims i to develop s and ns ff curves for the 17 river gauge stations of the west flowing rivers wfrs of kerala ii to look into how climate oscillations influence the simulation of ns flood frequency models at the neeleswaram outlet station in the periyar basin 2 study area the daily discharge data for 17 river gauge stations of wfrs of kerala india was collected from water resource information system wris https www indiawris gov in and the annual maximum discharge data of the stations were extracted the analysis only includes stations with record lengths over 25 years table 1 provides location details of 17 river gauge stations and data length used in this study fig 1 is a spatial

generalized logistic gev weibull generalized pareto generalized normal and pearson type iii distributions firstly l moments are calculated for the sample data and then the sample s location is represented as a point in the figure the candidate distribution which is relatively closer to the sample s location is considered to be the most appropriate distribution for the chosen data apart from visual interpretation two gof tests namely kolmogorov smirnov ks test anderson darling ad test was also conducted to identify the most suitable distribution at a significance level of 5 3 3 stationary

case study for dynamic ns modelling using climate oscillations as covariates it was one of the most widely affected area in the 2018 august floods of kerala the strategy adopted to find flood return quantiles is the same as mentioned above for time based models this example is illustrated mainly to emphasize on the importance of conducting a regional level study in terms of nsffa the effect of climate induced non stationarity tends to vary depending upon the location of the river gauging stations and can never be generalized as a whole for a nation or even for a state 4 results and discussions as a preliminary investigation on non stationarity of streamflow records the mk test of annual maximum streamflow of all the 17 stations was computed there was a clear ns pattern in the streamflows measured in ayilam kidangoor neeleeswaram pattazhy and perumannu a declining tendency was observed in the streamflows of kallooppara kumbidi malakkara mankara neeleeswaram pattazhy and thumpamon whereas all others had an increase in trend for visually interpreting the appropriate probability distribution that best fits the annual maximum stream flow dataset the lmrd is used as shown in fig 2 in addition gof tests namely ks and ad test was also carried out to identify which candidate distribution ranked the top positions overall for all the stations it was found that gev distribution was the most apt distribution satisfying all the 17 stations for all 17 sites s and ns flood frequency studies were performed using the gev distribution and the best model was chosen with the aid of aic values for brevity the aic values are not provided in tabular form the results so obtained complimented the mk test as all the 12 stations which displayed a stationary behaviour in mk test had sgev model as the best fit model for the remaining five stations data nsgev1 proved to be the most suitable option with all of them exhibiting an ns trend ayilam kidangoor neeleeswaram pattazhy and perumannu the location parameter in this model shifts linearly with time while the scale and shape parameters stay the same the flood quantiles for various return periods rp s of 2 5 10 25 50 100 150 200 250 300 400 and 500 years were computed for all stations the stationary flood estimates were computed for the 12 stations arangali erinjipuzha kalampur kallooppara karathodu kumbidi malakkara mankara pudur pulamanthole ramamangalam and thumpamon for the chosen return periods and is given in table 2 for stations ayilam kidangoor neeleeswaram pattazhy and perumannu a comparison of s and ns return levels were plotted as shown in fig 3 the stationary estimates can be observed to be less than all of the comparable non stationary values the flood discharge increases as rp increases but this increase was gradual in the case of ayilam perumannu and neeleeswaram stations for each of the five stations with ns behaviour the percentage variations pv of flood return levels between s and ns cases were determined fig 4 it was observed that for ayilam kidangoor and pattazhy stations the pv decreases as rp increases till 10 years beyond which the pv followed an increasing trend with rp according to the study there is a significant range in the percentage shift between non stationary and stationary estimations of flood quantiles over 50 years rp at kidangoor 14 to 58 and pattazhy 19 to 53 stations for various rps greater non stationarity is evident in the longer rp estimates than in the shorter rp estimations while the effect of non stationarity was found to have a gradual increment in the case of ayilam station i e pv of 8 at rp of 50 years to pv of 12 at rp of 500 years on the other hand for neeleeswaram and perumannu stations pv decreases continuously as rp increases from 2 years to 500 years for these two stations and ayilam maximum pv was observed for a shorter rp of 2 years i e ns becomes more relevant for designs accounting smaller return periods in all 5 stations it was discovered that ns models with time as a covariate outperformed stationary models but when dynamic nsffa is carried out agilan and umamahesh 2 contend that time based non stationary models can never be deemed the best model climate change and climate variability are best represented while incorporating climate indices as covariates for developing relationships between distribution parameters of an extreme flood event during august 2018 from june 1 to august 19 kerala witnessed one of the most extreme rainfall events on record with rainfall totals that were over 42 above average 38 the periyar river basin was one of the main river basins that experienced significant damage as a result of the 2018 kerala floods hence a typical case of neeleswaram station is considered for further analysis of nsffa using climate indices as covariates four large scale cos namely el nino southern oscillation enso north atlantic oscillation nao pacific decadal oscillation pdo and indian ocean dipole iod are considered as covariates for nsffa based on the past studies 18 32 44 the values of these climatic indices are obtained from https psl noaa gov gcos wgsp timeseries for the period of 1971 2017 a set of 14 models were developed as shown in table 3 apart from three time based ns models and s model to convey the dynamic nature of non stationarity the research revealed that nsgev14 bold value in table 3 was the best fitting model with the location parameter fluctuating according to enso and time combination having constant scale and shape parameters even though the time based ns model nsgev1 was discovered to be the model that provided the best fit for the neeleswaram station at the beginning of the study it has since been demonstrated that the inclusion of climate indices as covariates in ns models will unquestionably capture the effect of non stationarity in a much better way than using time as a covariate according to sudheer et al 38 the flood event in august 2018 has a return time of 142 years based on frequency analysis done on historical yearly flood discharge data in neeleswaram between 1971 and 2018 for instance in this study for a rp of 150 years the sgev nsgev1 and nsgev14 models gave a flood quantile of 5245 cumecs 5470 cumecs and 7300 cumecs respectively which is graphically represented in fig 5 based on the study report kerala floods of august 2018 published by cwc the maximum discharge in periyar river at neeleswaram station was recorded was 8800 cumecs on 16th august 2018 of which 1500 cumecs was the release from idukki reservoir 6 hence the study report concluded that the downstream areas would still have received a peak of about 7500 cumecs during that period even though the nsgev14 model didn t accurately predict the 2018 floods it nevertheless outperformed stationary and time based ns models the likelihood of an extreme rainfall event with accompanying flooding like the one that occurred in august 2018 in the periyar river basin is extremely low therefore no planned operation could have assisted in reducing floods of this scale 38 it is important to note that the study results of neeleeswaram station seriously call into question the validity and suitability of traditional infrastructure design theories that are predicated on the assumption of stationarity for example the return level of 2 years rp for the ns climate based model is 3126 cumecs whereas the same for the stationary model is 1936 cumecs with a difference of about 1190 cumecs 61 it can also be observed that stationary return level of 150 years rp is achieved well before by nsgev14 model at a rp of 25 years therefore the existing infrastructure designed based on the stationary return level will underestimate the actual flood risk and this is the exact reason why many of the infrastructure fail under extreme floods according to mishra et al 24 reservoirs play a significant role in enhancing or escalating the flood scenario and their operations can be made more productive by including extended range extreme forecasts during their design stage the study demonstrated that for various rps there is a significant variation in the percentage difference between non stationary and stationary estimates of flood quantiles in the state in the state the longer rp estimates exhibit a high degree of non stationarity relative to the shorter rp estimates while the influence of non stationarity is found to be considerable even at a few sites when the lower rps are used in general it may be said that non stationarity must be taken into account for designs with longer rps 200 years in all places while it must also be taken into account for designs with shorter rps 50 years in few selected locations here in this study only a selective set of 17 ns models were developed with time and climatic oscillations as covariates a multitude of ns models can be developed by varying the distribution parameters in various combinations furthermore in this study only two covariates are considered time and climatic oscillations which can be further extended to other physical covariates that tend to influence streamflow for e g urbanization local rainfall temperature and so on the best fit ns models tend to vary based on the location and the climatic oscillations that affect the particular river gauge station hence the nsffa has to be explored at a local scale for each location and cannot be generalized in order to capture the dynamics of such rare extreme events it is worth mentioning that the trend computation alone many not be deciphering the ns property of the streamflows and it may also be depending on the time spell chosen for the analysis 5 conclusions in this study 17 hydrologic stations that are part of the wfrs in kerala india were subjected to s and ns ffa the presence of non stationarity was estimated using mk test and it was found that streamflows of five ayilam kidangoor neeleeswaram pattazhy and perumannu out of the 17 stations displayed a strict ns behaviour the ffa was carried out by developing sgev model and three nsgev models with linearly time varying location and scale parameters from the analysis it was found that nsgev1 model with linear variation of location parameter with time found to be the most suitable one for nsffa the ns flood estimates dominated the corresponding stationary estimates for different rps ranging from 2 years to 500 years for all the five stations with ns streamflow records the departure of nsffc from the sffc was quantified in terms of pv showing an increase in pv with rps at ayilam kidangoor and pattazhy stations and a decrease at neeleswaram and perumannu stations kidangoor and pattazhy stations showed the maximum pv beyond 50 years ranging from 14 to 58 and 19 to 53 respectively kidangoor and pattazhy stations designs must take non stationarity into account for longer rp applications 50 years but neeleeswaram and perumannu stations designs must take non stationarity into account for shorter rp applications 50 years this necessitates that the choice of ns case should be adopted based on the type of hydraulic structure and its location an extended simulation was carried out for neeleeswaram station belonging to periyar basin by incorporating climate oscillations as covariates in nsffa it was discovered that the stable

20088,conventional flood frequency analysis ffa may underestimate flood quantiles and increase hydraulic infrastructure vulnerability in changing climates this study uses annual maximum streamflow data from 17 hydrologic stations along west flowing rivers in kerala india for non stationary ns ffa the generalized extreme value model with a linear temporal location parameter worked effectively for five stations kidangoor and pattazhy stations must account for non stationarity for longer return periods rps 50 years whereas neeleeswaram and perumannu stations must for shorter rps 50 years an extensive study was conducted for neeleswaram station periyar basin by simulating ns models incorporating four large scale climate oscillations as covariates the stationary assumption underestimated flood return levels of 2 year rp by about 61 which increases the flood risk leading to failure of hydraulic infrastructures it was observed that the best fitted climate based ns model achieves stationary return level of 150 years rp at 25 years rp itself the study proved that the climate based ns models captured the 2018 august floods in periyar basin better than stationary and time based models the regional variability in ff curve behaviour concludes that nsffa for kerala cannot be generalised and must be done at a local scale keywords flood frequency analysis infrastructure streamflow non stationary climate oscillations flood risk data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction anthropogenic activities are currently overriding natural climate variability causing irreversible climate change the human contribution to rise in global temperature has alarmingly amplified earth s natural greenhouse effect hotter air holds more water vapour causing heavier downpours floods and hydraulic infrastructure damage floods droughts heatwaves and other climate extremes are more likely to occur due to global warming frequency analysisof extremes is one of the most accepted statistical applications within hydrology flood frequency analysis ffa is commonly used to relate the frequency of extreme runoff or river flow occurrences to their intensity by employing probability distribution functions ff studies require long term peak discharge data which is scarce ffa plays a dynamic role in supplying flood return levels for different return periods which are utilised in the construction of storm water drainage systems culverts dams levees sewer bridges ff curves are needed to analyse flood return levels and determine the optimum hydraulic structural design parameters without over or under designing them flood return levels support flood insurance zoning procedures in addition to hydraulic design conventionally ffa assumes flood data is independent identically distributed and unbiased to anthropogenic changes in hydrological systems i e assumption of stationarity where distribution parameters are space time independent for easy computation as per 5th ipcc report extreme events are time varying due to anthropogenic activities and climate change 14 consequently stationary s ffa will not fulfil future hydroclimatic conditions leading to significant allegations 30 hence non stationary ns ffa dominates the hydrology communities by modifying the existing standards for effectively managing the hydraulic structures 19 in nsffa distribution parameters must be considered dynamic over time and may fluctuate with covariates such local temperature or climatic oscillations that can influence heavy rainfall and floods 16 making nsffa models more complex and difficult to handle 9 initially time was the only covariate in nsffa used to depict temporal trend 4 5 39 40 45 many researchers have developed ns models varying distribution parameters linearly and non linearly with multiple covariates to perform nsffa villarini et al 40 41 adopted time maximum daily rainfall and density of population as a covariate in generalized additive models for location shape and scale parameters for ffa ouarda and charron 29 performed nsffa with trends and climatic variation as covariates for generalized extreme value gev distribution parameters this canadian study examines two cases yearly flood flows and extreme temperatures in streamflow case study the shape parameter of nsgev model with temporal trend enhanced the goodness of fit gof india is among the worst flood hit countries in asia extreme flooding has resulted from catastrophic spatial and temporal fluctuation in the country s rainfall patterns with 80 of the annual total falling in just 3 to 4 months june to september roxy et al 34 found that extreme precipitation episodes in central india tripled from 1951 to 2015 the significant large scale flood events in india in the recent two decades are bihar floods 2004 3 mumbai floods 2005 37 bihar floods 2007 2008 17 uttarakhand floods 2013 31 jammu kashmir floods 2014 23 chennai floods 2015 36 and kerala floods 2018 42 india s diverse climate makes generalisations difficult for flood conditions to address the nation s diverse flood threats extreme flood events must be handled at both national and local levels wmo et al 43 correctly noted that there is no universal flood solutions that successful flood risk reduction measures are site specific although oceanic circulations indian summer monsoon precipitation have been widely established 10 17 21 22 31 33 35 little research has been done on how large scale oceanic atmospheric circulation may be related to floods in indian river basins 27 kerala s recent significant flooding and extensive rainfall in 2018 serve as a stark reminder of how severe the country s extreme flooding may be kerala is recognised for its abundant water resources which are supplied by 44 rivers according to india meteorological department imd 13 kerala has seen above average rainfall from the start of june 2018 with the deviations from normal being 15 in june 18 in july and 164 in august august 1 19 2018 the state was unprepared for this downpour forcing 35 dams to be opened by august 2018 to avoid dam failure the 2018 kerala floods one of the worst in almost a century caught the attention of the media scientists and politicians encouraging them to critically analyse this horrific catastrophe in various sectors the hydro climatological perspective of kerala floods 12 25 combined effect of extreme rainfall and reservoir storage 26 role of dams on the periyar floods 38 case study on kakki reservoir management 31 satellite based flood assessment 42 flood impact assessment by field investigation and post flood survey 21 social sensing of kerala 2018 flood impacts 46 are a few of the noteworthy contributions that have been made in relation to this rare extreme event only few studies have been carried out lingering around the ffa of kerala drissia et al 7 analysed daily and flood discharge of 43 gauging stations in kerala s west flowing rivers wfrs and constructed regional frequency curves incorporating watershed characteristics to estimate flood magnitude using l moments technique 8 to the best of our knowledge there have been no studies undertaken in kerala that utilise the idea of non stationarity to create ff curves that account for a warming planet the realisation that using traditional ff curves in the future will inevitably underestimate flood quantiles threatening the state s critical infrastructure prompted an immediate re evaluation of the state s hydraulic infrastructure design in light of climate induced nsffa of streamflows in kerala rivers in this study the annual maximum streamflow dataset of 17 stations of the wfrs of kerala over different districts were considered for ffa in a s as well as ns context as a first attempt of solving the issue this study looked at the simplest time dependent ns framework of location and scale distribution parameters and the effect of climatic variables for a crucial location in the periyar basin in relation to the great kerala floods of 2018 the goal of this exercise was to demonstrate how climate based ns models as opposed to stationary and time based models more accurately capture the complexity and dynamics of climate change specifically this research aims i to develop s and ns ff curves for the 17 river gauge stations of the west flowing rivers wfrs of kerala ii to look into how climate oscillations influence the simulation of ns flood frequency models at the neeleswaram outlet station in the periyar basin 2 study area the daily discharge data for 17 river gauge stations of wfrs of kerala india was collected from water resource information system wris https www indiawris gov in and the annual maximum discharge data of the stations were extracted the analysis only includes stations with record lengths over 25 years table 1 provides location details of 17 river gauge stations and data length used in this study fig 1 is a spatial

first one to devise mk test and its test statistics was given by kendall 15 positive and negative values of the normalised test statistic z respectively suggest growing or declining trends whereas

generalized logistic gev weibull generalized pareto generalized normal and pearson type iii distributions firstly l moments are calculated for the sample data and then the sample s location is represented as a point in the figure the candidate distribution which is relatively closer to the sample s location is considered to be the most appropriate distribution for the chosen data apart from visual interpretation two gof tests namely kolmogorov smirnov ks test anderson darling ad test was also conducted to identify the most suitable distribution at a significance level of 5 3 3 stationary

case study for dynamic ns modelling using climate oscillations as covariates it was one of the most widely affected area in the 2018 august floods of kerala the strategy adopted to find flood return quantiles is the same as mentioned above for time based models this example is illustrated mainly to emphasize on the importance of conducting a regional level study in terms of nsffa the effect of climate induced non stationarity tends to vary depending upon the location of the river gauging stations and can never be generalized as a whole for a nation or even for a state 4 results and discussions as a preliminary investigation on non stationarity of streamflow records the mk test of annual maximum streamflow of all the 17 stations was computed there was a clear ns pattern in the streamflows measured in ayilam kidangoor neeleeswaram pattazhy and perumannu a declining tendency was observed in the streamflows of kallooppara kumbidi malakkara mankara neeleeswaram pattazhy and thumpamon whereas all others had an increase in trend for visually interpreting the appropriate probability distribution that best fits the annual maximum stream flow dataset the lmrd is used as shown in fig 2 in addition gof tests namely ks and ad test was also carried out to identify which candidate distribution ranked the top positions overall for all the stations it was found that gev distribution was the most apt distribution satisfying all the 17 stations for all 17 sites s and ns flood frequency studies were performed using the gev distribution and the best model was chosen with the aid of aic values for brevity the aic values are not provided in tabular form the results so obtained complimented the mk test as all the 12 stations which displayed a stationary behaviour in mk test had sgev model as the best fit model for the remaining five stations data nsgev1 proved to be the most suitable option with all of them exhibiting an ns trend ayilam kidangoor neeleeswaram pattazhy and perumannu the location parameter in this model shifts linearly with time while the scale and shape parameters stay the same the flood quantiles for various return periods rp s of 2 5 10 25 50 100 150 200 250 300 400 and 500 years were computed for all stations the stationary flood estimates were computed for the 12 stations arangali erinjipuzha kalampur kallooppara karathodu kumbidi malakkara mankara pudur pulamanthole ramamangalam and thumpamon for the chosen return periods and is given in table 2 for stations ayilam kidangoor neeleeswaram pattazhy and perumannu a comparison of s and ns return levels were plotted as shown in fig 3 the stationary estimates can be observed to be less than all of the comparable non stationary values the flood discharge increases as rp increases but this increase was gradual in the case of ayilam perumannu and neeleeswaram stations for each of the five stations with ns behaviour the percentage variations pv of flood return levels between s and ns cases were determined fig 4 it was observed that for ayilam kidangoor and pattazhy stations the pv decreases as rp increases till 10 years beyond which the pv followed an increasing trend with rp according to the study there is a significant range in the percentage shift between non stationary and stationary estimations of flood quantiles over 50 years rp at kidangoor 14 to 58 and pattazhy 19 to 53 stations for various rps greater non stationarity is evident in the longer rp estimates than in the shorter rp estimations while the effect of non stationarity was found to have a gradual increment in the case of ayilam station i e pv of 8 at rp of 50 years to pv of 12 at rp of 500 years on the other hand for neeleeswaram and perumannu stations pv decreases continuously as rp increases from 2 years to 500 years for these two stations and ayilam maximum pv was observed for a shorter rp of 2 years i e ns becomes more relevant for designs accounting smaller return periods in all 5 stations it was discovered that ns models with time as a covariate outperformed stationary models but when dynamic nsffa is carried out agilan and umamahesh 2 contend that time based non stationary models can never be deemed the best model climate change and climate variability are best represented while incorporating climate indices as covariates for developing relationships between distribution parameters of an extreme flood event during august 2018 from june 1 to august 19 kerala witnessed one of the most extreme rainfall events on record with rainfall totals that were over 42 above average 38 the periyar river basin was one of the main river basins that experienced significant damage as a result of the 2018 kerala floods hence a typical case of neeleswaram station is considered for further analysis of nsffa using climate indices as covariates four large scale cos namely el nino southern oscillation enso north atlantic oscillation nao pacific decadal oscillation pdo and indian ocean dipole iod are considered as covariates for nsffa based on the past studies 18 32 44 the values of these climatic indices are obtained from https psl noaa gov gcos wgsp timeseries for the period of 1971 2017 a set of 14 models were developed as shown in table 3 apart from three time based ns models and s model to convey the dynamic nature of non stationarity the research revealed that nsgev14 bold value in table 3 was the best fitting model with the location parameter fluctuating according to enso and time combination having constant scale and shape parameters even though the time based ns model nsgev1 was discovered to be the model that provided the best fit for the neeleswaram station at the beginning of the study it has since been demonstrated that the inclusion of climate indices as covariates in ns models will unquestionably capture the effect of non stationarity in a much better way than using time as a covariate according to sudheer et al 38 the flood event in august 2018 has a return time of 142 years based on frequency analysis done on historical yearly flood discharge data in neeleswaram between 1971 and 2018 for instance in this study for a rp of 150 years the sgev nsgev1 and nsgev14 models gave a flood quantile of 5245 cumecs 5470 cumecs and 7300 cumecs respectively which is graphically represented in fig 5 based on the study report kerala floods of august 2018 published by cwc the maximum discharge in periyar river at neeleswaram station was recorded was 8800 cumecs on 16th august 2018 of which 1500 cumecs was the release from idukki reservoir 6 hence the study report concluded that the downstream areas would still have received a peak of about 7500 cumecs during that period even though the nsgev14 model didn t accurately predict the 2018 floods it nevertheless outperformed stationary and time based ns models the likelihood of an extreme rainfall event with accompanying flooding like the one that occurred in august 2018 in the periyar river basin is extremely low therefore no planned operation could have assisted in reducing floods of this scale 38 it is important to note that the study results of neeleeswaram station seriously call into question the validity and suitability of traditional infrastructure design theories that are predicated on the assumption of stationarity for example the return level of 2 years rp for the ns climate based model is 3126 cumecs whereas the same for the stationary model is 1936 cumecs with a difference of about 1190 cumecs 61 it can also be observed that stationary return level of 150 years rp is achieved well before by nsgev14 model at a rp of 25 years therefore the existing infrastructure designed based on the stationary return level will underestimate the actual flood risk and this is the exact reason why many of the infrastructure fail under extreme floods according to mishra et al 24 reservoirs play a significant role in enhancing or escalating the flood scenario and their operations can be made more productive by including extended range extreme forecasts during their design stage the study demonstrated that for various rps there is a significant variation in the percentage difference between non stationary and stationary estimates of flood quantiles in the state in the state the longer rp estimates exhibit a high degree of non stationarity relative to the shorter rp estimates while the influence of non stationarity is found to be considerable even at a few sites when the lower rps are used in general it may be said that non stationarity must be taken into account for designs with longer rps 200 years in all places while it must also be taken into account for designs with shorter rps 50 years in few selected locations here in this study only a selective set of 17 ns models were developed with time and climatic oscillations as covariates a multitude of ns models can be developed by varying the distribution parameters in various combinations furthermore in this study only two covariates are considered time and climatic oscillations which can be further extended to other physical covariates that tend to influence streamflow for e g urbanization local rainfall temperature and so on the best fit ns models tend to vary based on the location and the climatic oscillations that affect the particular river gauge station hence the nsffa has to be explored at a local scale for each location and cannot be generalized in order to capture the dynamics of such rare extreme events it is worth mentioning that the trend computation alone many not be deciphering the ns property of the streamflows and it may also be depending on the time spell chosen for the analysis 5 conclusions in this study 17 hydrologic stations that are part of the wfrs in kerala india were subjected to s and ns ffa the presence of non stationarity was estimated using mk test and it was found that streamflows of five ayilam kidangoor neeleeswaram pattazhy and perumannu out of the 17 stations displayed a strict ns behaviour the ffa was carried out by developing sgev model and three nsgev models with linearly time varying location and scale parameters from the analysis it was found that nsgev1 model with linear variation of location parameter with time found to be the most suitable one for nsffa the ns flood estimates dominated the corresponding stationary estimates for different rps ranging from 2 years to 500 years for all the five stations with ns streamflow records the departure of nsffc from the sffc was quantified in terms of pv showing an increase in pv with rps at ayilam kidangoor and pattazhy stations and a decrease at neeleswaram and perumannu stations kidangoor and pattazhy stations showed the maximum pv beyond 50 years ranging from 14 to 58 and 19 to 53 respectively kidangoor and pattazhy stations designs must take non stationarity into account for longer rp applications 50 years but neeleeswaram and perumannu stations designs must take non stationarity into account for shorter rp applications 50 years this necessitates that the choice of ns case should be adopted based on the type of hydraulic structure and its location an extended simulation was carried out for neeleeswaram station belonging to periyar basin by incorporating climate oscillations as covariates in nsffa it was discovered that the stable climate assumption could increase the probability of flooding and infrastructure system failure by underestimating flood extremes by around 61 over a return period of two years it was also observed that the stationary return level of 150 yearsrp is achieved well in advance by best fit climate based ns model at a rp of 25 years it was concluded that climate based ns models most likely apprehended the peak flood discharge that occurred during the 2018 august kerala floods these findings clearly indicate the efficiency and need of revising the existing flood frequency curves of the state in accordance with the changing climate the performance of ns models is highly modulated by the inclusion of various covariates to the distribution parameters and the best covariate that accommodates the climate change and variability will definitely vary based on the location of the hydrologic station under study hence this necessitates the need to further explore the covariates that warrants the extreme flood events at a local scale recently large flood events in kerala have become more frequent prompting the state to call for a reform of the ffc which is now being utilised to construct

request 1 introduction water security is the most significant life support function across the earth s ecosystem and is intricately dependent on regional economic and social conditions 1 2 though water security is a crucial policy deliverable for sustainable development 3 4 about 80 of the global population faces water security challenges in food health livelihood and environmental sustainability 5 6 mountain ecosystems such as the himalayas play a crucial role in meeting a significant portion of the global population s water supply needs 5 yet the mountain communities suffer from seasonal water scarcity and regional water induced emergencies 7 ecosystem services as a concept provides a means of managing water resources sustainably by assessing the natural functions of ecosystems to support water availability quality and reliability 3 with increasing urbanization and hill area development information regarding water allied ecosystem services es such as water supply and water regulation are of high value and is increasingly being sought after by water resources managers landscape planners ecologists and political decision makers 8 9 reliable information on es requires assessment of the impact of future development trajectories the understanding of underlying hydrological responses to ecological changes either due to climate or landscape changes or results of development programs 10 11 in this sense the ability to reliably represent watershed processes is a pivotal element for decision makers and water managers to protect water es in the long term 12 hydrological models like variable infiltration capacity vic model has been used for the assessment of indian himalayan river responses to climate change 13 soil water assessment tool swat for

often disconnected from modeling and modeling efforts are commonly guided by oversimplified assumptions which affect their credibility and impact 19 inadequate prioritization of specific areas with higher vulnerability and the lack of hydrological modeling and monitoring of these services in hydrological practice present key challenges that may considerably impede watershed management programs

underlying layers l called local recharge a fraction of l depending on local topography soil hydraulic properties geology etc contributes to baseflow b at the outlet of the watershed both qf and b are routed from each pixel to the watershed outlet the model adopts a graph traversal approach to route water available at upslope pixels to downslope pixels leading to the watershed outlet in solving the graph traversal problem the invest swy provides a spatial estimation of the annual baseflow contribution at each pixel in the watershed for more details on the model please refer 32 the model

we conducted a heuristic experiment by simulating two example scenarios in selected watersheds in the first scenario open forests were converted into barren land and in the second scenario the open forests were converted into fruit orchards the scenarios were designed to showcase the value of scenario generation in policy deliberations rather than aiming to simulate the absolute best future

indices aids in prioritizing limited resources to draw maximum benefits through optimizing governance in the water sector 36 we compute two sets of indices human indices and hydrological indices human indices are concerned with the threat to life due to water scarcity and flooding hydrological indices are indicative of the watershed behaviour the indices are defined to range from 0 to 1 except for dryness index which can take values greater than 1 for extremely dry conditions the indices computed in this study and their description is tabulated in the appendices appendix 1 table 3 the

climatology of watersheds and determine consumptive demand on watersheds respectively providing valuable information for watershed management and decision making 2 5 model assessment the sensitivity of the swy model was tested singularly as a measure of model robustness and the flexibility of the model defining parameters within the multispectral space the variation of α showcases the importance of precipitation seasonality coupled with the unchanged local regime where water recharge is essential for domestic and consumptive use β is influenced by terrain characteristics specifically soil typology and geology hence it is often less dynamic temporally as compared to α storage capacity up slope subsidy and up slope area are essential considerations when setting the numerical influence of β within the model the γ parameter is terrain influenced like β but more edaphically controlled such that the permeability and the presence of fractures and faults affects the fraction of recharge lost to deep groundwater storage a broad scale uniformity of the soil water continuum proscribes γ from changing over the landscape 37 a one at a time sensitivity analysis was conducted for α β and γ parameters following a similar approach used in 16 this analysis aimed to provide guidance for parameter selection in watershed modeling particularly in comparative studies α was kept constant at 1 12 while β and γ were varied in the range of 1 12 1 and 0 1 at intervals of 1 12 and 0 1 respectively similarly cn was also varied with default parameterization retained for other parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 water yield the annual water yield fig 3 is taken as the sum of total quick flow and total baseflow leaving the watershed in any given year the results show that yearly water yield as a fraction of annual precipitation is high as expected for socksten 41 which is 68 barren land as compared to the chander watershed 29 with 58 dense forest cover sahigad has a slightly higher 46 annual water yield than socksten which is explained by its lower evaporative index an index of regional climatology defined as the fraction of aet to precipitation the model parameters β and γ were kept constant across watersheds for comparison under this choice of parameters socksten exhibits the highest baseflow conversion 26 among the three study watersheds sahigad 17 and chander 15 reveal similar baseflow transformations as both watersheds are largely forested baseflows a component of total water yield provide for environmental flows and lean season abstractions sahigad watershed ranks the highest in water yield ecosystem services while socksten has the advantage of sustaining lean season flows with a higher baseflow conversion 3 2 water yield and lulc change sahigad in the baseline scenario has a small share of barren land 1 and a substantial percentage of open forests 59 the conversion of open forests to barren land in the case of sahigad results in a sixty fold increase in barren land and consequently an almost doubling 90 increase of baseflows compared to the baseline while for socksten the increase in barren land is nominal for the already barren land dominant watershed and consequently the effect on increasing baseflows is the least 35 increase now the chander watershed shares a similar cover 19 of open forests in the baseline scenario with socksten 18 a simplistic understanding would imply a proportional decrease in aet due to the degeneration of open forests the invest modelling environment adopts a more realistic simulation it iteratively estimates aet by considering the recharge behaviour of all the different land use classes specific to each watershed 32 this is evident in a change in aet that is contrary to routine crop coefficient based aet calculations the decline in aet is 13 in chander slightly less than a decline of 15 in socksten the gain in available water due to decline in aet is offset by higher allocation to the dense forest pixels of chander watershed invest captures this behavior in the iterative estimation of aet 32 consequently a lesser decline in aet is observed in chander despite a greater open forest coverage than socksten this highlights the utility of the invest modelling environment for quick assessments of the effects of lulc change on water balance development of open forests into fruit orchards scenario 2 when simulated in the invest environment results in significantly lesser change 2 in water balance components in the selected study locations the results indicate that the consumptive use for fruit orchards in the pilot watersheds given the user defined kc and cn values is comparable to that of open forests it is crucial to emphasize the importance of curating the biophysical table which captures critical landscape features stakeholders should carefully consider various factors such as soil type vegetation characteristics and land use when defining the biophysical table parameters for specific scenarios when heuristic experiments like the ones presented are shared with stakeholders they offer a tool for informed management decisions and discussions even among those who may have limited expertise in watershed science such experiments can promote hydrologically consistent and sustainable decision making and can be tailored to a wide range of watersheds and management scenarios 3 3 model assessment plots of aet vs β and l vs β for sahigad were generated fig 4 to have deeper insights into the interplay of these parameters on model outputs the following observations were drawn from the sensitivity model runs 1 for any set of α and γ aet increases with an increase in β 2 for any set of α and β aet increases with an increase in γ 3 aet and l exhibit an inverse relationship and consequently observations of changes in l with respect to α β and γ are the opposite of that observed for aet 4 for a particular β value when γ is in the range of 0 6 to 1 there is no significant change in both aet and l with a shift in γ values however for γ values 0 to 0 6 aet and l values vary significantly which is evident from the increased spacing between the aet vs β and l vs β plots respectively 5 the aet vs β curves and l vs β curves is asymptotical for higher values of β we observe that at β 0 5 the variations in aet values are much larger than when β 0 5 for a much more stable set of parameter configurations both β and γ can be chosen to be greater than 0 5 for e g α 1 12 β in the range 0 8 1 γ in the range 0 8 1 karl pearson s coefficient of correlation fig 5 between γ and aet indicate that γ and aet are positively and strongly correlated with higher values of correlation coefficient 0 83 we also find that β and aet are positively and weakly correlated with a value of 0 37 similarly for γ and l we observe that they are negatively but strongly correlated r 0 83 and β and l are negatively and weakly correlated r 0 37 fig 6 we further configured a set of parameter values α 1 12 β 1 γ 1 for examining the effect of variations in cn on aet l and qf values we chose it as the default value as this set represents the most stable configuration the cn values were systematically varied from the baseline scenario with decrements in units of 5 ranging up to 60 and increments up to 15 in order to explore a range of potential values an increased cn means there is a lesser possibility of retention of water and increased potential for runoff the plots confirm that a higher cn range would result in lesser aet lesser l and more runoff among the water balance components qf depends on a subjective choice of cn for sahigad for a change in cn by 5 the change in qf per year is limited to 4 mm3 which is reasonable to make preliminary assessments of ungauged watersheds from ancillary data the α β and γ values primarily influence the partitioning of aet and l and even here for a fixed choice of α and γ the rate of change of l or aet is not more than 2 mm3 for every 0 1 increment of β over the entire range of β the choice of α can be made based on the seasonality of rainfall β and γ can be set to the maximum bounds i e 0 and 1 for preliminary results while for exploratory assessments β and γ can be set to be greater than 0 5 as the effect of parameter error on aet and l are minimum in this range based on the uncertainty assessment described in this section 3 4 water security indices the water stress index for the baseline scenario was very low appendix 1 table 4 for the study watersheds as the agriculture practices are mainly rainfed and do not require any irrigation the only measurable water withdrawals were for domestic water use which when calculated based on the watershed s population results in a tiny fraction 1 of the water yield the flood retention index of sahigad is the least 0 71 this implies the contribution of flows in sahigad is dominantly by overland flows while the other watersheds have comparatively better flow retention of 0 85 and 0 86 for socksten and chander respectively the higher flood retention implies water available for supporting vegetation months after the rainfall season and recharge of deep groundwater aquifers if the prevalent water policy aims to bring all watersheds compared to the same level of flood retention effectiveness then sahigad watershed would attract more development resources among the three watersheds considered the baseflow contribution of chander is close to that of sahigad despite higher flood retention we can infer that higher retention does not necessarily translate to increased baseflows the results are not surprising when one observes that chander is dominantly densely forested 60 the behavior of chander exhibits a trade off between changes in evapotranspiration referred to as the pump effect and infiltration referred to as the sponge effect 38 resulting in lower rainfall overland flow conversions 29 as observed in the watershed response ratio qf p 39 further the climatology represented by the aridity index is higher 1 79 for socksten in tawang indicating a high potential for evaporative losses and consequently higher evaporative index 0 68 despite being largely barren 70 chander with dense forests has an evaporative index of 0 70 with losses governed by forest canopy transpiration owing to the dense forest cover in the preceding discussion it is evident that indices are good measures in understanding complex watershed behaviours and drawing comparisons across contrasting landscapes indices such as these may serve as a general thumb rule for watershed managers to assess the status of target landscapes and which in turn helps define watershed typologies and attach management protocols to each typology 4 conclusion in this study we have explored the use of open source data based ecosystem modelling as a potential tool for situational assessment aimed at providing a scoping protocol that is accessible and implementable by water managers seeking quick hydrological assessments our approach involved using the invest model to simulate water yield ecosystem services in select himalayan regions allowing us to investigate the dominant eco hydrological processes we conducted assessments of water balance components in the study watersheds evaluated the performance and uncertainty of the swy model and defined indices based on the modelled output that are easily comprehensible by a broad user base this work highlights the potential of this approach as a tool for approximate and expedited hydrological assessments for water managers the ecosystem services modeling presented in this work seamlessly integrates into the broader life cycle of watershed management spanning from ideation to implementation and assessment stakeholders perceptions of ecosystem value shape the dialogue partnerships and policy frameworks for watershed development through ecosystem services modeling stakeholders have the opportunity to optimize policy and programs based on evolving perceptions of ecosystem value informed by modeling outcomes that enhance understanding of the watershed and water security issues stakeholders active engagement in running the models themselves with capacity building to understand the tool s capabilities and limitations is crucial for effective modeling stakeholder consultations and scenario development identify questions of interest and explore consequences of changes on natural resources through ecosystem modeling results can be shared with stakeholders to inform decisions and support an iterative process of scenario creation until suitable management solutions are identified this participatory engagement co creates knowledge guides resource allocation towards targeted programs in water stressed regions and informs future policy deliberations based on improved ecosystem and community utility stakeholder feedback also informs research investments for better understanding of ecosystem functions and modeling this context is presented as a stepwise scoping protocol along the lines of the natural capital approach 32 as illustrated in fig 7 the choice of data for scoping watershed development programs depends on the required accuracy level and resources global datasets for climatology and soil have inherent deficiencies when applied to basin or watershed scale studies in the indian himalayas worldclim is useful for climatological baseline assessments but not for year on year assessments the global pet dataset is still under development with the latest version v3 currently available hysog 250 m is a good starting point for soil properties we validated hysog 250 m with the nbslupp 39 soil geodatabase to derive cn for the scs cn method our analysis shows that the choice of cn impacts water yield but approximations within a range of 5 are reasonable for reconnaissance studies the use of global datasets in the present work serve to demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework for scoping assessments end users should carefully choose datasets that align with their study objectives further the invest ecosystem services tool utilizes the widely used scs cn method for water yield assessment this method enables efficient transition from gis datasets on soils and land use cover to a rainfall runoff model while the model primarily represents rainfall partitioning into storm runoff it yields conservative water availability estimates suitable for policy discussions across a wide range of landscapes particularly in the himalayas where the total discharge hydrograph can be impacted by aquifers and flow paths that cross topographic boundaries this initial assessment can guide further investments in monitoring networks and modeling that capture the complex himalayan hydrology thus summarizing sustainable management of water ecosystem services requires information to support decision making in this work we simulated water yield using invest suite towards generating reliable information to support decision making in data scarce himalayan regions the suitability of the model was assessed by a one at a time sensitivity analysis a heuristic experiment was designed to demonstrate the utility of the invest suite in facilitating deliberation on policy choices the model outputs were translated into a set of watershed management indicators to assess changes in local and regional water security while also quantifying relationships between water demand and water resources at site specific contexts the modelling exercise further allowed a distilling of a stepwise scoping protocol for strengthening knowledge base for watershed management programs declaration of

model to generate reliable information for decision making related to watershed management programs in data scarce himalayan regions the results are translated into watershed indices easily communicable to watershed managers stakeholders and administrative agencies the analysis demonstrates the utility of hydrological modeling using limited data within a scoping protocol for the pre implementation phase of any watershed management program keywords invest himalayas watershed indices ecosystem services modeling ungauged catchment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water security is the most significant life support function across the earth s ecosystem and is intricately dependent on regional economic and social conditions 1 2 though water security is a crucial policy deliverable for sustainable development 3 4 about 80 of the global population faces water security challenges in food health livelihood and environmental sustainability 5 6 mountain ecosystems such as the himalayas play a crucial role in meeting a significant portion of the global population s water supply needs 5 yet the mountain communities suffer from seasonal water scarcity and regional water induced emergencies 7 ecosystem services as a concept provides a means of managing water resources sustainably by assessing the natural functions of ecosystems to support water availability quality and reliability 3 with increasing urbanization and hill area development information regarding water allied ecosystem services es such as water supply and water regulation are of high value and is increasingly being sought after by water resources managers landscape planners ecologists and political decision makers 8 9 reliable information on es requires assessment of the impact of future development trajectories the understanding of underlying hydrological responses to ecological changes either due to climate or landscape changes or results of development programs 10 11 in this sense the ability to reliably represent watershed processes is a pivotal element for decision makers and water managers to protect water es in the long term 12 hydrological models like variable infiltration capacity vic model has been used for the assessment of indian himalayan river responses to climate change 13 soil water assessment tool swat for modelling streamflow and sediment yield 14 and water evaluation and planning weap system for freshwater ecosystem services modelling 15 these models are highly complex and data intensive requiring many inputs 16 17 however in data scarce regions such as the himalayas the data and expertise to apply these models are often unavailable limiting their application 18 moreover local monitoring are often disconnected from modeling and modeling efforts are commonly guided by oversimplified assumptions which affect their credibility and impact 19 inadequate prioritization of specific areas with higher vulnerability and the lack of hydrological modeling and monitoring of these services in hydrological practice present key challenges that may considerably impede watershed management programs success 20 21 therefore simpler hydrological models i e with a user friendly interface and comparatively low data requirements e g using globally freely available data sources are needed one of the most used tools for modeling water es is the model suite integrated valuation of ecosystem services and tradeoffs invest developed by the natural capital project 22 in particular the seasonal water yield swy has been used to model water yield in diverse geographical contexts 16 17 23 assisting stakeholders and decision makers in the management of natural resources 24 26 nature based solutions 27 and protected areas 28 29 it uses relatively coarser datasets to represent ungauged regions and field validation enhances its applicability 17 30 in this work we demonstrate open source data based ecosystem modelling as an objective tool for situational assessment aimed at providing an easy scoping protocol accessible and implementable by all water managers looking for reliable hydrological assessments this we achieve by demonstration of water yield es simulations using the invest model to investigate dominant eco hydrological processes in select himalayan regions we first assess the water balance components in the identified study watersheds then we evaluate the swy model performance and uncertainty finally indices that are easily comprehensible by a broad user base based on the modelled output are defined the paper is structured by first documenting the material and methods involved in the research followed by results and interpretations along with a discussion on the utility of indices in watershed planning we summarize the article by distilling a scoping protocol for pre intervention assessment of watershed development activities 2 materials and methods 2 1 study

yield model invest swy in this study we used invest version 3 10 2 freely downloadable from https naturalcapitalproject stanford to perform the ecosystem services assessment using spatially explicit input information on local climate soil topography and landuse landcover lulc the invest swy provides monthly estimates of surface runoff qf at each pixel based on monthly precipitation pi i 1 2 12 and the rainfall events per month using a modification of the soil conservation service curve number scs cn method 31 the actual evapotranspiration aet is estimated from user defined crop coefficients for each lulc class and user input potential evapotranspiration pet rasters at watershed scale a reasonable approximation is that surface water and groundwater boundaries overlap and all groundwater within the watershed discharges into the stream consequently in each pixel at an annual scale input precipitation p is partitioned into only qf aet and a vertical flux of water from the surface to underlying layers l called local recharge a fraction of l depending on local topography soil hydraulic properties geology etc contributes to baseflow b at the outlet of the watershed both qf and b are routed from each pixel to the watershed outlet the model adopts a graph traversal approach to route water available at upslope pixels to downslope pixels leading to the watershed outlet in solving the graph traversal problem the invest swy provides a spatial estimation of the annual baseflow contribution at each pixel in the watershed for more details on the model please refer 32 the model parameters α β and γ govern the partitioning of total water available at each pixel due to recharge from upslope pixel and precipitation into local recharge and aet 16 α is a function of precipitation seasonality any given month s recharge can be used by downslope areas during later months depending on the subsurface travel times a default parameterization of constant α 1 12 assumes soil buffers monthly water release such that the monthly contribution from a pixel to downslope pixel is 1 12 of the annual contribution a value of α 0 describes that local recharge from upgradient pixels is absent for evapotranspiration locally representing the same case as β 0 a value of 6 12 for α means that half 0 5 of the annual recharge the equivalent of six average months is potentially available downstream in a particular month this might occur in a watershed with a slow release of recharged water 16 β is a spatial accessibility parameter that ranges between 0 and 1 and is influenced by local topography geology and position i e the recharge from the pixel just above the pixel of interest is more likely to be available than the recharge from pixels much further away γ is the fraction of pixel recharge available to be released to downslope pixels and not lost to deep percolation default is 1 2 3 model inputs climate inputs of monthly precipitation rasters and monthly totals of wet

watersheds from ancillary data the α β and γ values primarily influence the partitioning of aet and l and even here for a fixed choice of α and γ the rate of change of l or aet is not more than 2 mm3 for every 0 1 increment of β over the entire range of β the choice of α can be made based on the seasonality of rainfall β and γ can be set to the maximum bounds i e 0 and 1 for preliminary results while for exploratory assessments β and γ can be set to be greater than 0 5 as the effect of parameter error on aet and l are minimum in this range based on the uncertainty assessment described in this section 3 4 water security indices the water stress index for the baseline scenario was very low appendix 1 table 4 for the study watersheds as the agriculture practices are mainly rainfed and do not require any irrigation the only measurable water withdrawals were for domestic water use which when calculated based on the watershed s population results in a tiny fraction 1 of the water yield the flood retention index of sahigad is the least 0 71 this implies the contribution of flows in sahigad is dominantly by overland flows while the other watersheds have comparatively better flow retention of 0 85 and 0 86 for socksten and chander respectively the higher flood retention implies water available for supporting vegetation months after the rainfall season and recharge of deep groundwater aquifers if the prevalent water policy aims to bring all watersheds compared to the same level of flood retention effectiveness then sahigad watershed would attract more development resources among the three watersheds considered the baseflow contribution of chander is close to that of sahigad despite higher flood retention we can infer that higher retention does not necessarily translate to increased baseflows the results are not surprising when one observes that chander is dominantly densely forested 60 the behavior of chander exhibits a trade off between changes in evapotranspiration referred to as the pump effect and infiltration referred to as the sponge effect 38 resulting in lower rainfall overland flow conversions 29 as observed in the watershed response ratio qf p 39 further the climatology represented by the aridity index is higher 1 79 for socksten in tawang indicating a high potential for evaporative losses and consequently higher evaporative index 0 68 despite being largely barren 70 chander with dense forests has an evaporative index of 0 70 with losses governed by forest canopy transpiration owing to the dense forest cover in the preceding discussion it is evident that indices are good measures in understanding complex watershed behaviours and drawing comparisons across contrasting landscapes indices such as these may serve as a general thumb rule for watershed managers to assess the status of target landscapes and which in turn helps define watershed typologies and attach management protocols to each typology 4 conclusion in this study we have explored the use of open source data based ecosystem modelling as a potential tool for situational assessment aimed at providing a scoping protocol that is accessible and implementable by water managers seeking quick hydrological assessments our approach involved using the invest model to simulate water yield ecosystem services in select himalayan regions allowing us to investigate the dominant eco hydrological processes we conducted assessments of water balance components in the study watersheds evaluated the performance and uncertainty of the swy model and defined indices based on the modelled output that are easily comprehensible by a broad user base this work highlights the potential of this approach as a tool for approximate and expedited hydrological assessments for water managers the ecosystem services modeling presented in this work seamlessly integrates into the broader life cycle of watershed management spanning from ideation to implementation and assessment stakeholders perceptions of ecosystem value shape the dialogue partnerships and policy frameworks for watershed development through ecosystem services modeling stakeholders have the opportunity to optimize policy and programs based on evolving perceptions of ecosystem value informed by modeling outcomes that enhance understanding of the watershed and water security issues stakeholders active engagement in running the models themselves with capacity building to understand the tool s capabilities and limitations is crucial for effective modeling stakeholder consultations and scenario development identify questions of interest and explore consequences of changes on natural resources through ecosystem modeling results can be shared with stakeholders to inform decisions and support an iterative process of scenario creation until suitable management solutions are identified this participatory engagement co creates knowledge guides resource allocation towards targeted programs in water stressed regions and informs future policy deliberations based on improved ecosystem and community utility stakeholder feedback also informs research investments for better understanding of ecosystem functions and modeling this context is presented as a stepwise scoping protocol along the lines of the natural capital approach 32 as illustrated in fig 7 the choice of data for scoping watershed development programs depends on the required accuracy level and resources global datasets for climatology and soil have inherent deficiencies when applied to basin or watershed scale studies in the indian himalayas worldclim is useful for climatological baseline assessments but not for year on year assessments the global pet dataset is still under development with the latest version v3 currently available hysog 250 m is a good starting point for soil properties we validated hysog 250 m with the nbslupp 39 soil geodatabase to derive cn for the scs cn method our analysis shows that the choice of cn impacts water yield but approximations within a range of 5 are reasonable for reconnaissance studies the use of global datasets in the present work serve to demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework for scoping assessments end users should carefully choose datasets that align with their study objectives further the invest ecosystem services tool utilizes the widely used scs cn method for water yield assessment this method enables efficient transition from gis datasets on soils and land use cover to a rainfall runoff model while the model primarily represents rainfall partitioning into storm runoff it yields conservative water availability estimates suitable for policy discussions across a wide range of landscapes particularly in the himalayas where the total discharge hydrograph can be impacted by aquifers and flow paths that cross topographic boundaries this initial assessment can guide further investments in monitoring networks and modeling that capture the complex himalayan hydrology thus summarizing sustainable management of water ecosystem services requires information to support decision making in this work we simulated water yield using invest suite towards generating reliable information to support decision making in data scarce himalayan regions the suitability of the model was assessed by a one at a time sensitivity analysis a heuristic experiment was designed to demonstrate the utility of the invest suite in facilitating deliberation on policy choices the model outputs were translated into a set of watershed management indicators to assess changes in local and regional water security while also quantifying relationships between water demand and water resources at site specific contexts the modelling exercise further allowed a distilling of a stepwise scoping protocol for strengthening knowledge base for watershed management programs declaration of
