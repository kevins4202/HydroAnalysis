4390,this study is among the first to report on a theoretical relationship linking the hydraulic conductivity of soil and aquifer with environmental solution conditions a mathematical model is developed for predicting the hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite from the concentration and valence of electrolyte cations in solution the model relies on the diffuse double layer and dlvo theories the aggregation kinetics and the hazen equation with a few plausible assumptions for establishing three individual relationships with each corresponding to one of three steps in the cation to particle to grain to hydraulic conductivity pathway it is based on a mechanistic understanding that the concentration and valence of electrolyte cations controls the size of montmorillonite primary particles by influencing the electrical double layer subsequently regulates the grain size distribution of montmorillonite via inter particle collision and finally determines the hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite the model is validated by direct measurements of the surface charge density the grain size distribution and the hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite in nacl and cacl2 solutions of various concentrations the theoretical model of predicting hydraulic conductivity developed here is novel for implementing more accurate modeling of contaminant transport in the environment with advantage of cost savings keywords theoretical model hydraulic conductivity electrolyte concentration cation valence montmorillonite 1 introduction hydraulic conductivity of soil and aquifer is a property of their pore structures that describes the degree of ease to which water or other fluids can move through this parameter is the main factor to determine the pattern of solute migration in the pore structure and therefore plays a vital role in contaminant transport through surface and subsurface region in soil and groundwater remediation the knowledge of hydraulic conductivity is needed for accurately delivering reactive reagents to the site of concern the hydraulic conductivity of environmental media may be experimentally determined according to darcy s law but the procedure can be tedious and costly and the obtained values are often uncertain due to the complexity of the environmental conditions it has mostly relied on empirical formulas such as the pedotransfer functions ptfs to predict with large error the hydraulic conductivity using many predictors such as texture density organic matter content and others properties jian et al 2021 gamie and smedt 2018 rabot et al 2018 zhang and schaap 2017 2019 modeling solute or contaminant transport requires accurate prediction of hydraulic conductivity theoretical models to correlate the hydraulic conductivity with soil and groundwater conditions have long been in need montmorillonite is the major component of bentonite which can be used as landfill liners obstacles in soil remediation sealants for ponds and abandoned wells and backfill materials in geological repositories for nuclear waste cui et al 2012 dixon et al 2002 drnevich et al 1986 murray 1991 soonhyun kim et al 2005 tang et al 2011 villar and lloret 2008 wang et al 2012 yong et al 1986 in these applications the hydraulic conductivity is a crucial factor to consider when in contact with water montmorillonite is subjected to layer swelling thus altering its hydraulic conductivity swelling process is a complex process but can be divided into two stages of the crystalline swelling and the osmotic swelling as compared to the former swelling the latter of montmorillonite in saturated state occurs to a much larger extent thus determining the hydraulic conductivity crystalline swelling occurs within a quasicrystal between individual layers with up to 4 discrete layers of waters orderly intercalated cases 1997 cases et al 1992 saiyouri et al 2015 2004 each quasicrystal contains 2 20 aligned unit layers in ca montmorillonite and 1 5 in na montmorillonite cases 1997 cases et al 1992 olphen 1977 segad et al 2012a 2012b sposito and garrison 1984 the basal spacing d001 is characterized by 9 6 12 6 15 6 18 6 and 21 6 å with 0 1 2 3 and 4 layers of water molecules respectively the osmotic swelling occurs between quasicrystals beyond four layers of water forming a diffuse double layer the thickness of the double layer which is the debye length depends on the concentration and valence of electrolyte cations in solution thus the size of a quasicrystal together with a shell of bound waters defined as a primary particle of montmorillonite is dependent on the electrolyte in solution olphen 1977 two or more montmorillonite primary particles can create a larger scale structure termed a grain after the process of aggregation a grain forms from the collision among particles and smaller grains particle dynamics is a way to study aggregation but this method emphasizes too much of micro details when the number of particles in the system is large it is difficult to deal with moiseyev and bar yoseph 2013 aggregation kinetics is another way of study to obtain the grain size distribution this method is based on the collision frequency of particles and grains suspended in liquid or gas and ruled by central limit theorem albarran et al 2014 and and pratsinis 2007 gmachowski 2002 2001 matsoukas and friedlander 1991 to avoid the complex situation of the arrangement of particles in a grain the fractal structure of a grain is usually used to link the size between particles and grains jullien 1990 hydraulic conductivity depends on the size of pores and how these pores are distributed and connected which is challenging to determine many studies have chosen to use grain size distribution to predict hydraulic conductivity arya et al 1999 brooks 1964 durner 1994 hwang and powers 2003 masch and denny 1966 shepherd 1989 sperry and peirce 1995 venkataraman and rao 1998 vogel and roth 1998 extensive studies on the microstructure and macroscopic properties e g hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite discovered the influence of electrolyte solution unfortunately existing research is relatively independent and does not successfully connect them with each other there is almost no theoretical relationship quantitatively describing or predicting the influence of electrolyte solution on the hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite this study focused on montmorillonite in a saturated state in an attempt to develop a theoretical mathematical model to link the hydraulic conductivity with the electrolyte cations in solution to achieve this goal the relationship between the concentration and valence of electrolyte cations in solution and the distance between the montmorillonite quasicrystals was derived at the micro level the grain size distribution and the hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite under the same conditions were determined at the macro level by utilizing the aggregation collision kinetics the microstructure and macrostructure of montmorillonite were connected to quantify the influence of electrolyte cations on the hydraulic conductivity to validate the model on a broad basis two montmorillonite samples with differential cecs and two electrolytes of different cation valency were used 2 theoretical considerations the following theoretical analyses are based on a step by step pathway of linking hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite with electrolyte solution as drawn in fig 1 these analyses rely on the diffuse electrical double layer and dlvo theories the aggregation kinetics and the hazen equation an alphabetical list of notations with their units used in model development is provided in supplementary material 2 1 dependence of inter quasicrystal distance on the concentration and valence of electrolyte cations in solution the swelling pressure p pa of montmorillonite based materials arises from repulsion due to overlap of electrical double layers p d d l p a and attraction of van der waals p v d w p a it can be written as 1 p p d d l h z c p v d w h where h m is inter quasicrystal distance z is the valence of cation and c mol m3 is the concentration of electrolyte eq 1 indicates that inter quasicrystal distance h is an implicit function f 1 h z c of the concentration and valence of electrolyte cation as follows 2 f 1 h z c p d d l h z c p v d w h p 0 p d d l in eq 2 i e the pressure contributed by the overlap of electrical double layers can be written as follows based on the gouy chapman theory leermakers et al 2005 3 p d d l 2 c r t cosh y m 1 where r j k mol is gas constant t k is temperature and y m is the scaled potential at the mid point as indicated by superscript m between the montmorillonite layers liu and neretnieks 2008 derived the expression of y m by assuming the conservation of charge and moving two charged plates from infinity to a distance of h 4 sinh y m 2 sinh y m 4 κ h sinh y h 2 in this formula y m and y h are the scaled potentials of an isolated plate at distances of h 2 and h respectively they have the following expressions 4 1 y m 4 tanh 1 tanh y 0 4 e κ h 2 4 2 y h 4 tanh 1 tanh y 0 4 e κ h 4 3 y 0 2 sinh 1 z f σ 0 2 ε 0 ε r κ r t 4 4 κ 2 f 2 c z 2 ε 0 ε r r t 1 2 where f c mol ε 0 f m ε r κ 1 m and σ 0 c m2 represent the faraday constant vacuum permittivity the relative dielectric constant of water reciprocal of the debye length and the surface charge density respectively p v d w in eq 2 i e the pressure from van der waals force follows the following komine and ogata 1996 5 p v d w a h 6 π 1 h 3 2 h d p 3 1 h 2 d p 3 where a h j is the hamaker constant and d p m is the thickness of a montmorillonite quasicrystal according to these theories the pressure generated by the electrical double layer under osmotic conditions is a function of the montmorillonite inter quasicrystal distance the concentration and valence of the electrolyte cations while the van der waals force is a function of the montmorillonite inter quasicrystal distance only the pressure can be considered a constant value e g the atmospheric pressure thus eq 2 can be regarded as the relationship between the montmorillonite inter quasicrystal distance and the concentration and valence of the electrolyte cations in solution zhang et al 1995 the premise of this relationship is that montmorillonite is in the osmotic swelling stage in view of the saturation condition in this study the montmorillonite is considered to be in full osmotic swelling state 2 2 aggregation of montmorillonite particles the structure of the condensed matter formed by collision has an exponential relationship between its one dimensional size r m and effective volume v m3 a grain of size r consisting of n p primary particles satisfies the following equation 6 v v 0 r r 0 d f n p where v 0 m3 and r 0 m represent the volume and the effective size of a single primary particle respectively and d f is the fractal dimension compared with the bulk solution the movement of water molecules between the montmorillonite layers is restricted thus the effective size of a montmorillonite primary particle r 0 can be considered the sum of the inter particle distance i e inter quasicrystal and the thickness of a particle that is 7 r 0 d p h the frequency of collision β i j m3 s among particles and grains in free molecule regime can be written as hidy and brock 1965 8 β i j 8 π k t m i 8 π k t m j 1 2 σ i j where m i k g a n d m j k g are the mass of particles or grains i and j participating in the collision σ i j m 2 r i r j 2 is the collision cross section and k is bolzmann constant this formula suggests the frequency of collision is related to the size of particles grains combining the fractal nature of particles grains and the frequency of collision matsoukas and friedlander 1991 derived the relationship between the average grain size r m and the size of primary particles after long equilibration time 9 r t r 0 q where t m1 q and q are constants and the latter is determined by 10 q d f 3 d f 4 3 since the fractal dimension is less than 3 the parameter q must be negative which means the average size of grains is negatively correlated with montmorillonite primary particle size the distribution of grain size usually follows the log normal distribution 11 f r 1 r σ 2 π e ln r μ 2 σ 2 2 where μ m and σ are expectation and deviation of the natural logarithm of grain size respectively gmachowski 2001 studied the aggregation kinetics and the grain size distribution from the perspective of entropy and deduced that when the aggregation mechanism remains unchanged the variance of the grain size distribution is a constant determined by the fractal dimension considering that the present study focuses on the hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite as influenced by electrolyte cations it can be assumed that the aggregation mechanism remains unchanged for samples this will also be verified by experimental data 2 3 grain size distribution and hydraulic conductivity the hydraulic conductivity of a porous material is affected by many factors among which the grain size distribution is decisive many studies have directly established the relationships between a specific characteristic size of grains and the hydraulic conductivity masch and denny 1966 shepherd 1989 sperry and peirce 1995 venkataraman and rao 1998 shepherd 1989 pointed out that the power law can better describe the relationship between the hydraulic conductivity and the grain size hazen proposed a formula that has been used for several decades using the diameter of the 10 percentile grain size of a material d 10 m to predict the hydraulic conductivity norrish 1954 12 k c d 10 2 where k m s is the hydraulic conductivity and c 1 m s is a constant mbonimpa et al 2002 summarized a total of 221 results of the relationships between hydraulic conductivity and grain size from several papers the range of hydraulic conductivity was from 10 8 to 103 cm s based on these data if only the grain size is considered the hydraulic conductivity can be considered to be proportional to d 10 2 we assume that in the montmorillonite aggregation system the grain size distribution of montmorillonite conforms to the log normal distribution for the homoionic na montmorillonite and ca montmorillonite systems we further assume that the aggregation mechanism does not change during the aggregation i e constant σ the p quantile of the log normal distribution q p μ σ is 13 q p μ σ e μ 2 σ e r f 1 2 p 1 where e r f 1 is the reverse function of error function and the mean grain size r is 14 r e μ σ 2 2 with p 10 in eq 13 the ratio of d 10 to r is thus a constant as follows 15 d 10 r e 2 σ e r f 1 0 8 σ 2 2 the relationship between the hydraulic conductivity and the mean grain size can thus be written as 16 k c r 2 where c 1 m s c e 2 2 σ e r f 1 0 8 σ 2 is a constant with a unit of 1 m s 2 4 theoretical model for hydraulic conductivity in relation to the concentration and valence of electrolyte cations there exists a step wise pathway mechanistically that defines the hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite fig 1 that is the concentration and valence of electrolyte cations in solution controls the size of primary particles of montmorillonite subsequently regulates its grain size distribution and finally determines its hydraulic conductivity by combining these three relationships the mathematical model between the hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite and the electrolyte cations in solution can be developed first by substituting eq 9 for r in eq 16 the relationship between the primary particle size and the hydraulic conductivity can be written as 17 k k 1 r 0 k 2 now substitute eq 7 for r 0 in eq 17 and rearrange 18 h 1 k 1 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 d p c 1 k c 2 d p where k 1 m 1 2 q s t 2 c k 2 2 q c 1 k 1 1 k 2 and c 2 1 k 2 are constants according to the above derivation both c 1 and c 2 are related to d f besides c 1 is also related to the hazen s coefficient which is determined by montmorillonite itself to subsequently develop the theoretical model between the hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite and the concentration and valence of electrolyte cations in solution we obtain the following implicit function f 2 k z c i e the mathematical model relating hydraulic conductivity k to the concentration c and valence z of cation by solving h in eqs 2 5 and substituting for h in eq 18 19 f 2 k z c p d d l k z c p v d w k p 0 where 19 1 p d d

and the concentration and valence of electrolyte cations in solution it can be used to predict the hydraulic conductivity of na montmorillonite and ca montmorillonite from the concentration and valence of respective electrolytes 3 materials and methods 3 1 materials analytical grade sodium chloride calcium chloride barium chloride magnesium sulfate and nitric acid were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd two montmorillonite samples were mined in henan province homoionic na and ca montmorillonite were prepared and characterized for their cecs egme surface areas and bet surface areas supplementary material a steel column 50 46 mm i d 75 mm h was used to measure the hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite 3 2 permeability test the permeability test was conducted in triplicate three g of na montmorillonite was respectively added to a series of 1 l nacl solutions with six different concentrations 60 600 mmol l the suspensions were vigorously stirred for 1 day to ensure thorough mixing and reaching equilibrium the samples were centrifuged at 4302 g for 30 min thermo fisher scientific and 850 ml of each supernatant was collected for further use to measure the hydraulic conductivity and grain size distribution of montmorillonite the montmorillonite was vigorously stirred for one day to be re suspended in the remaining volume of the supernatant 150 ml the suspension was then poured into a column with a filter paper at the bottom the column was completely filled and the montmorillonite was allowed to be settled overnight the solution then began to leach out from the bottom of the column the volume of solution collected and the corresponding time were recorded after the monitored leaching speed became invariable the solution in the column was kept full during the leaching by constant supplementation with the collected supernatant the height of the precipitation in the column was measured after the measurement of volume and time and the water head was the height of the column i e 75 mm hydraulic conductivity was determined according to the darcy s law the na montmorillonite precipitation was then collected and re suspended in the collected supernatant in a 50 ml centrifuge tube the collected na montmorillonite was respectively named na1 na6 in the increasing order of nacl concentrations for further characterization the concentration of nacl in the supernatant was measured by agilent 720 es icp and the ph of the supernatant was recorded by a mettler toledo seven compact ph meter similarly 6 g of ca montmorillonite were added to a series of cacl2 solutions with seven different concentrations 5 180 mmol l and the remaining procedures were the same as the na montmorillonite measurement the collected ca montmorillonite was named respectively ca1 ca7 in the increasing order of cacl2 concentrations 3 3 grain size distribution of montmorillonite a portion of montmorillonite suspension collected from permeability test was used and the grain size distribution was measured by a mastersizer 3000 laser diffraction particle size analyzer to minimize the interference of agitation on the grain size a rotation speed of 2000 rpm the lowest of the device was chosen and supersonication was deactivated 4 results and discussion 4 1 characterization of montmorillonite the equilibrium concentrations and the ph of the electrolyte solutions in the permeability test the cecs the bet and egme surface areas of na and ca montmorillonite are listed in tables s1 and s2 the egme surface areas were much larger than the bet areas due to the fact that egme with a polar nature can penetrate the inner surfaces of expandable clay minerals where most of the charges are located suits et al 2002 thus in this study which was conducted in water the egme surface area rather than the bet surface area was more suitable for further analysis the ionic strength provided by h was negligible as the concentrations of na and ca2 were more than 100 times higher than the concentration of h in the water from the egme surface areas 448 18 m2 g for na montmorillnoite and 520 50 m2 g for ca montmorillonite and cecs 0 77 0 03 mol kg for na montmorillonite and 1 12 0 03 mol kg for ca montmorillonite the surface charge densities of na montmorillonite and ca montmorillonite were calculated from respective s e g m e and cec 0 166 c m2 for na montmorillonite and 0 208 c m2 for ca montmorillonite 4 2 relationship between the inter quasicrystal distance and the valence and concentration of electrolyte cations when montmorillonite is in the osmotic expansion stage the spacing between the unit layers is large e g exceeding 20 å and the orientation of the unit layers is difficult to resolve therefore it is difficult to measure the montmorillonite interlayer spacing at this stage by conventional methods norrish 1954 shang et al 1995 instead the relationship between the montmorillonite inter quasicrystal distance and the concentration and valence of electrolyte cations can be theoretically established as the suspensions of na montmorillonite and ca montmorillonite were vigorously stirred for one day in sufficient volume of solution e g 25 ml h2o g montmorillonite before permeability test all the unit layers of montmorillonite were considered well dispersed in the suspension prior to free sedimentation the parameters needed for this calculation along with their values are alphabetically listed in table 1 fig 2 shows the relationships between the montmorillonite inter quasicrystal distance and the concentration of electrolyte cations the two curves calculated from eqs 2 to 5 it is seen that as the concentration of the electrolyte cations in solution increased the montmorillonite inter quasicrystal distance initially decreased rapidly and became slowly approaching a constant value this variation was greatly affected by the valence of cation when the concentrations of nacl and cacl2 were equal the inter quasicrystal distance of ca montmorillonite was much smaller than that of na montmorillonite the distance of ca montmorillonite reached the smallest at about 2 nm in 250 mmol l cacl2 solution by comparison the inter quasicrystal distance of na montmorillonite continued to further decrease in a comparatively faster rate with the concentration of nacl reaching 1 mol l norrish 1954 used a very cumbersome method to measure the montmorillonite inter quasicrystal distance and simply established a linear relationship between the distance and the reciprocal of the square root of the concentration of electrolyte cations although careful examination of the measurements found a small degree of convexity concave downward to make comparison the inter quasicrystal distance h is plotted versus 1 electrolyte concentration 0 5 i e c 0 5 in fig s1 both lines are only slightly concave downward convex and become more linear especially when the electrolyte concentration is greater than 10 mmol l the lower end this supports the rationality of these theoretical calculations of the inter quasicrystal distance note that the above calculations and discussion are proper only for the osmotic swelling stage the result may not be applicable to the crystalline swelling stage at which the repulsive force from the hydration of cations is in action we determined the basal spacings for all samples from xrd patterns fig s2 also plotted in fig 2 circle and triangle symbols they are much smaller than the calculated inter quasicrystal distances 4 3 average size and grain size distribution the grain size distributions of na and ca montmorillonite in different concentrations of nacl and cacl2 solutions are shown in fig 3 they essentially conform to a log normal distribution the average grain size r the expectation value μ and the standard deviation σ of the natural logarithm of size are calculated based on the measured results table s3 and table s4 the variance of grain size distribution is 0 223 0 043 for na montmorillonite and 0 199 0 007 for ca montmorillonite thus our assumption that the standard deviation is a constant is confirmed gmachowski 2001 the difference in the standard deviation of grain size distribution between na montmorillonite and ca montmorillonite may also represent the difference in the aggregation mechanism in addition it is obvious that the primary particle size of montmorillonite is negatively correlated with the average grain size which is also consistent with the inference of aggregation kinetics matsoukas and friedlander 1991 the relationships between the average grain size and the size of primary particles are shown in fig 4 according to the fitting results in table 2 b the fractal dimension of na montmorillonite is 1 7 and the fractal dimension of ca montmorillonite is 2 5 these data appear quite reasonable matsoukas and friedlander 1991 4 4 grain size distribution and hydraulic conductivity the hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite measured from permeability test is listed in tables s5 and s6 they ranged from about 2 10 6 cm s to 10 4 cm s for na montmorillonite and from 7 10 5 to 1 6 10 4 cm s for ca montmorillonite the hydraulic conductivity is plotted versus the square of the average grain size in fig 5 the two parameters showed good linear relationships for both homoionic montmorillonite as indicated by their correlation coefficients r2 in table 2c this confirms the dependency of hydraulic conductivity on average grain size of montmorillonite and the reliability of the theoretical eq 16 the slop c is 0 58 cm s mm2 for na montmorillonite and 10 3 cm s mm2 for ca montmorillonite the two slopes differ considerably in magnitude which may be related to the standard deviation of the grain size distribution due to the differences in valence of the two cations and in cecs of montmorillonite according to the hazen equation the slope c is a function of the hazen s coefficient which is determined by the nature of montmorillonite when two primary particles collide the divalent cation of ca2 can interact strongly with negatively charged quasicrystals at both sides thus electrically binding particles together with monovalent cation of na electrical repulsion instead of attraction comes in effect this may lead to differential collision processes for na and ca montmorillonite leading to grains of differential properties with differential standard deviations of their grain size distributions nevertheless it is the grain size distribution rather than a specific grain size that determines the hydraulic conductivity 4 5 theoretical model for hydraulic conductivity in relation to the concentration and valence of electrolyte cations to validate the model for the hydraulic conductivity of montmoeillonite as a function of the concentration and valence of electrolyte cations i e eq 19 we directly plot the measured hydraulic conductivity versus the concentration of electrolyte used for the measurement fig 6 circles the hydraulic conductivity increased as the electrolyte concentration increased as observed in many studies chen et al 2015 jo et al 2005 2001 shackelford et al 2000 shainberg et al 1981 there are two ways of model validation first we fit the experimental data to the model i e eq 19 and obtain the parameters c 1 and c 2 table 2d red lines in fig 6 the model is confirmed to be highly reliable as supported by the high correlation coefficients of 0 96 and above for the two montmorillonite samples and two cations used in the experiment second we make step wise fitting and calculations using three individual relationships table 2a c and by combining these relationships a through c table 2 obtain the parameters c 1 and c 2 table 2e blue lines in fig 6 these blue lines also adequately describe the measured hydraulic conductivity the shapes of these curves differ being concave upward for na montmorillonite and downward for ca montmorillonite most outstandingly the curves of the developed model are in satisfactory agreement with the measured hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite 5 conclusions a theoretical mathematical model linking the hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite with the concentration and valence of electrolyte cations in solution is developed and validated by direct measurements of the surface charge density the grain size distribution and the hydraulic conductivity of na and ca montmorillonite in respective solutions the model is based on three relationships between the concentration and valence of electrolyte in solution and the montmorillonite inter quasicrystal distance between the primary particle size and the grain size distribution as well as between the grain size distribution and the hydraulic conductivity it is mechanistically understood that cations in solutions determine the hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite via controlling the inter quasicrystal distance and hence the primary particle size thereby regulating the grain size distribution the hydraulic conductivity measured in deionized water or tap water often deviates from the real world condition in soil solution and groundwater where many cations are coexisting this work is among the first to report on the development of theoretical mathematical models for the hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite as influenced by cations in solution it represents a large step forward in improving our prediction of the hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite in relation to environmental conditions further work is needed for more complex environmental media such as soils and aquifers such theoretical models of predicting hydraulic conductivity are in great need for implementing more

based on the collision frequency of particles and grains suspended in liquid or gas and ruled by central limit theorem albarran et al 2014 and and pratsinis 2007 gmachowski 2002 2001 matsoukas and friedlander 1991 to avoid the complex situation of the arrangement of particles in a grain the fractal structure of a grain is usually used to link the size between particles and grains jullien 1990 hydraulic conductivity depends on the size of pores and how these pores are distributed and connected which is challenging to determine many studies have chosen to use grain size distribution to predict hydraulic conductivity arya et al 1999 brooks 1964 durner 1994 hwang and powers 2003 masch and denny 1966 shepherd 1989 sperry and peirce 1995 venkataraman and rao 1998 vogel and roth 1998 extensive studies on the microstructure and macroscopic properties e g hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite discovered the influence of electrolyte solution unfortunately existing research is relatively independent and does not successfully connect them with each other there is almost no theoretical relationship quantitatively describing or predicting the influence of electrolyte solution on the hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite this study focused on montmorillonite in a saturated state in an attempt to develop a theoretical mathematical model to link the hydraulic conductivity with the electrolyte cations in solution to achieve this goal the relationship between the concentration and valence of electrolyte cations in solution and the distance between the montmorillonite quasicrystals was derived at the micro level the grain size distribution and the hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite under the same conditions were determined at the macro level by utilizing the aggregation collision kinetics the microstructure and macrostructure of montmorillonite were connected to quantify the influence of electrolyte cations on the hydraulic conductivity to validate the model on a broad basis two montmorillonite samples with differential cecs and two electrolytes of different cation valency were used 2 theoretical considerations the following theoretical analyses are based on a step by step pathway of linking hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite with electrolyte solution as drawn in fig 1 these analyses rely on the diffuse electrical double layer and dlvo theories the aggregation kinetics and the hazen equation an alphabetical list of notations with their units used in model development is provided in supplementary material 2 1 dependence of inter quasicrystal distance on the concentration and valence of electrolyte cations in solution the swelling pressure p pa of montmorillonite based materials arises from repulsion due to overlap of electrical double layers p d d l p a and attraction of van der waals p v d w p a it can be written as 1 p p d d l h z c p v d w h where h m is inter quasicrystal distance z is the valence of cation and c mol m3 is the concentration of electrolyte eq 1 indicates that inter quasicrystal distance h is an implicit function f 1 h z c of the concentration and valence of electrolyte cation as follows 2 f 1 h z c p d d l h z c p v d w h p 0 p d d l in eq 2 i e the pressure contributed by the overlap of electrical double layers can be written as follows based on the gouy chapman theory leermakers et al 2005 3 p d d l 2 c r t cosh y m 1 where r j k mol is gas constant t k is temperature and y m is the scaled potential at the mid point as indicated by superscript m between the montmorillonite layers liu and neretnieks 2008 derived the expression of y m by assuming the conservation of charge and moving two charged plates from infinity to a distance of h 4 sinh y m 2 sinh y m 4 κ h sinh y h 2 in this formula y m and y h are the scaled potentials of an isolated plate at distances of h 2 and h respectively they have the following expressions 4 1 y m 4 tanh 1 tanh y 0 4 e κ h 2 4 2 y h 4 tanh 1 tanh y 0 4 e κ h 4 3 y 0 2 sinh 1 z f σ 0 2 ε 0 ε r κ r t 4 4 κ 2 f 2 c z 2 ε 0 ε r r t 1 2 where f c mol ε 0 f m ε r κ 1 m and σ 0 c m2 represent the faraday constant vacuum permittivity the relative dielectric constant of water reciprocal of the debye length and the surface charge density respectively p v d w in eq 2 i e the pressure from van der waals force follows the following komine and ogata 1996 5 p v d w a h 6 π 1 h 3 2 h d p 3 1 h 2 d p 3 where a h j is the hamaker constant and d p m is the thickness of a montmorillonite quasicrystal according to these theories the pressure generated by the electrical double layer under osmotic conditions is a function of the montmorillonite inter quasicrystal distance the concentration and valence of the electrolyte cations while the van der waals force is a function of the montmorillonite inter quasicrystal distance only the pressure can be considered a constant value e g the atmospheric pressure thus eq 2 can be regarded as the relationship between the montmorillonite inter quasicrystal distance and the concentration and valence of the electrolyte cations in solution zhang et al 1995 the premise of this relationship is that montmorillonite is in the osmotic swelling stage in view of the saturation condition in this study the montmorillonite is considered to be in full osmotic swelling state 2 2 aggregation of montmorillonite particles the structure of the condensed matter formed by collision has an exponential relationship between its one dimensional size r m and effective volume v m3 a grain of size r consisting of n p primary particles satisfies the following equation 6 v v 0 r r 0 d f n p where v 0 m3 and r 0 m represent the volume and the effective size of a single primary particle respectively and d f is the fractal dimension compared with the bulk solution the movement of water molecules between the montmorillonite layers is restricted thus the effective size of a montmorillonite primary particle r 0 can be considered the sum of the inter particle distance i e inter quasicrystal and the thickness of a particle that is 7 r 0 d p h the frequency of collision β i j m3 s among particles and grains in free molecule regime can be written as hidy and brock 1965 8 β i j 8 π k t m i 8 π k t m j 1 2 σ i j where m i k g a n d m j k g are the mass of particles or grains i and j participating in the collision σ i j m 2 r i r j 2 is the collision cross section and k is bolzmann constant this formula suggests the frequency of collision is related to the size of particles grains combining the fractal nature of particles grains and the frequency of collision matsoukas and friedlander 1991 derived the relationship between the average grain size r m and the size of primary particles after long equilibration time 9 r t r 0 q where t m1 q and q are constants and the latter is determined by 10 q d f 3 d f 4 3 since the fractal dimension is less than 3 the parameter q must be negative which means the average size of grains is negatively correlated with montmorillonite primary particle size the distribution of grain size usually follows the log normal distribution 11 f r 1 r σ 2 π e ln r μ 2 σ 2 2 where μ m and σ are expectation and deviation of the natural logarithm of grain size respectively gmachowski 2001 studied the aggregation kinetics and the grain size distribution from the perspective of entropy and deduced that when the aggregation mechanism remains unchanged the variance of the grain size distribution is a constant determined by the fractal dimension considering that the present study focuses on the hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite as influenced by electrolyte cations it can be assumed that the aggregation mechanism remains unchanged for samples this will also be verified by experimental data 2 3 grain size distribution and hydraulic conductivity the hydraulic conductivity of a porous material is affected by many factors among which the grain size distribution is decisive many studies have directly established the relationships between a specific characteristic size of grains and the hydraulic conductivity masch and denny 1966 shepherd 1989 sperry and peirce 1995 venkataraman and rao 1998 shepherd 1989 pointed out that the power law can better describe the relationship between the hydraulic conductivity and the grain size hazen proposed a formula that has been used for several decades using the diameter of the 10 percentile grain size of a material d 10 m to predict the hydraulic conductivity norrish 1954 12 k c d 10 2 where k m s is the hydraulic conductivity and c 1 m s is a constant mbonimpa et al 2002 summarized a total of 221 results of the relationships between hydraulic conductivity and grain size from several papers the range of hydraulic conductivity was from 10 8 to 103 cm s based on these data if only the grain size is considered the hydraulic conductivity can be considered to be proportional to d 10 2 we assume that in the montmorillonite aggregation system the grain size distribution of montmorillonite conforms to the log normal distribution for the homoionic na montmorillonite and ca montmorillonite systems we further assume that the aggregation mechanism does not change during the aggregation i e constant σ the p quantile of the log normal distribution q p μ σ is 13 q p μ σ e μ 2 σ e r f 1 2 p 1 where e r f 1 is the reverse function of error function and the mean grain size r is 14 r e μ σ 2 2 with p 10 in eq 13 the ratio of d 10 to r is thus a constant as follows 15 d 10 r e 2 σ e r f 1 0 8 σ 2 2 the relationship between the hydraulic conductivity and the mean grain size can thus be written as 16 k c r 2 where c 1 m s c e 2 2 σ e r f 1 0 8 σ 2 is a constant with a unit of 1 m s 2 4 theoretical model for hydraulic conductivity in relation to the concentration and valence of electrolyte cations there exists a step wise pathway mechanistically that defines the hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite fig 1 that is the concentration and valence of electrolyte cations in solution controls the size of primary particles of montmorillonite subsequently regulates its grain size distribution and finally determines its hydraulic conductivity by combining these three relationships the mathematical model between the hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite and the electrolyte cations in solution can be developed first by substituting eq 9 for r in eq 16 the relationship between the primary particle size and the hydraulic conductivity can be written as 17 k k 1 r 0 k 2 now substitute eq 7 for r 0 in eq 17 and rearrange 18 h 1 k 1 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 d p c 1 k c 2 d p where k 1 m 1 2 q s t 2 c k 2 2 q c 1 k 1 1 k 2 and c 2 1 k 2 are constants according to the above derivation both c 1 and c 2 are related to d f besides c 1 is also related to the hazen s coefficient which is determined by montmorillonite itself to subsequently develop the theoretical model between the hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite and the concentration and valence of electrolyte cations in solution we obtain the following implicit function f 2 k z c i e the mathematical model relating hydraulic conductivity k to the concentration c and valence z of cation by solving h in eqs 2 5 and substituting for h in eq 18 19 f 2 k z c p d d l k z c p v d w k p 0 where 19 1 p d d

and the concentration and valence of electrolyte cations in solution it can be used to predict the hydraulic conductivity of na montmorillonite and ca montmorillonite from the concentration and valence of respective electrolytes 3 materials and methods 3 1 materials analytical grade sodium chloride calcium chloride barium chloride magnesium sulfate and nitric acid were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd two montmorillonite samples were mined in henan province homoionic na and ca montmorillonite were prepared and characterized for their cecs egme surface areas and bet surface areas supplementary material a steel column 50 46 mm i d 75 mm h was used to measure the hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite 3 2 permeability test the permeability test was conducted in triplicate three g of na montmorillonite was respectively added to a series of 1 l nacl solutions with six different concentrations 60 600 mmol l the suspensions were vigorously stirred for 1 day to ensure thorough mixing and reaching equilibrium the samples were centrifuged at 4302 g for 30 min thermo fisher scientific and 850 ml of each supernatant was collected for further use to measure the hydraulic conductivity and grain size distribution of montmorillonite the montmorillonite was vigorously stirred for one day to be re suspended in the remaining volume of the supernatant 150 ml the suspension was then poured into a column with a filter paper at the bottom the column was completely filled and the montmorillonite was allowed to be settled overnight the solution then began to leach out from the bottom of the column the volume of solution collected and the corresponding time were recorded after the monitored leaching speed became invariable the solution in the column was kept full during the leaching by constant supplementation with the collected supernatant the height of the precipitation in the column was measured after the measurement of volume and time and the water head was the height of the column i e 75 mm hydraulic conductivity was determined according to the darcy s law the na montmorillonite precipitation was then collected and re suspended in the collected supernatant in a 50 ml centrifuge tube the collected na montmorillonite was respectively named na1 na6 in the increasing order of nacl concentrations for further characterization the concentration of nacl in the supernatant was measured by agilent 720 es icp and the ph of the supernatant was recorded by a mettler toledo seven compact ph meter similarly 6 g of ca montmorillonite were added to a series of cacl2 solutions with seven different concentrations 5 180 mmol l and the remaining procedures were the same as the na montmorillonite measurement the collected ca montmorillonite was named respectively ca1 ca7 in the increasing order of cacl2 concentrations 3 3 grain size distribution of montmorillonite a portion of montmorillonite suspension collected from permeability test was used and the grain size distribution was measured by a mastersizer 3000 laser diffraction particle size analyzer to minimize the interference of agitation on the grain size a rotation speed of 2000 rpm the lowest of the device was chosen and supersonication was deactivated 4 results and discussion 4 1 characterization of montmorillonite the equilibrium concentrations and the ph of the electrolyte solutions in the permeability test the cecs the bet and egme surface areas of na and ca montmorillonite are listed in tables s1 and s2 the egme surface areas were much larger than the bet areas due to the fact that egme with a polar nature can penetrate the inner surfaces of expandable clay minerals where most of the charges are located suits et al 2002 thus in this study which was conducted in water the egme surface area rather than the bet surface area was more suitable for further analysis the ionic strength provided by h was negligible as the concentrations of na and ca2 were more than 100 times higher than the concentration of h in the water from the egme surface areas 448 18 m2 g for na montmorillnoite and 520 50 m2 g for ca montmorillonite and cecs 0 77 0 03 mol kg for na montmorillonite and 1 12 0 03 mol kg for ca montmorillonite the surface charge densities of na montmorillonite and ca montmorillonite were calculated from respective s e g m e and cec 0 166 c m2 for na montmorillonite and 0 208 c m2 for ca montmorillonite 4 2 relationship between the inter quasicrystal distance and the valence and concentration of electrolyte cations when montmorillonite is in the osmotic expansion stage the spacing between the unit layers is large e g exceeding 20 å and the orientation of the unit layers is difficult to resolve therefore it is difficult to measure the montmorillonite interlayer spacing at this stage by conventional methods norrish 1954 shang et al 1995 instead the relationship between the montmorillonite inter quasicrystal distance and the concentration and valence of electrolyte cations can be theoretically established as the suspensions of na montmorillonite and ca montmorillonite were vigorously stirred for one day in sufficient volume of solution e g 25 ml h2o g montmorillonite before permeability test all the unit layers of montmorillonite were considered well dispersed in the suspension prior to free sedimentation the parameters needed for this calculation along with their values are alphabetically listed in table 1 fig 2 shows the relationships between the montmorillonite inter quasicrystal distance and the concentration of electrolyte cations the two curves calculated from eqs 2 to 5 it is seen that as the concentration of the electrolyte cations in solution increased the montmorillonite inter quasicrystal distance initially decreased rapidly and became slowly approaching a constant value this variation was greatly affected by the valence of cation when the concentrations of nacl and cacl2 were equal the inter quasicrystal distance of ca montmorillonite was much smaller than that of na montmorillonite the distance of ca montmorillonite reached the smallest at about 2 nm in 250 mmol l cacl2 solution by comparison the inter quasicrystal distance of na montmorillonite continued to further decrease in a comparatively faster rate with the concentration of nacl reaching 1 mol l norrish 1954 used a very cumbersome method to measure the montmorillonite inter quasicrystal distance and simply established a linear relationship between the distance and the reciprocal of the square root of the concentration of electrolyte cations although careful examination of the measurements found a small degree of convexity concave downward to make comparison the inter quasicrystal distance h is plotted versus 1 electrolyte concentration 0 5 i e c 0 5 in fig s1 both lines are only slightly concave downward convex and become more linear especially when the electrolyte concentration is greater than 10 mmol l the lower end this supports the rationality of these theoretical calculations of the inter quasicrystal distance note that the above calculations and discussion are proper only for the osmotic swelling stage the result may not be applicable to the crystalline swelling stage at which the repulsive force from the hydration of cations is in action we determined the basal spacings for all samples from xrd patterns fig s2 also plotted in fig 2 circle and triangle symbols they are much smaller than the calculated inter quasicrystal distances 4 3 average size and grain size distribution the grain size distributions of na and ca montmorillonite in different concentrations of nacl and cacl2 solutions are shown in fig 3 they essentially conform to a log normal distribution the average grain size r the expectation value μ and the standard deviation σ of the natural logarithm of size are calculated based on the measured results table s3 and table s4 the variance of grain size distribution is 0 223 0 043 for na montmorillonite and 0 199 0 007 for ca montmorillonite thus our assumption that the standard deviation is a constant is confirmed gmachowski 2001 the difference in the standard deviation of grain size distribution between na montmorillonite and ca montmorillonite may also represent the difference in the aggregation mechanism in addition it is obvious that the primary particle size of montmorillonite is negatively correlated with the average grain size which is also consistent with the inference of aggregation kinetics matsoukas and friedlander 1991 the relationships between the average grain size and the size of primary particles are shown in fig 4 according to the fitting results in table 2 b the fractal dimension of na montmorillonite is 1 7 and the fractal dimension of ca montmorillonite is 2 5 these data appear quite reasonable matsoukas and friedlander 1991 4 4 grain size distribution and hydraulic conductivity the hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite measured from permeability test is listed in tables s5 and s6 they ranged from about 2 10 6 cm s to 10 4 cm s for na montmorillonite and from 7 10 5 to 1 6 10 4 cm s for ca montmorillonite the hydraulic conductivity is plotted versus the square of the average grain size in fig 5 the two parameters showed good linear relationships for both homoionic montmorillonite as indicated by their correlation coefficients r2 in table 2c this confirms the dependency of hydraulic conductivity on average grain size of montmorillonite and the reliability of the theoretical eq 16 the slop c is 0 58 cm s mm2 for na montmorillonite and 10 3 cm s mm2 for ca montmorillonite the two slopes differ considerably in magnitude which may be related to the standard deviation of the grain size distribution due to the differences in valence of the two cations and in cecs of montmorillonite according to the hazen equation the slope c is a function of the hazen s coefficient which is determined by the nature of montmorillonite when two primary particles collide the divalent cation of ca2 can interact strongly with negatively charged quasicrystals at both sides thus electrically binding particles together with monovalent cation of na electrical repulsion instead of attraction comes in effect this may lead to differential collision processes for na and ca montmorillonite leading to grains of differential properties with differential standard deviations of their grain size distributions nevertheless it is the grain size distribution rather than a specific grain size that determines the hydraulic conductivity 4 5 theoretical model for hydraulic conductivity in relation to the concentration and valence of electrolyte cations to validate the model for the hydraulic conductivity of montmoeillonite as a function of the concentration and valence of electrolyte cations i e eq 19 we directly plot the measured hydraulic conductivity versus the concentration of electrolyte used for the measurement fig 6 circles the hydraulic conductivity increased as the electrolyte concentration increased as observed in many studies chen et al 2015 jo et al 2005 2001 shackelford et al 2000 shainberg et al 1981 there are two ways of model validation first we fit the experimental data to the model i e eq 19 and obtain the parameters c 1 and c 2 table 2d red lines in fig 6 the model is confirmed to be highly reliable as supported by the high correlation coefficients of 0 96 and above for the two montmorillonite samples and two cations used in the experiment second we make step wise fitting and calculations using three individual relationships table 2a c and by combining these relationships a through c table 2 obtain the parameters c 1 and c 2 table 2e blue lines in fig 6 these blue lines also adequately describe the measured hydraulic conductivity the shapes of these curves differ being concave upward for na montmorillonite and downward for ca montmorillonite most outstandingly the curves of the developed model are in satisfactory agreement with the measured hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite 5 conclusions a theoretical mathematical model linking the hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite with the concentration and valence of electrolyte cations in solution is developed and validated by direct measurements of the surface charge density the grain size distribution and the hydraulic conductivity of na and ca montmorillonite in respective solutions the model is based on three relationships between the concentration and valence of electrolyte in solution and the montmorillonite inter quasicrystal distance between the primary particle size and the grain size distribution as well as between the grain size distribution and the hydraulic conductivity it is mechanistically understood that cations in solutions determine the hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite via controlling the inter quasicrystal distance and hence the primary particle size thereby regulating the grain size distribution the hydraulic conductivity measured in deionized water or tap water often deviates from the real world condition in soil solution and groundwater where many cations are coexisting this work is among the first to report on the development of theoretical mathematical models for the hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite as influenced by cations in solution it represents a large step forward in improving our prediction of the hydraulic conductivity of montmorillonite in relation to environmental conditions further work is needed for more complex environmental media such as soils and aquifers such theoretical models of predicting hydraulic conductivity are in great need for implementing more

4391,the complexity of karst groundwater flow modelling is reflected by the amount of simulation approaches the goal of the karst modelling challenge kmc is comparing different approaches on one single system using the same data set thirteen teams with different computational models for simulating discharge variations at karst springs have applied their respective models on one single data set coming from the milandre karst hydrogeological system mkhs the approaches include neural networks reservoir models semi distributed models and fully distributed groundwater models four and a half years of hourly or daily meteorological input and hourly discharge data were provided for model calibration the validation comprised forecasting one year of discharge without the observed discharge data the model performance was evaluated using the volume conservation nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the kling gupta efficiency kge applied on the total discharge and individual flow components as a result the comparison of model performances is a challenging task due to the differences in the model architecture but also required time steps some of the models require aggregated daily steps while others could be run using hourly data which provided some interesting differences depending on how the data was transformed the use of instantaneous data e g value at noon produces less bias that averaging hourly data over one day the transformation of hourly into daily data produces a decrease of nash and kge of 0 05 to 0 08 i e from 1 to 0 93 the resulting simulations forecasted values for year 2016 produced kges ranging between 0 83 and 0 37 0 83 to 0 24 for nse although the simulations matched the monitored flows reasonably well most models struggled to simulate baseflow conditions accurately in general the models that performed the best for this exercise were the global ones gardenia and varkarst with a limited number of parameters which can be calibrated using automatic calibration procedures the neural network models also showed a fair potential with one providing reasonable results despite the relatively short dataset available for warming up 4 5 years semi and fully distributed models also suggested that with some more effort they could perform well the accuracy of model predictions does not seem to increase by using models with more than 9 12 calibration parameters an evaluation of the relative errors between the forecasted and the observed values revealed that for most models 50 of the forecasted values contained more than 50 of difference against the observed discharge rate with 25 having a difference larger than 100 a significant part of the poorly forecasted values corresponded to base flow which was surprising given that as base flow is generally much easier to predict than peak flow hence this shows that modelling approaches and criteria for the calibration are too oriented towards peak flow sections of the hydrographs and that improvements could be gained by more focus on the base flow keywords modelling karst comparison efficiency criteria recharge baseflow 1 introduction 1 1 idea the aim of the modelling challenge was to invite research teams from all over the world to compare their modelling approaches and tools by applying them on the same data set a common evaluation method had to be defined and results from each team have been analyzed with the same criteria in this way all results could be directly compared various objective functions various ways to compute the difference between the forecasted and the observed time series have been tested with three subsequently used for the final comparison 1 2 problem definition in order to start with a rather simple question step 1 it was decided to focus on the hydrological behavior of karst hydrogeological systems khs i e the relationship between parameters controlling the input of water into karst mainly precipitation and temperature and the discharge rate of karst springs at the output of the system fig 1 the question to be solved by the respective teams is to forecast as precisely as possible the discharge rates at the karst outlet from the meteorological input data it should be noted that further steps are foreseen with the simulation of the flow and head distribution in space and time step 2 and the simulation of transport processes step 3 however the evaluation for this step 1 of the challenge does not take into account whether the models will be able to address the objectives of the further steps or not in this paper the word model refers to approaches and corresponding numerical tools used by the respective teams for their modelling exercise the word simulation is used to name the results of the modelling work 1 3 flow through a karst massif as outlined in most text books e g ford and williams 1989 karst massifs are characterized by a specific geomorphology and hydrology fig 1 karst landforms are due to the dissolution of the rock in precipitation water surface landforms such as karrenfields dolines and swallowholes are produced by water infiltration into the rock vertical shafts caves vadose or phreatic and large springs are related to the flowthrough and output of water from a hydrological point of view precipitation rain and snowmelt infiltrates through vegetation cover and soils into the top layer of the rock which is more or less weathered epikarst one part of precipitation waters returns back to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration in some cases surface water may form a small stream or even a river which is swallowed into concentrated location swallow hole if the stream drains a non karstic area this part of the catchment will be called allogenic epikarst distributes water partially towards vertical shafts leading the liquid directly down to the phreatic zone another part of water is trapped at the bottom of the epikarst and seeps slowly downwards through cracks and joints at some points water is drained again by the network of karst channels which efficiently drains the rock mass and leads water at the outlet of the karst system the karst spring mangin 1975 williams 1983 smart and friederich 1986 the volume of water stored in fissures is significant compared to that stored in karst channels király 1975 drogue 1980 smart and hobbs 1986 the relationship between recharge and discharge at springs seems quite direct in most karst systems as rain events are followed by clear peaks of discharge rates at karst springs usually within a few hours to days the response is therefore fairly similar to that usually observed in surface hydrology the degree of diffuse flow in the rock matrix compared to concentrated flow in conduits as well as the amount of concentrated recharge into swallow holes vs diffuse recharge through soils and epikarst may be significantly different depending on rock characteristics and on geomorphological and climatological contexts various models have been developed to simulate the functional relationship between precipitation and discharge peaks some of them include physical processes taking place in each subsystem traversed by water other ones simplify the nature into linear subsystems and other ones just consider the mathematical relationship between an input signal and an output one the aim of step 1 of the karst modelling challenge is to compare these approaches and their capability to simulate a hydrograph from a precipitation times series 1 4 short outlook on groundwater flow modelling in karst the analysis of hydrographs started mainly after the publication of maillet 1905 however continuous monitoring of karst springs really started only since the 1950s for the analysis of karst springs the first models occurred along the 1960s schoeller 1962 forkasiewicz and paloc 1967 castany 1968 brown 1970 1973 mangin 1970 1975 chemin 1974 bezes 1976 milanovic 1976 atkinson 1977 dreiss 1982 1983 dodge 1983 bonacci 1987 ford and williams 1989 early on two components were recognized one explaining the quick and intense response of spring discharge rates to precipitations and the other explaining the slow decrease of discharge rates recession through long periods of time without recharge events several conceptual ideas were developed through various types of mathematical models which can be grouped into three large families teutsch and sauter 1991 kovács and sauter 2007 ghasemizadeh 2012 fiorillo 2014 1 data driven or black box models including reservoir non parametric transfer functions 2 hydrogeological models enclosing matrix flow with or without conduits 3 pipe flow models based on the hydraulics of flow in conduits 1 4 1 data driven or black box models in these models the system is only considered as a black box or a combination of black boxes each box transforming an input signal inflow into an output one outflow the transformation is based on a purely mathematical function without considering physical processes controlling flow in the underground or by strongly simplifying them dewandel et al 2003 fiorillo 2014 the simplest model of this type would be a single box model taking the total precipitation as input and transforming it into a discharge time series the classical unitary hydrograph model assuming a single linear transfer function kernel as first introduced first by sherman 1932 was tested on karst systems it quickly turned out that khs are neither linear nor steady and that such a simple model cannot describe karst aquifers in a meaningful way thus more sophisticated schemes coupling several kernels were necessary to fit observed data somehow dreiss 1982 neural networks are the most recent developments of this category of models another category of lumped models was attempted by various authors using cascading and parallel reservoirs forkasiewicz and paloc 1967 bezes 1976 halihan and wicks 1998 usually one reservoir simulates the quick flow component and the others the slower component of khs a new parameter then occurred i e the distribution of recharge into the respective components the best results were obtained with a combination of three to five reservoirs some of them being partially emptied by evapotranspiration this approach led to rather precise simulation results e g long 2009 in most cases input parameters are not distributed i e each reservoir is supposed to expand over the whole size of the catchment area in fact this approach can also be distributed in space and may take into account some spatial differences of the aquifer characteristics in the respective parts of the catchment area e g bittner et al 2018 with three to five reservoirs distributed in tens or hundreds of zones the number of parameters becomes very high making it difficult to calibrate the models thanks to automatic calibration procedures this task can now be achieved with a reasonable effort pianosi et al 2016 mazzilli et al 2017 1 4 2 hydrogeological models fully distributed models darcy 1856 empirically described the mathematical relationship between groundwater gradients head differences and groundwater flow quantity this was in fact the first groundwater flow model which was one dimensional and steady state analytical solutions for some typical geometries and boundary conditions were developed in the 1970s the development of computers enabled equations to be solved numerically making it possible to compute flow across a much wider range of situations e g bredehoeft and pinder 1970 application of this approach to karst was first attempted in the mid 1970s király and morel 1976 but it quickly became obvious that khs cannot easily be modelled using this approach as the simulation of quick and intense flood events as well as a sustained base flow as observed in most karst springs proved challenging modellers decided to introduce a network of conduits within a matrix with a low hydraulic conductivity with contrasts of 10 4 to 10 5 m s between matrix and conduits karst hydrographs could be simulated however the recharge process also had to be improved which was achieved by adding a layer with a high hydraulic conductivity at the top of the model epikarst able to absorb precipitation and distribute it to the conduits and matrix király et al 1995 given that the high contrast of hydraulic conductivities in spatial models can be quite challenging from a numerical point of view various solutions have been developed such as double continuum or double medium models teutsch and sauter 1991 two further improvements occurred later turbulent flow in conduits and partially saturated flow thierrien and sudicky 1996 annable and sudicky 1998 in these fully distributed models the number of parameters is very high with several values for each cell making calibration manual very time consuming and practically impossible parameter zonation and automatic calibration procedures improved this aspect doherty et al 1994 borghi et al 2016 however as the basic structure of the network needs to be defined first its geometry and topology is not usually adjusted during the calibration process though it may play a significant role in some situations kovács 2003 especially in the epiphreatic zone jeannin 2001 assuming the physics considered in the model is correct models can however reveal unrealistic structures and therefore can act as a very advanced tool that provides further insights enemark et al 2019 gill et al 2020 duran and gill 2021 these models belong to process based groundwater flow models according to the classification proposed by anderson et al 2015 1 4 3 pipe flow models semi distributed models pipe flow models only consider a network of conduits and neglect flow through the matrix or add it as a non spatialized entity the idea is not new as many original authors martel 1921 lièvre 1915 1940 trombe 1948 exploring karst with both a hydrogeological and a speleological perspective suggested flow in karst to be well described by equations of the pipe hydraulics these models also belong to process based models according to anderson et al 2015 but the main process considered is the hydraulics of flow through conduits in the phreatic and epihreatic zones turbulent and partially saturated darcy s flow is not or only marginally considered a few authors then used pipe models for analyzing their data white and white 1970 atkinson 1977 boegli 1980 lauritzen et al 1985 smart 1988 all of them demonstrated that flow is turbulent in most natural conduits caves at least during medium to high water conditions flow may be transitional or even laminar during very low flow conditions ford and williams 1989 and worthington 1991 have provided suggestions on values of friction factors in caves but these have only really been based on defined known conduit sections and none of these authors really attempted to simulate flow in a complex network of pipes jeannin and maréchal 1995 and jeannin 2001 assessed headlosses due to bends and changes in cross sections compared to those related to friction along walls it turns out that the latter are usually dominating and typical values could be assigned for natural conduits they also calculated the hydraulics of a network of natural conduits for modelling flow in the downstream part of the hölloch cave switzerland the role of epiphreatic conduits on the hydraulics and flow velocity was found to be significant for many khs this specific behavior cannot be simulated with the usual hydrogeological software packages for this reason pipe flow modelling e g the swmm software developed by us epa and other urban drainage software have increasingly been used in modeling karst hydrology campbell and sullivan 2002 peterson and wicks 2006 wu et al 2008 gill et al 2013 chen and goldscheider 2014 jeannin et al 2015 kaufmann et al 2016 malard 2018 vuilleumier et al 2019 morrissey et al 2020 schuler et al 2020 these models enable flow to be simulated in a complex network of pipes with various diameters roughness and cross sectional shapes if this approach is efficient to link observed heads and discharge rates it is not adequate to link precipitation to discharge hydrograph indeed a recharge model is always necessary for doing it in order to transform meteorological data into groundwater recharge 1 4 4 modelling recharge of karst hydrogeological systems khs recharge is defined here as the quantity of water infiltrating and flowing through the karst system it roughly corresponds to the total precipitation minus evapotranspiration and overland runoff bypassing karst in some circumstances snow and ice storage are also to be considered in recharge processes recharge strongly depends on evapotranspiration several formulae have been developed for assessing the potential evapotranspiration pet from meteorological parameters thornthwait 1948 penman 1948 turc 1961 these models provide an assessment of the quantity of water which would be evaporated or transpirated by vegetation if sufficient water were available in soils in reality during periods of low water soils become strongly unsaturated and plants may suffer a water deficit reducing their capacity of bringing water from the soil into the atmosphere real evapotranspiration ret is thus lower than pet in humid climates the difference may be negligible but it becomes significant or even extreme in dryer climates many models can be used for the assessment of pet and ret from very simple to highly sophisticated ones real measurements of ret are difficult especially at catchment scale 1 5 objectives of the modelling challenge the overall aim of the modelling challenge of which this paper presents step 1 is to explore models for their ability to reproduce the following aspects groundwater recharge groundwater flow velocity in space and time groundwater heads in space and time spring discharge hydrographs the first step of the challenge is limited to the relationship between meteorological parameters parameters of groundwater recharge and spring hydrographs discharge rate at system s output in other words it is focused on aspects of groundwater recharge and spring hydrographs any group or person interested in comparing his model results to the other ones was openly invited to participate 1 1 the challenge is going on any person interested can use data available in the supplementary material to this paper and can send her his result to the corrsponding author for obtaining the criteria values 2 modelling approaches compared in kmc all types of models described above were applied for the challenge the two categories of lumped parameter models neural networks and reservoirs as well as semi distributed and fully distributed models 2 1 data driven models 1 neural networks two research teams applied neural networks for the simulation of karst hydrographs kit karlsruhe with three models and imt mines alès with one the latter team uses deep recurrent multilayer perceptron mlp and the former team applies narx model convolutional neural networks cnn as well as long short term memory networks lstm artificial neural networks ann form a branch of artificial intelligence they are based on single neuron operations which are arranged and connected in a specific architecture using parameters also called weights the behaviour of the model is programmed by the values assigned to the parameters set during the training stage data is presented to the network and special training algorithms fit the target data by modifying the parameters between the neurons one neuron calculates two values i the weighted sum of its input vector with its parameters and ii its output which transforms the weighted sum in a scalar value using predefined functions e g linear or sigmoid known as activation functions the graded nonlinear response of sigmoid activation functions enables the ann to capture nonlinear relationships within the training data at this stage it is important to notice that ann models have no predefined function before training the goal of the training is to build both the function and to calculate its parameters for this purpose a database representing all the kinds of behaviors is necessary usually to represent the behavior with good quality the necessary length of the database depends on the behaviors to be considered when the database is continuous with a small time step 1 h as in this study several behaviors at different time scales take place thus the database must be sufficiently long to allow the model catching the underlying phenomena 15 years should be necessary artigue et al 2012 coutouis et al 2016 in this study only 4 5 years in two different periods of time were available it is thus important to notice that the database used in this work is not sufficient for ann approaches results shown hereafter can thus be considered as a proof of feasibility the various approaches models used in this study are summarized hereafter as these techniques are diverse and not commonly used in karst modelling further details are given as supplementary material all neural network models designed in this work used hourly precipitation and temperature daily evapotranspiration data resampled at hourly time step and discharge data at an hourly time step the data ranges used for training or validation differ slightly depending on the model 2 1 1 recurrent deep multilayer perceptron ann rec mlp the chosen multilayer perceptron is a recurrent neural network rnn with one hidden layer of n h hidden neurons and one output neuron the hidden layer neurons are nonlinear and apply a sigmoid function the output neuron is linear its output is equal to the weighted sum of its inputs this specific architecture displays the two properties of universal approximation and parsimony the latter of which is due to the nonlinearity relative to model inputs and parameters barron 1993 the universal approximation hornik et al 1989 means that the model is able to identify any differentiable function provided the existence of a database representing the behavior to identify for further details on this architecture the interested reader is referred to dreyfus 2005 in this study a deep multilayer perceptron is used by adding a deep layer connected in order to implement a preprocessing of data output neuron is a sigmoid one the model contains 381 parameters 2 1 2 narx model the narx model nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs used by kit karlsruhe is quite similar to the previous model used by mining school in alès france the differences are for example the number of hidden layers the input data being used and the architecture narx models can also belong to the group of recurrent neural networks rnn narx in particular have a global feedback connection between their output and input layer enabling information flow in different directions in the network and making them especially suitable for modelling nonlinear dynamic systems this also means that each output value is not only regressed on the independent input signals but also on previous output signals depending on the chosen model rnns can have difficulties in capturing long term dependencies greater than 10 time steps due to the problem of vanishing gradients bengio et al 1994 however narx can keep information up to three times longer than simple rnns lin et al 1996a 1996b to build and apply narx models we use matlab 2019a mathworks inc and its deep learning toolbox the model contains 371 parameters 2 1 3 long short term memory network deep learning approaches such as long short term memory networks lstm received a lot of attention in recent years due to significant successes in various disciplines lstms also belong to the group of rnns and are widely applied to model sequential data like time series or natural language unlike other rnns lstms have been explicitly designed to overcome the problem of vanishing gradients besides the hidden state inherent to all types of rnns lstms have a cell memory or cell state to store information and three gates to control the information flow this enables information to remain in the cell memory which is why lstms can handle long term dependencies hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 the lstm model that simulates the outflow of the milandre cave has 11 311 trainable parameters 2 1 4 convolutional neural networks convolutional neural networks cnns are a type of deep learning multi layer neural network that was originally designed to efficiently handle image data but which has been also successfully applied to time series forecasting treating a sequence of observations like a one dimensional image the cnn that simulates the outflow of the milandre cave has 950 921 trainable parameters 2 2 data driven models 2 reservoirs gardenia brgm rcd seasonal tu freiberg chlem uni zuerich and karstmod sno karst models are all very similar tools designed to simulate the main processes of the water balance at catchment scale using simplified physical laws representing flows through a succession of reservoirs using climatic time series precipitation potential evapotranspiration air temperature on a recharge area these models are able to compute the flow at the outlet of a khs spring 2 2 1 rcd seasonal the karst system is represented by three storages which are connected by links one storage for representing the recharge system soil and epikarst and two others for the conduit and the diffuse flow system precipitation and actual evapotranspiration define the model input groundwater recharge to the conduit and diffuse flow systems occurs when the water content of the recharge system exceeds a threshold this threshold is seasonally variable sine wave with one year wavelength minimum in the summer and maximum in the winter for calibration maxima peaks and minima base flow before peak of measured spring discharge from the years 2014 2015 were taken as fit target model rcd seasonal is described in butscher and huggenberger 2008 2 2 2 karstmod karstmod is a modular platform for modeling of the rain level flow relationship in karstic basins developed by the french sno karst in its most complete form mazzilli et al 2019 it offers 4 compartments organized on as a two levels structure in this study it was used to test the performance of a two parameter transfer function with an infinite characteristic time guinot et al 2015 the proposed model has a two level structure an upper compartment is meant to account for flow within the soil and epikarst above a certain level water overflows to a lower compartment which stands for the infiltration and saturated zones the unit response of the lower compartment is an inverse power function of time which allows for infinite characteristic times such response may be well suited to reproduce long term memory effects of khs 2 2 3 gardenia the gardenia numerical code thiéry 2014 2015 http gardenia brgm fr has 4 reservoirs i a superficial reservoir s representing the water retention capacity of the soil quadratic law ii an intermediate linear reservoir h roughly representing the unsaturated zone and two underground linear reservoirs g1 and g2 representing compartments of the saturated zone the total discharge is the sum of the fast slow and deeper flows which is routed to the outlet 2 2 4 chlem uni zuerich cave hydrology lumped element model chlem provides different types of hydraulic elements that can be freely joined for kmc the hydraulic system was simulated with for parallel conduits that produce the model discharge which is compared to the measurements each of the four pipes consists of one storage element and one delay element and receives water from an input element with or without evapotranspiration in the storage elements the discharge depends on the storage volume following a power law and is limited by an adjustable parameter each of the elements has one to three adjustable parameters that were adjusted with an optimization algorithm cobyla from the nlopt optimization library 2 3 semi distributed models krm 1 siska varkarst uni freiburg and infoworks tcd dublin models are all semi distributed models but with significant differences the number of parameters for these models is moderate krm 1 is very similar to lumped parameter models with reservoirs but input parameters can be semi or fully distributed it has been developed as an alternative to models daily rainfall runoff models based on two reservoirs and three parameters edijatno and michel 1989 in order to further refine interception and soil infiltration processes which are assumed to be the main recharge controls for lowland and vegetated karst aquifers storage capacities of interception reservoirs vary according to the type and respective proportion of land uses forests cultures urban areas denudated areas etc and according to seasons in order to reproduce the dynamic of the vegetation interception and etp parameters are not uniform over the whole catchment two slow reservoirs are introduced to mimic processes in the soil epikarst and in the deep vadose zone they allow underflow and overflow depending on recharge intensity parameters of soil epikarst reservoirs vary according to a drought index while those of the deeper reservoirs are unique in addition an exchanger makes the recharged water pass from the low permeability volumes lpv to the karst conduits and vice et versa depending on pseudo hydraulic relations the complete description of krm 1 is available in malard 2018 the spatial distribution of rainfall over the catchment area can be taken into account but this was not applied in the present application rain is spatially uniform but vegetation cover is semi distributed the number of parameters for the calibration is 18 varkarst hartmann et al 2013 is a semi distributed model that considers the spatial heterogeneity using a distribution function the meteorological forcing is assumed homogeneous over the catchment area with shape parameters describing the distributions of soil and epikarst storages vertical hydraulic conductivities the separation into diffuse concentrated recharge and the groundwater hydraulic conductivities the model consists of 15 compartments reproducing the spatial variability of recharge and storage dynamics this value was tested in hartmann et al 2012 and shown to be enough to obtain stable integrated discharge and its variability it has also been confirmed by several following applications hartmann et al 2013 hartmann et al 2021 liu et al 2021 each compartment includes three superposed reservoirs soil epikarst and groundwater the first 14 compartments represent the dynamics of diffuse recharge and matrix flow while the last compartment represents the dynamics of concentrated recharge and conduit flow hartmann et al 2014 the discharge of the main spring is determined by the addition of flow from the groundwater reservoir of all model compartments which are controlled by the variable groundwater storage coefficients and conduit storage coefficient respectively the number of parameters for the calibration is 8 tcd dublin developed a semi distributed 1d model of the catchment based on the drainage software infoworks icm innovyse which models the hydraulics of the karst conduit network in both open channel and pressurized pipe flow gill et al 2013 the governing model equations are the saint venant equations of conservation of mass and momentum diffuse recharge from rainfall is modelled per sub catchment via a series of reservoirs rainfall runoff soil and groundwater stores in series all yielding different delayed discharges in parallel into the pipe network flows can also discharge into permeable pipes one connected for each sub catchment to represent the primary and secondary permeability expressed by darcy s law morrissey et al 2020 schuler et al 2020 the higher the density of these pipes included in this type of model moves towards becoming a fully distributed in the infoworks model the milandre catchment area is explicitly subdivided into 30 sub catchments of 0 45 to 0 475 km2 the sizes of the sub catchments are the result of modelling experience with respect to balancing the numerical stability of the model along with reasonable diameters of the draining pipes and heads every sub catchment generates recharge and storage through a hierarchical sequence of processes related to a runoff quick recharge b soil store contribution intermediate recharge and c groundwater store contribution slow recharge 19 parameters control these dynamics and in this model all sub catchments have the same parameter settings 2 4 fully distributed models in karstflow pardo igúzquiza et al 2018 recharge is split between fast recharge and slow recharge fast recharge is a percentage of rainfall that reaches the water level through the conduit network instantaneously for practical purposes the slow diffuse recharge takes place over the whole recharge domain while fast concentrated recharge is limited to specified regions fig 2 diffuse recharge is estimated by the method of thornthwaite applied to the percentage of rainfall that does not undergo quick recharge the model domain is discretized into voxels with absolute altitudes using a digital elevation model the diffuse flow along each column of voxels is described by the richards equation assuming a porous medium when the non saturated flow reaches the phreatic zone the one dimensional vertical flow couples as recharge with a two dimensional domain where flow through conduits and fractures is simulated by the equations of a two dimensional darcian flow in a porous medium the karst spring discharge is simulated by using a drain the parameters needed by the model are described in fig 2 modflow cfpv2 in short cfpv2 fig 3 is a flow and transport discrete continuum model which combines cave heat and solute transport routines liedl et al 2003 with modflow2005 cfp mode1 flow code shoemaker et al 2008 considering some additional improvements reimann et al 2018 in cfpv2 the aquifer encloses a network of conduits with turbulent laminar flow embedded within a matrix of lower permeability porous medium recharge can be split between diffuse recharge through the low permeability porous medium infiltration through the epikarst reservoir e g chang et al 2019 and direct infiltration into conduits and their associated fast response reservoirs namely cads see kavousi et al 2020 accordingly several recharge conditions were conceptualized and initiated as numerical model variants of the catchment in the presented simulations recharge is calculated by subtracting potential evapotranspiration etp to total precipitation p considering a simple degree day snow cover snowmelt approach for estimation of hourly snowmelt as well for the methodology of degree day approach see rango and martinec 1995 among many others it should be pointed out that the distributed recharge was given here as a single value all across the modeling domain moreover only six input parameters were homogenously assigned to the model keeping in mind that the overall aim of karst modeling challenge as a proof of concept not calibration statistics it should be noted that spatial variation of recharge and model input parameters which were not also provided with current state catchment data could improve the performance of cfpv2 process based model the inverse problem was solved using the pest parameter estimation code doherty 2015 2 5 comment on the various approaches the challenge is focused on the recharge discharge relationship only mainly the uncertainty of forecasted hydrographs at the system output table 1 provides an outlook of the main characteristics of the respective models lumped parameter models are thus basically sufficient to address the question although semi and fully distributed models have been applied they neither considered the spatial variability of infiltration nor of the aquifer parameters parameters were assumed to be the same all over the catchment area only the spatial variability of the interception of precipitation and evapotranspiration was considered in some of the models most models include some parameters which are more or less physically based and others which aren t infoworks karstflow and modflow cfpv2 are mostly based on physical descriptions of flow with most of their parameters having a physical meaning however the physical concepts used in these models are considerably different and simplified compared to processes really taking place in nature 3 study site and data the milandre karst hydrogeological system mkhs is located in the tabular jura in the front part of the jura mountains in northern switzerland the site is known as being the karst laboratory used by siska for conducting surveys and experiments since early 1990s the system outputs are formed by two perennial springs saivu 20 200 l s 1 373 m a s l and font 12 600 l s 1 369 m a s l during medium to high water periods water overflows at bâme spring 0 3000 l s 1 375 m a s l all springs are located on the left west side of the allaine river fig 4 mkhs is fed by a recharge area of 13 km2 grasso and jeannin 1994 jeannin 1996 perrin et al 2003 which consists in a limestone plateau at an altitude of 550 m a s l this area is occupied by forests 30 of the catchment area pastures 30 cultivated lands 30 and urban regions 5 the limestone is almost completely covered 95 by soil with a thickness in the order of 0 3 to 0 5 m in forested parts and up to 2 m in cultivated land gw recharge is purely autogenic and diffuse no surface stream and swallow holes the mean annual precipitation is 1070 mm as measured by the meteoswiss weather station at fahy located 7 km away from the center of the catchment area the mean annual effective precipitation precipitation minus real evapotranspiration is 520 mm an overview of the hydrogeological settings of the area is provided by kovacs and jeannin 2003 the aquifer is hosted by upper jurassic limestone and is underlain by the oxfordian marls which act as a regional aquiclude as the active conduits lie almost directly above this impervious formation there is no deep phreatic zone and the system is qualified as a shallow karst system perrin 2003 the downstream part of the catchment contains a 10 5 km speleological network the milandre cave which hosts a 4 km long perennial cave stream the milandrine this is the main drainage axis of the catchment the stream flows into a sump around 500 m upstream from the saivu spring two main underground tributaries feed the milandrine and each of them contributes to 25 to 35 to the cumulated discharge of the springs grasso and jeannin 1994 the underground stream is monitored along its course at three places for discharge temperature and electrical conductivity several drillholes located around the main karst conduits have been monitored showing the groundwater behavior around the conduit network this data will be important for the next steps of the challenge 4 methods 4 1 workflow of the karst modelling challenge kmc for step 1 of kmc dedicated to the relationship between meteorological parameters and spring hydrograph the discharge rates of the three spring of the system saivu font and bâme were simply summed in order to provide one single discharge time series for the whole khs 4 1 1 calibration data in february 2017 each team received 4 years of meteorological data from 1 1 1992 to 31 12 1995 for the main meteorological station fahy located 7 km south west of center of the catchment area hourly precipitation hourly temperature and daily pet were given hourly precipitation data were also given for the maira station which is located in the middle of the catchment area daily precipitation were also given for a third station mormont located 2 km south east of the catchment each team also received 2 5 years of hourly discharge data sum of saivu font and bâme springs from 24 9 1992 to 28 3 1995 this data set was used for a first calibration of the models as well as for adjusting criteria for the comparison all teams returned their results and a first comparison was made in 2018 based on this first exercise it was then decided to provide a second dataset for a further evaluation of model performances 4 1 2 model evaluation in june 2019 a new dataset was sent to all teams with two years of data 2014 2015 for the meteorological station of fahy and for the total combined discharge rates of saivu font and bâme springs data from maira and mormont were not provided because they were declared as not useful by the teams after the analysis of the first dataset teams were asked to apply their model to the second dataset with the parameters calibrated with the first dataset to run the quality criteria and to write a comment on it if they wished they had the possibility to improve the calibration using years 2014 2015 4 1 3 test data finally all teams were invited to forecast discharge time series for the year 2016 for which they only received input data that meant that they could use their calibration data based on the 1992 to 1995 time series data for the simulation forecast of 2016 or based on the 2014 2015 time series or a combination of both they sent their best model to the first author who applied the same evaluation criteria to all received time series among the 15 teams originally interested in the challenge 8 of them sent their results and 5 additional teams joined afterwards making a total of 13 modelling teams comparing their approaches and results 4 2 uncertainty of the data we briefly discuss here two different types of uncertainties which are attached to measured data used for the challenge 4 2 1 measurement uncertainty air temperature is measured with a high precision better than 0 1 c precipitation is measured with a high quality rain gage calibrated tipping bucket of meteoswiss with a precision in the order of 0 2 mm both are measured every 10 min and averaged t or cumulated p over one hour for the spring discharges the water level is measured every 15 or 30 min and is transformed into discharge using a rating curve established empirically for the measurement section the obtained discharge rates are averaged over one hour for this step 1 of the challenge the output discharge rate is obtained by summing the three outlet points springs of the mkhs rating curves were derived by taking discharge rate measurements at the springs across a range of various rates or water levels most measurements were made by salt dilution method measurements are repeated every few years in order to look at potential changes in the rating curves uncertainties on discharge rate data are in the order of 20 in absolute values however this uncertainty must be considered as global and not as a noise related to every single value 4 2 2 uncertainty related to spatial heterogeneity meteorological parameters are measured at an official meteorological station of the swiss meteorological agency sma the station is located 7 km away from the center of the catchment area at a similar elevation summer showers locally can be quite different from what is measured at the rain gage however for most major events the rain distribution is rather uniform as given by a comparison with other meteorological stations in the area including the one located in the middle of the catchment area which is rather small 10 15 km2 and rather flat this latter rain gage was compared but not used for the challenge as its measurements appeared to be less liable than those of the official sma station land use is not uniform as detailed previously the catchment area is covered by forest 30 pastures and cultivated land 60 and about 10 of urban area the effect on recharge of the differences in ret models for these respective regions is not directly measurable inducing another source of spatial uncertainty 4 3 evaluation of model performances the only aim in the present step of the challenge was to simulate the observed discharge rate at the system output as well as possible the quality criteria or efficiency criteria must therefore result from the comparison between the observed and the simulated forecasted time series six methods or objective functions were considered providing an evaluation of model performances as a function of different objectives madsen et al 2002 moriasi et al 2007 biondi et al 2012 mean squared error mse normalized mean squared error nmse variance var nash criteria nash kling gupta efficiency criteria kge and volume conservations coefficient vcc each method summarizes the difference between the forecasted and the observed curves into one single value which is obtained with a different calculation during the first exercise using data from the 1990 s discussions between participants of the challenge showed that only nash kge and vcc were applicable for the comparison the other criteria are not normalized and can therefore hardly be compared from one simulation to another hence although they have been calculated they will not be further discussed in this paper vcc is the ratio between the forecasted volume of flow and the observed one ideally the value must be 1 quality classes are given in table 2 as well as the range between very good to low nash takes into account the ratio between the mean squared error mse and the variance var as defined by nash and sutcliffe 1970 the nash coefficient ranges from to 1 1 being the ideal value for nash less than 0 the mean of the observed values is a better indicator than the calibrated model for nash 0 the results provided by the model are as accurate as the mean of the observed values usually the model may be considered as reliable when nash coefficient is higher than 0 75 the nash criterion least squares is well known for giving a lot of weight to flood periods but in return being less sensitive with regards to the simulation of low water levels this motivated gupta et al 2009 to introduce an improved criteria kge taking into account a normalized distance between the observed and forecasted curves kge ranges between 1 and 0 these three criteria were applied to the whole time series however in order to evaluate more closely the apparent strengths and weaknesses of the respective models we also split the observed curve into four components peak rising limb peak recession base flow and undetermined we calculated the quality criteria for the overall time series as well as for each of its four components in addition a fourth criteria was used to assess the applicability of the respective models i e the effort necessary to set up calibrate and run the model classes are given in table 2 a final note was arbitrarily calculated using a weighted mean between kge weight 2 5 vcc weight 2 5 and nash weight 1 5 relative errors are also used for characterizing the difference between the forecasted and the observed values for each value hour the difference is calculated and divided by the larger value of observed or forecasted discharge rate doing so a forecasted value 3 times lower than the observed one makes a relative error of 300 and a forecasted value 3 times larger than the observed one a relative error of 300 4 4 time step hourly discharge measurements hms of the milandre springs show fast fluctuations on a time scale which is shorter than a day which would suggest that model simulations should be computed at an hourly time step however some models are designed for daily time steps and provide daily values dvs these may be compared to the reference observed time series hms either by taking daily instantaneous values divs e g the measured value at noon or by averaging values over 24 h davs in the framework of kmc results of the simulations had to be compared to hms for computing the efficiency criteria therefore simulated dvs were retransformed into hourly values hvs a linear decomposition of dvs into hvs was thus necessary conversions from hourly values to daily values and then to hourly values again may significantly affect the quality of the simulation two biases were tested the effect of resampling decomposing and the way to resample from instantaneous or from average values one question raised by participants was if it was better to use average or instantaneous values therefore we made a comparison between reference hms and hourly values issued from the resampling of divs and davs the new time series are called hdivs and hdavs respectively fig 5 fig 6 shows that significant differences do exist between hms hdivs and hdavs most of the time instantaneous values hdivs show a better fit with hms than average values hdavs hdavs systematically underestimate peak flows and often overestimate the rising limb of the floods hdivs usually show a better fit with peak flow except when variations of peak flow are clearly shorter than one day e g the flood on dec 5th 1992 for this case the averaged value may provide a better fit hdivs better reproduce low flows than hdavs in summary hdavs show a more systematic bias than hdivs hdivs and hdavs are thus compared to hms using the provided efficiency criteria see table 3 in both cases it appears that vcc volume conservation coefficient is well conserved nash and kge are about 0 9 to 0 95 meaning that conversion from hourly to daily and then to hourly values again degrades the time series in the same order of magnitude of what is usually targeted and obtained with the best simulations it should be observed that nash and kge for hdivs are slightly better than those computed for hdavs vcc is a bit lower for hdavs which makes sense as hdvas systematically underestimate peak flows our advice for kmc was then to work at hourly time step as far as possible for simulations at the milandre test site but if this was not possible then teams were encouraged to use divs from hms to compare daily values obtained with their models finally as all teams were required to compute their final efficiency criteria at an hourly time step their simulated results if calculated at daily time step needed to be resampled into hourly data using a linear decomposition 5 results 5 1 overall performance as shown on fig 7 the different model forecasts generally seem to reproduce the correct order of magnitude of discharge rates for most of the prediction period models tend to underestimate discharge during recessions occurring after significant high water conditions e g march and june on fig 7 given that most models provided reasonable results quality criteria were then applied in order to identify strengths and weaknesses of the respective models the following comparison takes into account only the best prediction for the year 2016 provided by the participating teams most are obtained with calibration on years 2014 2015 but some used a mix with 1992 1995 as well in table 4 model results have been classified according to their final score as defined in chapter 3 effort is given as indication concerning kge and vcc all models are acceptable to good but none is very good forecasted curves for the year 2016 are given for all individual models in fig 8 the log scale provides a better view of the relative errors between the forecasted and the observed curve than the linear scale all models reproduce the overall shape of the curve of discharge variations covering periods of time of low flow and other periods with peaks the amplitude of the peaks is in the right order of a magnitude low flow conditions are correctly identified however a closer look shows that low flow conditions are rather poorly forecasted by most models whereby often the forecasted discharge rate is too low and too flat it appears that curves predicted by reservoir models and semi distributed models reproduce somehow better the observed behavior with many peaks from january to june and less peaks from july to october infoworks and krm1 are semi distributed models with their recharge processes based on reservoir models their curves are thus quite similar to those of reservoir models varkarst is based on a different approach it explicitly considers spatial variability and it can be seen that the peaks are pretty well predicted but the simulation does not reflect the observed behavior well during low flow conditions rcd seasonal oversimplifies recession during summer with just a single long recession the distributed models fail at forecasting low flow conditions as too many little peaks are produced and the subsequent recessions are much too quick peaks are underestimated in winter and overestimated in summer chlem which is a reservoir model produces curves which are similar to those of distributed models lumped models are not bad for the first half of the year but have a significant drift in the second part of the year with ann 2 performing better overall than the three others relative errors are given in fig 9 errors on peaks are of short duration but may be of considerable intensity usually larger than 400 positive or negative for some events along the year the flow rate during the recession in march is underestimated by most models cnn is the only model providing a prediction close to observations for this event varkarst karstmod and chlem are particularly low the main recession in july tends also to be underestimated by most models with gardenia karstflow and krm1 performing better than the others it is noticeable that most models using neural derived approaches display a significant drift in the last months of the simulations except the mlp model by classifying the relative errors we can display the percentage of the forecasted data hours year for which the error of the model is lower than a value fig 10 for instance the lstm model intense pale blue has 22 of the forecasted values with an error lower than 50 e g between 67 and 150 l s instead of 100 l s gardenia has 72 the higher is the curve the better the performance of the model 5 2 performance by flow components the observed times series was divided into four components rising limb of the peaks recession base flow and undetermined flow base flow was empirically determined when the discharge rate is decreasing over five successive hours with a rate lower than 1 l s per hour the latter component includes points which are not clearly related to one of the other three classes for the year 2016 the significance of the four components is given in table 5 in hours variations from one year to the other are in the order of 5 each value of the observed curve is attributed to one single flow component for the forecasted curves the components of the observed curve are used for the separation meaning that all models are compared on the basis of the same components as can be seen on fig 11 most values belonging to the undetermined flow correspond in fact to base flow conditions they could not be attributed to base flow because they include slight increases of the discharge rate which may be related to some technical problems e g temperature variations on the electronics or changes of the atmospheric pressure which are not perfectly corrected the respective models have specific results for each component gardenia has among the best performances for most criteria and components this is less the case for varkarst especially concerning volume conservation vcc most models have one component with kge close to or below 0 5 nash criteria is low for base flow in most models chlem cfp modified and rcd seasonal three models with the lowest scores are better than most other models for base flow according to vcc and kge the nash criteria is quite poor for most models as this criterium cannot be good for a trending time series as the mean value is taken as reference in the denominator of the nash sutcliff formula other quality criteria have also been calculated for the respective models mainly mean squared error and the variance test however these criteria do not provide more information than those presented in table 6 5 3 comparison of calibrated parameters given that the models are based on different concepts their parameters are all different and cannot be compared directly some aspects however can be roughly compared for several models i e catchment size storage capacity conduit diffuse flow components 5 3 1 catchment size in karst regions catchment size is never known exactly and so this was considered to be a calibration parameter by some of the models the calibrated size area varies between 11 6 and 16 24 km2 which ranges between 9 and 28 of the assessed surface area 12 7 km2 the main reason for these variations is related to the model applied for assessing evapotranspiration the size was calibrated to adjust the water balance on the calibration period neural networks models do not provide any catchment size the role of this parameter is approached by a series of unidentified functions and parameters 5 3 2 storage capacity the attenuation between recharge and discharge is related to the characteristics of the storage in all models however the way it is generated is different in the respective models most models have quick and slow storages included somehow which reflects what is commonly accepted in karst aquifers since the 1970s as summarized e g by bakalowicz 2005 their number and characteristics are however different and hardly comparable it may be only mathematical or based on the infilling of a reservoir or on the routing of water etc somehow all models generate peaks within 0 2 5 days after a rain event and a base flow usually corresponding to the emptying of some kind of reservoir or mathematical function with slow recession keeping water flowing out of the system over more than 6 months without recharge the storage volume of this slow component is in the order of 100 250 mm 5 3 3 conduit diffuse flow components another long lasting debate among karst hydrogeologist see e g bakalowicz 2005 is about the ratio between the quick flow component assumed to be related to conduits and the slow flow component assumed to be related to matrix or diffuse flow from our results we were hoping to be able to compare the amount of recharge flowing through both components of the respective models however as every model has a different architecture and concept this could hardly be done the only thing we can compare is the amount of peak flow rising limb and recession and base flow including undetermined flow for each model the comparison shows however that differences between models are not very significant the amount of peak flow ranging between 64 and 78 and the volume of base flow ranging between 22 and 36 6 discussion and model comparison the comparison shows that forecasted curves with similar values for their quality criteria may have different shapes this illustrates the fact that quality criteria for model comparison could still be improved our first assessment of the results was that all models produced fair to good simulations however this assessment is probably rather qualitative than quantitative indeed when looking at relative errors we realized that most models produce values with errors larger than 50 for about 50 of the time or more results are clearly worse during low flow conditions absolute differences are low during these periods of time but relative ones are significant by looking at the respective curves fig 8 and at the relative errors fig 9 one can say that the three criteria we selected are not sufficient to characterize the overall quality of the results for instance the shape of the curve forecasted by the varkarst model reproduces very well the peaks be very poorly the values during the dry season gardenia is better for base flow but still include significant differences in march and october of the simulated year the fact that most models obviously tend to underestimate or poorly reproduce low flow e g lstm or varkarst could be related to the way calibration is implemented it is usually mainly targeted on minimising the squared errors metric which gives much weight to the peaks and not much to low flow values a criterium minimizing relative errors instead of absolute errors could possibly improve the weighting of base flow conditions in the overall results another option could also be to calibrate the parameters which control base flow first as they not dependent much on the recharge model and then to calibrate the other parameters on the residuals of this first calibration step in the case of rcd seasonal and possibly varkarst the main reason for the poor forecasting of low flow conditions seems to be related to the recharge model which completely fails to produce any recharge between june and november or december the water deficit in the recharge reservoir is obviously too high over this period compared to the reality interestingly the spatial distribution of precipitation appeared not to be significant and was abandoned along the process in agreement with all participants obviously the number of recharge event for which differences are significant e g summer storms is low this may be the case for the milandrine khs which is small and located in a temperate and hilly region this may be different for a larger catchment with more relief and contrasting climate krm 1 model is the only model for which land use was taken into consideration however this does not appear to improve the results in a way to produce better results than the other models the number of parameters in the respective models ranges between less than 10 and several thousands despite automatic calibration optimization procedures models with less parameters tend to be better than the models with many parameters i e distributed models did not provide better results than global ones not considering catchment characteristics in the respective models could be a reason for this therefore it seems that the transformation between meteorological parameters and discharge rates is mainly controlled by a few general characteristics of the system such as size recharge process and one or two storages rather than by the detailed spatial distribution of parameters controlling these modellers using neural networks with many parameters claimed that data delivered for calibration were not sufficient as no basic structure is provided in their models compared to the models based upon a more physical function they have to build this structure using data they require therefore at least 15 years of data without any gap which is challenging these observations raise the question of uncertainty and overfitting associated with numerical models in fact we can probably conclude that the best models are as good as the data we provided modflow cfpv2 and karstflow are fully distributed models these models are based on the principle that the transformation of the input signal into the output one is mainly related to the characteristics of the aquifer this approach is more deductive than for the other models because these models are constructed from the supposed characteristics of the catchment and of the aquifer a consequence is that the recharge part of the models is simplified this is the main reason why peaks in the summer season are strongly exaggerated with both models see fig 8 for the given exercise this approach is also not the most efficient as it requires more work for digitizing a lot of data but at the end the results include more bias than many other models because recharge was not considered properly would a spatial discretization of the model parameters improve the results whilst this was not explicitly investigated in this research we can argue that the main discrepancy of these models is related to too large peaks in summer which seem to be more related to an oversimplification of the recharge model rather than to the spatialization of the model parameters recharge seems therefore really to be the key factor in the present case on the contrary lumped parameter models are more inductive because they include less or no constraining hypotheses the disadvantage is that none of their parameters can be compared somehow with natural characteristics not even the size of the catchment area they provide purely functional results another problem is that they require long and continuous data sets for learning the input output relationship of a natural flow system in semi and fully distributed models the spatial distribution of recharge land use vegetation precipitation can be taken into account however as the performance of these models turned out to be no better than results of similar models reservoir which did not take it into account one can infer that at least in the present case study the role of spatial distribution of the recharge is low the effect of spatial distribution was however not analysed in any depth and so could be further investigated e g bittner et al 2018 gill et al 2020 as the milandre site is rather flat small and without allogenic recharge the use of a complimentary catchment area with more contrasted conditions would probably be better for this analysis it should be noted that the relative significance of the spatial distribution of recharge function in any models will vary according to the characteristics of the karst catchment being simulated for example whether there is significant allogenic recharge or not the size of the catchment area and or the steepness of the topography may all be important factors an evaluation of the number of parameters hydrologically constrained in a rainfall runoff model in surface hydrology was investigated by jakeman and hornberger 1993 they show that most hydrological systems are well described by models with 4 to 6 parameters the contribution of any supplementary parameter seems to be within the data uncertainty related to monitoring data this explains somehow the fact that in our study models with many parameters greater than20 do not provide better results than those with less parameters in karst it is difficult to obtain reasonable results with less than 6 parameters three for the routing and three for the transformation of precipitation to recharge because of some visible threshold processes in karst systems 9 parameters seems to be a more reasonable minimum table 1 indicates that some of the models had less than 9 parameters however they include implicit assumptions fixing some of the parameters e g distribution functions fixed topology or geometry etc jakeman and hornberger 1993 also suggest that a standardized simple model could be applied systematically to any hydrological system this would help comparing systems characteristics and identifying drifts in data related to technical or natural reasons e g climate change the model comparison presented in our paper could therefore be a good basis for defining such a standardized karst model 7 conclusion and outlook 7 1 conclusion before making a conclusion it is important to have in mind that the comparison between the models was only carried out a one year simulation period due to the non stationary nature of hydrologic phenomena some models could be very good for one kind of situation and not so good for others the presented interpretations must thus be considered as snapshot interpretations compared to a similar exercise conducted for surface catchment holländer et al 2009 all models performed reasonably well although they are based on strongly different modelling approaches all models lead to reasonable and somehow similar results for the proposed exercise input output hydrological modelling despite considerable simplifications with respect to reality gardenia provides excellent results in the present case it fits the observed data almost within the range of uncertainty on the data themselves however despite very good scores the forecasted hydrograph displays significant differences with the observed one especially in low water conditions this is even more obvious for results issued from varkarst model apart from the different aspects of the modelling approach it can also be concluded from the modelling exercise that recharge is crucial in the modelling of any precipitation discharge relationship more specifically it can be observed that the real evapotranspiration must be carefully approached otherwise models will fail at reproducing discharge rates from precipitation data at least in temperate regions it can even be inferred that hydrogeological processes taking place within the aquifer are subsidiary compared to recharge processes taking place in the soil and epikarst lumped parameters models are interesting options if they can include non linear functions and adequate parameters for taking evapotranspiration into account regarding ann models their limitation is that they require long and complete datasets for calibration and validation and that they usually do not provide any physical indication about the real system even if this knowledge extraction has been successfully attempted as suggested by kong a siou et al 2013 and darras et al 2015 these models remain mainly functional taking into account the limited duration covered by the available data several anns show an acceptable behavior from the comparison as well as from tests of some models on other sites it also seems that the order and priority in which the calibration of the models is carried out has a strong effect on the result calibrating base flow first and peak flow afterwards appears to improve the results this point was not properly investigated in this study and should be further examined some physical reasons could support this idea as storage characteristics of karst aquifer are probably relevant concerning base flow as this part of the hydrograph is more independent on recharge processes it may be meaningful to calibrate the storage components of the models first using one or two storage reservoirs this is also supported by ideas derived from kovacs et al 2005 then the recharge model must focus on modelling the difference between precipitation and the assessed base flow it should also be highlighted here that the scoring scheme used to evaluate of strengths and weaknesses needs to be adapted for the purpose for the model is being developed for models used to provide flood assessments may not be assessed in the same way as those models focussing on the implications of low flow drought conditions the scores for the respective flow components table 5 shows the differences between the respective models it should be noted here that some of the modelling approaches could be combined in order to use their respective strengths for instance semi distributed models could be used in combination with neural methods in order to improve their recharge assessment component such optimizations will need to be adjusted to specific conditions of the site available data and question to be addressed 7 2 outlook in the case of the milandre catchment area only one model krm1 within the challenge attempted to take the spatial distribution of evapotranspiration land use into account this did not improve the model results in a measurable way however as real evapotranspiration is very significant and as we know that this differentiation is necessary in catchments with stronger altitudinal gradients it would be meaningful to further investigate this aspect this report covers the very first step of a model comparison it was focused only on the temporal discharge response of the spring to recharge events we would like to expand the challenge to further aspects of the modelling of karst hydrogeology the next step is to take into account the spatial distribution of flow and heads within the aquifer a first question with this respect is the fact that the discharge rate given at the spring for the challenge in reality corresponds to the flow rate coming out of three different springs font saivu and bâme which are located several hundred meters apart we also have head measurements at various locations within the aquifer and it would be interesting to see how various modelling approaches could reproduce those data for this new exercise it seems that lumped models will be hardly usable and that distributed models will be more adequate it will be therefore interesting to see how the respective teams will adapt their approach for this new challenge once heads and discharge rates will be approached we will try to simulate flow velocities and some transport processes for which we also acquired data this may also result in better performance of the models to the overall flows simulated in step 1 as some parameters will be better constrained credit authorship contribution statement pierre yves jeannin conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation resources data curation writing original

4391,the complexity of karst groundwater flow modelling is reflected by the amount of simulation approaches the goal of the karst modelling challenge kmc is comparing different approaches on one single system using the same data set thirteen teams with different computational models for simulating discharge variations at karst springs have applied their respective models on one single data set coming from the milandre karst hydrogeological system mkhs the approaches include neural networks reservoir models semi distributed models and fully distributed groundwater models four and a half years of hourly or daily meteorological input and hourly discharge data were provided for model calibration the validation comprised forecasting one year of discharge without the observed discharge data the model performance was evaluated using the volume conservation nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the kling gupta efficiency kge applied on the total discharge and individual flow components as a result the comparison of model performances is a challenging task due to the differences in the model architecture but also required time steps some of the models require aggregated daily steps while others could be run using hourly data which provided some interesting differences depending on how the data was transformed the use of instantaneous data e g value at noon produces less bias that averaging hourly data over one day the transformation of hourly into daily data produces a decrease of nash and kge of 0 05 to 0 08 i e from 1 to 0 93 the resulting simulations forecasted values for year 2016 produced kges ranging between 0 83 and 0 37 0 83 to 0 24 for nse although the simulations matched the monitored flows reasonably well most models struggled to simulate baseflow conditions accurately in general the models that performed the best for this exercise were the global ones gardenia and varkarst with a limited number of parameters which can be calibrated using automatic calibration procedures the neural network models also showed a fair potential with one providing reasonable results despite the relatively short dataset available for warming up 4 5 years semi and fully distributed models also suggested that with some more effort they could perform well the accuracy of model predictions does not seem to increase by using models with more than 9 12 calibration parameters an evaluation of the relative errors between the forecasted and the observed values revealed that for most models 50 of the forecasted values contained more than 50 of difference against the observed discharge rate with 25 having a difference larger than 100 a significant part of the poorly forecasted values corresponded to base flow which was surprising given that as base flow is generally much easier to predict than peak flow hence this shows that modelling approaches and criteria for the calibration are too oriented towards peak flow sections of the hydrographs and that improvements could be gained by more focus on the base flow keywords modelling karst comparison efficiency criteria recharge baseflow 1 introduction 1 1 idea the aim of the modelling challenge was to invite research teams from all over the world to compare their modelling approaches and tools by applying them on the same data set a common evaluation method had to be defined and results from each team have been analyzed with the same criteria in this way all results could be directly compared various objective functions various ways to compute the difference between the forecasted and the observed time series have been tested with three subsequently used for the final comparison 1 2 problem definition in order to start with a rather simple question step 1 it was decided to focus on the hydrological behavior of karst hydrogeological systems khs i e the relationship between parameters controlling the input of water into karst mainly precipitation and temperature and the discharge rate of karst springs at the output of the system fig 1 the question to be solved by the respective teams is to forecast as precisely as possible the discharge rates at the karst outlet from the meteorological input data it should be noted that further steps are foreseen with the simulation of the flow and head distribution in space and time step 2 and the simulation of transport processes step 3 however the evaluation for this step 1 of the challenge does not take into account whether the models will be able to address the objectives of the further steps or not in this paper the word model refers to approaches and corresponding numerical tools used by the respective teams for their modelling exercise the word simulation is used to name the results of the modelling work 1 3 flow through a karst massif as outlined in most text books e g ford and williams 1989 karst massifs are characterized by a specific geomorphology and hydrology fig 1 karst landforms are due to the dissolution of the rock in precipitation water surface landforms such as karrenfields dolines and swallowholes are produced by water infiltration into the rock vertical shafts caves vadose or phreatic and large springs are related to the flowthrough and output of water from a hydrological point of view precipitation rain and snowmelt infiltrates through vegetation cover and soils into the top layer of the rock which is more or less weathered epikarst one part of precipitation waters returns back to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration in some cases surface water may form a small stream or even a river which is swallowed into concentrated location swallow hole if the stream drains a non karstic area this part of the catchment will be called allogenic epikarst distributes water partially towards vertical shafts leading the liquid directly down to the phreatic zone another part of water is trapped at the bottom of the epikarst and seeps slowly downwards through cracks and joints at some points water is drained again by the network of karst channels which efficiently drains the rock mass and leads water at the outlet of the karst system the karst spring mangin 1975 williams 1983 smart and friederich 1986 the volume of water stored in fissures is significant compared to that stored in karst channels király 1975 drogue 1980 smart and hobbs 1986 the relationship between recharge and discharge at springs seems quite direct in most karst systems as rain events are followed by clear peaks of discharge rates at karst springs usually within a few hours to days the response is therefore fairly similar to that usually observed in surface hydrology the degree of diffuse flow in the rock matrix compared to concentrated flow in conduits as well as the amount of concentrated recharge into swallow holes vs diffuse recharge through soils and epikarst may be significantly different depending on rock characteristics and on geomorphological and climatological contexts various models have been developed to simulate the functional relationship between precipitation and discharge peaks some of them include physical processes taking place in each subsystem traversed by water other ones simplify the nature into linear subsystems and other ones just consider the mathematical relationship between an input signal and an output one the aim of step 1 of the karst modelling challenge is to compare these approaches and their capability to simulate a hydrograph from a precipitation times series 1 4 short outlook on groundwater flow modelling in karst the analysis of hydrographs started mainly after the publication of maillet 1905 however continuous monitoring of karst springs really started only since the 1950s for the analysis of karst springs the first models occurred along the 1960s schoeller 1962 forkasiewicz and paloc 1967 castany 1968 brown 1970 1973 mangin 1970 1975 chemin 1974 bezes 1976 milanovic 1976 atkinson 1977 dreiss 1982 1983 dodge 1983 bonacci 1987 ford and williams 1989 early on two components were recognized one explaining the quick and intense response of spring discharge rates to precipitations and the other explaining the slow decrease of discharge rates recession through long periods of time without recharge events several conceptual ideas were developed through various types of mathematical models which can be grouped into three large families teutsch and sauter 1991 kovács and sauter 2007 ghasemizadeh 2012 fiorillo 2014 1 data driven or black box models including reservoir non parametric transfer functions 2 hydrogeological models enclosing matrix flow with or without conduits 3 pipe flow models based on the hydraulics of flow in conduits 1 4 1 data driven or black box models in these models the system is only considered as a black box or a combination of black boxes each box transforming an input signal inflow into an output one outflow the transformation is based on a purely mathematical function without considering physical processes controlling flow in the underground or by strongly simplifying them dewandel et al 2003 fiorillo 2014 the simplest model of this type would be a single box model taking the total precipitation as input and transforming it into a discharge time series the classical unitary hydrograph model assuming a single linear transfer function kernel as first introduced first by sherman 1932 was tested on karst systems it quickly turned out that khs are neither linear nor steady and that such a simple model cannot describe karst aquifers in a meaningful way thus more sophisticated schemes coupling several kernels were necessary to fit observed data somehow dreiss 1982 neural networks are the most recent developments of this category of models another category of lumped models was attempted by various authors using cascading and parallel reservoirs forkasiewicz and paloc 1967 bezes 1976 halihan and wicks 1998 usually one reservoir simulates the quick flow component and the others the slower component of khs a new parameter then occurred i e the distribution of recharge into the respective components the best results were obtained with a combination of three to five reservoirs some of them being partially emptied by evapotranspiration this approach led to rather precise simulation results e g long 2009 in most cases input parameters are not distributed i e each reservoir is supposed to expand over the whole size of the catchment area in fact this approach can also be distributed in space and may take into account some spatial differences of the aquifer characteristics in the respective parts of the catchment area e g bittner et al 2018 with three to five reservoirs distributed in tens or hundreds of zones the number of parameters becomes very high making it difficult to calibrate the models thanks to automatic calibration procedures this task can now be achieved with a reasonable effort pianosi et al 2016 mazzilli et al 2017 1 4 2 hydrogeological models fully distributed models darcy 1856 empirically described the mathematical relationship between groundwater gradients head differences and groundwater flow quantity this was in fact the first groundwater flow model which was one dimensional and steady state analytical solutions for some typical geometries and boundary conditions were developed in the 1970s the development of computers enabled equations to be solved numerically making it possible to compute flow across a much wider range of situations e g bredehoeft and pinder 1970 application of this approach to karst was first attempted in the mid 1970s király and morel 1976 but it quickly became obvious that khs cannot easily be modelled using this approach as the simulation of quick and intense flood events as well as a sustained base flow as observed in most karst springs proved challenging modellers decided to introduce a network of conduits within a matrix with a low hydraulic conductivity with contrasts of 10 4 to 10 5 m s between matrix and conduits karst hydrographs could be simulated however the recharge process also had to be improved which was achieved by adding a layer with a high hydraulic conductivity at the top of the model epikarst able to absorb precipitation and distribute it to the conduits and matrix király et al 1995 given that the high contrast of hydraulic conductivities in spatial models can be quite challenging from a numerical point of view various solutions have been developed such as double continuum or double medium models teutsch and sauter 1991 two further improvements occurred later turbulent flow in conduits and partially saturated flow thierrien and sudicky 1996 annable and sudicky 1998 in these fully distributed models the number of parameters is very high with several values for each cell making calibration manual very time consuming and practically impossible parameter zonation and automatic calibration procedures improved this aspect doherty et al 1994 borghi et al 2016 however as the basic structure of the network needs to be defined first its geometry and topology is not usually adjusted during the calibration process though it may play a significant role in some situations kovács 2003 especially in the epiphreatic zone jeannin 2001 assuming the physics considered in the model is correct models can however reveal unrealistic structures and therefore can act as a very advanced tool that provides further insights enemark et al 2019 gill et al 2020 duran and gill 2021 these models belong to process based groundwater flow models according to the classification proposed by anderson et al 2015 1 4 3 pipe flow models semi distributed models pipe flow models only consider a network of conduits and neglect flow through the matrix or add it as a non spatialized entity the idea is not new as many original authors martel 1921 lièvre 1915 1940 trombe 1948 exploring karst with both a hydrogeological and a speleological perspective suggested flow in karst to be well described by equations of the pipe hydraulics these models also belong to process based models according to anderson et al 2015 but the main process considered is the hydraulics of flow through conduits in the phreatic and epihreatic zones turbulent and partially saturated darcy s flow is not or only marginally considered a few authors then used pipe models for analyzing their data white and white 1970 atkinson 1977 boegli 1980 lauritzen et al 1985 smart 1988 all of them demonstrated that flow is turbulent in most natural conduits caves at least during medium to high water conditions flow may be transitional or even laminar during very low flow conditions ford and williams 1989 and worthington 1991 have provided suggestions on values of friction factors in caves but these have only really been based on defined known conduit sections and none of these authors really attempted to simulate flow in a complex network of pipes jeannin and maréchal 1995 and jeannin 2001 assessed headlosses due to bends and changes in cross sections compared to those related to friction along walls it turns out that the latter are usually dominating and typical values could be assigned for natural conduits they also calculated the hydraulics of a network of natural conduits for modelling flow in the downstream part of the hölloch cave switzerland the role of epiphreatic conduits on the hydraulics and flow velocity was found to be significant for many khs this specific behavior cannot be simulated with the usual hydrogeological software packages for this reason pipe flow modelling e g the swmm software developed by us epa and other urban drainage software have increasingly been used in modeling karst hydrology campbell and sullivan 2002 peterson and wicks 2006 wu et al 2008 gill et al 2013 chen and goldscheider 2014 jeannin et al 2015 kaufmann et al 2016 malard 2018 vuilleumier et al 2019 morrissey et al 2020 schuler et al 2020 these models enable flow to be simulated in a complex network of pipes with various diameters roughness and cross sectional shapes if this approach is efficient to link observed heads and discharge rates it is not adequate to link precipitation to discharge hydrograph indeed a recharge model is always necessary for doing it in order to transform meteorological data into groundwater recharge 1 4 4 modelling recharge of karst hydrogeological systems khs recharge is defined here as the quantity of water infiltrating and flowing through the karst system it roughly corresponds to the total precipitation minus evapotranspiration and overland runoff bypassing karst in some circumstances snow and ice storage are also to be considered in recharge processes recharge strongly depends on evapotranspiration several formulae have been developed for assessing the potential evapotranspiration pet from meteorological parameters thornthwait 1948 penman 1948 turc 1961 these models provide an assessment of the quantity of water which would be evaporated or transpirated by vegetation if sufficient water were available in soils in reality during periods of low water soils become strongly unsaturated and plants may suffer a water deficit reducing their capacity of bringing water from the soil into the atmosphere real evapotranspiration ret is thus lower than pet in humid climates the difference may be negligible but it becomes significant or even extreme in dryer climates many models can be used for the assessment of pet and ret from very simple to highly sophisticated ones real measurements of ret are difficult especially at catchment scale 1 5 objectives of the modelling challenge the overall aim of the modelling challenge of which this paper presents step 1 is to explore models for their ability to reproduce the following aspects groundwater recharge groundwater flow velocity in space and time groundwater heads in space and time spring discharge hydrographs the first step of the challenge is limited to the relationship between meteorological parameters parameters of groundwater recharge and spring hydrographs discharge rate at system s output in other words it is focused on aspects of groundwater recharge and spring hydrographs any group or person interested in comparing his model results to the other ones was openly invited to participate 1 1 the challenge is going on any person interested can use data available in the supplementary material to this paper and can send her his result to the corrsponding author for obtaining the criteria values 2 modelling approaches compared in kmc all types of models described above were applied for the challenge the two categories of lumped parameter models neural networks and reservoirs as well as semi distributed and fully distributed models 2 1 data driven models 1 neural networks two research teams applied neural networks for the simulation of karst hydrographs kit karlsruhe with three models and imt mines alès with one the latter team uses deep recurrent multilayer perceptron mlp and the former team applies narx model convolutional neural networks cnn as well as long short term memory networks lstm artificial neural networks ann form a branch of artificial intelligence they are based on single neuron operations which are arranged and connected in a specific architecture using parameters also called weights the behaviour of the model is programmed by the values assigned to the parameters set during the training stage data is presented to the network and special training algorithms fit the target data by modifying the parameters between the neurons one neuron calculates two values i the weighted sum of its input vector with its parameters and ii its output which transforms the weighted sum in a scalar value using predefined functions e g linear or sigmoid known as activation functions the graded nonlinear response of sigmoid activation functions enables the ann to capture nonlinear relationships within the training data at this stage it is important to notice that ann models have no predefined function before training the goal of the training is to build both the function and to calculate its parameters for this purpose a database representing all the kinds of behaviors is necessary usually to represent the behavior with good quality the necessary length of the database depends on the behaviors to be considered when the database is continuous with a small time step 1 h as in this study several behaviors at different time scales take place thus the database must be sufficiently long to allow the model catching the underlying phenomena 15 years should be necessary artigue et al 2012 coutouis et al 2016 in this study only 4 5 years in two different periods of time were available it is thus important to notice that the database used in this work is not sufficient for ann approaches results shown hereafter can thus be considered as a proof of feasibility the various approaches models used in this study are summarized hereafter as these techniques are diverse and not commonly used in karst modelling further details are given as supplementary material all neural network models designed in this work used hourly precipitation and temperature daily evapotranspiration data resampled at hourly time step and discharge data at an hourly time step the data ranges used for training or validation differ slightly depending on the model 2 1 1 recurrent deep multilayer perceptron ann rec mlp the chosen multilayer perceptron is a recurrent neural network rnn with one hidden layer of n h hidden neurons and one output neuron the hidden layer neurons are nonlinear and apply a sigmoid function the output neuron is linear its output is equal to the weighted sum of its inputs this specific architecture displays the two properties of universal approximation and parsimony the latter of which is due to the nonlinearity relative to model inputs and parameters barron 1993 the universal approximation hornik et al 1989 means that the model is able to identify any differentiable function provided the existence of a database representing the behavior to identify for further details on this architecture the interested reader is referred to dreyfus 2005 in this study a deep multilayer perceptron is used by adding a deep layer connected in order to implement a preprocessing of data output neuron is a sigmoid one the model contains 381 parameters 2 1 2 narx model the narx model nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs used by kit karlsruhe is quite similar to the previous model used by mining school in alès france the differences are for example the number of hidden layers the input data being used and the architecture narx models can also belong to the group of recurrent neural networks rnn narx in particular have a global feedback connection between their output and input layer enabling information flow in different directions in the network and making them especially suitable for modelling nonlinear dynamic systems this also means that each output value is not only regressed on the independent input signals but also on previous output signals depending on the chosen model rnns can have difficulties in capturing long term dependencies greater than 10 time steps due to the problem of vanishing gradients bengio et al 1994 however narx can keep information up to three times longer than simple rnns lin et al 1996a 1996b to build and apply narx models we use matlab 2019a mathworks inc and its deep learning toolbox the model contains 371 parameters 2 1 3 long short term memory network deep learning approaches such as long short term memory networks lstm received a lot of attention in recent years due to significant successes in various disciplines lstms also belong to the group of rnns and are widely applied to model sequential data like time series or natural language unlike other rnns lstms have been explicitly designed to overcome the problem of vanishing gradients besides the hidden state inherent to all types of rnns lstms have a cell memory or cell state to store information and three gates to control the information flow this enables information to remain in the cell memory which is why lstms can handle long term dependencies hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 the lstm model that simulates the outflow of the milandre cave has 11 311 trainable parameters 2 1 4 convolutional neural networks convolutional neural networks cnns are a type of deep learning multi layer neural network that was originally designed to efficiently handle image data but which has been also successfully applied to time series forecasting treating a sequence of observations like a one dimensional image the cnn that simulates the outflow of the milandre cave has 950 921 trainable parameters 2 2 data driven models 2 reservoirs gardenia brgm rcd seasonal tu freiberg chlem uni zuerich and karstmod sno karst models are all very similar tools designed to simulate the main processes of the water balance at catchment scale using simplified physical laws representing flows through a succession of reservoirs using climatic time series precipitation potential evapotranspiration air temperature on a recharge area these models are able to compute the flow at the outlet of a khs spring 2 2 1 rcd seasonal the karst system is represented by three storages which are connected by links one storage for representing the recharge system soil and epikarst and two others for the conduit and the diffuse flow system precipitation and actual evapotranspiration define the model input groundwater recharge to the conduit and diffuse flow systems occurs when the water content of the recharge system exceeds a threshold this threshold is seasonally variable sine wave with one year wavelength minimum in the summer and maximum in the winter for calibration maxima peaks and minima base flow before peak of measured spring discharge from the years 2014 2015 were taken as fit target model rcd seasonal is described in butscher and huggenberger 2008 2 2 2 karstmod karstmod is a modular platform for modeling of the rain level flow relationship in karstic basins developed by the french sno karst in its most complete form mazzilli et al 2019 it offers 4 compartments organized on as a two levels structure in this study it was used to test the performance of a two parameter transfer function with an infinite characteristic time guinot et al 2015 the proposed model has a two level structure an upper compartment is meant to account for flow within the soil and epikarst above a certain level water overflows to a lower compartment which stands for the infiltration and saturated zones the unit response of the lower compartment is an inverse power function of time which allows for infinite characteristic times such response may be well suited to reproduce long term memory effects of khs 2 2 3 gardenia the gardenia numerical code thiéry 2014 2015 http gardenia brgm fr has 4 reservoirs i a superficial reservoir s representing the water retention capacity of the soil quadratic law ii an intermediate linear reservoir h roughly representing the unsaturated zone and two underground linear reservoirs g1 and g2 representing compartments of the saturated zone the total discharge is the sum of the fast slow and deeper flows which is routed to the outlet 2 2 4 chlem uni zuerich cave hydrology lumped element model chlem provides different types of hydraulic elements that can be freely joined for kmc the hydraulic system was simulated with for parallel conduits that produce the model discharge which is compared to the measurements each of the four pipes consists of one storage element and one delay element and receives water from an input element with or without evapotranspiration in the storage elements the discharge depends on the storage volume following a power law and is limited by an adjustable parameter each of the elements has one to three adjustable parameters that were adjusted with an optimization algorithm cobyla from the nlopt optimization library 2 3 semi distributed models krm 1 siska varkarst uni freiburg and infoworks tcd dublin models are all semi distributed models but with significant differences the number of parameters for these models is moderate krm 1 is very similar to lumped parameter models with reservoirs but input parameters can be semi or fully distributed it has been developed as an alternative to models daily rainfall runoff models based on two reservoirs and three parameters edijatno and michel 1989 in order to further refine interception and soil infiltration processes which are assumed to be the main recharge controls for lowland and vegetated karst aquifers storage capacities of interception reservoirs vary according to the type and respective proportion of land uses forests cultures urban areas denudated areas etc and according to seasons in order to reproduce the dynamic of the vegetation interception and etp parameters are not uniform over the whole catchment two slow reservoirs are introduced to mimic processes in the soil epikarst and in the deep vadose zone they allow underflow and overflow depending on recharge intensity parameters of soil epikarst reservoirs vary according to a drought index while those of the deeper reservoirs are unique in addition an exchanger makes the recharged water pass from the low permeability volumes lpv to the karst conduits and vice et versa depending on pseudo hydraulic relations the complete description of krm 1 is available in malard 2018 the spatial distribution of rainfall over the catchment area can be taken into account but this was not applied in the present application rain is spatially uniform but vegetation cover is semi distributed the number of parameters for the calibration is 18 varkarst hartmann et al 2013 is a semi distributed model that considers the spatial heterogeneity using a distribution function the meteorological forcing is assumed homogeneous over the catchment area with shape parameters describing the distributions of soil and epikarst storages vertical hydraulic conductivities the separation into diffuse concentrated recharge and the groundwater hydraulic conductivities the model consists of 15 compartments reproducing the spatial variability of recharge and storage dynamics this value was tested in hartmann et al 2012 and shown to be enough to obtain stable integrated discharge and its variability it has also been confirmed by several following applications hartmann et al 2013 hartmann et al 2021 liu et al 2021 each compartment includes three superposed reservoirs soil epikarst and groundwater the first 14 compartments represent the dynamics of diffuse recharge and matrix flow while the last compartment represents the dynamics of concentrated recharge and conduit flow hartmann et al 2014 the discharge of the main spring is determined by the addition of flow from the groundwater reservoir of all model compartments which are controlled by the variable groundwater storage coefficients and conduit storage coefficient respectively the number of parameters for the calibration is 8 tcd dublin developed a semi distributed 1d model of the catchment based on the drainage software infoworks icm innovyse which models the hydraulics of the karst conduit network in both open channel and pressurized pipe flow gill et al 2013 the governing model equations are the saint venant equations of conservation of mass and momentum diffuse recharge from rainfall is modelled per sub catchment via a series of reservoirs rainfall runoff soil and groundwater stores in series all yielding different delayed discharges in parallel into the pipe network flows can also discharge into permeable pipes one connected for each sub catchment to represent the primary and secondary permeability expressed by darcy s law morrissey et al 2020 schuler et al 2020 the higher the density of these pipes included in this type of model moves towards becoming a fully distributed in the infoworks model the milandre catchment area is explicitly subdivided into 30 sub catchments of 0 45 to 0 475 km2 the sizes of the sub catchments are the result of modelling experience with respect to balancing the numerical stability of the model along with reasonable diameters of the draining pipes and heads every sub catchment generates recharge and storage through a hierarchical sequence of processes related to a runoff quick recharge b soil store contribution intermediate recharge and c groundwater store contribution slow recharge 19 parameters control these dynamics and in this model all sub catchments have the same parameter settings 2 4 fully distributed models in karstflow pardo igúzquiza et al 2018 recharge is split between fast recharge and slow recharge fast recharge is a percentage of rainfall that reaches the water level through the conduit network instantaneously for practical purposes the slow diffuse recharge takes place over the whole recharge domain while fast concentrated recharge is limited to specified regions fig 2 diffuse recharge is estimated by the method of thornthwaite applied to the percentage of rainfall that does not undergo quick recharge the model domain is discretized into voxels with absolute altitudes using a digital elevation model the diffuse flow along each column of voxels is described by the richards equation assuming a porous medium when the non saturated flow reaches the phreatic zone the one dimensional vertical flow couples as recharge with a two dimensional domain where flow through conduits and fractures is simulated by the equations of a two dimensional darcian flow in a porous medium the karst spring discharge is simulated by using a drain the parameters needed by the model are described in fig 2 modflow cfpv2 in short cfpv2 fig 3 is a flow and transport discrete continuum model which combines cave heat and solute transport routines liedl et al 2003 with modflow2005 cfp mode1 flow code shoemaker et al 2008 considering some additional improvements reimann et al 2018 in cfpv2 the aquifer encloses a network of conduits with turbulent laminar flow embedded within a matrix of lower permeability porous medium recharge can be split between diffuse recharge through the low permeability porous medium infiltration through the epikarst reservoir e g chang et al 2019 and direct infiltration into conduits and their associated fast response reservoirs namely cads see kavousi et al 2020 accordingly several recharge conditions were conceptualized and initiated as numerical model variants of the catchment in the presented simulations recharge is calculated by subtracting potential evapotranspiration etp to total precipitation p considering a simple degree day snow cover snowmelt approach for estimation of hourly snowmelt as well for the methodology of degree day approach see rango and martinec 1995 among many others it should be pointed out that the distributed recharge was given here as a single value all across the modeling domain moreover only six input parameters were homogenously assigned to the model keeping in mind that the overall aim of karst modeling challenge as a proof of concept not calibration statistics it should be noted that spatial variation of recharge and model input parameters which were not also provided with current state catchment data could improve the performance of cfpv2 process based model the inverse problem was solved using the pest parameter estimation code doherty 2015 2 5 comment on the various approaches the challenge is focused on the recharge discharge relationship only mainly the uncertainty of forecasted hydrographs at the system output table 1 provides an outlook of the main characteristics of the respective models lumped parameter models are thus basically sufficient to address the question although semi and fully distributed models have been applied they neither considered the spatial variability of infiltration nor of the aquifer parameters parameters were assumed to be the same all over the catchment area only the spatial variability of the interception of precipitation and evapotranspiration was considered in some of the models most models include some parameters which are more or less physically based and others which aren t infoworks karstflow and modflow cfpv2 are mostly based on physical descriptions of flow with most of their parameters having a physical meaning however the physical concepts used in these models are considerably different and simplified compared to processes really taking place in nature 3 study site and data the milandre karst hydrogeological system mkhs is located in the tabular jura in the front part of the jura mountains in northern switzerland the site is known as being the karst laboratory used by siska for conducting surveys and experiments since early 1990s the system outputs are formed by two perennial springs saivu 20 200 l s 1 373 m a s l and font 12 600 l s 1 369 m a s l during medium to high water periods water overflows at bâme spring 0 3000 l s 1 375 m a s l all springs are located on the left west side of the allaine river fig 4 mkhs is fed by a recharge area of 13 km2 grasso and jeannin 1994 jeannin 1996 perrin et al 2003 which consists in a limestone plateau at an altitude of 550 m a s l this area is occupied by forests 30 of the catchment area pastures 30 cultivated lands 30 and urban regions 5 the limestone is almost completely covered 95 by soil with a thickness in the order of 0 3 to 0 5 m in forested parts and up to 2 m in cultivated land gw recharge is purely autogenic and diffuse no surface stream and swallow holes the mean annual precipitation is 1070 mm as measured by the meteoswiss weather station at fahy located 7 km away from the center of the catchment area the mean annual effective precipitation precipitation minus real evapotranspiration is 520 mm an overview of the hydrogeological settings of the area is provided by kovacs and jeannin 2003 the aquifer is hosted by upper jurassic limestone and is underlain by the oxfordian marls which act as a regional aquiclude as the active conduits lie almost directly above this impervious formation there is no deep phreatic zone and the system is qualified as a shallow karst system perrin 2003 the downstream part of the catchment contains a 10 5 km speleological network the milandre cave which hosts a 4 km long perennial cave stream the milandrine this is the main drainage axis of the catchment the stream flows into a sump around 500 m upstream from the saivu spring two main underground tributaries feed the milandrine and each of them contributes to 25 to 35 to the cumulated discharge of the springs grasso and jeannin 1994 the underground stream is monitored along its course at three places for discharge temperature and electrical conductivity several drillholes located around the main karst conduits have been monitored showing the groundwater behavior around the conduit network this data will be important for the next steps of the challenge 4 methods 4 1 workflow of the karst modelling challenge kmc for step 1 of kmc dedicated to the relationship between meteorological parameters and spring hydrograph the discharge rates of the three spring of the system saivu font and bâme were simply summed in order to provide one single discharge time series for the whole khs 4 1 1 calibration data in february 2017 each team received 4 years of meteorological data from 1 1 1992 to 31 12 1995 for the main meteorological station fahy located 7 km south west of center of the catchment area hourly precipitation hourly temperature and daily pet were given hourly precipitation data were also given for the maira station which is located in the middle of the catchment area daily precipitation were also given for a third station mormont located 2 km south east of the catchment each team also received 2 5 years of hourly discharge data sum of saivu font and bâme springs from 24 9 1992 to 28 3 1995 this data set was used for a first calibration of the models as well as for adjusting criteria for the comparison all teams returned their results and a first comparison was made in 2018 based on this first exercise it was then decided to provide a second dataset for a further evaluation of model performances 4 1 2 model evaluation in june 2019 a new dataset was sent to all teams with two years of data 2014 2015 for the meteorological station of fahy and for the total combined discharge rates of saivu font and bâme springs data from maira and mormont were not provided because they were declared as not useful by the teams after the analysis of the first dataset teams were asked to apply their model to the second dataset with the parameters calibrated with the first dataset to run the quality criteria and to write a comment on it if they wished they had the possibility to improve the calibration using years 2014 2015 4 1 3 test data finally all teams were invited to forecast discharge time series for the year 2016 for which they only received input data that meant that they could use their calibration data based on the 1992 to 1995 time series data for the simulation forecast of 2016 or based on the 2014 2015 time series or a combination of both they sent their best model to the first author who applied the same evaluation criteria to all received time series among the 15 teams originally interested in the challenge 8 of them sent their results and 5 additional teams joined afterwards making a total of 13 modelling teams comparing their approaches and results 4 2 uncertainty of the data we briefly discuss here two different types of uncertainties which are attached to measured data used for the challenge 4 2 1 measurement uncertainty air temperature is measured with a high precision better than 0 1 c precipitation is measured with a high quality rain gage calibrated tipping bucket of meteoswiss with a precision in the order of 0 2 mm both are measured every 10 min and averaged t or cumulated p over one hour for the spring discharges the water level is measured every 15 or 30 min and is transformed into discharge using a rating curve established empirically for the measurement section the obtained discharge rates are averaged over one hour for this step 1 of the challenge the output discharge rate is obtained by summing the three outlet points springs of the mkhs rating curves were derived by taking discharge rate measurements at the springs across a range of various rates or water levels most measurements were made by salt dilution method measurements are repeated every few years in order to look at potential changes in the rating curves uncertainties on discharge rate data are in the order of 20 in absolute values however this uncertainty must be considered as global and not as a noise related to every single value 4 2 2 uncertainty related to spatial heterogeneity meteorological parameters are measured at an official meteorological station of the swiss meteorological agency sma the station is located 7 km away from the center of the catchment area at a similar elevation summer showers locally can be quite different from what is measured at the rain gage however for most major events the rain distribution is rather uniform as given by a comparison with other meteorological stations in the area including the one located in the middle of the catchment area which is rather small 10 15 km2 and rather flat this latter rain gage was compared but not used for the challenge as its measurements appeared to be less liable than those of the official sma station land use is not uniform as detailed previously the catchment area is covered by forest 30 pastures and cultivated land 60 and about 10 of urban area the effect on recharge of the differences in ret models for these respective regions is not directly measurable inducing another source of spatial uncertainty 4 3 evaluation of model performances the only aim in the present step of the challenge was to simulate the observed discharge rate at the system output as well as possible the quality criteria or efficiency criteria must therefore result from the comparison between the observed and the simulated forecasted time series six methods or objective functions were considered providing an evaluation of model performances as a function of different objectives madsen et al 2002 moriasi et al 2007 biondi et al 2012 mean squared error mse normalized mean squared error nmse variance var nash criteria nash kling gupta efficiency criteria kge and volume conservations coefficient vcc each method summarizes the difference between the forecasted and the observed curves into one single value which is obtained with a different calculation during the first exercise using data from the 1990 s discussions between participants of the challenge showed that only nash kge and vcc were applicable for the comparison the other criteria are not normalized and can therefore hardly be compared from one simulation to another hence although they have been calculated they will not be further discussed in this paper vcc is the ratio between the forecasted volume of flow and the observed one ideally the value must be 1 quality classes are given in table 2 as well as the range between very good to low nash takes into account the ratio between the mean squared error mse and the variance var as defined by nash and sutcliffe 1970 the nash coefficient ranges from to 1 1 being the ideal value for nash less than 0 the mean of the observed values is a better indicator than the calibrated model for nash 0 the results provided by the model are as accurate as the mean of the observed values usually the model may be considered as reliable when nash coefficient is higher than 0 75 the nash criterion least squares is well known for giving a lot of weight to flood periods but in return being less sensitive with regards to the simulation of low water levels this motivated gupta et al 2009 to introduce an improved criteria kge taking into account a normalized distance between the observed and forecasted curves kge ranges between 1 and 0 these three criteria were applied to the whole time series however in order to evaluate more closely the apparent strengths and weaknesses of the respective models we also split the observed curve into four components peak rising limb peak recession base flow and undetermined we calculated the quality criteria for the overall time series as well as for each of its four components in addition a fourth criteria was used to assess the applicability of the respective models i e the effort necessary to set up calibrate and run the model classes are given in table 2 a final note was arbitrarily calculated using a weighted mean between kge weight 2 5 vcc weight 2 5 and nash weight 1 5 relative errors are also used for characterizing the difference between the forecasted and the observed values for each value hour the difference is calculated and divided by the larger value of observed or forecasted discharge rate doing so a forecasted value 3 times lower than the observed one makes a relative error of 300 and a forecasted value 3 times larger than the observed one a relative error of 300 4 4 time step hourly discharge measurements hms of the milandre springs show fast fluctuations on a time scale which is shorter than a day which would suggest that model simulations should be computed at an hourly time step however some models are designed for daily time steps and provide daily values dvs these may be compared to the reference observed time series hms either by taking daily instantaneous values divs e g the measured value at noon or by averaging values over 24 h davs in the framework of kmc results of the simulations had to be compared to hms for computing the efficiency criteria therefore simulated dvs were retransformed into hourly values hvs a linear decomposition of dvs into hvs was thus necessary conversions from hourly values to daily values and then to hourly values again may significantly affect the quality of the simulation two biases were tested the effect of resampling decomposing and the way to resample from instantaneous or from average values one question raised by participants was if it was better to use average or instantaneous values therefore we made a comparison between reference hms and hourly values issued from the resampling of divs and davs the new time series are called hdivs and hdavs respectively fig 5 fig 6 shows that significant differences do exist between hms hdivs and hdavs most of the time instantaneous values hdivs show a better fit with hms than average values hdavs hdavs systematically underestimate peak flows and often overestimate the rising limb of the floods hdivs usually show a better fit with peak flow except when variations of peak flow are clearly shorter than one day e g the flood on dec 5th 1992 for this case the averaged value may provide a better fit hdivs better reproduce low flows than hdavs in summary hdavs show a more systematic bias than hdivs hdivs and hdavs are thus compared to hms using the provided efficiency criteria see table 3 in both cases it appears that vcc volume conservation coefficient is well conserved nash and kge are about 0 9 to 0 95 meaning that conversion from hourly to daily and then to hourly values again degrades the time series in the same order of magnitude of what is usually targeted and obtained with the best simulations it should be observed that nash and kge for hdivs are slightly better than those computed for hdavs vcc is a bit lower for hdavs which makes sense as hdvas systematically underestimate peak flows our advice for kmc was then to work at hourly time step as far as possible for simulations at the milandre test site but if this was not possible then teams were encouraged to use divs from hms to compare daily values obtained with their models finally as all teams were required to compute their final efficiency criteria at an hourly time step their simulated results if calculated at daily time step needed to be resampled into hourly data using a linear decomposition 5 results 5 1 overall performance as shown on fig 7 the different model forecasts generally seem to reproduce the correct order of magnitude of discharge rates for most of the prediction period models tend to underestimate discharge during recessions occurring after significant high water conditions e g march and june on fig 7 given that most models provided reasonable results quality criteria were then applied in order to identify strengths and weaknesses of the respective models the following comparison takes into account only the best prediction for the year 2016 provided by the participating teams most are obtained with calibration on years 2014 2015 but some used a mix with 1992 1995 as well in table 4 model results have been classified according to their final score as defined in chapter 3 effort is given as indication concerning kge and vcc all models are acceptable to good but none is very good forecasted curves for the year 2016 are given for all individual models in fig 8 the log scale provides a better view of the relative errors between the forecasted and the observed curve than the linear scale all models reproduce the overall shape of the curve of discharge variations covering periods of time of low flow and other periods with peaks the amplitude of the peaks is in the right order of a magnitude low flow conditions are correctly identified however a closer look shows that low flow conditions are rather poorly forecasted by most models whereby often the forecasted discharge rate is too low and too flat it appears that curves predicted by reservoir models and semi distributed models reproduce somehow better the observed behavior with many peaks from january to june and less peaks from july to october infoworks and krm1 are semi distributed models with their recharge processes based on reservoir models their curves are thus quite similar to those of reservoir models varkarst is based on a different approach it explicitly considers spatial variability and it can be seen that the peaks are pretty well predicted but the simulation does not reflect the observed behavior well during low flow conditions rcd seasonal oversimplifies recession during summer with just a single long recession the distributed models fail at forecasting low flow conditions as too many little peaks are produced and the subsequent recessions are much too quick peaks are underestimated in winter and overestimated in summer chlem which is a reservoir model produces curves which are similar to those of distributed models lumped models are not bad for the first half of the year but have a significant drift in the second part of the year with ann 2 performing better overall than the three others relative errors are given in fig 9 errors on peaks are of short duration but may be of considerable intensity usually larger than 400 positive or negative for some events along the year the flow rate during the recession in march is underestimated by most models cnn is the only model providing a prediction close to observations for this event varkarst karstmod and chlem are particularly low the main recession in july tends also to be underestimated by most models with gardenia karstflow and krm1 performing better than the others it is noticeable that most models using neural derived approaches display a significant drift in the last months of the simulations except the mlp model by classifying the relative errors we can display the percentage of the forecasted data hours year for which the error of the model is lower than a value fig 10 for instance the lstm model intense pale blue has 22 of the forecasted values with an error lower than 50 e g between 67 and 150 l s instead of 100 l s gardenia has 72 the higher is the curve the better the performance of the model 5 2 performance by flow components the observed times series was divided into four components rising limb of the peaks recession base flow and undetermined flow base flow was empirically determined when the discharge rate is decreasing over five successive hours with a rate lower than 1 l s per hour the latter component includes points which are not clearly related to one of the other three classes for the year 2016 the significance of the four components is given in table 5 in hours variations from one year to the other are in the order of 5 each value of the observed curve is attributed to one single flow component for the forecasted curves the components of the observed curve are used for the separation meaning that all models are compared on the basis of the same components as can be seen on fig 11 most values belonging to the undetermined flow correspond in fact to base flow conditions they could not be attributed to base flow because they include slight increases of the discharge rate which may be related to some technical problems e g temperature variations on the electronics or changes of the atmospheric pressure which are not perfectly corrected the respective models have specific results for each component gardenia has among the best performances for most criteria and components this is less the case for varkarst especially concerning volume conservation vcc most models have one component with kge close to or below 0 5 nash criteria is low for base flow in most models chlem cfp modified and rcd seasonal three models with the lowest scores are better than most other models for base flow according to vcc and kge the nash criteria is quite poor for most models as this criterium cannot be good for a trending time series as the mean value is taken as reference in the denominator of the nash sutcliff formula other quality criteria have also been calculated for the respective models mainly mean squared error and the variance test however these criteria do not provide more information than those presented in table 6 5 3 comparison of calibrated parameters given that the models are based on different concepts their parameters are all different and cannot be compared directly some aspects however can be roughly compared for several models i e catchment size storage capacity conduit diffuse flow components 5 3 1 catchment size in karst regions catchment size is never known exactly and so this was considered to be a calibration parameter by some of the models the calibrated size area varies between 11 6 and 16 24 km2 which ranges between 9 and 28 of the assessed surface area 12 7 km2 the main reason for these variations is related to the model applied for assessing evapotranspiration the size was calibrated to adjust the water balance on the calibration period neural networks models do not provide any catchment size the role of this parameter is approached by a series of unidentified functions and parameters 5 3 2 storage capacity the attenuation between recharge and discharge is related to the characteristics of the storage in all models however the way it is generated is different in the respective models most models have quick and slow storages included somehow which reflects what is commonly accepted in karst aquifers since the 1970s as summarized e g by bakalowicz 2005 their number and characteristics are however different and hardly comparable it may be only mathematical or based on the infilling of a reservoir or on the routing of water etc somehow all models generate peaks within 0 2 5 days after a rain event and a base flow usually corresponding to the emptying of some kind of reservoir or mathematical function with slow recession keeping water flowing out of the system over more than 6 months without recharge the storage volume of this slow component is in the order of 100 250 mm 5 3 3 conduit diffuse flow components another long lasting debate among karst hydrogeologist see e g bakalowicz 2005 is about the ratio between the quick flow component assumed to be related to conduits and the slow flow component assumed to be related to matrix or diffuse flow from our results we were hoping to be able to compare the amount of recharge flowing through both components of the respective models however as every model has a different architecture and concept this could hardly be done the only thing we can compare is the amount of peak flow rising limb and recession and base flow including undetermined flow for each model the comparison shows however that differences between models are not very significant the amount of peak flow ranging between 64 and 78 and the volume of base flow ranging between 22 and 36 6 discussion and model comparison the comparison shows that forecasted curves with similar values for their quality criteria may have different shapes this illustrates the fact that quality criteria for model comparison could still be improved our first assessment of the results was that all models produced fair to good simulations however this assessment is probably rather qualitative than quantitative indeed when looking at relative errors we realized that most models produce values with errors larger than 50 for about 50 of the time or more results are clearly worse during low flow conditions absolute differences are low during these periods of time but relative ones are significant by looking at the respective curves fig 8 and at the relative errors fig 9 one can say that the three criteria we selected are not sufficient to characterize the overall quality of the results for instance the shape of the curve forecasted by the varkarst model reproduces very well the peaks be very poorly the values during the dry season gardenia is better for base flow but still include significant differences in march and october of the simulated year the fact that most models obviously tend to underestimate or poorly reproduce low flow e g lstm or varkarst could be related to the way calibration is implemented it is usually mainly targeted on minimising the squared errors metric which gives much weight to the peaks and not much to low flow values a criterium minimizing relative errors instead of absolute errors could possibly improve the weighting of base flow conditions in the overall results another option could also be to calibrate the parameters which control base flow first as they not dependent much on the recharge model and then to calibrate the other parameters on the residuals of this first calibration step in the case of rcd seasonal and possibly varkarst the main reason for the poor forecasting of low flow conditions seems to be related to the recharge model which completely fails to produce any recharge between june and november or december the water deficit in the recharge reservoir is obviously too high over this period compared to the reality interestingly the spatial distribution of precipitation appeared not to be significant and was abandoned along the process in agreement with all participants obviously the number of recharge event for which differences are significant e g summer storms is low this may be the case for the milandrine khs which is small and located in a temperate and hilly region this may be different for a larger catchment with more relief and contrasting climate krm 1 model is the only model for which land use was taken into consideration however this does not appear to improve the results in a way to produce better results than the other models the number of parameters in the respective models ranges between less than 10 and several thousands despite automatic calibration optimization procedures models with less parameters tend to be better than the models with many parameters i e distributed models did not provide better results than global ones not considering catchment characteristics in the respective models could be a reason for this therefore it seems that the transformation between meteorological parameters and discharge rates is mainly controlled by a few general characteristics of the system such as size recharge process and one or two storages rather than by the detailed spatial distribution of parameters controlling these modellers using neural networks with many parameters claimed that data delivered for calibration were not sufficient as no basic structure is provided in their models compared to the models based upon a more physical function they have to build this structure using data they require therefore at least 15 years of data without any gap which is challenging these observations raise the question of uncertainty and overfitting associated with numerical models in fact we can probably conclude that the best models are as good as the data we provided modflow cfpv2 and karstflow are fully distributed models these models are based on the principle that the transformation of the input signal into the output one is mainly related to the characteristics of the aquifer this approach is more deductive than for the other models because these models are constructed from the supposed characteristics of the catchment and of the aquifer a consequence is that the recharge part of the models is simplified this is the main reason why peaks in the summer season are strongly exaggerated with both models see fig 8 for the given exercise this approach is also not the most efficient as it requires more work for digitizing a lot of data but at the end the results include more bias than many other models because recharge was not considered properly would a spatial discretization of the model parameters improve the results whilst this was not explicitly investigated in this research we can argue that the main discrepancy of these models is related to too large peaks in summer which seem to be more related to an oversimplification of the recharge model rather than to the spatialization of the model parameters recharge seems therefore really to be the key factor in the present case on the contrary lumped parameter models are more inductive because they include less or no constraining hypotheses the disadvantage is that none of their parameters can be compared somehow with natural characteristics not even the size of the catchment area they provide purely functional results another problem is that they require long and continuous data sets for learning the input output relationship of a natural flow system in semi and fully distributed models the spatial distribution of recharge land use vegetation precipitation can be taken into account however as the performance of these models turned out to be no better than results of similar models reservoir which did not take it into account one can infer that at least in the present case study the role of spatial distribution of the recharge is low the effect of spatial distribution was however not analysed in any depth and so could be further investigated e g bittner et al 2018 gill et al 2020 as the milandre site is rather flat small and without allogenic recharge the use of a complimentary catchment area with more contrasted conditions would probably be better for this analysis it should be noted that the relative significance of the spatial distribution of recharge function in any models will vary according to the characteristics of the karst catchment being simulated for example whether there is significant allogenic recharge or not the size of the catchment area and or the steepness of the topography may all be important factors an evaluation of the number of parameters hydrologically constrained in a rainfall runoff model in surface hydrology was investigated by jakeman and hornberger 1993 they show that most hydrological systems are well described by models with 4 to 6 parameters the contribution of any supplementary parameter seems to be within the data uncertainty related to monitoring data this explains somehow the fact that in our study models with many parameters greater than20 do not provide better results than those with less parameters in karst it is difficult to obtain reasonable results with less than 6 parameters three for the routing and three for the transformation of precipitation to recharge because of some visible threshold processes in karst systems 9 parameters seems to be a more reasonable minimum table 1 indicates that some of the models had less than 9 parameters however they include implicit assumptions fixing some of the parameters e g distribution functions fixed topology or geometry etc jakeman and hornberger 1993 also suggest that a standardized simple model could be applied systematically to any hydrological system this would help comparing systems characteristics and identifying drifts in data related to technical or natural reasons e g climate change the model comparison presented in our paper could therefore be a good basis for defining such a standardized karst model 7 conclusion and outlook 7 1 conclusion before making a conclusion it is important to have in mind that the comparison between the models was only carried out a one year simulation period due to the non stationary nature of hydrologic phenomena some models could be very good for one kind of situation and not so good for others the presented interpretations must thus be considered as snapshot interpretations compared to a similar exercise conducted for surface catchment holländer et al 2009 all models performed reasonably well although they are based on strongly different modelling approaches all models lead to reasonable and somehow similar results for the proposed exercise input output hydrological modelling despite considerable simplifications with respect to reality gardenia provides excellent results in the present case it fits the observed data almost within the range of uncertainty on the data themselves however despite very good scores the forecasted hydrograph displays significant differences with the observed one especially in low water conditions this is even more obvious for results issued from varkarst model apart from the different aspects of the modelling approach it can also be concluded from the modelling exercise that recharge is crucial in the modelling of any precipitation discharge relationship more specifically it can be observed that the real evapotranspiration must be carefully approached otherwise models will fail at reproducing discharge rates from precipitation data at least in temperate regions it can even be inferred that hydrogeological processes taking place within the aquifer are subsidiary compared to recharge processes taking place in the soil and epikarst lumped parameters models are interesting options if they can include non linear functions and adequate parameters for taking evapotranspiration into account regarding ann models their limitation is that they require long and complete datasets for calibration and validation and that they usually do not provide any physical indication about the real system even if this knowledge extraction has been successfully attempted as suggested by kong a siou et al 2013 and darras et al 2015 these models remain mainly functional taking into account the limited duration covered by the available data several anns show an acceptable behavior from the comparison as well as from tests of some models on other sites it also seems that the order and priority in which the calibration of the models is carried out has a strong effect on the result calibrating base flow first and peak flow afterwards appears to improve the results this point was not properly investigated in this study and should be further examined some physical reasons could support this idea as storage characteristics of karst aquifer are probably relevant concerning base flow as this part of the hydrograph is more independent on recharge processes it may be meaningful to calibrate the storage components of the models first using one or two storage reservoirs this is also supported by ideas derived from kovacs et al 2005 then the recharge model must focus on modelling the difference between precipitation and the assessed base flow it should also be highlighted here that the scoring scheme used to evaluate of strengths and weaknesses needs to be adapted for the purpose for the model is being developed for models used to provide flood assessments may not be assessed in the same way as those models focussing on the implications of low flow drought conditions the scores for the respective flow components table 5 shows the differences between the respective models it should be noted here that some of the modelling approaches could be combined in order to use their respective strengths for instance semi distributed models could be used in combination with neural methods in order to improve their recharge assessment component such optimizations will need to be adjusted to specific conditions of the site available data and question to be addressed 7 2 outlook in the case of the milandre catchment area only one model krm1 within the challenge attempted to take the spatial distribution of evapotranspiration land use into account this did not improve the model results in a measurable way however as real evapotranspiration is very significant and as we know that this differentiation is necessary in catchments with stronger altitudinal gradients it would be meaningful to further investigate this aspect this report covers the very first step of a model comparison it was focused only on the temporal discharge response of the spring to recharge events we would like to expand the challenge to further aspects of the modelling of karst hydrogeology the next step is to take into account the spatial distribution of flow and heads within the aquifer a first question with this respect is the fact that the discharge rate given at the spring for the challenge in reality corresponds to the flow rate coming out of three different springs font saivu and bâme which are located several hundred meters apart we also have head measurements at various locations within the aquifer and it would be interesting to see how various modelling approaches could reproduce those data for this new exercise it seems that lumped models will be hardly usable and that distributed models will be more adequate it will be therefore interesting to see how the respective teams will adapt their approach for this new challenge once heads and discharge rates will be approached we will try to simulate flow velocities and some transport processes for which we also acquired data this may also result in better performance of the models to the overall flows simulated in step 1 as some parameters will be better constrained credit authorship contribution statement pierre yves jeannin conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation resources data curation writing original

4392,the design of hydraulic structures for water control is based on the principle of accepting that structures might fail to fulfill their intended purpose as consequence of extreme yet rare events producing damages traditionally structures are sized to resist to a design event i e a hyetograph or hydrograph associated to a fixed probability of occurrence this implicitly assumes that the probability of structure failure equals that of the hydrological load although unjustified under general conditions indeed structure failure also depends on the failure mechanism which is a characteristic of the specific structure and problem at hand ruling the interaction between the hydrological load and the structure itself to overcome the limitations of the hydrological design event approach we provide here a general consistent structure based risk framework for design or risk assessment the framework combines the multivariate statistical distribution of the hydrological process and the hydraulic response of the structure remarkably it reduces the potential complexity of the problem to the statistical analysis of the univariate probability distribution of the damage i e the consequence of structure failure the approach is exemplified for an offline reservoir for flood mitigation by adopting both a simplified routing model and a monte carlo procedure based on a detailed hydrodynamic simulation results demonstrate the potential of the framework regardless of the accuracy of the modeling approach adopted for its implementation specifically the framework allows disentangling the roles of the different design parameters involved by providing clear indications for practitioners keywords design risk assessment hydraulic structures water control damage offline reservoir multivariate probability distribution 1 introduction the design of civil structures is based on the principle of assuming a predefined level of risk the so called residual risk in essence we accept that the system fails to fulfill its intended purpose under specific typically rare conditions caused by the occurrence of natural or man made hazardous events for each specific system the accepted level of risk is determined by balancing the consequences of failure the direct and indirect economic damages to environment and society and the costs for system realization operation and maintenance since risk is defined as the expected value of the probability distribution of damage risk based design requires the identification and quantification of all those components determining the probability of system failure and then of damage that is the overall economic loss e g tung et al 2006 pp 427 438 failure occurrence and damage depend on the system exposure resistance and robustness see e g varnes 1984 and straub 2005 exposure is the probability of occurrence of the potential hazards to the considered system resistance includes all intermediate processes and elements which may modify the exposure within the system among which the failure mechanisms while robustness describes how the system and the surrounding environment react on the hazardous events producing damages the design problem is usually very complex potentially involving several methods and models whose implementation depend on the specific problem and goal at hand the method traditionally used for the design of hydraulic structures relies on the assumption of a hydrological design event which is a synthetic event e g hyetograph or hydrograph that is associated to a predetermined probability of occurrence typically measured in terms of return period vogel and castellarin 2017 volpi et al 2015 volpi 2019 this probability is set equal to an acceptable probability of system failure then the structure is sized to resist to such predetermined hydrological load implicitly assuming that the probability of system failure equals the one of the hydrological load the above traditional method generally does not correspond to the risk based criterion previously described for several reasons 1 the a priori assumption of an acceptable return period of system failure does not account for the cost benefit ratio where benefit is nothing else than risk reduction with respect to ante operam natural conditions paik 2008 hence such approach does not provide a cost optimal solution for the design problem apart from very simple cases as demonstrated by botto et al 2014 2 the adoption of a single return period value limits the estimation of damage to a single value instead of providing its entire probability distribution and its expected value i e the risk r 3 using a single return period value might have other consequences as highlighted by balistrocchi et al 2013 when a structure is sized according to a large return period it might perform poorly with respect to minor events or if a small return period is employed the device might be ineffective during extreme events such a behavior depends on the specific structure and on the particular goal of the case at hand 4 the return period of the structure failure generally does not correspond to that of the hydrological load i e the design event that might be due to the assumption of a design storm event an approach largely criticized in past literature works see among others adams and howard 1986 knighton and walter 2016 grimaldi et al 2012 yet one the most important factor determining this difference is the missed representation of the mechanisms of structure failure i e the interaction between the hydrological load and the structure this issue was discussed in deep by volpi and fiori 2014 and balistrocchi et al 2017 with reference to the design of an inline reservoir thus a reliable estimation of both the damage probability density function pdf and risk its expected value requires to account for the complex stochastic variability of the hydrological processes and for any mechanism of failure that is relevant for the problem at hand embedding the interactions between the hydrological event and the system see e g requena et al 2013 tomirotti and mignosa 2017 following coles and tawn 1994 and volpi and fiori 2014 denoted the latter relationship as structure function the use of continuous time simulation boughton and droop 2003 hoes and nelen 2005 beneyto et al 2020 grimaldi et al 2020 allows to overcome all the limitations of the hydrological design event approach that are mentioned above but only if the complex interaction between the structure and the hydrological load is integrated into the probabilistic estimation framework this general approach includes numerical simulation of rainfall see e g koutsoyiannis and langousis 2010 papalexiou 2018 runoff generation and rainfall runoff transformation grimaldi et al 2020 simplified methods based on analytical solutions guo and adams 1999 paik 2008 camici et al 2011 balistrocchi et al 2013 or multivariate statistical representations of the main characteristics of the hydrological process of interest volpi and fiori 2014 balistrocchi et al 2017 following volpi and fiori 2014 we provide here a general framework for hydraulic structure design or assessment using a structure based risk approach the proposed approach properly combines i the multivariate statistical representation of the hydrological process of interest and ii the hydraulic response of the structure to the environmental load note that the specific methods adopted here such as the representation of the hydrological process through the joint probability distribution of its interesting features or the damage function are already available in the literature yet they are combined here in a comprehensive coherent and structure goal oriented framework the latter generally accounts for all the mechanisms of structure failure through the corresponding structure functions despite the potential complexity of the whole system the approach proposed here reduces the high number of statistical variables involved in problem definition to a single relevant random variable that is the damage the general mathematical framework for the structure based risk approach is illustrated in section 2 the approach is exemplified here for an offline reservoir for flood mitigation this structure is selected because it offers enough complexity e g its design requires the definition of the whole hydrograph shape through peak volume and time to peak yet allowing for simplifications that result in an analytical solution for the sake of clarity we limit our analysis to a single general failure condition and in section 3 we make use of simplified routing model a real world case study follows section 4 and its results are compared to those obtained by using the simplified routing method of section 3 a simple damage discharge function is used in both the cases a conclusions section closes the paper providing the main conclusions and general guidelines to the design problem for practitioners 2 mathematical framework for structure based risk assessment or design the key point is the evaluation of the probability distribution function of the damage and in summary of the risk r i e its expected value the damage is the ultimate quantity that guides the design of a new structure or the assessment of an existing one in the following we illustrate the mathematical framework for the probabilistic estimation of damage where we denote the random variables by underlined symbols and the deterministic variables by the plain form while vectors are indicated by bold symbols the damage d follows a probability distribution function whose shape depends on several parameters for a specific structure and goal of the problem we can define a vector of relevant parameters that includes all the variables describing the structure the hydrological load acting on it the interaction among the two above taking into account all the relevant mechanisms of structure failure the robustness or conversely vulnerability of the inundated area let us assume i a structure defined by a vector of design parameters θ θ j with j 1 n such as levee height width distance from the main channel etc and ii the hydrological load determined by a vector η η k with k 1 l in the case of levee systems as an example the hydrological load is represented by the flow discharge in the river whose characteristics of interest e g peak volume duration and time to peak depend on the mechanisms of system failure that is relevant for the specific problem at hand levee failure due to overtopping is directly related to the maximum flow discharge in the river while in case of piping the duration of the flood is also relevant based on the above assumptions the damage d is a function of θ and η and its shape is determined by the different relevant mechanism of structure failure denoted as m and the robustness r or vulnerability of the affected area being d m r θ η the latter accounts for the so called structure function the relationship determining the response of the structure to the hydrological load it also accounts for the interaction of the hydrological load with the environment such as the propagation of the flood volume in the inundated areas and possible negative effects on settlements and infrastructures the risk is obtained by integrating the damage d with respect to its pdf p d d 1 r m r θ d p d d d d d m r θ η p η η 1 η l d η 1 d η l where p η η 1 η l is the joint probability density function characterizing the hydrological load we recall that the probability distribution of damage accounts for both the occurrence of structure failure and its consequences on the affected area the structure failure depends as well on the same quantities characterizing the damage apart from the system robustness a simplified representation of the structure failure is through the random variable f m θ η the latter follows a bernoulli distribution so that it is equal to 0 with probability 1 p f when the structure resists and equal to 1 with probability p f when it fails with p f the expected value e f m the return period of structure failure is a useful quantity to characterize the probabilistic behaviour of the system especially for communication purpose it is simply expressed by t f 1 p f computing the return period of structure failure t f the probability distribution of damage p d θ η and the risk r m r is generally a complex problem involving several steps and models as depicted in fig 1 starting from the specific structure and goal at hand the relevant structure parameters θ θ j j 1 n are identified some of these could be already determined from previous analyses or constrained due to system peculiarities while the others need to be established based on the balance between costs and benefits i e risk reduction the specific goal also drives the identification of the m relevant mechanisms of structure failure and as a consequence of the hydrological load η η k with k 1 l acting on the system i e the exposure as previously mentioned intermediate processes and elements may modify the exposure within the system that is the resistance in case of flooding those elements might include the propagation of the discharge along the river where discharge is the hydrological load the interaction between the discharge and the structure e g levee inline or offline reservoir for flood mitigation etc and the propagation of the flood within the inundated area robustness determines the interaction of the flood with humans exposed assets and environment all those elements generally require to be represented through a model our aim here is not to discuss the type of model that can be used for the scope but rather to exemplify how the overall procedure applies as function of the problem at hand before providing a practical example it is convenient to classify the above framework into specific simple cases as function of the problem complexity without loss of generality the complexity of the problem is represented here by the number of structure parameter involved θ j with j 1 n and the number of random variables describing the hydrological load η k with k 1 l the cases are listed in the following n l 1 this is the simplest and classical case in which the design depends on a single parameter like e g the levee height which in turn depends on a single random variable characterizing the hydrological load e g discharge in such a case the structure function is usually a bijective increasing function of the random variable of interest so that the larger is the load the bigger the structure under this assumption and since the same behaviour rules the damage in the inundated area the probability cumulative distribution function of the damage equals that pertaining to the hydrological load in other words the corresponding values of the two random variables share the same return period this justifies the assumption of a design event approach as an example we have n l 1 when we want to determine the height of a levee supposing that the width is already established and that the only relevant mechanism of failure is overtopping levee failure occurs when the maximum water level in the river generally determined by the flood peak exceeds the levee height so that the area beside is inundated by the flood n 1 l 1 when the relevant characteristics of the hydrological load are more than one and in general not statistically independent among each other it is not possible to establish a bijective relationship between the hydrological load η and the size of the structure that is again represented here by a single quantity θ this case was discussed in depth by volpi and fiori 2014 who proposed the adoption of the structure based approach for design and risk assessment of hydraulic structures demonstrating that the assumption of a hydrological design event is not theoretically justified in the paper it is shown how the return period of failure of the spillway of an inline reservoir for flood mitigation is determined by the statistical variability of flood peak and volume and by their interaction with the structure that is represented by the discharge flowing through out the spillway n 1 l 1 this is the most general case where the structure sizing requires the determination of several parameters θ n 1 generally speaking the problem might be undetermined because several parameter combinations may result in the same value of the objective function that is risk reduction with respect to structure cost this is the case of interest for the present work and it is discussed in the sequel through the relevant example of an offline reservoir for flood mitigation 3 design of offline detention basins for flood mitigation based on a simplified modeling approach 3 1 simplified modeling approach in order to illustrate and exemplify the general methodological framework introduced in the previous section we consider in the following the design of an unregulated offline reservoir for flood mitigation the reservoir located sideways of the river temporarily stores excess water from the river such as to mitigate the river discharge downstream keeping it lower than a given threshold value q 0 above which the system fails due e g to levee overtopping a return period t is typically associated to q 0 a sketch of the river reservoir system is provided in fig 2 a water is transferred between the river and the reservoir by an unregulated side spillway of length l s an overflow spillway and a bottom outlet are typically present in the reservoir the hydraulic behavior of the system depends mainly on the length l s and height h s of the spillway sill which corresponds to a given discharge value q s we assume a bijective relation between discharge and levels and the maximum storage capacity of the reservoir w max in the following we simplify the system by assuming an ideal side spillway i e for l s such that the excess discharge q u q s where q u is the discharge upstream the reservoir is completely transferred to the reservoir if the latter fills completely it becomes immaterial and the river discharge is unaffected by it thus the system dynamic depends only on q s and w max the spillway length l s and all the other control structures present in the reservoir do not play any role in the determination of the downstream discharge q d under the above ideal assumptions the hydrological load is represented by the upstream hydrograph q u for simplicity and without loss of generality we assume a triangular shape for the flood event as represented in fig 2b q p denotes the peak flow v the total volume and δ 2 v q p the duration of the flood event the time to peak is given by t p α δ with α 0 1 along the ideal behaviour of the spillway reservoir system the downstream discharge is always less than or equal to the threshold value q s when the reservoir capacity is not a limiting factor the latter condition occurs when the reservoir capacity w max is larger that the volume of the incoming hydrograph above the threshold q s fig 2b v s as expressed in the following 2 v s v q p q s 2 q p 2 when w max v s the flood attenuation downstream the reservoir depends on the reservoir capacity itself the approximate solution for the peak discharge downstream q see fig 2b is given by 3 q q p if q p q s q s if q p q s and v s w max q s q p q s 2 v q p w max 1 α v if q p q s and w max v s w max α q p if q p q s and v s w max α where q denotes the peak of the discharge wave after the reservoir the simplified reservoir routing model considered here has some similarities to that proposed by guo and adams 1999 for inline reservoirs and subsequently applied by balistrocchi et al 2013 to both inline and offline reservoirs alike previous model the approach adopted here allows to effectively disentangle how the structure parameters the threshold discharge q s and the storage capacity w max affect the probability distribution of the damage additionally the model used here includes explicitly the effect of the flood peak position represented by the coefficient α fig 2b shows that in the case of flood mitigation reservoirs as in other relevant hydrological applications both the flood peak and the flood volume are essential factors thus the bivariate analysis of the joint probability distribution of the associated variables is generally more meaningful than the univariate one we denote here p q p v the joint cumulative distribution function cdf of the upstream peak flow q p and volume v as previously mentioned also the peak position α plays a role see eq 3 in the case analyzed here the position of the peak α is assumed to be a constant however the problem could be generalized by treating it as a random variable and introducing the joint probability of flood peak volume and peak position in summary the failure mechanism is determined by the sole downstream peak flow q while the hydrological load is determined by the joint cdf of natural peak discharge q p and volume v and the system response is controlled by the two design quantities q s w max with reference to the general framework of section 2 we have n 2 and l 2 we remind that under non ideal behavior the number of parameters is bound to increase including for instance l s and the variables controlling the outlets the use of the downstream discharge as a measure of the structure failure means that the latter might occur either because of exceeding water levels in the river resulting in the overtopping of the levee or because the downstream discharge does not meet the requirement of being smaller than q s due to the inadequacy of structure sizing the latter condition is denoted as hydrological failure by paik 2008 it is necessary to point out that the definition of the structure function eq 3 is generally much more complicated because of the multiple and complex failure mechanisms that might affect the system indeed besides the common failure mechanism that is considered here other mechanisms could be relevant for the specific goal at hand among these we can mention levee collapse due to overtopping or piping which might even suddenly determine very large flow discharges downstream as further example hydraulic structures that modify river regime e g a dam can cause an imbalance in sediment transport on the catchment leading to a variety of hydraulic and environmental problems determining risk conditions moreover the probability distribution of damage might be influenced by unusual combination of unfavorable events including operational ones which individually are not safety critical such as the partial or total obstruction of the outlet or the spillway or the error in reservoir level measurement for regulated reservoirs see e g hartford 2016 and micovic et al 2016 noteworthy in order to account for broader failure conditions with respect to those considered here more complex hydrodynamic models should be used e g including sediment transport thanks to the simplicity of the response model adopted here the probability distribution function of the peak discharge p q can be obtained by integration of the joint pdf of the random variables q p and v characterizing the hydrological load acting on the structure by employing standard statistical analysis see e g papoulis 1991 p 135 4 p q q d q p q p v q p v dq p dv where d q is the region of the q p v plane such that g q p v q the relationship g between the variables q p v and q that can be derived by eq 3 is the structure function volpi and fiori 2014 the domain d q for the simplified model at hand reads as 5 d q q p q 0 v if q q s 0 q p 0 v q p 2 q p q s 2 if q q s 0 q p q 0 v q q p 0 v q p 2 q p q s 2 1 α q q s 2 if q q s for more realistic and complex modeling approaches of the river reservoir system the solution of the integral in eq 4 can be obtained by using monte carlo method as extensively discussed in the case study presented in section 4 in the following subsections we i show how the simplified modeling approach discussed here can be applied for the design of a detention basin and ii compare results with those obtained by using a standard univariate or bivariate event based approach 3 2 illustrative example we evaluate here the cdf of downstream discharge q by employing eqs 4 and 5 for a few combinations of the parameters characterizing the system eq 4 depends on the particular shape of the joint probability distribution p q p v in the present example we consider a bivariate lognormal distribution see e g yue 2000 the latter is upper tail independent such that the simultaneous occurrence of the extremes is neglected although such feature may play an important role in risk estimation poulin et al 2007 its assessment is beyond the scopes of the illustrative example considered here in order to obtain general results all the quantities are expressed in dimensionless terms the random variables are normalized with respect to their geometric means since this allows for a standardization of the corresponding marginal probability functions indeed the marginals of the dimensionless hydrological variables q p q p e μ ln q p and v v e μ ln v normalized with respect to the corresponding geometric mean are fully described by the parameters σ ln q p and σ ln v which are the standard deviations of the logarithm of the variables for simplicity the superscript is not reported and all the variables used in this section are intended to be dimensionless the dependence structure is defined through the parameter ρ which is the pearson correlation coefficient between the variables ln q p and ln v the correlation coefficient between q p and v is given by ρ q p v e ρ σ 2 1 e σ 2 1 for the sake of illustration we assume in the following σ σ ln q p σ ln v 0 5 and two values of the parameter ρ ρ 0 which is the limiting of independent variables and ρ 0 8 the chosen values may pertain to medium to large catchments see e g volpi and fiori 2012 3 3 results fig 3 depicts the cdf p q blue line and p q p black line i e the peak discharge distribution after and before the realization of the detention basin for a combination of dimensionless peak discharge q s and basin volume w max as previously discussed p q depends on the joint pdf p q p v and the domain of integration d q eq 5 both quantities are shown as example in fig 4 for the case of panel a of fig 3 and the domain d q is depicted for q q s 0 75 thin blue line q 2 and q 3 thick black lines the difference p q p q p reflects the beneficial impact of the basin in reducing the occurrence of the peak discharge such difference is maximum at q q s where a jump occurs whose size depends only on w max and is independent on the shape of the hydrograph α instead for q q s p q is controlled by α as shown in panel a for α 0 0 5 1 0 i e for early centered and late flood peak the beneficial effects of the basin in increasing the cdf i e reducing the frequency of the related events persist for q q s as function of the volume of the basin w max compare panels a and b in particular p q p q p approaches zero for increasing q at a rapidity which is inverse proportional to w max increasing the spillway height i e q s extends the frequency reduction to larger discharges for a given w max at the expense of discharges smaller than q s whose frequency is obviously unaffected by the basin if q 0 is the discharge value that leads to system failure under natural conditions i e before reservoir construction a natural choice would be to select q s q 0 whenever possible in such a case we have a single design variable w max i e n 1 and p q s is the probability of system failure 1 p f based on this assumption we evaluate the reduction of the exceeding probability of q s i e the inverse of the increase of the return period of q s as function of the storage capacity as previously mentioned the increase of q s return period does not depend on α see comments to fig 3 results are shown in fig 5 a for σ 0 5 and ρ 0 8 which are the reference parameters here the larger is the threshold critical discharge q s the smaller is the storage capacity producing a significant reduction of the failure probability downstream fig 5b depicts the relationship between the storage capacity and the threshold discharge when the return period of structure failure is set equal to a predefined value in the figure we consider t f 100 years and we show the storage capacity w t that is necessary to set the probability of failure equal to 1 1 100 for the reference parameters values blue solid line results are compared to those pertaining to the case of independent random variables i e ρ 0 blue dashed line which requires a smaller reservoir capacity w t to guarantee the same probability of failure with reference to the effect of the variance of the marginal distributions it is easy to check that the required storage capacity w t is enhanced by the variability of the hydrological load not shown in the figure fig 5b also provides information about the differences among the general approach used here represented by eqs 4 5 and the one based on the assumption of a hydrological design event as mentioned in the introduction section the hydrological design event can be defined based on the statistical behavior of the peak discharge univariate design event green solid line in the figure or on the joint statistical behaviour of peak discharge and volume bivariate design event black solid and dashed lines in the univariate case we usually determine the design event as the hydrograph with peak value equal to p q p 1 1 1 t then we define the hydrograph based on an average shape that typically depends on the upstream catchment characteristics and the rainfall runoff method used to simulate the flood event here we assume that the volume scale linearly with the flood peak which implies that we are assuming the same average duration δ for all the flood events or in other words a perfect correlation between the variables ruling the hydrological load in dimensionless terms the required storage capacity is equal to 6 w t q s δ p q p 1 1 1 t p q p 1 1 1 t q s 2 2 p q p 1 1 1 t 2 where δ 2 under the reference scenario it is p t q p 1 1 1 t 3 20 for t 100 in this case the hydrological load is determined by the behaviour of a single random variable and the return period of structure failure equals by definition that of the hydrological load compare volpi and fiori 2014 as also discussed in section 2 the univariate case overestimates the required storage capacity when the correlation between flood peak q p and volume v is weak this is expected to occur more likely in small to medium size catchments in the bivariate design event approach we have infinite design events sharing the same joint return period value t we consider here the most likely peak volume combination q p v p q p v 1 1 1 t as identified by volpi and fiori 2012 the required storage capacity is 7 w t q s v q p q s 2 q p 2 where q p v 3 51 and for ρ 0 8 and 3 62 for ρ 0 the use of the design event approach in a bivariate setting black lines leads to an overestimation of the required storage capacity w t even larger than adopting the univariate design event approach coherent with previous findings volpi and fiori 2014 the differences among the design parameters evaluated by the structure based multivariate framework and the classical design event based approaches reduce for increasing values of the correlation coefficient between the hydrological variables as shown in fig 5b compare black to blue lines where solid lines refer to ρ 0 8 and ρ 0 respectively the overestimation obtained by applying the design event approach may be enhanced by a high dispersion of the joint probability distribution volpi and fiori 2014 if for any reason we cannot set q s q 0 the return period of system failure cannot be controlled up to the desired value in such a case we can use a different criterion for reservoir sizing that is accepting that failure might occur for q 0 q q s with moderate although frequent damages yet maximising the overall benefit compared to cost while the probability of failure remains the same hence we evaluate the overall benefit for a given q 0 value by changing both q s and w max where q s is bounded below by q 0 the case q s is smaller than q 0 is not of interest since it always results in a smaller benefit the design condition considered here corresponds to n 2 the benefit is obtained as the reduction of risk i e the expected value of the probability distribution of the damage d hence we compute risk with and without the reservoir as function of the main controlling parameters and we take the difference between the two the relation damage discharge is assumed for simplicity as power law i e d q β where β is the robustness parameter based on the latter assumption that leads to p d p q p and p d p q the benefit b is written as 8 b p q p q 0 1 q β dp q p p q q 0 1 q β dp q results are shown in fig 8a as function of q s and w max for the reference parameter values σ 0 5 ρ 0 8 for α 0 5 and β 1 while α is irrelevant for the probability of failure p f it might rule the benefit b because the latter depends on the whole shape of the probability distribution p q q q q s see fig 3a the figure shows how the benefit reaches it maximum value when the threshold tends to zero and the storage capacity tends to infinite which is a rather obvious and expected result in the realistic case of limited storage capacity see e g the value w max which is represented in the figure by the black dashed line the maximum benefit is obtained for threshold values larger than zero in summary the smaller the storage capacity the larger the optimum threshold denoted in the figure as q s the above behaviour is slightly affected by the position of the peak fig 8b upper panels when moving the peak from early time α 0 to late time α 1 the benefit reduces as expected and the optimum threshold increases in turn the effect of the exponent β of the power law relationship on the benefit is much stronger especially in terms of the overall benefit lower panels for β 2 the benefit is larger and the same is for the optimum threshold the behavior confirms the importance of considering all components exposure resistance and robustness in the design procedure as they are deeply intertwined 4 case study chiani river italy we show here how the general framework provided in this work can be applied for the design of an offline reservoir along an italian river considering the natural characteristics of the river system and focusing on the actual behaviour of the reservoir inlet structure as measured by both the spillway height and length this deviates from the simplified routing model considered in the previous section where we assumed an ideal behaviour of the inlet structure neglecting the role of its length we investigate the optimal dimensions of the morrano detention basin along the chiani river central italy as illustrated in fig 7 the chiani river originates near cittá della pieve from the confluence of the astrone river with the chianetta river and it is the main tributary of the paglia river the chiani river catchment covers an area of about 450 km2 and depicts a plateau gorge pattern where the flatter and longer hillslopes are located in the upper or middle part of the catchment the chiani river is about 42 km long up to the confluence with the paglia river only the lower portion of 11 5 km is analysed here 4 1 setup of the numerical experiment the hydraulic behaviour of the detention basin depends on all the parameters θ j with j 1 n namely the height and length of the inlet and overflow spillway and the dimension of the bottom outlet since we want to focus on the design of the inlet spillway we assume all the other parameters already determined the maximum storage capacity of the reservoir is generally constrained by the extent of the area that is free from human settlement being equal to 2 04 10 6 m3 for the present case the overflow spillway is supposed to be long enough such that its level equal to 143 5 m a s l determines the maximum water level in the reservoir thus the n 2 design parameters are the height of the inlet spillway that is represented in terms of the corresponding discharge through the local stage discharge relationship q s and the length l s as in the illustrative example discussed in the previous section the hydrologic load acting on the system is represented by the joint statistical behaviour of the flood peak q p and volume v i e l 2 joint values of flow peak annual maximum and the corresponding volume around the peak for a time window of about 12 h are calculated based upon the observed water level available at the morrano station see fig 7 from 1948 to 2014 and the stage discharge relationship bencivenga et al 2001 due to missing data we have available 48 years of observation we inferred a joint probability distribution function to the available data p q p v assuming a lognormal and gamma distribution functions to represent the marginal statistical behavior of q p and v respectively while the dependence structure between the two variables is fitted by a gumbel hougaard copula the latter is characterized by a positive upper tail dependence the mean and standard deviation of the lognormal distribution are approximately 170 and 125 m3 s those pertaining to the gamma distribution are 3 45 10 6 and 2 56 10 6 m3 finally the pearson correlation coefficient is equal to ρ 0 92 for structure sizing we aim at determining the inlet spillway dimensions that maximize the overall benefit b the reduced risk after reservoir construction to compute the risk in natural conditions and after the reservoir construction as function of the design parameters we numerically solve the integral in eq 1 by using a monte carlo approach based on the following algorithm 1 by means of a rainfall runoff linear model based on a geomorphological iuh di lazzaro 2009 and volpi et al 2018 we simulate 1 000 hydrographs whose peak flow and volume follow the joint probability distribution function p q p v random sampling from the bivariate distribution is solved as illustrated in salvadori et al 2007 p 210 2 the 1 000 flood waves are propagated along the chiani river reach in natural conditions before reservoir construction resulting in 1 000 flood peak values q p at the control section see fig 7 this data sample is used to empirically derive the probability distribution of flood peak p q p that determines the ante operam scenario 3 given a pair of design parameters q s and l s the 1 000 flood waves are propagated along the river reach and the interaction with the reservoir simulated to derive 1 000 flood peak values of q and its empirical probability distribution p q at the same control section as above as function of the design parameters 4 finally we compute the overall benefit b q s l s by numerically solving eq 8 this procedure is repeated 60 times to explore a feasible range of variability of the inlet spillway geometry specifically the inlet spillway height was set to vary by steps of 0 5 m in between 140 5 m a s l which corresponds to the low flow of q s 30 m3 s and 145 m a s l 0 5 m below the overflow spillway height corresponding to q s 200 m3 s for the spillway length we considered 10 values between 50 and 160 m which is reasonable based on the geometry of the river reservoir system the hydraulic simulations i e the propagation of the flood wave along the river reach and the interaction between the river discharge and the reservoir through the inlet and overflow spillways under unsteady conditions are carried out with hec ras one dimensional 1d hydrodynamic model which was controlled by matlab goodell 2014 leon and goodell 2016 the model was calibrated in a previous work against discharge measures available at morrano station bencivenga et al 2001 the reservoir is represented in the hydrodynamic model through the actual volume elevation curve where the maximum volume w max is reached at the maximum elevation of 143 5 m a s l the overall benefit b q s l s is evaluated at the control section fig 7 that is adequately located downstream the morrano reservoir in order to take into account the discharge possibly flowing through the overflow spillway 4 2 results and discussion fig 8 depicts the probability distribution function ante and post operam for some combinations of the design parameters q s and l s panel a compares the two functions p q p black line and p q blue line for a relatively small threshold value q s 55 m3 s and a convenient spillway length l s 100 m in such a case the detention basin is able to considerably reduce the most frequent and less intense events while it is practically irrelevant for the extreme ones note that the most frequent events are those contributing much to the benefit that is represented by the shaded area following eq 8 with β 1 as previously shown the exponent β has an important impact on benefit when increasing q s yet keeping l s constant as in panels b and c where q s 120 m3 s and q s 200 m3 s respectively the reservoir becomes more effective for the largest flood events those exceeding the q s threshold values at the cost of a benefit reduction panels d f reproduce the same conditions as in panels a c but introducing two different values of the spillway length l s 50 m solid red line and l s 160 m dash dot red line it is clear that the variation of l s does not have a large influence on results if compared with the threshold q s independently of the threshold value compare panels d f notwithstanding this it can be noticed that a small spillway length l s 50 m helps reducing the peak flow discharge for the most extreme events while it slightly decreases the reservoir efficiency for the ordinary events this is easily explained by considering that the discharge flowing into the reservoir increases proportionally with the spillway length therefore a small spillway length yields a slower filling of the reservoir so that the flood peak does not find the reservoir full and is attenuated on the contrary a small spillway length affects peak reduction for the ordinary events by limiting the discharge that can flow into the reservoir and generally the complete reservoir filling the probability distributions shown in fig 8 depict a very similar behaviour of that discussed in section 3 and shown in fig 3 this shows that a more accurate representation of the physical processes by detailed hydrodynamic simulation does not significatively change the pattern of the post operam discharge distribution found in the ideal configuration as a matter of fact the simplified routing model illustrated in section 3 is able to catch the most important aspects of the offline detention basin at least for a preliminary structure sizing under the simplifying failure and damage conditions considered here the results obtained by varying the design parameters q s and l s are summarized in fig 9 in terms of the benefit b and for different values of β the figure clearly indicates that the maximum benefit is generally obtained for any l s at the lowest discharge value apart for β 2 confirming the findings of section 3 by comparing this result with those emerged in fig 6 that are obtained assuming very long spillways we can conclude that the reservoir maximum capacity is not a strong limiting factor in this case indeed the maximum storage capacity is comparable to the average of the probability distribution of the flood volume being approximately 0 6 of the geometric mean of the flood volume distribution from the inspection of fig 9 it can be also noticed that the benefit depicts a stronger variation with the threshold discharge q s than with the spillway length l s regardless of the β value this confirms that l s plays a secondary role favouring the ideal configuration analyzed in section 3 besides the relationship between the discharge and the damage ruled by β determines the extent and the pattern of benefit variability for example the limiting role of the maximum storage capacity discussed above is emphasized by large values of β β 2 in figs 6 and 9 in the latter figure for l s 160 m there is an optimum for b at about q s 70 m3 s despite of the secondary role of the spillway length a clear pattern of benefit variation with l s emerges too from fig 9 for moderate to high values of the inlet spillway height q s e g for q s 75 m3 s when β 1 panel b for q s 150 m3 s when β 2 panel c the benefit increases with the length in this case the assumption of a large spillway length is efficient this combination might be a typical solution in design practice when the interest is the discharge reduction for very high return period events e g when detention basins are combined with other mitigation strategies that are not effective for high discharge values on the contrary for the low values of the inlet spillway height the maximum benefit is obtained for the lower values of l s moreover the length of the threshold that maximizes the benefit tends to decrease as β increases this is because a small length improves the efficiency of the reservoir for extremes events whose influence on the benefit is enhanced by large β values for example with reference to panel c where β 2 the optimal parameter combination highlighted in the figure as a red cross is given by the lowest spillway height corresponding to q s 30 m3 s and length l s 50 m the small spillway height allows the reservoir to mitigate also the small and very frequent flood events while the small length of the spillway delays the filling of the detention basin and allows even the most extreme events to be reduced effectively it is worth mentioning that in practice a small spillway length might cause malfunctioning and potential obstructions eventually resulting in structure failure therefore the adoption of small l s is not recommended in favor of a longer spillway yet in compliance with environmental and economic constraints for β 0 5 and 1 the adoption of a sub optimal larger length even of 160 m does not cause a strong reduction in the benefit see panels a and b thus being acceptable instead in the case of β 2 panel c the increase in length with respect to the optimum value causes a significant benefit reduction in this case it might be more appropriate to slightly increase also the spillway height and threshold discharge q s to keep the benefit as large as possible 5 conclusions in this work a general framework based on risk is provided for the sizing and assessment of hydraulic structures the framework takes into account i the variability of the hydrological load acting on the structure exposure ii the interaction among the hydrological load the river system the structure and the area potentially affected by flood propagation resistance and iii the consequences of structure failure robustness the power of the method is that problem complexity caused by the large number of involved processes and corresponding random variables is reduced by summarizing results in terms of the univariate probability distribution of the damage the framework is applied to the design of an offline detention basin for flood mitigation it is exemplified by means of both a simplified routing model that allows for analytical solutions and a monte carlo procedure based on the detailed hydrodynamic simulation of the river reservoir system we recall that in both cases a single yet general failure condition and a simple damage function are considered failure occurs because of exceeding water levels in the river resulting in the overtopping of the levee or because the downstream discharge does not meet the requirement of being smaller than a critical value due to the inadequacy of structure sizing further we neglect the secondary effects such as the collapse of the levee note however that any other mechanism of system failure e g related to sediment transport or to operational events or secondary effect can be included in the framework by adopting the appropriate modeling approach able to simulate the phenomenon of interest in general it is the goal of the analysis that drives the choice of the mechanisms to be represented in the framework the main conclusions drawn in this work regarding the specific application to offline basins are summarized in the following the comparison between the two methods simplified and accurate suggests that the simplified routing model which assumes an ideal behaviour for the reservoir is able to catch the main influence of structure geometry and size on discharge attenuation downstream the detention basin for this reason it can be used for a preliminary rapid and cheap evaluation of the optimal structure dimensions at least under the simplifying assumptions adopted here the approach allows investigating over the error induced by adopting the standard single event approach for the design of hydraulic structures it is the simple case in which the structure size and the hydrological load are represented by a single parameter and a single random variable being related by a bijective function in fact only under the latter conditions the return period of structure failure and damage equals that of the hydrological load thus justifying the assumption of an hydrological design event the simplified model was also adopted to disentangle the roles of the reservoir maximum capacity and the inlet spillway threshold the results clearly indicate that the most important parameter for reservoir sizing is the maximum storage capacity when the latter is not a limiting factor the inlet spillway threshold discharge should be as small as possible although larger that the critical discharge value that leads to system failure under natural conditions in order to maximize the benefit gained by the reservoir conversely for limited reservoir capacity there is an optimum for the inlet threshold discharge larger than the critical discharge and maximizing the benefit in any case the relation damage discharge which reflects the robustness plays an important role in the determination of the optimal sizing in the case study based on the detailed hydrodynamic simulation of the flood event we focus on the relative roles of spillway height and length small values of the spillway length might help increasing the efficiency of the reservoir for large return period values and reduce the cost however small spillway length are not recommended for maintenance reasons in favor of longer and less economic structures finally note that the adoption of sub optimal values for spillway length does non produce large benefit reductions since the spillway length generally plays a minor role with respect to the spillway height i e the threshold discharge the framework described in this work may help in shedding some light in the several and complex aspects involved in the design of hydraulic structures and or their assessment although it is of a rather general nature it is exemplified here for the relevant case of flood protection for which the effectiveness of the measures depend on several different parameters from the hydrological hydraulic load to the particular configuration of the structure as function of the effects of the flood on the environment and the human activities clearly the application of the framework depends on the particular structure under consideration as outlined in section 2 despite the simplification adopted the illustrative example on offline detention basins and the case study suggest that the approach is quite

4392,the design of hydraulic structures for water control is based on the principle of accepting that structures might fail to fulfill their intended purpose as consequence of extreme yet rare events producing damages traditionally structures are sized to resist to a design event i e a hyetograph or hydrograph associated to a fixed probability of occurrence this implicitly assumes that the probability of structure failure equals that of the hydrological load although unjustified under general conditions indeed structure failure also depends on the failure mechanism which is a characteristic of the specific structure and problem at hand ruling the interaction between the hydrological load and the structure itself to overcome the limitations of the hydrological design event approach we provide here a general consistent structure based risk framework for design or risk assessment the framework combines the multivariate statistical distribution of the hydrological process and the hydraulic response of the structure remarkably it reduces the potential complexity of the problem to the statistical analysis of the univariate probability distribution of the damage i e the consequence of structure failure the approach is exemplified for an offline reservoir for flood mitigation by adopting both a simplified routing model and a monte carlo procedure based on a detailed hydrodynamic simulation results demonstrate the potential of the framework regardless of the accuracy of the modeling approach adopted for its implementation specifically the framework allows disentangling the roles of the different design parameters involved by providing clear indications for practitioners keywords design risk assessment hydraulic structures water control damage offline reservoir multivariate probability distribution 1 introduction the design of civil structures is based on the principle of assuming a predefined level of risk the so called residual risk in essence we accept that the system fails to fulfill its intended purpose under specific typically rare conditions caused by the occurrence of natural or man made hazardous events for each specific system the accepted level of risk is determined by balancing the consequences of failure the direct and indirect economic damages to environment and society and the costs for system realization operation and maintenance since risk is defined as the expected value of the probability distribution of damage risk based design requires the identification and quantification of all those components determining the probability of system failure and then of damage that is the overall economic loss e g tung et al 2006 pp 427 438 failure occurrence and damage depend on the system exposure resistance and robustness see e g varnes 1984 and straub 2005 exposure is the probability of occurrence of the potential hazards to the considered system resistance includes all intermediate processes and elements which may modify the exposure within the system among which the failure mechanisms while robustness describes how the system and the surrounding environment react on the hazardous events producing damages the design problem is usually very complex potentially involving several methods and models whose implementation depend on the specific problem and goal at hand the method traditionally used for the design of hydraulic structures relies on the assumption of a hydrological design event which is a synthetic event e g hyetograph or hydrograph that is associated to a predetermined probability of occurrence typically measured in terms of return period vogel and castellarin 2017 volpi et al 2015 volpi 2019 this probability is set equal to an acceptable probability of system failure then the structure is sized to resist to such predetermined hydrological load implicitly assuming that the probability of system failure equals the one of the hydrological load the above traditional method generally does not correspond to the risk based criterion previously described for several reasons 1 the a priori assumption of an acceptable return period of system failure does not account for the cost benefit ratio where benefit is nothing else than risk reduction with respect to ante operam natural conditions paik 2008 hence such approach does not provide a cost optimal solution for the design problem apart from very simple cases as demonstrated by botto et al 2014 2 the adoption of a single return period value limits the estimation of damage to a single value instead of providing its entire probability distribution and its expected value i e the risk r 3 using a single return period value might have other consequences as highlighted by balistrocchi et al 2013 when a structure is sized according to a large return period it might perform poorly with respect to minor events or if a small return period is employed the device might be ineffective during extreme events such a behavior depends on the specific structure and on the particular goal of the case at hand 4 the return period of the structure failure generally does not correspond to that of the hydrological load i e the design event that might be due to the assumption of a design storm event an approach largely criticized in past literature works see among others adams and howard 1986 knighton and walter 2016 grimaldi et al 2012 yet one the most important factor determining this difference is the missed representation of the mechanisms of structure failure i e the interaction between the hydrological load and the structure this issue was discussed in deep by volpi and fiori 2014 and balistrocchi et al 2017 with reference to the design of an inline reservoir thus a reliable estimation of both the damage probability density function pdf and risk its expected value requires to account for the complex stochastic variability of the hydrological processes and for any mechanism of failure that is relevant for the problem at hand embedding the interactions between the hydrological event and the system see e g requena et al 2013 tomirotti and mignosa 2017 following coles and tawn 1994 and volpi and fiori 2014 denoted the latter relationship as structure function the use of continuous time simulation boughton and droop 2003 hoes and nelen 2005 beneyto et al 2020 grimaldi et al 2020 allows to overcome all the limitations of the hydrological design event approach that are mentioned above but only if the complex interaction between the structure and the hydrological load is integrated into the probabilistic estimation framework this general approach includes numerical simulation of rainfall see e g koutsoyiannis and langousis 2010 papalexiou 2018 runoff generation and rainfall runoff transformation grimaldi et al 2020 simplified methods based on analytical solutions guo and adams 1999 paik 2008 camici et al 2011 balistrocchi et al 2013 or multivariate statistical representations of the main characteristics of the hydrological process of interest volpi and fiori 2014 balistrocchi et al 2017 following volpi and fiori 2014 we provide here a general framework for hydraulic structure design or assessment using a structure based risk approach the proposed approach properly combines i the multivariate statistical representation of the hydrological process of interest and ii the hydraulic response of the structure to the environmental load note that the specific methods adopted here such as the representation of the hydrological process through the joint probability distribution of its interesting features or the damage function are already available in the literature yet they are combined here in a comprehensive coherent and structure goal oriented framework the latter generally accounts for all the mechanisms of structure failure through the corresponding structure functions despite the potential complexity of the whole system the approach proposed here reduces the high number of statistical variables involved in problem definition to a single relevant random variable that is the damage the general mathematical framework for the structure based risk approach is illustrated in section 2 the approach is exemplified here for an offline reservoir for flood mitigation this structure is selected because it offers enough complexity e g its design requires the definition of the whole hydrograph shape through peak volume and time to peak yet allowing for simplifications that result in an analytical solution for the sake of clarity we limit our analysis to a single general failure condition and in section 3 we make use of simplified routing model a real world case study follows section 4 and its results are compared to those obtained by using the simplified routing method of section 3 a simple damage discharge function is used in both the cases a conclusions section closes the paper providing the main conclusions and general guidelines to the design problem for practitioners 2 mathematical framework for structure based risk assessment or design the key point is the evaluation of the probability distribution function of the damage and in summary of the risk r i e its expected value the damage is the ultimate quantity that guides the design of a new structure or the assessment of an existing one in the following we illustrate the mathematical framework for the probabilistic estimation of damage where we denote the random variables by underlined symbols and the deterministic variables by the plain form while vectors are indicated by bold symbols the damage d follows a probability distribution function whose shape depends on several parameters for a specific structure and goal of the problem we can define a vector of relevant parameters that includes all the variables describing the structure the hydrological load acting on it the interaction among the two above taking into account all the relevant mechanisms of structure failure the robustness or conversely vulnerability of the inundated area let us assume i a structure defined by a vector of design parameters θ θ j with j 1 n such as levee height width distance from the main channel etc and ii the hydrological load determined by a vector η η k with k 1 l in the case of levee systems as an example the hydrological load is represented by the flow discharge in the river whose characteristics of interest e g peak volume duration and time to peak depend on the mechanisms of system failure that is relevant for the specific problem at hand levee failure due to overtopping is directly related to the maximum flow discharge in the river while in case of piping the duration of the flood is also relevant based on the above assumptions the damage d is a function of θ and η and its shape is determined by the different relevant mechanism of structure failure denoted as m and the robustness r or vulnerability of the affected area being d m r θ η the latter accounts for the so called structure function the relationship determining the response of the structure to the hydrological load it also accounts for the interaction of the hydrological load with the environment such as the propagation of the flood volume in the inundated areas and possible negative effects on settlements and infrastructures the risk is obtained by integrating the damage d with respect to its pdf p d d 1 r m r θ d p d d d d d m r θ η p η η 1 η l d η 1 d η l where p η η 1 η l is the joint probability density function characterizing the hydrological load we recall that the probability distribution of damage accounts for both the occurrence of structure failure and its consequences on the affected area the structure failure depends as well on the same quantities characterizing the damage apart from the system robustness a simplified representation of the structure failure is through the random variable f m θ η the latter follows a bernoulli distribution so that it is equal to 0 with probability 1 p f when the structure resists and equal to 1 with probability p f when it fails with p f the expected value e f m the return period of structure failure is a useful quantity to characterize the probabilistic behaviour of the system especially for communication purpose it is simply expressed by t f 1 p f computing the return period of structure failure t f the probability distribution of damage p d θ η and the risk r m r is generally a complex problem involving several steps and models as depicted in fig 1 starting from the specific structure and goal at hand the relevant structure parameters θ θ j j 1 n are identified some of these could be already determined from previous analyses or constrained due to system peculiarities while the others need to be established based on the balance between costs and benefits i e risk reduction the specific goal also drives the identification of the m relevant mechanisms of structure failure and as a consequence of the hydrological load η η k with k 1 l acting on the system i e the exposure as previously mentioned intermediate processes and elements may modify the exposure within the system that is the resistance in case of flooding those elements might include the propagation of the discharge along the river where discharge is the hydrological load the interaction between the discharge and the structure e g levee inline or offline reservoir for flood mitigation etc and the propagation of the flood within the inundated area robustness determines the interaction of the flood with humans exposed assets and environment all those elements generally require to be represented through a model our aim here is not to discuss the type of model that can be used for the scope but rather to exemplify how the overall procedure applies as function of the problem at hand before providing a practical example it is convenient to classify the above framework into specific simple cases as function of the problem complexity without loss of generality the complexity of the problem is represented here by the number of structure parameter involved θ j with j 1 n and the number of random variables describing the hydrological load η k with k 1 l the cases are listed in the following n l 1 this is the simplest and classical case in which the design depends on a single parameter like e g the levee height which in turn depends on a single random variable characterizing the hydrological load e g discharge in such a case the structure function is usually a bijective increasing function of the random variable of interest so that the larger is the load the bigger the structure under this assumption and since the same behaviour rules the damage in the inundated area the probability cumulative distribution function of the damage equals that pertaining to the hydrological load in other words the corresponding values of the two random variables share the same return period this justifies the assumption of a design event approach as an example we have n l 1 when we want to determine the height of a levee supposing that the width is already established and that the only relevant mechanism of failure is overtopping levee failure occurs when the maximum water level in the river generally determined by the flood peak exceeds the levee height so that the area beside is inundated by the flood n 1 l 1 when the relevant characteristics of the hydrological load are more than one and in general not statistically independent among each other it is not possible to establish a bijective relationship between the hydrological load η and the size of the structure that is again represented here by a single quantity θ this case was discussed in depth by volpi and fiori 2014 who proposed the adoption of the structure based approach for design and risk assessment of hydraulic structures demonstrating that the assumption of a hydrological design event is not theoretically justified in the paper it is shown how the return period of failure of the spillway of an inline reservoir for flood mitigation is determined by the statistical variability of flood peak and volume and by their interaction with the structure that is represented by the discharge flowing through out the spillway n 1 l 1 this is the most general case where the structure sizing requires the determination of several parameters θ n 1 generally speaking the problem might be undetermined because several parameter combinations may result in the same value of the objective function that is risk reduction with respect to structure cost this is the case of interest for the present work and it is discussed in the sequel through the relevant example of an offline reservoir for flood mitigation 3 design of offline detention basins for flood mitigation based on a simplified modeling approach 3 1 simplified modeling approach in order to illustrate and exemplify the general methodological framework introduced in the previous section we consider in the following the design of an unregulated offline reservoir for flood mitigation the reservoir located sideways of the river temporarily stores excess water from the river such as to mitigate the river discharge downstream keeping it lower than a given threshold value q 0 above which the system fails due e g to levee overtopping a return period t is typically associated to q 0 a sketch of the river reservoir system is provided in fig 2 a water is transferred between the river and the reservoir by an unregulated side spillway of length l s an overflow spillway and a bottom outlet are typically present in the reservoir the hydraulic behavior of the system depends mainly on the length l s and height h s of the spillway sill which corresponds to a given discharge value q s we assume a bijective relation between discharge and levels and the maximum storage capacity of the reservoir w max in the following we simplify the system by assuming an ideal side spillway i e for l s such that the excess discharge q u q s where q u is the discharge upstream the reservoir is completely transferred to the reservoir if the latter fills completely it becomes immaterial and the river discharge is unaffected by it thus the system dynamic depends only on q s and w max the spillway length l s and all the other control structures present in the reservoir do not play any role in the determination of the downstream discharge q d under the above ideal assumptions the hydrological load is represented by the upstream hydrograph q u for simplicity and without loss of generality we assume a triangular shape for the flood event as represented in fig 2b q p denotes the peak flow v the total volume and δ 2 v q p the duration of the flood event the time to peak is given by t p α δ with α 0 1 along the ideal behaviour of the spillway reservoir system the downstream discharge is always less than or equal to the threshold value q s when the reservoir capacity is not a limiting factor the latter condition occurs when the reservoir capacity w max is larger that the volume of the incoming hydrograph above the threshold q s fig 2b v s as expressed in the following 2 v s v q p q s 2 q p 2 when w max v s the flood attenuation downstream the reservoir depends on the reservoir capacity itself the approximate solution for the peak discharge downstream q see fig 2b is given by 3 q q p if q p q s q s if q p q s and v s w max q s q p q s 2 v q p w max 1 α v if q p q s and w max v s w max α q p if q p q s and v s w max α where q denotes the peak of the discharge wave after the reservoir the simplified reservoir routing model considered here has some similarities to that proposed by guo and adams 1999 for inline reservoirs and subsequently applied by balistrocchi et al 2013 to both inline and offline reservoirs alike previous model the approach adopted here allows to effectively disentangle how the structure parameters the threshold discharge q s and the storage capacity w max affect the probability distribution of the damage additionally the model used here includes explicitly the effect of the flood peak position represented by the coefficient α fig 2b shows that in the case of flood mitigation reservoirs as in other relevant hydrological applications both the flood peak and the flood volume are essential factors thus the bivariate analysis of the joint probability distribution of the associated variables is generally more meaningful than the univariate one we denote here p q p v the joint cumulative distribution function cdf of the upstream peak flow q p and volume v as previously mentioned also the peak position α plays a role see eq 3 in the case analyzed here the position of the peak α is assumed to be a constant however the problem could be generalized by treating it as a random variable and introducing the joint probability of flood peak volume and peak position in summary the failure mechanism is determined by the sole downstream peak flow q while the hydrological load is determined by the joint cdf of natural peak discharge q p and volume v and the system response is controlled by the two design quantities q s w max with reference to the general framework of section 2 we have n 2 and l 2 we remind that under non ideal behavior the number of parameters is bound to increase including for instance l s and the variables controlling the outlets the use of the downstream discharge as a measure of the structure failure means that the latter might occur either because of exceeding water levels in the river resulting in the overtopping of the levee or because the downstream discharge does not meet the requirement of being smaller than q s due to the inadequacy of structure sizing the latter condition is denoted as hydrological failure by paik 2008 it is necessary to point out that the definition of the structure function eq 3 is generally much more complicated because of the multiple and complex failure mechanisms that might affect the system indeed besides the common failure mechanism that is considered here other mechanisms could be relevant for the specific goal at hand among these we can mention levee collapse due to overtopping or piping which might even suddenly determine very large flow discharges downstream as further example hydraulic structures that modify river regime e g a dam can cause an imbalance in sediment transport on the catchment leading to a variety of hydraulic and environmental problems determining risk conditions moreover the probability distribution of damage might be influenced by unusual combination of unfavorable events including operational ones which individually are not safety critical such as the partial or total obstruction of the outlet or the spillway or the error in reservoir level measurement for regulated reservoirs see e g hartford 2016 and micovic et al 2016 noteworthy in order to account for broader failure conditions with respect to those considered here more complex hydrodynamic models should be used e g including sediment transport thanks to the simplicity of the response model adopted here the probability distribution function of the peak discharge p q can be obtained by integration of the joint pdf of the random variables q p and v characterizing the hydrological load acting on the structure by employing standard statistical analysis see e g papoulis 1991 p 135 4 p q q d q p q p v q p v dq p dv where d q is the region of the q p v plane such that g q p v q the relationship g between the variables q p v and q that can be derived by eq 3 is the structure function volpi and fiori 2014 the domain d q for the simplified model at hand reads as 5 d q q p q 0 v if q q s 0 q p 0 v q p 2 q p q s 2 if q q s 0 q p q 0 v q q p 0 v q p 2 q p q s 2 1 α q q s 2 if q q s for more realistic and complex modeling approaches of the river reservoir system the solution of the integral in eq 4 can be obtained by using monte carlo method as extensively discussed in the case study presented in section 4 in the following subsections we i show how the simplified modeling approach discussed here can be applied for the design of a detention basin and ii compare results with those obtained by using a standard univariate or bivariate event based approach 3 2 illustrative example we evaluate here the cdf of downstream discharge q by employing eqs 4 and 5 for a few combinations of the parameters characterizing the system eq 4 depends on the particular shape of the joint probability distribution p q p v in the present example we consider a bivariate lognormal distribution see e g yue 2000 the latter is upper tail independent such that the simultaneous occurrence of the extremes is neglected although such feature may play an important role in risk estimation poulin et al 2007 its assessment is beyond the scopes of the illustrative example considered here in order to obtain general results all the quantities are expressed in dimensionless terms the random variables are normalized with respect to their geometric means since this allows for a standardization of the corresponding marginal probability functions indeed the marginals of the dimensionless hydrological variables q p q p e μ ln q p and v v e μ ln v normalized with respect to the corresponding geometric mean are fully described by the parameters σ ln q p and σ ln v which are the standard deviations of the logarithm of the variables for simplicity the superscript is not reported and all the variables used in this section are intended to be dimensionless the dependence structure is defined through the parameter ρ which is the pearson correlation coefficient between the variables ln q p and ln v the correlation coefficient between q p and v is given by ρ q p v e ρ σ 2 1 e σ 2 1 for the sake of illustration we assume in the following σ σ ln q p σ ln v 0 5 and two values of the parameter ρ ρ 0 which is the limiting of independent variables and ρ 0 8 the chosen values may pertain to medium to large catchments see e g volpi and fiori 2012 3 3 results fig 3 depicts the cdf p q blue line and p q p black line i e the peak discharge distribution after and before the realization of the detention basin for a combination of dimensionless peak discharge q s and basin volume w max as previously discussed p q depends on the joint pdf p q p v and the domain of integration d q eq 5 both quantities are shown as example in fig 4 for the case of panel a of fig 3 and the domain d q is depicted for q q s 0 75 thin blue line q 2 and q 3 thick black lines the difference p q p q p reflects the beneficial impact of the basin in reducing the occurrence of the peak discharge such difference is maximum at q q s where a jump occurs whose size depends only on w max and is independent on the shape of the hydrograph α instead for q q s p q is controlled by α as shown in panel a for α 0 0 5 1 0 i e for early centered and late flood peak the beneficial effects of the basin in increasing the cdf i e reducing the frequency of the related events persist for q q s as function of the volume of the basin w max compare panels a and b in particular p q p q p approaches zero for increasing q at a rapidity which is inverse proportional to w max increasing the spillway height i e q s extends the frequency reduction to larger discharges for a given w max at the expense of discharges smaller than q s whose frequency is obviously unaffected by the basin if q 0 is the discharge value that leads to system failure under natural conditions i e before reservoir construction a natural choice would be to select q s q 0 whenever possible in such a case we have a single design variable w max i e n 1 and p q s is the probability of system failure 1 p f based on this assumption we evaluate the reduction of the exceeding probability of q s i e the inverse of the increase of the return period of q s as function of the storage capacity as previously mentioned the increase of q s return period does not depend on α see comments to fig 3 results are shown in fig 5 a for σ 0 5 and ρ 0 8 which are the reference parameters here the larger is the threshold critical discharge q s the smaller is the storage capacity producing a significant reduction of the failure probability downstream fig 5b depicts the relationship between the storage capacity and the threshold discharge when the return period of structure failure is set equal to a predefined value in the figure we consider t f 100 years and we show the storage capacity w t that is necessary to set the probability of failure equal to 1 1 100 for the reference parameters values blue solid line results are compared to those pertaining to the case of independent random variables i e ρ 0 blue dashed line which requires a smaller reservoir capacity w t to guarantee the same probability of failure with reference to the effect of the variance of the marginal distributions it is easy to check that the required storage capacity w t is enhanced by the variability of the hydrological load not shown in the figure fig 5b also provides information about the differences among the general approach used here represented by eqs 4 5 and the one based on the assumption of a hydrological design event as mentioned in the introduction section the hydrological design event can be defined based on the statistical behavior of the peak discharge univariate design event green solid line in the figure or on the joint statistical behaviour of peak discharge and volume bivariate design event black solid and dashed lines in the univariate case we usually determine the design event as the hydrograph with peak value equal to p q p 1 1 1 t then we define the hydrograph based on an average shape that typically depends on the upstream catchment characteristics and the rainfall runoff method used to simulate the flood event here we assume that the volume scale linearly with the flood peak which implies that we are assuming the same average duration δ for all the flood events or in other words a perfect correlation between the variables ruling the hydrological load in dimensionless terms the required storage capacity is equal to 6 w t q s δ p q p 1 1 1 t p q p 1 1 1 t q s 2 2 p q p 1 1 1 t 2 where δ 2 under the reference scenario it is p t q p 1 1 1 t 3 20 for t 100 in this case the hydrological load is determined by the behaviour of a single random variable and the return period of structure failure equals by definition that of the hydrological load compare volpi and fiori 2014 as also discussed in section 2 the univariate case overestimates the required storage capacity when the correlation between flood peak q p and volume v is weak this is expected to occur more likely in small to medium size catchments in the bivariate design event approach we have infinite design events sharing the same joint return period value t we consider here the most likely peak volume combination q p v p q p v 1 1 1 t as identified by volpi and fiori 2012 the required storage capacity is 7 w t q s v q p q s 2 q p 2 where q p v 3 51 and for ρ 0 8 and 3 62 for ρ 0 the use of the design event approach in a bivariate setting black lines leads to an overestimation of the required storage capacity w t even larger than adopting the univariate design event approach coherent with previous findings volpi and fiori 2014 the differences among the design parameters evaluated by the structure based multivariate framework and the classical design event based approaches reduce for increasing values of the correlation coefficient between the hydrological variables as shown in fig 5b compare black to blue lines where solid lines refer to ρ 0 8 and ρ 0 respectively the overestimation obtained by applying the design event approach may be enhanced by a high dispersion of the joint probability distribution volpi and fiori 2014 if for any reason we cannot set q s q 0 the return period of system failure cannot be controlled up to the desired value in such a case we can use a different criterion for reservoir sizing that is accepting that failure might occur for q 0 q q s with moderate although frequent damages yet maximising the overall benefit compared to cost while the probability of failure remains the same hence we evaluate the overall benefit for a given q 0 value by changing both q s and w max where q s is bounded below by q 0 the case q s is smaller than q 0 is not of interest since it always results in a smaller benefit the design condition considered here corresponds to n 2 the benefit is obtained as the reduction of risk i e the expected value of the probability distribution of the damage d hence we compute risk with and without the reservoir as function of the main controlling parameters and we take the difference between the two the relation damage discharge is assumed for simplicity as power law i e d q β where β is the robustness parameter based on the latter assumption that leads to p d p q p and p d p q the benefit b is written as 8 b p q p q 0 1 q β dp q p p q q 0 1 q β dp q results are shown in fig 8a as function of q s and w max for the reference parameter values σ 0 5 ρ 0 8 for α 0 5 and β 1 while α is irrelevant for the probability of failure p f it might rule the benefit b because the latter depends on the whole shape of the probability distribution p q q q q s see fig 3a the figure shows how the benefit reaches it maximum value when the threshold tends to zero and the storage capacity tends to infinite which is a rather obvious and expected result in the realistic case of limited storage capacity see e g the value w max which is represented in the figure by the black dashed line the maximum benefit is obtained for threshold values larger than zero in summary the smaller the storage capacity the larger the optimum threshold denoted in the figure as q s the above behaviour is slightly affected by the position of the peak fig 8b upper panels when moving the peak from early time α 0 to late time α 1 the benefit reduces as expected and the optimum threshold increases in turn the effect of the exponent β of the power law relationship on the benefit is much stronger especially in terms of the overall benefit lower panels for β 2 the benefit is larger and the same is for the optimum threshold the behavior confirms the importance of considering all components exposure resistance and robustness in the design procedure as they are deeply intertwined 4 case study chiani river italy we show here how the general framework provided in this work can be applied for the design of an offline reservoir along an italian river considering the natural characteristics of the river system and focusing on the actual behaviour of the reservoir inlet structure as measured by both the spillway height and length this deviates from the simplified routing model considered in the previous section where we assumed an ideal behaviour of the inlet structure neglecting the role of its length we investigate the optimal dimensions of the morrano detention basin along the chiani river central italy as illustrated in fig 7 the chiani river originates near cittá della pieve from the confluence of the astrone river with the chianetta river and it is the main tributary of the paglia river the chiani river catchment covers an area of about 450 km2 and depicts a plateau gorge pattern where the flatter and longer hillslopes are located in the upper or middle part of the catchment the chiani river is about 42 km long up to the confluence with the paglia river only the lower portion of 11 5 km is analysed here 4 1 setup of the numerical experiment the hydraulic behaviour of the detention basin depends on all the parameters θ j with j 1 n namely the height and length of the inlet and overflow spillway and the dimension of the bottom outlet since we want to focus on the design of the inlet spillway we assume all the other parameters already determined the maximum storage capacity of the reservoir is generally constrained by the extent of the area that is free from human settlement being equal to 2 04 10 6 m3 for the present case the overflow spillway is supposed to be long enough such that its level equal to 143 5 m a s l determines the maximum water level in the reservoir thus the n 2 design parameters are the height of the inlet spillway that is represented in terms of the corresponding discharge through the local stage discharge relationship q s and the length l s as in the illustrative example discussed in the previous section the hydrologic load acting on the system is represented by the joint statistical behaviour of the flood peak q p and volume v i e l 2 joint values of flow peak annual maximum and the corresponding volume around the peak for a time window of about 12 h are calculated based upon the observed water level available at the morrano station see fig 7 from 1948 to 2014 and the stage discharge relationship bencivenga et al 2001 due to missing data we have available 48 years of observation we inferred a joint probability distribution function to the available data p q p v assuming a lognormal and gamma distribution functions to represent the marginal statistical behavior of q p and v respectively while the dependence structure between the two variables is fitted by a gumbel hougaard copula the latter is characterized by a positive upper tail dependence the mean and standard deviation of the lognormal distribution are approximately 170 and 125 m3 s those pertaining to the gamma distribution are 3 45 10 6 and 2 56 10 6 m3 finally the pearson correlation coefficient is equal to ρ 0 92 for structure sizing we aim at determining the inlet spillway dimensions that maximize the overall benefit b the reduced risk after reservoir construction to compute the risk in natural conditions and after the reservoir construction as function of the design parameters we numerically solve the integral in eq 1 by using a monte carlo approach based on the following algorithm 1 by means of a rainfall runoff linear model based on a geomorphological iuh di lazzaro 2009 and volpi et al 2018 we simulate 1 000 hydrographs whose peak flow and volume follow the joint probability distribution function p q p v random sampling from the bivariate distribution is solved as illustrated in salvadori et al 2007 p 210 2 the 1 000 flood waves are propagated along the chiani river reach in natural conditions before reservoir construction resulting in 1 000 flood peak values q p at the control section see fig 7 this data sample is used to empirically derive the probability distribution of flood peak p q p that determines the ante operam scenario 3 given a pair of design parameters q s and l s the 1 000 flood waves are propagated along the river reach and the interaction with the reservoir simulated to derive 1 000 flood peak values of q and its empirical probability distribution p q at the same control section as above as function of the design parameters 4 finally we compute the overall benefit b q s l s by numerically solving eq 8 this procedure is repeated 60 times to explore a feasible range of variability of the inlet spillway geometry specifically the inlet spillway height was set to vary by steps of 0 5 m in between 140 5 m a s l which corresponds to the low flow of q s 30 m3 s and 145 m a s l 0 5 m below the overflow spillway height corresponding to q s 200 m3 s for the spillway length we considered 10 values between 50 and 160 m which is reasonable based on the geometry of the river reservoir system the hydraulic simulations i e the propagation of the flood wave along the river reach and the interaction between the river discharge and the reservoir through the inlet and overflow spillways under unsteady conditions are carried out with hec ras one dimensional 1d hydrodynamic model which was controlled by matlab goodell 2014 leon and goodell 2016 the model was calibrated in a previous work against discharge measures available at morrano station bencivenga et al 2001 the reservoir is represented in the hydrodynamic model through the actual volume elevation curve where the maximum volume w max is reached at the maximum elevation of 143 5 m a s l the overall benefit b q s l s is evaluated at the control section fig 7 that is adequately located downstream the morrano reservoir in order to take into account the discharge possibly flowing through the overflow spillway 4 2 results and discussion fig 8 depicts the probability distribution function ante and post operam for some combinations of the design parameters q s and l s panel a compares the two functions p q p black line and p q blue line for a relatively small threshold value q s 55 m3 s and a convenient spillway length l s 100 m in such a case the detention basin is able to considerably reduce the most frequent and less intense events while it is practically irrelevant for the extreme ones note that the most frequent events are those contributing much to the benefit that is represented by the shaded area following eq 8 with β 1 as previously shown the exponent β has an important impact on benefit when increasing q s yet keeping l s constant as in panels b and c where q s 120 m3 s and q s 200 m3 s respectively the reservoir becomes more effective for the largest flood events those exceeding the q s threshold values at the cost of a benefit reduction panels d f reproduce the same conditions as in panels a c but introducing two different values of the spillway length l s 50 m solid red line and l s 160 m dash dot red line it is clear that the variation of l s does not have a large influence on results if compared with the threshold q s independently of the threshold value compare panels d f notwithstanding this it can be noticed that a small spillway length l s 50 m helps reducing the peak flow discharge for the most extreme events while it slightly decreases the reservoir efficiency for the ordinary events this is easily explained by considering that the discharge flowing into the reservoir increases proportionally with the spillway length therefore a small spillway length yields a slower filling of the reservoir so that the flood peak does not find the reservoir full and is attenuated on the contrary a small spillway length affects peak reduction for the ordinary events by limiting the discharge that can flow into the reservoir and generally the complete reservoir filling the probability distributions shown in fig 8 depict a very similar behaviour of that discussed in section 3 and shown in fig 3 this shows that a more accurate representation of the physical processes by detailed hydrodynamic simulation does not significatively change the pattern of the post operam discharge distribution found in the ideal configuration as a matter of fact the simplified routing model illustrated in section 3 is able to catch the most important aspects of the offline detention basin at least for a preliminary structure sizing under the simplifying failure and damage conditions considered here the results obtained by varying the design parameters q s and l s are summarized in fig 9 in terms of the benefit b and for different values of β the figure clearly indicates that the maximum benefit is generally obtained for any l s at the lowest discharge value apart for β 2 confirming the findings of section 3 by comparing this result with those emerged in fig 6 that are obtained assuming very long spillways we can conclude that the reservoir maximum capacity is not a strong limiting factor in this case indeed the maximum storage capacity is comparable to the average of the probability distribution of the flood volume being approximately 0 6 of the geometric mean of the flood volume distribution from the inspection of fig 9 it can be also noticed that the benefit depicts a stronger variation with the threshold discharge q s than with the spillway length l s regardless of the β value this confirms that l s plays a secondary role favouring the ideal configuration analyzed in section 3 besides the relationship between the discharge and the damage ruled by β determines the extent and the pattern of benefit variability for example the limiting role of the maximum storage capacity discussed above is emphasized by large values of β β 2 in figs 6 and 9 in the latter figure for l s 160 m there is an optimum for b at about q s 70 m3 s despite of the secondary role of the spillway length a clear pattern of benefit variation with l s emerges too from fig 9 for moderate to high values of the inlet spillway height q s e g for q s 75 m3 s when β 1 panel b for q s 150 m3 s when β 2 panel c the benefit increases with the length in this case the assumption of a large spillway length is efficient this combination might be a typical solution in design practice when the interest is the discharge reduction for very high return period events e g when detention basins are combined with other mitigation strategies that are not effective for high discharge values on the contrary for the low values of the inlet spillway height the maximum benefit is obtained for the lower values of l s moreover the length of the threshold that maximizes the benefit tends to decrease as β increases this is because a small length improves the efficiency of the reservoir for extremes events whose influence on the benefit is enhanced by large β values for example with reference to panel c where β 2 the optimal parameter combination highlighted in the figure as a red cross is given by the lowest spillway height corresponding to q s 30 m3 s and length l s 50 m the small spillway height allows the reservoir to mitigate also the small and very frequent flood events while the small length of the spillway delays the filling of the detention basin and allows even the most extreme events to be reduced effectively it is worth mentioning that in practice a small spillway length might cause malfunctioning and potential obstructions eventually resulting in structure failure therefore the adoption of small l s is not recommended in favor of a longer spillway yet in compliance with environmental and economic constraints for β 0 5 and 1 the adoption of a sub optimal larger length even of 160 m does not cause a strong reduction in the benefit see panels a and b thus being acceptable instead in the case of β 2 panel c the increase in length with respect to the optimum value causes a significant benefit reduction in this case it might be more appropriate to slightly increase also the spillway height and threshold discharge q s to keep the benefit as large as possible 5 conclusions in this work a general framework based on risk is provided for the sizing and assessment of hydraulic structures the framework takes into account i the variability of the hydrological load acting on the structure exposure ii the interaction among the hydrological load the river system the structure and the area potentially affected by flood propagation resistance and iii the consequences of structure failure robustness the power of the method is that problem complexity caused by the large number of involved processes and corresponding random variables is reduced by summarizing results in terms of the univariate probability distribution of the damage the framework is applied to the design of an offline detention basin for flood mitigation it is exemplified by means of both a simplified routing model that allows for analytical solutions and a monte carlo procedure based on the detailed hydrodynamic simulation of the river reservoir system we recall that in both cases a single yet general failure condition and a simple damage function are considered failure occurs because of exceeding water levels in the river resulting in the overtopping of the levee or because the downstream discharge does not meet the requirement of being smaller than a critical value due to the inadequacy of structure sizing further we neglect the secondary effects such as the collapse of the levee note however that any other mechanism of system failure e g related to sediment transport or to operational events or secondary effect can be included in the framework by adopting the appropriate modeling approach able to simulate the phenomenon of interest in general it is the goal of the analysis that drives the choice of the mechanisms to be represented in the framework the main conclusions drawn in this work regarding the specific application to offline basins are summarized in the following the comparison between the two methods simplified and accurate suggests that the simplified routing model which assumes an ideal behaviour for the reservoir is able to catch the main influence of structure geometry and size on discharge attenuation downstream the detention basin for this reason it can be used for a preliminary rapid and cheap evaluation of the optimal structure dimensions at least under the simplifying assumptions adopted here the approach allows investigating over the error induced by adopting the standard single event approach for the design of hydraulic structures it is the simple case in which the structure size and the hydrological load are represented by a single parameter and a single random variable being related by a bijective function in fact only under the latter conditions the return period of structure failure and damage equals that of the hydrological load thus justifying the assumption of an hydrological design event the simplified model was also adopted to disentangle the roles of the reservoir maximum capacity and the inlet spillway threshold the results clearly indicate that the most important parameter for reservoir sizing is the maximum storage capacity when the latter is not a limiting factor the inlet spillway threshold discharge should be as small as possible although larger that the critical discharge value that leads to system failure under natural conditions in order to maximize the benefit gained by the reservoir conversely for limited reservoir capacity there is an optimum for the inlet threshold discharge larger than the critical discharge and maximizing the benefit in any case the relation damage discharge which reflects the robustness plays an important role in the determination of the optimal sizing in the case study based on the detailed hydrodynamic simulation of the flood event we focus on the relative roles of spillway height and length small values of the spillway length might help increasing the efficiency of the reservoir for large return period values and reduce the cost however small spillway length are not recommended for maintenance reasons in favor of longer and less economic structures finally note that the adoption of sub optimal values for spillway length does non produce large benefit reductions since the spillway length generally plays a minor role with respect to the spillway height i e the threshold discharge the framework described in this work may help in shedding some light in the several and complex aspects involved in the design of hydraulic structures and or their assessment although it is of a rather general nature it is exemplified here for the relevant case of flood protection for which the effectiveness of the measures depend on several different parameters from the hydrological hydraulic load to the particular configuration of the structure as function of the effects of the flood on the environment and the human activities clearly the application of the framework depends on the particular structure under consideration as outlined in section 2 despite the simplification adopted the illustrative example on offline detention basins and the case study suggest that the approach is quite

4393,reactive mass transport in which chemical dissolution front may become unstable is a common phenomenon in the field of groundwater hydrology the use of mathematical transforms can convert many scientific and engineering problems from the conventional time space domain into a generalized time space domain so that analytical solutions which are impossible to be directly obtained in the conventional time space domain can be derived in the generalized time space domain the theoretical analysis and computational simulation of dissolution timescale chemical dissolution front instability within fluid saturated porous media is no exception to investigate how different mathematical transforms can affect the theoretical analyses and computational simulation of chemical dissolution front instability within fluid saturated porous media two different approaches are considered to select mathematical transforms in this study in the first approach the mathematical transform mainly consists of a much larger timescale than the dissolution timescale and a length scale that is independent of the mineral dissolution ratio mdr while in the second approach the mathematical transform mainly consists of the dissolution timescale and the mdr dependent length scale the related theoretical and computational results have demonstrated that 1 the use of two different mathematical transforms has no effect on the analytical solution to the dispersion equation of a chemical dissolution front instability problem in the original physical time space domain 2 the use of different mathematical transforms may have significant effects on computationally simulating the evolution patterns of unstable chemical dissolution front in finite space domains which are filled with fluid saturated porous media 3 if the mathematical transform is appropriately selected then the dissolution timescale chemical dissolution front instability problem in fluid saturated porous media is mathematically solvable keywords theoretical analysis computational simulation chemical dissolution front instability mathematical transform porous rocks 1 introduction reactive mass transport is a common phenomenon associated with groundwater pollution in the field of groundwater hydrology chen et al 2009 lai et al 2016 zhao et al 2013 2016 2020 the chemical dissolution front involved in a reactive mass transport system may become unstable and therefore chemical dissolution front instability needs to be considered in many fields including groundwater hydrology chen et al 2009 lai et al 2016 zhao et al 2013 2016 mathematical transforms are important means for solving both ordinary and partial differential equations in mathematics since the processes and mechanisms involved in most scientific and engineering problems can be described by ordinary and partial differential equations it becomes inevitable to resort to mathematical transforms in the case of analytically solving scientific and engineering problems although mathematical transforms can have many different forms from the purely mathematical point of view the following two categories of mathematical transforms are only commonly used in the theoretical analysis of scientific and engineering problems in the first category the applied mathematical transform converts the partial differential equations of either a scientific problem or an engineering problem from one coordinate system into another different one but it does not change the object size and shape in the problem domain however in the second category not only can the applied mathematical transform convert the partial differential equations of either a scientific problem or an engineering problem from one coordinate system into another different one but also it can change the object size in the problem domain a typical example of using the first category of mathematical transform is that it is used to solve the pore fluid flow focusing problem associated with geological faults and large fractures within fluid saturated porous rocks phillips 1991 zhao et al 2006 2008 zimmerman 1996 from the purely mathematical point of view if the length of a geological fault along its trending direction is long enough then we can use its two dimensional cross section which is perpendicular to its trending direction to study the pore fluid flow focusing phenomenon in the geological fault within the fluid saturated porous rock in addition if the ratio of the length versus thickness of the two dimensional cross section is greater enough then we can treat the shape of the geological fault as a flat ellipse which has a long axis in the length direction and a short axis in the thickness direction the difficulty we confront in the theoretical analysis of this geological problem is that since the geological fault is mathematically treated as an elliptic shape the interface condition between the geological fault and its surrounding rock is very hard to be satisfied in a rectangular coordinate system to overcome this difficulty it is desirable to use an elliptic coordinate system in which the long and short axes are just coincident to the two axes of the elliptic coordinate system however it remains very difficult for us to directly derive the partial differential equations of the pore fluid flow focusing problem in an elliptic coordinate system to get out of this dilemma we should use the first category of mathematical transform to convert the partial differential equations of the pore fluid flow focusing problem in a rectangular coordinate system into ones in an elliptic coordinate system phillips 1991 zhao et al 2006 2008 zimmerman 1996 on the other hand theoretical analysis of the pore fluid convective flow problem within the upper crust of the earth belongs to a typical example of using the second category of mathematical transform to solve geological problems the main purpose of the theoretical analysis is to establish a theoretical criterion which can be employed to judge whether or not pore fluid convective flow can occur in a hydrothermal system within the upper crust of the earth gasser and kazimi 1976 horne and caltagirone 1980 horton and rogers 1945 lapwood 1948 zhao et al 2004 to achieve this purpose it is necessary to conduct a nondimensionalization process in which the dimensional partial differential equations of the pore fluid convective flow problem are transformed into the dimensionless ones from the purely mathematical point of view this nondimensionalization process is equivalent to the application of a particular mathematical transform to convert the original pore fluid convective flow problem described in the conventional time space domain into an alternative pore fluid convective flow problem described in the generalized time space domain after this particular mathematical transform is used the comprehensive dynamic characteristic of the original pore fluid convective flow problem can be represented by a dimensionless number known as the rayleigh number of the hydrothermal system kaviany 1984 nield and bejan 1992 zhao et al 2008b once the dimensionless partial differential equations of the pore fluid convective flow problem which is mathematically described in the generalized time space domain is solved with given boundary conditions we can obtain the critical rayleigh number of the hydrothermal system which can be used to establish the desired theoretical criterion gasser and kazimi 1976 horne and caltagirone 1980 horton and rogers 1945 kaviany 1984 lapwood 1948 nield and bejan 1992 zhao et al 2004 2008b although the theoretical analysis of chemical dissolution front instability within fluid saturated porous media also belongs in principle to a typical example of using the second category of mathematical transform to solve geological problems the core issue associated with the theoretical analysis is how to convert the chemical dissolution front instability problem from an initial value problem into a boundary value problem so that the conventional linear stability theory can be used to establish a theoretical criterion this can be done only when the mineral dissolution ratio mdr which is defined as the ratio of the equilibrium concentration of a mineral in the pore fluid to the solid density of the mineral in the porous rock approaches zero in the chemical dissolution system chadam et al 1986 1988 lai et al 2014 ormond and ortoleva 2000 ortoleva et al 1987 zhao 2014 zhao et al 2008c 2017 however there are currently different approaches to the selection of mathematical transforms in the process of solving chemical dissolution front instability problems within fluid saturated porous media from the purely mathematical point of view the application of a mathematical transform is equivalent to the transformation of the problem from one time space domain into another time space domain although it is expected that the different dimensionless models which are based on different mathematical transforms do not change the solution stability of the underlying dimensional formulation of an original problem it remains a difficult task to demonstrate this expectation in a purely mathematical manner especially for the highly nonlinear coupled problem such as the chemical dissolution front instability problem within a fluid saturated porous medium this is the first reason why it is necessary to investigate whether or not these different approaches can produce the same analytical solution to the dispersion equation of a chemical dissolution front instability problem in the physical time space domain the second reason for conducting this study is that it was questioned whether the theoretical results derived from using the mathematical transform with a much larger timescale than the dissolution timescale are suitable for the situation where the mathematical transform with the dissolution timescale is used szymczak and ladd 2014 to clarify the confusion caused by this question it is also necessary to prove that different mathematical transforms do not change the underlying dynamic properties of an original problem the third reason for conducting this study is that different dimensionless models which are based on different mathematical transforms chadam et al 1986 chen et al 2009 lai et al 2014 2016 zhao 2014 are commonly used for computational simulation of chemical dissolution front instability problems within fluid saturated porous media however the theoretical criteria which are used to judge whether the chemical dissolution system simulated by using these different mathematical transforms chadam et al 1986 chen et al 2009 lai et al 2014 2016 zhao 2014 is stable or not are still lacking more importantly due to the approximate nature of computational simulation results theoretical results are needed to confirm the validation of computational simulation results at least in a qualitative manner if we can prove that different mathematical transforms do not change the underlying dynamic properties of an original problem then the theoretical criterion derived in the previous theoretical study zhao 2014 can be safely used to judge the stability of the chemical dissolution system simulated by using these different mathematical transforms the aforementioned three reasons lead to the main motivation of conducting this study the rest contents of this paper are arranged as follows in section 2 the mathematical governing partial differential equations of a typical chemical dissolution front instability problem in fluid saturated porous media are briefly presented mathematically the considered problem belongs to an initial value problem in section 3 the mathematical transform which is associated with the much larger timescale than the dissolution timescale and the mdr independent length scale is used to convert the initial value problem i e the original problem into a boundary value problem i e an alternative problem so that the linear stability theory can be used to derive the dispersion equation of the original chemical dissolution front instability problem in section 4 the mathematical transform which is associated with the dissolution timescale and the mdr dependent length scale is used to convert the initial value problem i e the original problem into the boundary value problem i e an alternative problem so as to use the linear stability theory for deriving the dispersion equation of the original chemical dissolution front instability problem in section 5 the derived theoretical results are used to establish a theoretical criterion which can be utilized to assess the chemical dissolution front instability in computational simulations where the computational domain is finite in size afterwards two different computational simulation models are used to investigate the effects of different mathematical transforms on the evolution patterns of unstable chemical dissolution front propagating in finite space domains finally some conclusions are given in section 6 2 brief description of mathematical governing partial differential equations as mentioned in the introduction two categories of mathematical transforms are commonly used in the theoretical study of scientific and engineering problems the theoretical study of pore fluid flow focusing problems in geological faults within fluid saturated porous rocks is a typical example of using the first category of mathematical transform while the theoretical study of pore fluid convective flow problems within the upper crust of the earth is a typical example of using the second category of mathematical transform as shown in fig 1 the basic idea behind using the first category of mathematical transform is that the partial differential equations of the pore fluid flow focusing problem is first derived in a rectangular coordinate system i e the xoy coordinate system in fig 1 and then transformed into ones in an elliptic coordinate system i e the ξ o η coordinate system in fig 1 this can avoid the difficulty caused by directly deriving the partial differential equations of the pore fluid flow focusing problem in the elliptic coordinate system since the interface between the fault and its surrounding rock can be expressed as a constant i e ξ ξ 0 in the elliptic coordinate system the interface condition can be easily satisfied in the process of deriving the theoretical solutions of the original problem zhao et al 2006 however the basic idea behind using the second category of mathematical transform is that a nondimensionalization process is used to scale the variables and parameters so as to reduce the number of parameters and to simplify the originally derived partial differential equations of the pore fluid convective flow problem in this case as shown in fig 2 the size of the problem domain is changed during the nondimensionalization process although two different rectangular coordinate systems i e the xoy and x o y coordinate systems in fig 2 are used for describing dimensional and dimensionless partial differential equations of the problem in particular a dimensionless number known as the rayleigh number of the hydrothermal system kaviany 1984 nield and bejan 1992 zhao et al 2008b is derived to establish the theoretical criterion which can be used to judge whether or not pore fluid convective flow can occur in a hydrothermal system within the upper crust of the earth from the purely mathematical point of view the application of a mathematical transform is equivalent to the transformation of the problem from one time space domain into another time space domain it is noted that the basic principle of selecting a mathematical transform is to meet the specific need of the theoretical study to be conducted since the theoretical study of either a chemical dissolution front instability problem or a pore fluid convective flow problem has a similar objective to establish a theoretical criterion it is natural to select the second category of mathematical transform in this study in order to investigate the effects of different mathematical transforms on the theoretical results of a typical chemical dissolution front instability problem in a fluid saturated porous medium we need to recall originally defined mathematical governing partial differential equations of the problem when the density of the pore fluid is assumed to be constant in the chemical dissolution system as follows chadam et al 1986 zhao 2014 zhao et al 2008c 2017 1 u k ϕ μ p 2 ϕ t u 0 3 t ϕ c c u ϕ d ϕ c s ϕ kc 4 ϕ t χ ρ s s ϕ k c 5 s ϕ s 0 ϕ f ϕ where u u x i u y j is the darcy velocity vector within the porous medium p and c are the pore fluid pressure and the acid solute concentration with a unit of moles per pore fluid volume μ is the dynamic viscosity of the pore fluid ϕ is the porosity of the porous medium ϕ f is the final porosity in the completely dissolved region of the dissolvable material d ϕ is the diffusivity dispersivity of the acid solute k ϕ is the permeability of the porous medium χ is the stoichiometric coefficient of the dissolvable material in the porous medium k is the rate constant with a unit of m s s ϕ is the reactive surface area per unit volume of the dissolvable mineral s 0 is a reference value of s ϕ ρ s is the molar density i e moles per volume of the dissolvable material in the porous medium if we insert eq 1 into eqs 2 and 3 then we can immediately obtain the following equations 6 t k ϕ μ p 0 7 t ϕ c c k ϕ μ p ϕ d ϕ c s ϕ kc since eqs 4 6 and 7 involve three unknown variables namely the porosity pore fluid pressure and acid solute concentration they are capable of expressing the resulting governing partial differential equations which form the theoretical bases of the ϕ p c approach algorithm zhao et al 2017 2018b for the typical chemical dissolution front instability problem in a fluid saturated porous medium if the domain of this theoretical problem is a two dimensional infinite plane as commonly considered in the previous studies zhao 2014 then the boundary conditions of the problem can be expressed as lim x c x t 0 8 lim x p x t x p fx lim x c x t c in 9 lim x p x t x p 0 x where p fx is the pore fluid pressure gradient as x approaching negative infinity at the entrance of the chemical dissolution system p 0 x is the unknown pore fluid pressure gradient as x approaching positive infinity at the exit of the chemical dissolution system c in is the acid solute concentration at the entrance of the chemical dissolution system the initial condition for this theoretical problem is ϕ x 0 ϕ 0 x 10 lim x ϕ x 0 ϕ f where ϕ 0 is the initial porosity in the undissolved region of the porous medium from the mathematical point of view if time variable is involved in the governing partial differential equations then the problem described by the governing partial differential equations is regarded as an initial value problem however if time variable is not involved in the governing partial differential equations then the problem described by the governing partial differential equations is regarded as a boundary value problem this means that the problem described by eqs 4 6 and 7 belongs to an initial value problem in order to use the conventional linear stability theory in the forthcoming theoretical study it is necessary to convert the chemical dissolution front instability problem from an initial value problem into a boundary value problem by using appropriate mathematical transforms 3 theoretical analysis based on the first approach to the selection of mathematical transforms as clearly indicated by the previously presented mathematical governing partial differential equations multiple timescales and length scales are inevitably involved in the typical chemical dissolution front instability problem within a fluid saturated porous medium to deal with this issue we introduce the following four timescales below t t ϕ f d ϕ f u x 0 2 11 t r 1 k s 0 t d t r ε 12 t md t d ε where t t is called the transport timescale t r is called the reaction timescale t d is called the dissolution timescale t md is a much larger timescale than the dissolution timescale ϕ f is the final porosity in the completely dissolved region of the dissolvable material u x 0 is the darcy velocity component in the x direction at the entrance of the typical chemical dissolution system ε is the mdr and can be defined as follows zhao 2014 zhao et al 2008c 2017 2018a 13 ε c in ρ s where c in is the acid solute concentration at the entrance of the chemical dissolution system in order to facilitate the forthcoming theoretical analyses we define two specific length scales as follows l t r ϕ f d ϕ f t r 14 l t d ϕ f d ϕ f t d note that since l t r is independent of the mineral dissolution ratio mdr it is called the mdr independent length scale hereafter since t d is dependent on the mdr so is l t d therefore we call l t d the mdr dependent length scale hereafter in this study as the first approach to the selection of mathematical transforms we select both the much larger timescale than the dissolution timescale i e t md and the mdr independent length scale i e l t r to transform the original time space solution domain into a new generalized time space solution domain as a result the original mathematical governing partial differential equations of the problem which are represented by eqs 4 6 and 7 can be transformed into the corresponding dimensionless forms as follows 15 ε 2 ϕ τ ψ ϕ p 0 16 ε 2 τ ϕ c d ϕ c c ψ ϕ p s ϕ c 0 17 ε ϕ τ χ s ϕ c where τ is used to denote the dimensionless time the related dimensionless parameters and variables used in these dimensionless equations can be expressed below τ t t md t ε t d t ε 2 t r 18 ψ ϕ k ϕ μ p p p c c c in x x l t r 19 x x l t r p ϕ f d ϕ f ψ ϕ f 20 ψ ϕ ψ ϕ ψ ϕ f s ϕ s ϕ s 0 ϕ f ϕ 21 d ϕ ϕ d ϕ ϕ f d ϕ f in the case of the mdr approaching zero eqs 15 17 can be simplified as follows 22 ψ ϕ p 0 23 d ϕ c c ψ ϕ p ϕ f ϕ c 0 24 χ ϕ f ϕ c 0 these three dimensionless equations clearly indicate that when we use the first approach to the selection of mathematical transforms it is possible use the selected mathematical transform which mainly consists of the much larger timescale than the dissolution timescale and the mdr independent length scale to convert the initial value problem in the original time space solution domain into a boundary value problem in the new generalized time space solution domain more importantly eq 24 clearly demonstrates that in order to mathematically satisfy this equation the following four combined solutions are possible 1 ϕ ϕ f and c 0 in the whole problem domain implying that all dissolvable materials were completely dissolved and no acid was injected into the whole problem domain as well 2 ϕ ϕ f in the whole problem domain implying that all dissolvable materials were completely dissolved 3 c 0 in the whole problem domain implying that no acid was injected into the whole problem domain 4 ϕ ϕ f and c 0 in the part of the domain known as an upstream region and ϕ ϕ 0 ϕ f and c 0 in the another part of the domain known as a downstream region since the first three combined solutions have no scientific significance only the fourth combined solutions are considered in this study this means that the whole problem domain can be divided into two regions an upstream region and a downstream region as shown in fig 3 note that at the interface between the upstream region and the downstream region the porosity jumps from the initial value ϕ 0 into the final value ϕ f resulting in a sharp porosity profile see fig 3 which is commonly called the chemical dissolution front in the chemical dissolution front instability problem when the acid is continuously injected at the entrance of a chemical dissolution system the chemical dissolution front propagates continuously at a constant speed in the chemical dissolution system zhao 2014 this enables us to possibly obtain in the new generalized time space solution domain analytical solutions for the typical chemical dissolution front instability problem within a fluid saturated porous medium even though this problem cannot be analytically solved in the original time space solution domain based on the linear stability theory chadam et al 1986 zhao 2014 zhao et al 2008c 2017 we have analytically solved the above mentioned dimensionless governing partial differential equations of the chemical dissolution front instability problem in the new generalized time space solution domain the final dispersion equation for the dimensionless growth rate of a small perturbation in the chemical dissolution system can be expressed by using the unconventional time as follows chadam et al 1986 zhao 2014 25 ω m τ z h t r 1 β ϕ f ϕ 0 z h t r z h t r 2 4 m 2 1 β m where ϕ 0 is the initial porosity in the undissolved region of the porous medium β and z h t r can be expressed below 26 β ψ ϕ 0 ψ ϕ f k ϕ 0 k ϕ f 27 z h t r u x 0 ϕ f d ϕ f t r where z h t r is the zh number of the chemical dissolution system in the case of using the first approach according to the relationship between the conventional time and unconventional time zhao et al 2018b eq 25 can be rewritten by using the conventional time i e our daily life time for this purpose we need to consider the following equations 28 ω m ε ω m τ ω m τ ω m t md it is worthwhile to turn the dimensionless growth rate of a small perturbation into the corresponding dimensional form for this purpose the following equations need to be considered 29 ε ω m τ ε ω m t md ε ω m t r ε 2 ω m t r u x 0 2 ϕ f d ϕ f ϕ f d ϕ f u x 0 2 ε ω m z h t r 2 ϕ f d ϕ f u x 0 2 ε 30 m m l t r m ϕ f d ϕ f t r m u x 0 t r ϕ f d ϕ f ϕ f d ϕ f u x 0 m z h t r ϕ f d ϕ f u x 0 if we substitute the above two equations into eq 25 with the consideration of eq 28 then we can obtain the following equation 31 ω m ε u x 0 2 1 β ϕ f ϕ 0 ϕ f d ϕ f 1 1 4 m ϕ f d ϕ f u x 0 2 1 β m ϕ f d ϕ f u x 0 this equation is the dispersion equation of the typical chemical dissolution front instability problem in the original physical time space domain when the first approach to the selection of mathematical transforms is employed 4 theoretical analysis based on the second approach to the selection of mathematical transforms in the second approach to the selection of mathematical transforms we select both the dissolution timescale i e t d and the mdr dependent length scale i e l t d to transform the original time space solution domain into a new generalized time space solution domain consequently the original mathematical governing partial differential equations of the problem can be transformed into the corresponding dimensionless forms below 32 ϕ t ψ ϕ p 0 33 t ϕ c d ϕ c c ψ ϕ p 1 ε ϕ f ϕ c 0 34 ϕ t χ ϕ f ϕ c 0 where t is used to denote another alternative dimensionless time we can express the related dimensionless parameters and variables that are used in these dimensionless equations below t t t d t ε t r 35 ψ ϕ k ϕ μ x x l t d y y l t d p p p 36 c c c in p ϕ f d ϕ f ψ ϕ f 37 ψ ϕ ψ ϕ ψ ϕ f s ϕ s ϕ s 0 ϕ f ϕ 38 d ϕ ϕ d ϕ ϕ f d ϕ f equation 33 can be rewritten as follows 39 ε t ϕ c d ϕ c c ψ ϕ p ϕ f ϕ c 0 in the case of ε approaching zero eq 39 becomes the following 40 ϕ f ϕ c 0 similarly eq 40 clearly demonstrates that the mathematical validity condition of this equation indicates that this equation has the following four possible combined solutions 1 ϕ ϕ f and c 0 in the whole problem domain 2 ϕ ϕ f in the whole problem domain 3 c 0 in the whole problem domain 4 ϕ ϕ f and c 0 in the part of the domain known as an upstream region and ϕ ϕ 0 ϕ f and c 0 in the another part of the domain known as a downstream region since the first three combined solutions have no scientific significance only the fourth combined solutions are considered in this study this also demonstrates that the whole problem domain be divided into two regions an upstream region and a downstream region zhao 2014 zhao et al 2008c 2017 substitution of eq 40 into eq 34 yields the following equation 41 ϕ t 0 this means that the variations of both the porosity and dimensionless pore fluid pressure are independent of the time variable in the new generalized time space solution domain when the second approach to the selection of mathematical transforms is employed in this section therefore eq 33 can be rewritten in the upstream region as 42 ϕ f c t d ϕ f c c ψ ϕ f p 0 eq 42 indicates that the time variable remains involved in the transport process within the upstream region this prevents us from directly conducting the conventional linear stability analysis however since the chemical dissolution front propagates continuously at a constant speed in the chemical dissolution system zhao 2014 it is possible to use a moving coordinate system the origin of which is just located at the chemical dissolution front see fig 3 the propagation speed of the moving coordinate system is set to be equal to the propagation speed of the chemical dissolution front so that in the moving coordinate system the chemical dissolution system can be viewed as in a stationary state away from the entrance of the chemical dissolution system the dimensionless propagation speed of the chemical dissolution front can be expressed as zhao 2014 43 v front ε p fx ϕ f ϕ 0 where p fx is the dimensionless pore fluid pressure gradient at the entrance of the chemical dissolution system since the chemical dissolution system can be viewed as in a stationary state the following relationship exists in the moving coordinate system i e the o ξ coordinate system in fig 3 44 c t v front c ξ ε p fx ϕ f ϕ 0 c ξ therefore in the case of ε approaching zero eq 42 can be further expressed as 45 d ϕ f c c ψ ϕ f p 0 up to now we also converted the initial value problem into a boundary value problem in the second approach to the selection of mathematical transforms by means of the linear stability theory chadam et al 1986 zhao 2014 zhao et al 2008c 2017 the final dispersion equation for the dimensionless growth rate of a small perturbation in the chemical dissolution system can be expressed by using the conventional time as follows zhao 2014 46 ω m ε z h t d 1 β ϕ f ϕ 0 z h t d z h t d 2 4 m 2 1 β m where z h t d is the zh number of the chemical dissolution system in the case of using the second approach and can be expressed in the following form 47 z h t d u x 0 ϕ f d ϕ f t d in the same way as used in the first approach to the selection of mathematical transforms we can turn the dimensionless growth rate of a small perturbation into the corresponding dimensional form on the basis of considering the following equations 48 ω m ω m t d ω m t d u x 0 2 ϕ f d ϕ f ϕ f d ϕ f u x 0 2 ω m z h t d 2 ϕ f d ϕ f u x 0 2 49 m m l t r m ϕ f d ϕ f t d m u x 0 t d ϕ f d ϕ f ϕ f d ϕ f u x 0 m z h t d ϕ f d ϕ f u x 0 if we substitute these two equations into eq 46 then we can obtain the following equation 50 ω m ε u x 0 2 1 β ϕ f ϕ 0 ϕ f d ϕ f 1 1 4 m ϕ f d ϕ f u x 0 2 1 β m ϕ f d ϕ f u x 0 it is clearly observed that eq 50 is exactly the same as eq 31 indicating that both the first approach and the second approach to the selection of mathematical transforms can produce the same result for the dispersion equation of the typical chemical dissolution front instability problem in the original physical time space domain this fact demonstrates that although different timescales and length scales are used in the mathematical transforms which lead to different generalized time space solution domains we can obtain the same result for the dispersion equation of a chemical dissolution front instability problem in the original physical time space domain it is noted that two different dimensionless growth rates expressed by eqs 25 and 46 one of which is faster than the other are the direct consequence of using two different mathematical transforms in the theoretical study of the typical chemical dissolution front instability problem in terms of deriving the dimensional growth rate which is expressed by eqs 31 and 50 these two different dimensionless growth rates play a bridge role in proving the fact that different mathematical transforms do not change the underlying dynamic properties of the original problem it should be pointed out that the dimensional growth rate cannot be obtained from directly solving the original mathematical governing partial differential equations of the typical chemical dissolution front instability problem because they are mathematically unsolvable without using appropriate mathematical transforms this demonstrates the importance of using appropriate mathematical transforms in the theoretical study of the typical chemical dissolution front instability problem 5 establishment of the theoretical criterion for assessing and simulating chemical dissolution front instability in finite space domains 5 1 establishment of the theoretical criterion although the dispersion equation i e eq 31 or eq 50 can be used to assess planar chemical dissolution front instability in an infinite space which is filled with fluid saturated porous media it is inconvenient to use it for assessing chemical dissolution front instability in a finite space domain which is often encountered in many scientific and engineering fields chadam et al 1986 1988 lai et al 2014 ormond and ortoleva 2000 ortoleva et al 1987 zhao 2014 zhao et al 2008c 2017 to deal with this issue we need to establish in an alternative way a theoretical criterion for assessing chemical dissolution front instability in finite space domains for this purpose we can let ω m τ 0 in eq 25 or ω m 0 in eq 46 so that we can obtain the following equations 51 z h t r critical z h t r critical 2 4 m 2 1 β m 0 52 z h t d critical z h t d critical 2 4 m 2 1 β m 0 letting m 1 means that we consider λ l t r 2 π in the first approach and λ l t d 2 π in the second approach to the selection of mathematical transforms as a result we obtain the following equation 53 z h t r critical z h t d critical 3 2 β β 2 2 1 β therefore we establish the theoretical criterion associated with the fundamental mode i e the mode with m 1 for assessing chemical dissolution front instability in finite space domains as 54 z h t r z h t r critical 3 2 β β 2 2 1 β 55 z h t d z h t d critical 3 2 β β 2 2 1 β it is worthwhile to point out that the theoretical criterion associated with eq 54 is established in correspondence with using the first approach to the selection of mathematical transforms while the theoretical criterion associated with eq 55 is established in correspondence with using the second approach to the selection of mathematical transforms although these two theoretical criteria look the same in their appearance they have in fact different physical meanings because two distinct length scales are used in the process of establishing them since the length scale used in the first approach to the selection of mathematical transforms is much larger than that used in the second approach the geometrical length in the direction perpendicular to the propagation direction of a chemical dissolution front should be much larger in the first approach than in the second approach so as to accommodate the fundamental mode i e the mode associated with m 1 of a small perturbation in the chemical dissolution front instability system in this regard we can conclude that different mathematical transforms may have significant effects on the evolution patterns of unstable chemical dissolution front in finite space domains which are filled with fluid saturated porous media 5 2 computational simulation of chemical dissolution front instability in finite space domains in order to demonstrate the above mentioned conclusion we need to use the previously well developed computational simulation method zhao 2014 zhao et al 2017 2018a to numerically simulate the evolution process of unstable chemical dissolution front in fluid saturated porous media of finite space domains for this particular purpose we constructed a two dimensional computational model which is shown in fig 4 in this figure we use l x and l y to represent both the dimensionless length and the dimensionless width of the generalized computational domain under consideration in the case of using the first mathematical transform approach the corresponding dimensionless length and dimensionless width are equal to 2000 and 1000 respectively while in the case using the second mathematical transform approach they are equal to 200 and 100 respectively the reason for this length scale difference is that the length scale ratio of the second mathematical transform approach to the first mathematical transform approach is equal to 10 if we assume that the mdr which is used in the computational simulation is equal to 0 01 this can be obviously observed from eq 14 where both the mdr independent length scale which is used in the first mathematical transform approach and the mdr dependent length scale which is used in the second mathematical transform approach are clearly defined this means that the dimensional length and width of the computational domain are exactly the same if either the first mathematical transform approach or the second mathematical transform approach is not applied we used the finite element method to discretize this generalized computational domain into 19 701 four node elements of square shape and a total number of 20 000 nodal points both the top and the bottom boundary conditions of the generalized computational domain are shown in fig 4 the dimensionless concentration of 1 0 and the dimensionless pore fluid pressure gradient of 4 0 are applied at the left boundary of the computational domain when both the first and second mathematical transform approaches are used the following dimensionless reactive surface area per unit volume of the dissolvable materials and the dimensionless permeability of the porous medium are used in the computational simulation zhao 2014 zhao et al 2017 2018a 56 s ϕ s ϕ s 0 ϕ f ϕ 57 k ϕ ψ ϕ k ϕ k ϕ f 1 ϕ f 2 ϕ 3 1 ϕ 2 ϕ f 3 in addition the initial porosity of 0 1 i e ϕ 0 0 1 and the final porosity of 0 2 i e ϕ f 0 2 as well as the initial dimensionless concentration of zero c 0 are employed in the generalized computational domain the dimensionless time step length is equal to 0 001 and 1 0 for the first mathematical transform approach and the second mathematical transform approach respectively in order to trigger the instability of a chemical dissolution front in the supercritical chemical dissolution system a small porosity perturbation of 0 05 ϕ 0 is added into the initial porosity distribution field in the generalized computational domain moreover a dimensionless pore fluid pressure of 100 i e p 100 is also assigned at the right boundary of the generalized computational domain fig 5 shows the computationally simulated results of chemical dissolution front evolution in the fluid saturated porous medium when the first mathematical transform approach is used in the computational domain transform while fig 6 shows the computationally simulated results of chemical dissolution front evolution in the fluid saturated porous medium when the second mathematical transform approach is used in the computational domain transform it is noted that we use the porosity front as usual to display the chemical dissolution front in the generalized computational domain because the zh number of the computationally simulated chemical dissolution system is equal to 4 in the case of using both the first and second mathematical transform approach which is greater than the corresponding critical zh number of 1 77 the preferential pore fluid flow channels are indeed formed in the generalized computational domain as clearly shown in both figs 5 and 6 this indicates that both the first mathematical transform approach and the second mathematical transform approach are suitable for simulating the instability phenomena of chemical dissolution fronts in supercritical chemical dissolution systems within the fluid saturated porous media however the related computationally simulated results shown in these two figures clearly demonstrate that the evolution patterns of the chemical dissolution fronts are obviously different when different mathematical transforms are used in the computational domain transform generally since the length scale associated with the second mathematical transform approach is much larger than that associated with the first mathematical transform approach the large length scale geological structures such as the formation of karst strata and large dissolution caves is more suitably simulated by using the second mathematical transform approach 6 conclusions in order to investigate how different mathematical transform can affect the theoretical analysis and computational simulation results of chemical dissolution front instability problems within fluid saturated porous media two different mathematical transform approaches have been considered in this study in the first mathematical transform approach the mathematical transform mainly consists of a much larger timescale than the dissolution timescale and a mdr independent length scale while in the second mathematical transform approach the mathematical transform mainly consists of a dissolution timescale and a mdr dependent length scale the related theoretical and computational results have demonstrated that 1 the use of two different mathematical transforms has no effect on the dispersion equation of a chemical dissolution front instability problem in the original physical time space domain 2 the use of different mathematical transforms may have significant effects on computationally simulating the evolution patterns of unstable chemical dissolution fronts in finite space domains which are filled with fluid saturated porous media 3 because the length scale associated with the second mathematical transform approach is much larger than that associated with the first mathematical transform approach the large length scale geological structures such as the formation of karst strata and large dissolution caves are more suitably simulated by using the second mathematical transform approach on the other hand the small length scale pollution patterns which are associated with groundwater pollution in the field of groundwater hydrology are more suitably simulated by using the first mathematical transform approach 4 if the mathematical transform is appropriately selected then the dissolution timescale chemical dissolution front instability problem in fluid saturated porous media is mathematically solvable credit authorship contribution statement chongbin zhao conceptualization methodology b e hobbs modifying original draft a ord modifying original draft declaration of

4393,reactive mass transport in which chemical dissolution front may become unstable is a common phenomenon in the field of groundwater hydrology the use of mathematical transforms can convert many scientific and engineering problems from the conventional time space domain into a generalized time space domain so that analytical solutions which are impossible to be directly obtained in the conventional time space domain can be derived in the generalized time space domain the theoretical analysis and computational simulation of dissolution timescale chemical dissolution front instability within fluid saturated porous media is no exception to investigate how different mathematical transforms can affect the theoretical analyses and computational simulation of chemical dissolution front instability within fluid saturated porous media two different approaches are considered to select mathematical transforms in this study in the first approach the mathematical transform mainly consists of a much larger timescale than the dissolution timescale and a length scale that is independent of the mineral dissolution ratio mdr while in the second approach the mathematical transform mainly consists of the dissolution timescale and the mdr dependent length scale the related theoretical and computational results have demonstrated that 1 the use of two different mathematical transforms has no effect on the analytical solution to the dispersion equation of a chemical dissolution front instability problem in the original physical time space domain 2 the use of different mathematical transforms may have significant effects on computationally simulating the evolution patterns of unstable chemical dissolution front in finite space domains which are filled with fluid saturated porous

keywords theoretical analysis computational simulation chemical dissolution front instability mathematical transform porous rocks 1 introduction reactive mass transport is a common phenomenon associated with groundwater pollution in the field of groundwater hydrology chen et al 2009 lai et al 2016 zhao et al 2013 2016 2020 the chemical dissolution front involved in a reactive mass transport system may become unstable and therefore chemical dissolution front instability needs to be considered in many fields including groundwater hydrology chen et al 2009 lai et al 2016 zhao et al 2013 2016 mathematical transforms are important means for solving both ordinary and partial differential equations in mathematics since the processes and mechanisms involved in most scientific and engineering problems can be described by ordinary and partial differential equations it becomes inevitable to resort to mathematical transforms in the case of analytically solving scientific and engineering problems although mathematical transforms can have many different forms from the purely mathematical point of view the following two categories of mathematical transforms are only commonly used in the theoretical analysis of scientific and engineering problems in the first category the applied mathematical transform converts the partial differential equations of either a scientific problem or an engineering problem from one coordinate system into another different one but it does not change the object size and shape in the problem domain however in the second category not only can the applied mathematical transform convert the partial differential equations of either a scientific problem or an engineering problem from one coordinate system into another different one but also it can change the object size in the problem domain a typical example of using the first category of mathematical transform is that it is used to solve the pore fluid flow focusing problem associated with geological faults and large fractures within fluid saturated porous rocks phillips 1991 zhao et al 2006 2008 zimmerman 1996 from the purely mathematical point of view if the length of a geological fault along its trending direction is long enough then we can use its two dimensional cross section which is perpendicular to its trending direction to study the pore fluid flow focusing phenomenon in the geological fault within the fluid saturated porous rock in addition if the ratio of the length versus thickness of the two dimensional cross section is greater enough then we can treat the shape of the geological fault as a flat ellipse which has a long axis in the length direction and a short axis in the thickness direction the difficulty we confront in the theoretical analysis of this geological problem is that since the geological fault is mathematically treated as an elliptic shape the interface condition between the geological fault and its surrounding rock is very hard to be satisfied in a rectangular coordinate system to overcome this difficulty it is desirable to use an elliptic coordinate system in which the long and short axes are just coincident to the two axes of the elliptic coordinate system however it remains very difficult for us to directly derive the partial differential equations of the pore fluid flow focusing problem in an elliptic coordinate system to get out of this dilemma we should use the first category of mathematical transform to convert the partial differential equations of the pore fluid flow focusing problem in a rectangular coordinate system into ones in an elliptic coordinate system phillips 1991 zhao et al 2006 2008 zimmerman 1996 on the other hand theoretical analysis of the pore fluid convective flow problem within the upper crust of the earth belongs to a typical example of using the second category of mathematical transform to solve geological problems the main purpose of the theoretical analysis is to establish a theoretical criterion which can be employed to judge whether or not pore fluid convective flow can occur in a hydrothermal system within the upper crust of the earth gasser and kazimi 1976 horne and caltagirone 1980 horton and rogers 1945 lapwood 1948 zhao et al 2004 to achieve this purpose it is necessary to conduct a nondimensionalization process in which the dimensional partial differential equations of the pore fluid convective flow problem are transformed into the dimensionless ones from the purely mathematical point of view this nondimensionalization process is equivalent to the application of a particular mathematical transform to convert the original pore fluid convective flow problem described in the conventional time space domain into an alternative pore fluid convective flow problem described in the generalized time space domain after this particular mathematical transform is used the comprehensive dynamic characteristic of the original pore fluid convective flow problem can be represented by a dimensionless number known as the rayleigh number of the hydrothermal system kaviany 1984 nield and bejan 1992 zhao et al 2008b once the dimensionless partial differential equations of the pore fluid convective flow problem which is mathematically described in the generalized time space domain is solved with given boundary conditions we can obtain the critical rayleigh number of the hydrothermal system which can be used to establish the desired theoretical criterion gasser and kazimi 1976 horne and caltagirone 1980 horton and rogers 1945 kaviany 1984 lapwood 1948 nield and bejan 1992 zhao et al 2004 2008b although the theoretical analysis of chemical dissolution front instability within fluid saturated porous media also belongs in principle to a typical example of using the second category of mathematical transform to solve geological problems the core issue associated with the theoretical analysis is how to convert the chemical dissolution front instability problem from an initial value problem into a boundary value problem so that the conventional linear stability theory can be used to establish a theoretical criterion this can be done only when the mineral dissolution ratio mdr which is defined as the ratio of the equilibrium concentration of a mineral in the pore fluid to the solid density of the mineral in the porous rock approaches zero in the chemical dissolution system chadam et al 1986 1988 lai et al 2014 ormond and ortoleva 2000 ortoleva et al 1987 zhao 2014 zhao et al 2008c 2017 however there are currently different approaches to the selection of mathematical transforms in the process of solving chemical dissolution front instability problems within fluid saturated porous media from the purely mathematical point of view the application of a mathematical transform is equivalent to the transformation of the problem from one time space domain into another time space domain although it is expected that the different dimensionless models which are based on different mathematical transforms do not change the solution stability of the underlying dimensional formulation of an original problem it remains a difficult task to demonstrate this expectation in a purely mathematical manner especially for the highly nonlinear coupled problem such as the chemical dissolution front instability problem within a fluid saturated porous medium this is the first reason why it is necessary to investigate whether or not these different approaches can produce the same analytical solution to the dispersion equation of a chemical dissolution front instability problem in the physical time space domain the second reason for conducting this study is that it was questioned whether the theoretical results derived from using the mathematical transform with a much larger timescale than the dissolution timescale are suitable for the situation where the mathematical transform with the dissolution timescale is used szymczak and ladd 2014 to clarify the confusion caused by this question it is also necessary to prove that different mathematical transforms do not change the underlying dynamic properties of an original problem the third reason for conducting this study is that different dimensionless models which are based on different mathematical transforms chadam et al 1986 chen et al 2009 lai et al 2014 2016 zhao 2014 are commonly used for computational simulation of chemical dissolution front instability problems within fluid saturated porous media however the theoretical criteria which are used to judge whether the chemical dissolution system simulated by using these different mathematical transforms chadam et al 1986 chen et al 2009 lai et al 2014 2016 zhao 2014 is stable or not are still lacking more importantly due to the approximate nature of computational simulation results theoretical results are needed to confirm the validation of computational simulation results at least in a qualitative manner if we can prove that different mathematical transforms do not change the underlying dynamic properties of an original problem then the theoretical criterion derived in the previous theoretical study zhao 2014 can be safely used to judge the stability of the chemical dissolution system simulated by using these different mathematical transforms the aforementioned three reasons lead to the main motivation of conducting this study the rest contents of this paper are arranged as follows in section 2 the mathematical governing partial differential equations of a typical chemical dissolution front instability problem in fluid saturated porous media are briefly presented mathematically the considered problem belongs to an initial value problem in section 3 the mathematical transform which is associated with the much larger timescale than the dissolution timescale and the mdr independent length scale is used to convert the initial value problem i e the original problem into a boundary value problem i e an alternative problem so that the linear stability theory can be used to derive the dispersion equation of the original chemical dissolution front instability problem in section 4 the mathematical transform which is associated with the dissolution timescale and the mdr dependent length scale is used to convert the initial value problem i e the original problem into the boundary value problem i e an alternative problem so as to use the linear stability theory for deriving the dispersion equation of the original chemical dissolution front instability problem in section 5 the derived theoretical results are used to establish a theoretical criterion which can be utilized to assess the chemical dissolution front instability in computational simulations where the computational domain is finite in size afterwards two different computational simulation models are used to investigate the effects of different mathematical transforms on the evolution patterns of unstable chemical dissolution front propagating in finite space domains finally some conclusions are given in section 6 2 brief description of mathematical governing partial differential equations as mentioned in the introduction two categories of mathematical transforms are commonly used in the theoretical study of scientific and engineering problems the theoretical study of pore fluid flow focusing problems in geological faults within fluid saturated porous rocks is a typical example of using the first category of mathematical transform while the theoretical study of pore fluid convective flow problems within the upper crust of the earth is a typical example of using the second category of mathematical transform as shown in fig 1 the basic idea behind using the first category of mathematical transform is that the partial differential equations of the pore fluid flow focusing problem is first derived in a rectangular coordinate system i e the xoy coordinate system in fig 1 and then transformed into ones in an elliptic coordinate system i e the ξ o η coordinate system in fig 1 this can avoid the difficulty caused by directly deriving the partial differential equations of the pore fluid flow focusing problem in the elliptic coordinate system since the interface between the fault and its surrounding rock can be expressed as a constant i e ξ ξ 0 in the elliptic coordinate system the interface condition can be easily satisfied in the process of deriving the theoretical solutions of the original problem zhao et al 2006 however the basic idea behind using the second category of mathematical transform is that a nondimensionalization process is used to scale the variables and parameters so as to reduce the number of parameters and to simplify the originally derived partial differential equations of the pore fluid convective flow problem in this case as shown in fig 2 the size of the problem domain is changed during the nondimensionalization process although two different rectangular coordinate systems i e the xoy and x o y coordinate systems in fig 2 are used for describing dimensional and dimensionless partial differential equations of the problem in particular a dimensionless number known as the rayleigh number of the hydrothermal system kaviany 1984 nield and bejan 1992 zhao et al 2008b is derived to establish the theoretical criterion which can be used to judge whether or not pore fluid convective flow can occur in a hydrothermal system within the upper crust of the earth from the purely mathematical point of view the application of a mathematical transform is equivalent to the transformation of the problem from one time space domain into another time space domain it is noted that the basic principle of selecting a mathematical transform is to meet the specific need of the theoretical study to be conducted since the theoretical study of either a chemical dissolution front instability problem or a pore fluid convective flow problem has a similar objective to establish a theoretical criterion it is natural to select the second category of mathematical transform in this study in order to investigate the effects of different mathematical transforms on the theoretical results of a typical chemical dissolution front instability problem in a fluid saturated porous medium we need to recall originally defined mathematical governing partial differential equations of the problem when the density of the pore fluid is assumed to be constant in the chemical dissolution system as follows chadam et al 1986 zhao 2014 zhao et al 2008c 2017 1 u k ϕ μ p 2 ϕ t u 0 3 t ϕ c c u ϕ d ϕ c s ϕ kc 4 ϕ t χ ρ s s ϕ k c 5 s ϕ s 0 ϕ f ϕ where u u x i u y j is the darcy velocity vector within the porous medium p and c are the pore fluid pressure and the acid solute concentration with a unit of moles per pore fluid volume μ is the dynamic viscosity of the pore fluid ϕ is the porosity of the porous medium ϕ f is the final porosity in the completely dissolved region of the dissolvable material d ϕ is the diffusivity dispersivity of the acid solute k ϕ is the permeability of the porous medium χ is the stoichiometric coefficient of the dissolvable material in the porous medium k is the rate constant with a unit of m s s ϕ is the reactive surface area per unit volume of the dissolvable mineral s 0 is a reference value of s ϕ ρ s is the molar density i e moles per volume of the dissolvable material in the porous medium if we insert eq 1 into eqs 2 and 3 then we can immediately obtain the following equations 6 t k ϕ μ p 0 7 t ϕ c c k ϕ μ p ϕ d ϕ c s ϕ kc since eqs 4 6 and 7 involve three unknown variables namely the porosity pore fluid pressure and acid solute concentration they are capable of expressing the resulting governing partial differential equations which form the theoretical bases of the ϕ p c approach algorithm zhao et al 2017 2018b for the typical chemical dissolution front instability problem in a fluid saturated porous medium if the domain of this theoretical problem is a two dimensional infinite plane as commonly considered in the previous studies zhao 2014 then the boundary conditions of the problem can be expressed as lim x c x t 0 8 lim x p x t x p fx lim x c x t c in 9 lim x p x t x p 0 x where p fx is the pore fluid pressure gradient as x approaching negative infinity at the entrance of the chemical dissolution system p 0 x is the unknown pore fluid pressure gradient as x approaching positive infinity at the exit of the chemical dissolution system c in is the acid solute concentration at the entrance of the chemical dissolution system the initial condition for this theoretical problem is ϕ x 0 ϕ 0 x 10 lim x ϕ x 0 ϕ f where ϕ 0 is the initial porosity in the undissolved region of the porous medium from the mathematical point of view if time variable is involved in the governing partial differential equations then the problem described by the governing partial differential equations is regarded as an initial value problem however if time variable is not involved in the governing partial differential equations then the problem described by the governing partial differential equations is regarded as a boundary value problem this means that the problem described by eqs 4 6 and 7 belongs to an initial value problem in order to use the conventional linear stability theory in the forthcoming theoretical study it is necessary to convert the chemical dissolution front instability problem from an initial value problem into a boundary value problem by using appropriate mathematical transforms 3 theoretical analysis based on the first approach to the selection of mathematical transforms as clearly indicated by the previously presented mathematical governing partial differential equations multiple timescales and length scales are inevitably involved in the typical chemical dissolution front instability problem within a fluid saturated porous medium to deal with this issue we introduce the following four timescales below t t ϕ f d ϕ f u x 0 2 11 t r 1 k s 0 t d t r ε 12 t md t d ε where t t is called the transport timescale t r is called the reaction timescale t d is called the dissolution timescale t md is a much larger timescale than the dissolution timescale ϕ f is the final porosity in the completely dissolved region of the dissolvable material u x 0 is the darcy velocity component in the x direction at the entrance of the typical chemical dissolution system ε is the mdr and can be defined as follows zhao 2014 zhao et al 2008c 2017 2018a 13 ε c in ρ s where c in is the acid solute concentration at the entrance of the chemical dissolution system in order to facilitate the forthcoming theoretical analyses we define two specific length scales as follows l t r ϕ f d ϕ f t r 14 l t d ϕ f d ϕ f t d note that since l t r is independent of the mineral dissolution ratio mdr it is called the mdr independent length scale hereafter since t d is dependent on the mdr so is l t d therefore we call l t d the mdr dependent length scale hereafter in this study as the first approach to the selection of mathematical transforms we select both the much larger timescale than the dissolution timescale i e t md and the mdr independent length scale i e l t r to transform the original time space solution domain into a new generalized time space solution domain as a result the original mathematical governing partial differential equations of the problem which are represented by eqs 4 6 and 7 can be transformed into the corresponding dimensionless forms as follows 15 ε 2 ϕ τ ψ ϕ p 0 16 ε 2 τ ϕ c d ϕ c c ψ ϕ p s ϕ c 0 17 ε ϕ τ χ s ϕ c where τ is used to denote the dimensionless time the related dimensionless parameters and variables used in these dimensionless equations can be expressed below τ t t md t ε t d t ε 2 t r 18 ψ ϕ k ϕ μ p p p c c c in x x l t r 19 x x l t r p ϕ f d ϕ f ψ ϕ f 20 ψ ϕ ψ ϕ ψ ϕ f s ϕ s ϕ s 0 ϕ f ϕ 21 d ϕ ϕ d ϕ ϕ f d ϕ f in the case of the mdr approaching zero eqs 15 17 can be simplified as follows 22 ψ ϕ p 0 23 d ϕ c c ψ ϕ p ϕ f ϕ c 0 24 χ ϕ f ϕ c 0 these three dimensionless equations clearly indicate that when we use the first approach to the selection of mathematical transforms it is possible use the selected mathematical transform which mainly consists of the much larger timescale than the dissolution timescale and the mdr independent length scale to convert the initial value problem in the original time space solution domain into a boundary value problem in the new generalized time space solution domain more importantly eq 24 clearly demonstrates that in order to mathematically satisfy this equation the following four combined solutions are possible 1 ϕ ϕ f and c 0 in the whole problem domain implying that all dissolvable materials were completely dissolved and no acid was injected into the whole problem domain as well 2 ϕ ϕ f in the whole problem domain implying that all dissolvable materials were completely dissolved 3 c 0 in the whole problem domain implying that no acid was injected into the whole problem domain 4 ϕ ϕ f and c 0 in the part of the domain known as an upstream region and ϕ ϕ 0 ϕ f and c 0 in the another part of the domain known as a downstream region since the first three combined solutions have no scientific significance only the fourth combined solutions are considered in this study this means that the whole problem domain can be divided into two regions an upstream region and a downstream region as shown in fig 3 note that at the interface between the upstream region and the downstream region the porosity jumps from the initial value ϕ 0 into the final value ϕ f resulting in a sharp porosity profile see fig 3 which is commonly called the chemical dissolution front in the chemical dissolution front instability problem when the acid is continuously injected at the entrance of a chemical dissolution system the chemical dissolution front propagates continuously at a constant speed in the chemical dissolution system zhao 2014 this enables us to possibly obtain in the new generalized time space solution domain analytical solutions for the typical chemical dissolution front instability problem within a fluid saturated porous medium even though this problem cannot be analytically solved in the original time space solution domain based on the linear stability theory chadam et al 1986 zhao 2014 zhao et al 2008c 2017 we have analytically solved the above mentioned dimensionless governing partial differential equations of the chemical dissolution front instability problem in the new generalized time space solution domain the final dispersion equation for the dimensionless growth rate of a small perturbation in the chemical dissolution system can be expressed by using the unconventional time as follows chadam et al 1986 zhao 2014 25 ω m τ z h t r 1 β ϕ f ϕ 0 z h t r z h t r 2 4 m 2 1 β m where ϕ 0 is the initial porosity in the undissolved region of the porous medium β and z h t r can be expressed below 26 β ψ ϕ 0 ψ ϕ f k ϕ 0 k ϕ f 27 z h t r u x 0 ϕ f d ϕ f t r where z h t r is the zh number of the chemical dissolution system in the case of using the first approach according to the relationship between the conventional time and unconventional time zhao et al 2018b eq 25 can be rewritten by using the conventional time i e our daily life time for this purpose we need to consider the following equations 28 ω m ε ω m τ ω m τ ω m t md it is worthwhile to turn the dimensionless growth rate of a small perturbation into the corresponding dimensional form for this purpose the following equations need to be considered 29 ε ω m τ ε ω m t md ε ω m t r ε 2 ω m t r u x 0 2 ϕ f d ϕ f ϕ f d ϕ f u x 0 2 ε ω m z h t r 2 ϕ f d ϕ f u x 0 2 ε 30 m m l t r m ϕ f d ϕ f t r m u x 0 t r ϕ f d ϕ f ϕ f d ϕ f u x 0 m z h t r ϕ f d ϕ f u x 0 if we substitute the above two equations into eq 25 with the consideration of eq 28 then we can obtain the following equation 31 ω m ε u x 0 2 1 β ϕ f ϕ 0 ϕ f d ϕ f 1 1 4 m ϕ f d ϕ f u x 0 2 1 β m ϕ f d ϕ f u x 0 this equation is the dispersion equation of the typical chemical dissolution front instability problem in the original physical time space domain when the first approach to the selection of mathematical transforms is employed 4 theoretical analysis based on the second approach to the selection of mathematical transforms in the second approach to the selection of mathematical transforms we select both the dissolution timescale i e t d and the mdr dependent length scale i e l t d to transform the original time space solution domain into a new generalized time space solution domain consequently the original mathematical governing partial differential equations of the problem can be transformed into the corresponding dimensionless forms below 32 ϕ t ψ ϕ p 0 33 t ϕ c d ϕ c c ψ ϕ p 1 ε ϕ f ϕ c 0 34 ϕ t χ ϕ f ϕ c 0 where t is used to denote another alternative dimensionless time we can express the related dimensionless parameters and variables that are used in these dimensionless equations below t t t d t ε t r 35 ψ ϕ k ϕ μ x x l t d y y l t d p p p 36 c c c in p ϕ f d ϕ f ψ ϕ f 37 ψ ϕ ψ ϕ ψ ϕ f s ϕ s ϕ s 0 ϕ f ϕ 38 d ϕ ϕ d ϕ ϕ f d ϕ f equation 33 can be rewritten as follows 39 ε t ϕ c d ϕ c c ψ ϕ p ϕ f ϕ c 0 in the case of ε approaching zero eq 39 becomes the following 40 ϕ f ϕ c 0 similarly eq 40 clearly demonstrates that the mathematical validity condition of this equation indicates that this equation has the following four possible combined solutions 1 ϕ ϕ f and c 0 in the whole problem domain 2 ϕ ϕ f in the whole problem domain 3 c 0 in the whole problem domain 4 ϕ ϕ f and c 0 in the part of the domain known as an upstream region and ϕ ϕ 0 ϕ f and c 0 in the another part of the domain known as a downstream region since the first three combined solutions have no scientific significance only the fourth combined solutions are considered in this study this also demonstrates that the whole problem domain be divided into two regions an upstream region and a downstream region zhao 2014 zhao et al 2008c 2017 substitution of eq 40 into eq 34 yields the following equation 41 ϕ t 0 this means that the variations of both the porosity and dimensionless pore fluid pressure are independent of the time variable in the new generalized time space solution domain when the second approach to the selection of mathematical transforms is employed in this section therefore eq 33 can be rewritten in the upstream region as 42 ϕ f c t d ϕ f c c ψ ϕ f p 0 eq 42 indicates that the time variable remains involved in the transport process within the upstream region this prevents us from directly conducting the conventional linear stability analysis however since the chemical dissolution front propagates continuously at a constant speed in the chemical dissolution system zhao 2014 it is possible to use a moving coordinate system the origin of which is just located at the chemical dissolution front see fig 3 the propagation speed of the moving coordinate system is set to be equal to the propagation speed of the chemical dissolution front so that in the moving coordinate system the chemical dissolution system can be viewed as in a stationary state away from the entrance of the chemical dissolution system the dimensionless propagation speed of the chemical dissolution front can be expressed as zhao 2014 43 v front ε p fx ϕ f ϕ 0 where p fx is the dimensionless pore fluid pressure gradient at the entrance of the chemical dissolution system since the chemical dissolution system can be viewed as in a stationary state the following relationship exists in the moving coordinate system i e the o ξ coordinate system in fig 3 44 c t v front c ξ ε p fx ϕ f ϕ 0 c ξ therefore in the case of ε approaching zero eq 42 can be further expressed as 45 d ϕ f c c ψ ϕ f p 0 up to now we also converted the initial value problem into a boundary value problem in the second approach to the selection of mathematical transforms by means of the linear stability theory chadam et al 1986 zhao 2014 zhao et al 2008c 2017 the final dispersion equation for the dimensionless growth rate of a small perturbation in the chemical dissolution system can be expressed by using the conventional time as follows zhao 2014 46 ω m ε z h t d 1 β ϕ f ϕ 0 z h t d z h t d 2 4 m 2 1 β m where z h t d is the zh number of the chemical dissolution system in the case of using the second approach and can be expressed in the following form 47 z h t d u x 0 ϕ f d ϕ f t d in the same way as used in the first approach to the selection of mathematical transforms we can turn the dimensionless growth rate of a small perturbation into the corresponding dimensional form on the basis of considering the following equations 48 ω m ω m t d ω m t d u x 0 2 ϕ f d ϕ f ϕ f d ϕ f u x 0 2 ω m z h t d 2 ϕ f d ϕ f u x 0 2 49 m m l t r m ϕ f d ϕ f t d m u x 0 t d ϕ f d ϕ f ϕ f d ϕ f u x 0 m z h t d ϕ f d ϕ f u x 0 if we substitute these two equations into eq 46 then we can obtain the following equation 50 ω m ε u x 0 2 1 β ϕ f ϕ 0 ϕ f d ϕ f 1 1 4 m ϕ f d ϕ f u x 0 2 1 β m ϕ f d ϕ f u x 0 it is clearly observed that eq 50 is exactly the same as eq 31 indicating that both the first approach and the second approach to the selection of mathematical transforms can produce the same result for the dispersion equation of the typical chemical dissolution front instability problem in the original physical time space domain this fact demonstrates that although different timescales and length scales are used in the mathematical transforms which lead to different generalized time space solution domains we can obtain the same result for the dispersion equation of a chemical dissolution front instability problem in the original physical time space domain it is noted that two different dimensionless growth rates expressed by eqs 25 and 46 one of which is faster than the other are the direct consequence of using two different mathematical transforms in the theoretical study of the typical chemical dissolution front instability problem in terms of deriving the dimensional growth rate which is expressed by eqs 31 and 50 these two different dimensionless growth rates play a bridge role in proving the fact that different mathematical transforms do not change the underlying dynamic properties of the original problem it should be pointed out that the dimensional growth rate cannot be obtained from directly solving the original mathematical governing partial differential equations of the typical chemical dissolution front instability problem because they are mathematically unsolvable without using appropriate mathematical transforms this demonstrates the importance of using appropriate mathematical transforms in the theoretical study of the typical chemical dissolution front instability problem 5 establishment of the theoretical criterion for assessing and simulating chemical dissolution front instability in finite space domains 5 1 establishment of the theoretical criterion although the dispersion equation i e eq 31 or eq 50 can be used to assess planar chemical dissolution front instability in an infinite space which is filled with fluid saturated porous media it is inconvenient to use it for assessing chemical dissolution front instability in a finite space domain which is often encountered in many scientific and engineering fields chadam et al 1986 1988 lai et al 2014 ormond and ortoleva 2000 ortoleva et al 1987 zhao 2014 zhao et al 2008c 2017 to deal with this issue we need to establish in an alternative way a theoretical criterion for assessing chemical dissolution front instability in finite space domains for this purpose we can let ω m τ 0 in eq 25 or ω m 0 in eq 46 so that we can obtain the following equations 51 z h t r critical z h t r critical 2 4 m 2 1 β m 0 52 z h t d critical z h t d critical 2 4 m 2 1 β m 0 letting m 1 means that we consider λ l t r 2 π in the first approach and λ l t d 2 π in the second approach to the selection of mathematical transforms as a result we obtain the following equation 53 z h t r critical z h t d critical 3 2 β β 2 2 1 β therefore we establish the theoretical criterion associated with the fundamental mode i e the mode with m 1 for assessing chemical dissolution front instability in finite space domains as 54 z h t r z h t r critical 3 2 β β 2 2 1 β 55 z h t d z h t d critical 3 2 β β 2 2 1 β it is worthwhile to point out that the theoretical criterion associated with eq 54 is established in correspondence with using the first approach to the selection of mathematical transforms while the theoretical criterion associated with eq 55 is established in correspondence with using the second approach to the selection of mathematical transforms although these two theoretical criteria look the same in their appearance they have in fact different physical meanings because two distinct length scales are used in the process of establishing them since the length scale used in the first approach to the selection of mathematical transforms is much larger than that used in the second approach the geometrical length in the direction perpendicular to the propagation direction of a chemical dissolution front should be much larger in the first approach than in the second approach so as to accommodate the fundamental mode i e the mode associated with m 1 of a small perturbation in the chemical dissolution front instability system in this regard we can conclude that different mathematical transforms may have significant effects on the evolution patterns of unstable chemical dissolution front in finite space domains which are filled with fluid saturated porous media 5 2 computational simulation of chemical dissolution front instability in finite space domains in order to demonstrate the above mentioned conclusion we need to use the previously well developed computational simulation method zhao 2014 zhao et al 2017 2018a to numerically simulate the evolution process of unstable chemical dissolution front in fluid saturated porous media of finite space domains for this particular purpose we constructed a two dimensional computational model which is shown in fig 4 in this figure we use l x and l y to represent both the dimensionless length and the dimensionless width of the generalized computational domain under consideration in the case of using the first mathematical transform approach the corresponding dimensionless length and dimensionless width are equal to 2000 and 1000 respectively while in the case using the second mathematical transform approach they are equal to 200 and 100 respectively the reason for this length scale difference is that the length scale ratio of the second mathematical transform approach to the first mathematical transform approach is equal to 10 if we assume that the mdr which is used in the computational simulation is equal to 0 01 this can be obviously observed from eq 14 where both the mdr independent length scale which is used in the first mathematical transform approach and the mdr dependent length scale which is used in the second mathematical transform approach are clearly defined this means that the dimensional length and width of the computational domain are exactly the same if either the first mathematical transform approach or the second mathematical transform approach is not applied we used the finite element method to discretize this generalized computational domain into 19 701 four node elements of square shape and a total number of 20 000 nodal points both the top and the bottom boundary conditions of the generalized computational domain are shown in fig 4 the dimensionless concentration of 1 0 and the dimensionless pore fluid pressure gradient of 4 0 are applied at the left boundary of the computational domain when both the first and second mathematical transform approaches are used the following dimensionless reactive surface area per unit volume of the dissolvable materials and the dimensionless permeability of the porous medium are used in the computational simulation zhao 2014 zhao et al 2017 2018a 56 s ϕ s ϕ s 0 ϕ f ϕ 57 k ϕ ψ ϕ k ϕ k ϕ f 1 ϕ f 2 ϕ 3 1 ϕ 2 ϕ f 3 in addition the initial porosity of 0 1 i e ϕ 0 0 1 and the final porosity of 0 2 i e ϕ f 0 2 as well as the initial dimensionless concentration of zero c 0 are employed in the generalized computational domain the dimensionless time step length is equal to 0 001 and 1 0 for the first mathematical transform approach and the second mathematical transform approach respectively in order to trigger the instability of a chemical dissolution front in the supercritical chemical dissolution system a small porosity perturbation of 0 05 ϕ 0 is added into the initial porosity distribution field in the generalized computational domain moreover a dimensionless pore fluid pressure of 100 i e p 100 is also assigned at the right boundary of the generalized computational domain fig 5 shows the computationally simulated results of chemical dissolution front evolution in the fluid saturated porous medium when the first mathematical transform approach is used in the computational domain transform while fig 6 shows the computationally simulated results of chemical dissolution front evolution in the fluid saturated porous medium when the second mathematical transform approach is used in the computational domain transform it is noted that we use the porosity front as usual to display the chemical dissolution front in the generalized computational domain because the zh number of the computationally simulated chemical dissolution system is equal to 4 in the case of using both the first and second mathematical transform approach which is greater than the corresponding critical zh number of 1 77 the preferential pore fluid flow channels are indeed formed in the generalized computational domain as clearly shown in both figs 5 and 6 this indicates that both the first mathematical transform approach and the second mathematical transform approach are suitable for simulating the instability phenomena of chemical dissolution fronts in supercritical chemical dissolution systems within the fluid saturated porous media however the related computationally simulated results shown in these two figures clearly demonstrate that the evolution patterns of the chemical dissolution fronts are obviously different when different mathematical transforms are used in the computational domain transform generally since the length scale associated with the second mathematical transform approach is much larger than that associated with the first mathematical transform approach the large length scale geological structures such as the formation of karst strata and large dissolution caves is more suitably simulated by using the second mathematical transform approach 6 conclusions in order to investigate how different mathematical transform can affect the theoretical analysis and computational simulation results of chemical dissolution front instability problems within fluid saturated porous media two different mathematical transform approaches have been considered in this study in the first mathematical transform approach the mathematical transform mainly consists of a much larger timescale than the dissolution timescale and a mdr independent length scale while in the second mathematical transform approach the mathematical transform mainly consists of a dissolution timescale and a mdr dependent length scale the related theoretical and computational results have demonstrated that 1 the use of two different mathematical transforms has no effect on the dispersion equation of a chemical dissolution front instability problem in the original physical time space domain 2 the use of different mathematical transforms may have significant effects on computationally simulating the evolution patterns of unstable chemical dissolution fronts in finite space domains which are filled with fluid saturated porous media 3 because the length scale associated with the second mathematical transform approach is much larger than that associated with the first mathematical transform approach the large length scale geological structures such as the formation of karst strata and large dissolution caves are more suitably simulated by using the second mathematical transform approach on the other hand the small length scale pollution patterns which are associated with groundwater pollution in the field of groundwater hydrology are more suitably simulated by using the first mathematical transform approach 4 if the mathematical transform is appropriately selected then the dissolution timescale chemical dissolution front instability problem in fluid saturated porous media is mathematically solvable credit authorship contribution statement chongbin zhao conceptualization methodology b e hobbs modifying original draft a ord modifying original draft declaration of

4394,managed aquifer recharge mar is an effective strategy for relieving water shortages and their related environmental problems however clogging is a major issue in mar implementation bioclogging occurs when nutrients and suspended solids ss are available in the water to which bacteria can be attached and subsequently form larger aggregations that result in porous media clogging the combined clogging of ss and pseudomonas aeruginosa p a bacteria was investigated using a series column experiment and scanning electron microscopy sem fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps correlation analysis and pathway analysis were employed to identify the combined clogging interaction between ss and p a low ss concentrations exhibited high mobility and improved the migration of p a as carriers while high ss concentrations promoted the deposition of p a thus ss changed the stage characteristics of bioclogging and the order of the clogging rate was as follows ss p a group p a group ss group the interaction mechanisms of the combined clogging included bridging ions chemical bonds functional groups extracellular polymeric substance polymerization and improved adhesion within the ss p a sand system which formed polymers with large particle sizes that occupied the pores and narrowed the flow path causing the media to clog the correlation and pathway analyses demonstrated that the direct effect of biomass was larger than ss on combined clogging but the indirect effects of biomass were less than those of the ss indicating that a series of interactions occurred during the ss p a combined clogging and more special attention should be paid to the interaction of ss and bacteria during the aquifer recharge process keywords managed aquifer recharge suspended solids combined clogging bioclogging pseudomonas aeruginosa 1 introduction managed aquifer recharge mar is an effective strategy for supplementing groundwater resources and reducing the negative effects of groundwater overexploitation ye et al 2019 porous media clogging is a long standing issue of mar that can result in a decline in the recharge rate and ultimately cause the recharge facility to fail cui et al 2018 dillon and pavelic 1996 jeong et al 2018 previous studies have indicated that mar system clogging is primarily caused by the filtration and deposition of suspended solids ss fetzer et al 2017 microorganism growth baveye et al 1998 xian et al 2019 eps production xia et al 2016 chemical precipitation cui et al 2018 gas accumulation shu et al 2017 colloid release and particle reorganization pavelic et al 2007 ss in recharge water is a key factor in controlling physical clogging dillon et al 1994 jeong et al 2018 song et al 2020 the size and concentration of ss pore structure and flow velocity affect the migration and deposition of particles in porous media fetzer et al 2017 rinck pfeiffer et al 2000 when the ss size is greater than the pore diameter ss easily causes superficial clogging cake filtration whereas fine ss can penetrate deeper into the porous medium and cause internal clogging in depth filtration du et al 2018 siriwardene et al 2007 researchers have proposed that an ss content of over 25 mg l or 3 ntu triggers clogging pavelic et al 2011 the particle size ratio between the ss and infiltration medium also affects the clogging rate and type the smaller the particle size ratio the slower the clogging rate and the more likely the clogging is internal otherwise the more likely the clogging type is superficial du et al 2018 ss particles measuring 100 μm are absorbed by electrostatic and van der waals forces and they constrain the passage of larger solid particles through bridging which is caused by the accumulated solids acting as sieves hua et al 2010 bioclogging is the second most significant mar issue dillon and pavelic 1996 and it is induced by bacteria fungi and or algae flemming and wingender 2010 xia et al 2014 the clogging rate and degree are predominately related to the carbon nitrogen temperature carbon nitrogen ratio and ph of the recharge water kirk et al 2012 reischke et al 2014 xia et al 2014 in the presence of high nutrient loads biomass cells and exopolymers accumulation in aquifer pores leads to a significant reduction in the hydraulic conductivity xia et al 2016 there is a positive correlation between the clogging degree and eps accumulation martin 2013 xia et al 2014 ye et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 different clogging combinations can be observed at the same site du et al 2018 rinck pfeiffer et al 2000 as ubiquitous fractions in recharged water microorganisms and ss in porous media are influenced by their mutual interactions wang et al 2020 for example even a small quantity of ss can aggravate the clogging process when the microbial content is high pavelic et al 2011 wang et al 2020 many factors including the mineral type surface characteristics roughness charge and hydrophobicity bacterial type physicochemical characteristics motility charge hydrophobicity and bacterial surface biopolymer compositions and environmental conditions such as ph and the ionic strength of the recharge water affect the bacterial adhesion to minerals ss exhibit a high cation exchange capacity and interlayer cations can exchange with the acid ions produced by microbial metabolism maintaining the ph value within a range that promotes the growth and respiration of microorganisms stotzky 1966 additionally bacteria minerals particle sizes the soil environment ph ionic strength organic acid and ligands and the duration affect bacterial adsorption ss can reduce the cell surface roughness change the cell morphology and size and significantly improve the glucose utilization rate of p a kang et al 2015 bacteria first briefly bind to solids through van der waals forces and then tight and irreversible adsorption occurs via other forces such as electrostatic forces denkhaus et al 2006 these interactions between microorganisms and the solid surface can influence the migration and sedimentation of microorganisms coexisting in ss additionally the microorganisms and their secretions can interact with particles which can affect the migration of particulate matter via coagulation roche et al 2017 bacterial cell aggregations are stimulated by ss steven and robert 1995 certain microbes such as aspergillus flavus can flocculate activated carbon kaolin clay and soil solids via charge neutralization or by bridging using their secretions aljuboori et al 2015 and the adhesion of microbes to particle surfaces can also alter the hydrophobicity of minerals somasundaran et al 1998 most existing research has focused on single clogging processes and mechanisms i e physical or biological and field conditions in which ss and microorganisms coexist and interact i e migration deposition and clogging have not yet been investigated wang et al 2020 bacteria and ss can influence the permeability of porous media and the clogging process both separately and together resulting in more complex clogging ramazanpour esfahani et al 2020 rinck pfeiffer et al 2000 wang et al 2020 in this study sand column experiments were conducted to simulate the mar clogging process the specific research objectives were as follows 1 to reveal the different clogging developing laws and mechanisms under the coexistence of ss and bacteria p a 2 to elucidate the interactions between ss and p a and their combined effects on the clogging of porous media 3 to

washed in deionized di water until it reached a neutral ph yang et al 2011 afterward the sand was dried in an electric drying oven at 120 c for 2 h and then sterilized using ultraviolet uv light

shenyang energy saving electric oven factory china for 2 hours to evaluate the biomass amount the deposition of the ss in the porous media was calculated using gravimetric methods after the biomass was removed from the sand sample the sand samples were washed and sonicated for many times until the supernatant liquid was colorless to evaluate the amount of ss 2 2 6 statistical analysis pearson correlation analysis was conducted in spss and a significance test was conducted using a two way analysis of variance the path coefficient was calculated as described by dewey and lu 1959 wang et al 2020 using spss path coefficient analysis was used to partition the correlation coefficients and determine the direct and indirect effects of the independent variables i e the deposition of ss and biomass amount on the dependent variable kt k0 the pathway coefficients had the characteristic of a correlation coefficient the normality of kt k0 for the ss p a group was first checked using spss to determine the path coefficient after normality was confirmed stepwise regression analysis between the dependent and the independent variables was performed 3 results 3 1 evolution of clogging ki k0 refers to the clogging degree of the ith layer of the sand column i 1 2 3 and 4 refers to the sand sections of 0 3 cm 3 8 cm 8 13 cm and 13 16 cm from the column inlet respectively and kt k0 refers to the clogging degree of the total column k k0 decreased over time for single bioclogging single ss clogging and combined ss p a clogging as illustrated in figs a c and the kt k0 evolution of different clogging types and blank control is displayed in fig 3 d the single bioclogging process can be divided into three stages based on kt k0 fig 3 the stable stage 0 1000 min quickly decreasing stage 1000 2000 min and slowly decreasing stage 2000 min which corresponds to the adaptive exponential growth and decay periods of bacterial growth respectively the reduction in hydraulic conductivity in the p a group primarily occurred at the surface layer of the column inlet kt k0 0 006 at 5000 min and then moved to the deep layers fig 3 a ss clogging occurred in the entire column and kt k0 decreased slowly and constantly to approximately 0 2 and the degree decreased with the recharge path fig 3 b ss p a clogging quickly reached 0 017 and more severely clogged the entire column compared to single clogging at the end of the experiment fig 3 c ki k0 1 at the initial stage mainly resulting from the particle rearrangement from the blank control experiment the k k0 increased slightly as well in the initial stage at the initial state of the experiment the inlet particles were not as tightly compacted and may have been rearranged under the sheer force of water flow and they formed a stable seepage channel which increased the permeability of the medium goldenberg 1993 during the experiment the initial reduction in kt k0 occurred in the order of the ss p a group 0 919 p a group 0 901 ss group 0 492 in the first 1000 min table 2 and it increased with an increase in ss in the ss and ss p a groups the clogging start time order was p a group ss group ss p a group for an ss concentration of 20 mg l and the time shortened as the ss concentration increased fig 4 a the order of the amount of time until serious clogging kt k0 0 2 was p a group ss p a group ss group table 2 and the degree of clogging in the ss p a group was heavier than that of the ss group and it was enhanced with an increase in the ss concentration fig 4 b the maximum clogging rate occurred during the quickly decreasing stage for single bioclogging and during the stable stage for ss p a clogging fig 4 b which indicated that the combined clogging factors accelerated the clogging start time 3 2 migration and deposition of p a under ss 3 2 1 effect of ss on p a migration the relative migration concentration c c0 was adopted to indicate the degree of migration of p a the migration curves of p a in porous media under various ss concentrations are displayed in fig 5 under a low ss concentration 100 mg l the p a migration rate c c0 increased to 0 5 fig 5 p a adsorbed on the ss surface exhibited high mobility when the ss concentration increased 100 mg l the probability of collision between p a and ss increased and aggregates with a large size and volume formed which narrowed the flow path and blocked the pores in the media cake formed at the inlet and inhibited the migration of p a to 0 02 when the ss concentration was 400 mg l 3 2 2 effect of ss on p a deposition the microbial accumulation increased with an increase in the ss concentration during the clogging process fig 6 a and the deposition of ss was greater than that of microorganisms fig 6 b furthermore the ss and biomass primarily accumulated on the inlet surface 3 cm 4 discussion most research has focused on the clogging mechanism of a single factor such as bacteria baveye et al 1998 martin thullner et al 2004 xia et al 2014 ss du et al 2018 xie et al 2020 or chemical ions bustos medina et al 2013 cui et al 2018 the combined clogging mechanisms of ss and bacteria have not yet been clarified in the literature 4 1 identification of combined clogging mechanisms the combined clogging mechanisms were identified according to three aspects microbial actions ion actions and bonding effects 4 1 1 microbial action the adhesive role of bacteria on particles has been the primary focus of most clogging research he et al 2020 wu et al 2014 the adhesion between bacteria and goethite primarily results from electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding rong et al 2010 certain microbes such as aspergillus flavus can flocculate activated carbon kaolin clay and soil solids via charge neutralization or bridging with their secretions aljuboori et al 2015 additionally microbes can alter the hydrophobicity of minerals to particle surfaces via adhesion somasundaran et al 1998 however the role of bacteria in ss dissolution has rarely been studied based on the laboratory experiments the ph in the environment rose fig 7 due to the action of bacteria which induced the dissolution of ss table 3 this problem was explored using solubility tests during the experiments table 3 during the clogging process the order of phduring the clogging process was as follows p a ss ss p a fig 7 the ph was 9 in the p a group due to bacterial actions and the dissolution of feldspar in the quartz sand cui et al 2018 lv 2019 both of these processes resulted in a sufficiently high ph for quartz and caused the solubility of ss to significantly increase table 3 the cation concentration in the ss p a group was 2 092 to 20 990 times higher than that in the ss group table 3 which indicated that microbial actions promoted the dissolution of soluble salts in ss additionally an increase in cations improved precipitation and further increased the risk of a moderate degree of clogging 4 1 2 ion actions in ss p a sand system the zeta potential can reflect the state of charge on the solid surface which can be used to analyze the attraction or repulsion between particles and to characterise the stability of a colloidal dispersion system the absolute value of the zeta potential decreased with an increase in the concentration os ss fig 8 when ss were introduced into the column electrostatic interactions became the dominant factor ions such as potassium k na ca2 mg2 iron fe3 and al3 produced by the dissolution of ss increased the ionic strength of the environment and the depth of the secondary minimum also increased fig 9 weakening the electrical repulsion between the ions and enhancing their adsorption these ions also induced ion bridging with the eps rong et al 2010 bacteria colonized on the porous media formed biofilms and increased the surface roughness all of which accelerated ss settlement settled ss provide a larger specific surface area promoting the adsorption of bacteria therefore bacterial surface viscous materials can more easily connect with the porous media and ss surfaces through bridging the ions also promoted the growth and reproduction of microorganisms when the concentration of ss was higher the probability of adhesion between microorganisms and ss was greater and accumulation occurred more easily at the inlet due to filtration which was due to the accumulation of microorganisms and ss mostly occurring on the surface of the column inlet fig 6 4 1 3 bonding between ss and p a ftir xps during the later stage 2000 min hydrogen bonds chemical bonds functional groups and eps polymerization were the governing factors rong et al 2010 the interactions between ss and p a were further analyzed via ftir and xps all peaks were searched for in the national institute of standards and technology xps database by assessing the spectra of the clogging substances figs 10 12 the bands at 1436 cm 1 and the shift to 1438 1434 cm 1 represented a phenolic o h plane variable angle vibration gulnaz et al 2006 laurent et al 2009 and indicated the replacement of h by other cations such as ca2 mg2 and al3 chen et al 2002 the absorption bands at 1650 cm 1 and 1540 cm 1 were attributed to the c o and c n stretching vibrations in amide i proteins and the bending vibrations of nh and c n stretching vibrations in amide ii proteins respectively the band drift from 1650 cm 1 to 1643 cm 1 indicated that new c o and c n substances were created the results reveal that ss stimulated eps production and modified its characteristics chatterjee et al 2011 chen et al 2012 the absorption bond at 879 cm 1 was related to si o and drifted to 877 881 cm 1 under the action of bacteria ouyang et al 1996 ramazanpour esfahani et al 2020 indicating that the ss dissolution was caused by microbial activities and the dissolved ions and silica reacted with p a to form new precipitations ca2 reacted with the proteins phenols and o h functional group in the flocs leading to the transformation of the c n and n h vibration bands shift from 1540 cm 1 to 1538 cm 1 as presented in fig 10 the xps spectra of si 2p fig 11 a confirmed the biochemical binding between the biomass and solids and clarified the si precipitation mechanism in the packing columns for the control the peak at a binding energy be of 102 9 ev was assigned to o si o regarding the role of bacteria two new peaks appeared at bes of 102 5 ev si ch3 2o n and 103 1 ev si o fig 11 a which were attributed to the binding of the dissolved sio2 with the epss thus the si polymers bonded to epss to enhance biomass production and clogging the xps spectra of ca 2p fig 11 c clarified the ca precipitation mechanisms in the packing columns the ca 2p in the ss fit well with the peaks at bes of 347 3 ev ca o and 350 6 ev ca oh 2 regarding the role of bacteria new peaks appeared at 346 7 ev 347 4 ev 350 35 ev 351 15 ev and 351 75 ev showing that new substances were produced ca hcoo 2 ca o ca co3 and ca oh 2 ch2ch c o oh n this result indicates that ca precipitations exerted a significant influence on clogging additionally the xps spectra of mg 1 s fig 11 d from the clogging samples in the ss p a group fit well with new peaks at bes of 1303 85 ev and 1304 55 ev corresponding to mg oh 2 and mg sio4 and indicating that mg precipitations were produced during the clogging process xps spectra of fe 2p and al 2p existed for the ss however they disappeared in the ss p a clogging sample results which indicated that these ions were absorbed and utilized by bacteria fig 12 the xps and ftir spectra confirmed that ions dissolved from ss accelerated microbial activity and generated microbial products increasing the precipitation of mg oh 2 mgsio4 ca hcoo 2 caco3 si ch3 2o n and ca oh 2 ch2ch c o oh n additionally the precipitations aggregated with bacteria which further aggravated the clogging the quartz sand surface was modified by bacteria and precipitations during the recharging process and the deposition of these substances on the surface and in the pore throats resulted in more severe clogging 4 1 4 the interaction of ss and p a a lower zeta potential indicates a stronger absorption force and the ss and p a are more likely to be aggregated as a bacteria mineral polymer with a larger size table 4 fig 13 ss can be adsorbed into eps through charge neutralization bridging and or sweeping ma et al 2008 the structure of solids and porous media plays a dominant role in the migration and distribution processes of solids which also impacts the permeability and alters the preferential flow path the particle size ratio rp d dp where d is the ss diameter and dp is the size of the porous particle was analyzed to further understand the behavior of ss within the pore space for lower ss concentrations in the ss p a group the particle size was smaller than the pore diameter table 4 and the particles could therefore easily penetrate the porous media thus they tended to clog narrow pore throats the migration distance primarily depends on the hydrodynamic forces under this condition rp 0 15 however the bridging and clogging of fine solids could be observed in the pore space when rp 0 15 feng et al 2020 in the ss p a group for high ss concentrations 200 mg l and 400 mg l the pore structure was significant ju and fan 2009 and the combined clogging mechanism was filtration as cake under these conditions the amount of ss p a flocs deposited in the sand was calculated using the primary sedimentary dynamics hypothesis and convection diffusion equation where the deposition coefficient kdep can be calculated using eq 2 du et al 2018 2 k dep v ε l ln c c 0 where v cm s is the flow velocity ε is the porosity of the porous medium l cm is the effective length of the column and c c0 corresponds to the fraction of particles recovered in the effluent after the breakthrough curve plateaus the deposition rate coefficient increased with an increase in the ss concentration table 5 which promoted ss p a floc deposition and accelerated clogging the clogging mechanism was infiltration under high ss concentrations 4 2 contribution of ss and bacteria to combined clogging the identification of combined clogging mechanisms in section 4 1 demonstrated that both factors ss and p a were related to media clogging however it was difficult to distinguish their contribution rates certain combined clogging research has demonstrated that physical clogging due to the attachment and entrapment of solids on the surfaces of collectors and biological clogging primarily results from biomass accumulation at the inlet and mineral dissolution through microbial activity ramazanpour esfahani et al 2020 rinck pfeiffer et al 2000 however these factor contribution rates are rarely explored to determine the contribution rates of ss and p a to the combined clogging the clogging substance accumulation ratio was calculated and a correlation analysis was conducted 4 2 1 clogging substances accumulated ratio the accumulated ratio which is predominately characterized by the proportions of bacteria and ss accumulation in the clogging process was calculated to identify the impacts of ss and bacteria deposition on the combined clogging eq 3 as illustrated in table 6 3 c r mi m ss m p a where c r represents the bacteria accumulation ratio m ss is the ss accumulation amount m p a is the bacteria accumulation amount and mi is the amount of ss or bacteria the masses of the accumulated ss and p a in the first 3 cm and those of the total columns are displayed in table 6 the accumulated ratio demonstrated that both biomass and ss affected the combined clogging and the ss clogging mass was more significant than that of the biomass in the combined clogging ss accumulation accounted for over 64 9 of the total clogging substances the accumulated p a ratio in the surface layer was less than that in the entire column indirectly demonstrating that ss promote the migration of bacteria the ss were primarily deposited in the surface layer of the inlet as a result of the biofilm adhesion and filtration under high ss concentrations 4 2 2 interaction between ss and biomass content in ss p a clogging the clogging substance accumulation calculation only explains the clogging mass quantity and does not represent the true contribution of each substance type to the clogging therefore correlation analysis was conducted to determine the real contribution rates of the ss and biomass deposition to the combined clogging as exhibited in table 7 the relative significance of the correlations table 7 was as follows biomass ss kt k0 gradually decreased with the accumulation of biomass in the p a group ss deposition in the ss group and ss biomass deposition in the ss p a group fitting formulas for the different groups were also established as illustrated in fig 14 in the ss p a group bacteria cells continuously increased to 467 mg and ss accumulated to 4798 mg which contributed to the reduction in kt k0 throughout the experiment the results depicted that ss and biomass deposition were both significantly negatively associated with kt k0 which indicated that ss and biomass deposition not only affected kt k0 independently but also interactively to influence the clogging process the ss deposition and biomass were obtained for single clogging and kt k0 in the ss p a group was predicted at a certain ss concentration based on the equations in fig 14 c and d the predicted kt k0 in the ss and p a groups were assessed separately when the ss deposition and biomass were obtained for the ss p a group based on the equations in fig 14 a and b furthermore a quantitative analysis of biomass and ss combined clogging was conducted via path coefficient analysis and using spss table 8 the correlation coefficients and the direct and indirect effects of ss and biomass deposition on kt k0 in the ss p a group are displayed in table 8 the results of the regression analysis were as follows 4 k t k 0 0 755827 0 01662 d b 0 001458 d s where db is the biomass content deposited in the total column mg and ds is the content of ss deposited in the total column mg the significance of eq 4 was p 0 05 and r2 0 918 indicating that there was a sufficient fit between the measured and predicted data the results of the path analysis are displayed in table 8 these results demonstrate that the direct contribution of biomass 8 579 to kt k0 was greater than that of the ss 7 728 however the indirect effect of ss on kt k0 8 566 i e by influencing biomass production was higher than that of biomass 7 717 i e by influencing ss deposition this result indicates that ss promoted microbial growth and eps production and formed agglomerates with microorganisms that exhibited a significant effect on the kt k0 however the value of r2 0 918 in the statistical regression and the surplus factor e 1 r 2 0 3975 was high enough to indicate that not only the above two factors du and chen 2010 affect clogging when kt k0 declined to 0 3 the content of ss in the ss group was approximately 1 14 to 8 84 times higher than that in the ss p a group and the elapsed time to kt k0 0 3 in the ss group was approximately 1 62 5 12 times longer than that of the ss p a group ss concentration range of 20 400 mg l these results demonstrate that bacteria played a crucial role in kt k0 reduction by promoting ss attachment in the ss p a group comparing the ss biomass deposited in the ss p a group to that in the single clogging group the ss p a group took less time to accumulate a similar amount of ss biomass to that of the single group this result is consistent with the results of the adsorption of bacteria onto the ss surface where ss were more likely to settle in the upper layer within a short recharge period and the clogging rate in the ss p a group was larger than that of the single ss p a group during the combined clogging process the direct and indirect effects of ss and biomass on the medium permeability were analyzed using spss ss and biomass impacted clogging at different stages of the clogging process during the seepage stage clogging was primarily induced by ss deposition in the stable stage microbes displayed poor adhesion as free cells the adsorption force between the cell membrane and quartz sand was not strong enough to resist the shear force and gravity of the water flow and the bacteria migrated to the outside of the sand column with water flow these results demonstrate that the medium permeability increased and the migration and deposition of p a under the coexistence of ss is affected by van der waals forces electrostatic forces among the quartz sand hydrogen bonds hydrophobic interactions lewis acid base interaction rong et al 2010 and the space steric hindrance effect wu et al 2013 of the bacteria ss and porous media interactions in the rapidly decreasing stage ss and p a were absorbed on the sand surface both separately and together and they interacted and formed larger sized aggregates the absorption and deposition narrowed the flow path and the aggregates occupied the pore space and throat further influencing migration and deposition in the porous media thus both bacteria growth and ss accumulation contributed to the reduction in hydraulic conductivity finally the clogging stabilized in the slowly decreasing stage 5 conclusions in this study the evolution laws of single and combined clogging induced by ss and bacteria were investigated the combined clogging mechanism was identified and the contribution rate of ss and p a to combined clogging was calculated the primary findings can be summarized as follows ss addition weakened the typical bioclogging stage characteristics and modified the sand surface via ss and p a attachment the clogging rates in descending order were ss p a group p a group ss group the concentration of ss influenced bacteria migration and deposition ss at low concentrations exhibited high mobility and promoted the migration of bacteria while ss at high concentrations inhibited bacteria migration which affected the clogging position and spatial distribution microbial action induced the dissolution of soluble salts in the ss and promoted the combination of ss and bacteria through bridging ions eps polymerization chemical bonds functional groups and formed agglomerates with large sizes and volumes that influenced the clogging process via pore occupation or infiltration the combined contribution rate of ss and p a to clogging was assessed using the clogging substances accumulation and correlation analysis of ss and p a to combined clogging the results demonstrated that the direct effect of biomass was larger than ss but the indirect effects of biomass were less than those of the ss indicating that a series of interactions occurred during the ss p a combined clogging and more special attention should be paid to the interaction of ss and bacteria during the aquifer recharge process this study demonstrated that special attention should be paid to the interaction of ss and bacteria during the mar providing a new perspective for quantifying the contribution rate of factors on combined clogging in recharge anda rule for the prevention control and treatment of clogging in field application in summary we suggest that recharge water containing ss and bacteria should be employed with caution for recharging the correlation analysis also revealed that other factors cell counts and polysaccharides proteins hydrophobicity and so on affect the combined clogging evolution and a comprehensive analysis of the influencing factors needs to be performed funding this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china 41672231 41472213

4394,managed aquifer recharge mar is an effective strategy for relieving water shortages and their related environmental problems however clogging is a major issue in mar implementation bioclogging occurs when nutrients and suspended solids ss are available in the water to which bacteria can be attached and subsequently form larger aggregations that result in porous media clogging the combined clogging of ss and pseudomonas aeruginosa p a bacteria was investigated using a series column experiment and scanning electron microscopy sem fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps correlation analysis and pathway analysis were employed to identify the combined clogging interaction between ss and p a low ss concentrations exhibited high mobility and improved the migration of p a as carriers while high ss concentrations promoted the deposition of p a thus ss changed the stage characteristics of bioclogging and the order of the clogging rate was as follows ss p a group p a group ss group the interaction mechanisms of the combined clogging included bridging ions chemical bonds functional groups extracellular polymeric substance polymerization and improved adhesion within the ss p a sand system which formed polymers with large particle sizes that occupied the pores and narrowed the flow path causing the media to clog the correlation and pathway analyses demonstrated that the direct effect of biomass was larger than ss on combined clogging but the indirect effects of biomass were less than those of the ss indicating that a series of interactions occurred during the ss p a combined clogging and more special attention should be paid to the interaction of ss and bacteria during the aquifer recharge process keywords managed aquifer recharge suspended solids combined clogging bioclogging pseudomonas aeruginosa 1 introduction managed aquifer recharge mar is an effective strategy for supplementing groundwater resources and reducing the negative effects of groundwater overexploitation ye et al 2019 porous media clogging is a long standing issue of mar that can result in a decline in the recharge rate and ultimately cause the recharge facility to fail cui et al 2018 dillon and pavelic 1996 jeong et al 2018 previous studies have indicated that mar system clogging is primarily caused by the filtration and deposition of suspended solids ss fetzer et al 2017 microorganism growth baveye et al 1998 xian et al 2019 eps production xia et al 2016 chemical precipitation cui et al 2018 gas accumulation shu et al 2017 colloid release and particle reorganization pavelic et al 2007 ss in recharge water is a key factor in controlling physical clogging dillon et al 1994 jeong et al 2018 song et al 2020 the size and concentration of ss pore structure and flow velocity affect the migration and deposition of particles in porous media fetzer et al 2017 rinck pfeiffer et al 2000 when the ss size is greater than the pore diameter ss easily causes superficial clogging cake filtration whereas fine ss can penetrate deeper into the porous medium and cause internal clogging in depth filtration du et al 2018 siriwardene et al 2007 researchers have proposed that an ss content of over 25 mg l or 3 ntu triggers clogging pavelic et al 2011 the particle size ratio between the ss and infiltration medium also affects the clogging rate and type the smaller the particle size ratio the slower the clogging rate and the more likely the clogging is internal otherwise the more likely the clogging type is superficial du et al 2018 ss particles measuring 100 μm are absorbed by electrostatic and van der waals forces and they constrain the passage of larger solid particles through bridging which is caused

site du et al 2018 rinck pfeiffer et al 2000 as ubiquitous fractions in recharged water microorganisms and ss in porous media are influenced by their mutual interactions wang et al 2020 for example even a small quantity of ss can aggravate the clogging process when the microbial content is high pavelic et al 2011 wang et al 2020 many factors including the mineral type surface characteristics roughness charge and hydrophobicity bacterial type physicochemical characteristics motility charge hydrophobicity and bacterial surface biopolymer compositions and environmental conditions such as ph and the ionic strength of the recharge water affect the bacterial adhesion to minerals ss exhibit a high cation exchange capacity and interlayer cations can exchange with the acid ions produced by microbial metabolism maintaining the ph value within a range that promotes the growth and respiration of microorganisms stotzky 1966 additionally bacteria minerals particle sizes the soil environment ph ionic strength organic acid and ligands and the duration affect bacterial adsorption ss can reduce the cell surface roughness change the cell morphology and size and significantly improve the glucose utilization rate of p a kang et al 2015 bacteria first briefly bind to solids through van der waals forces and then tight and irreversible adsorption occurs via other forces such as electrostatic forces denkhaus et al 2006 these interactions between microorganisms and the solid surface can influence the migration and sedimentation of microorganisms coexisting in ss additionally the microorganisms and their secretions can interact with particles which can affect the migration of particulate matter via coagulation roche et al 2017 bacterial cell aggregations are stimulated by ss steven and robert 1995 certain microbes such as aspergillus flavus can flocculate activated carbon kaolin clay and soil solids via charge neutralization or by bridging using their secretions aljuboori et al 2015 and the adhesion of microbes to particle surfaces can also alter the hydrophobicity of minerals somasundaran et al 1998 most existing research has focused on single clogging processes and mechanisms i e physical or biological and field conditions in which ss and microorganisms coexist and interact i e migration deposition and clogging have not yet been investigated wang et al 2020 bacteria and ss can influence the permeability of porous media and the clogging process both separately and together resulting in more complex clogging ramazanpour esfahani et al 2020 rinck pfeiffer et al 2000 wang et al 2020 in this study sand column experiments were conducted to simulate the mar clogging process the specific research objectives were as follows 1 to reveal the different clogging developing laws and mechanisms under the coexistence of ss and bacteria p a 2 to elucidate the interactions between ss and p a and their combined effects on the clogging of porous media 3 to reveal p a migration laws for different ss concentrations and 4 to compare the characteristics of porous media clogging and identify the dominant factors and related contributions 2 materials and

224 2 μm medium sand the hydraulic conductivity is 10 35 m day the sand was pretreated using an acid based treatment 0 2 m sodium hydroxide and 0 2 m hydrochloric acid to remove metal impurities and washed in deionized di water until it reached a neutral ph yang et al 2011 afterward the sand was dried in an electric drying oven at 120 c for 2 h and then sterilized using ultraviolet uv light before being packed into columns the ss were derived from the stormwater runoff of pavement roads in changchun china the raw samples were dried and sieved to obtain particles with a diameter of 3 24

shenyang energy saving electric oven factory china for 2 hours to evaluate the biomass amount the deposition of the ss in the porous media was calculated using gravimetric methods after the biomass was removed from the sand sample the sand samples were washed and sonicated for many times until the supernatant liquid was colorless to evaluate the amount of ss 2 2 6 statistical analysis pearson correlation analysis was conducted in spss and a significance test was conducted using a two way analysis of variance the path coefficient was calculated as described by dewey and lu 1959 wang et al 2020 using spss path coefficient analysis was used to partition the correlation coefficients and determine the direct and indirect effects of the independent variables i e the deposition of ss and biomass amount on the dependent variable kt k0 the pathway coefficients had the characteristic of a correlation coefficient the normality of kt k0 for the ss p a group was first checked using spss to determine the path coefficient after normality was confirmed stepwise regression analysis between the dependent and the independent variables was performed 3 results 3 1 evolution of clogging ki k0 refers to the clogging degree of the ith layer of the sand column i 1 2 3 and 4 refers to the sand sections of 0 3 cm 3 8 cm 8 13 cm and 13 16 cm from the column inlet respectively and kt k0 refers to the clogging degree of the total column k k0 decreased over time for single bioclogging single ss clogging and combined ss p a clogging as illustrated in figs a c and the kt k0 evolution of different clogging types and blank control is displayed in fig 3 d the single bioclogging process can be divided into three stages based on kt k0 fig 3 the stable stage 0 1000 min quickly decreasing stage 1000 2000 min and slowly decreasing stage 2000 min which corresponds to the adaptive exponential growth and decay periods of bacterial growth respectively the reduction in hydraulic conductivity in the p a group primarily occurred at the surface layer of the column inlet kt k0 0 006 at 5000 min and then moved to the deep layers fig 3 a ss clogging occurred in the entire column and kt k0 decreased slowly and constantly to approximately 0 2 and the degree decreased with the recharge path fig 3 b ss p a clogging quickly reached 0 017 and more severely clogged the entire column compared to single clogging at the end of the experiment fig 3 c ki k0 1 at the initial stage mainly resulting from the particle rearrangement from the blank control experiment the k k0 increased slightly as well in the initial stage at the initial state of the experiment the inlet particles were not as tightly compacted and may have been rearranged under the sheer force of water flow and they formed a stable seepage channel which increased the permeability of the medium goldenberg 1993 during the experiment the initial reduction in kt k0 occurred in the order of the ss p a group 0 919 p a group 0 901 ss group 0 492 in the first 1000 min table 2 and it increased with an increase in ss in the ss and ss p a groups the clogging start time order was p a group ss group ss p a group for an ss concentration of 20 mg l and the time shortened as the ss concentration increased fig 4 a the order of the amount of time until serious clogging kt k0 0 2 was p a group ss p a group ss group table 2 and the degree of clogging in the ss p a group was heavier than that of the ss group and it was enhanced with an increase in the ss concentration fig 4 b the maximum clogging rate occurred during the quickly decreasing stage for single bioclogging and during the stable stage for ss p a clogging fig 4 b which indicated that the combined clogging factors accelerated the clogging start time 3 2 migration and deposition of p a under ss 3 2 1 effect of ss on p a migration the relative migration concentration c c0 was adopted to indicate the degree of migration of p a the migration curves of p a in porous media under various ss concentrations are displayed in fig 5 under a low ss concentration 100 mg l the p a migration rate c c0 increased to 0 5 fig 5 p a adsorbed on the ss surface exhibited high mobility when the ss concentration increased 100 mg l the probability of collision between p a and ss increased and aggregates with a large size and volume formed which narrowed the flow path and blocked the pores in the media cake formed at the inlet and inhibited the migration of p a to 0 02 when the ss concentration was 400 mg l 3 2 2 effect of ss on p a deposition the microbial accumulation increased with an increase in the ss concentration during the clogging process fig 6 a and the deposition of ss was greater than that of microorganisms fig 6 b furthermore the ss and biomass primarily accumulated on the inlet surface 3 cm 4 discussion most research has focused on the clogging mechanism of a single factor such as bacteria baveye et al 1998 martin thullner et al 2004 xia et al 2014 ss du et al 2018 xie et al 2020 or chemical ions bustos medina et al 2013 cui et al 2018 the combined clogging mechanisms of ss and bacteria have not yet been clarified in the literature 4 1 identification of combined clogging mechanisms the combined clogging mechanisms were identified according to three aspects microbial actions ion actions and bonding effects 4 1 1 microbial action the adhesive role of bacteria on particles has been the primary focus of most clogging research he et al 2020 wu et al 2014 the adhesion between bacteria and goethite primarily results from electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding rong et al 2010 certain microbes such as aspergillus flavus can flocculate activated carbon kaolin clay and soil solids via charge neutralization or bridging with their secretions aljuboori et al 2015 additionally microbes can alter the hydrophobicity of minerals to particle surfaces via adhesion somasundaran et al 1998 however the role of bacteria in ss dissolution has rarely been studied based on the laboratory experiments the ph in the environment rose fig 7 due to the action of bacteria which induced the dissolution of ss table 3 this problem was explored using solubility tests during the experiments table 3 during the clogging process the order of phduring the clogging process was as follows p a ss ss p a fig 7 the ph was 9 in the p a group due to bacterial actions and the dissolution of feldspar in the quartz sand cui et al 2018 lv 2019 both of these processes resulted in a sufficiently high ph for quartz and caused the solubility of ss to significantly increase table 3 the cation concentration in the ss p a group was 2 092 to 20 990 times higher than that in the ss group table 3 which indicated that microbial actions promoted the dissolution of soluble salts in ss additionally an increase in cations improved precipitation and further increased the risk of a moderate degree of clogging 4 1 2 ion actions in ss p a sand system the zeta potential can reflect the state of charge on the solid surface which can be used to analyze the attraction or repulsion between particles and to characterise the stability of a colloidal dispersion system the absolute value of the zeta potential decreased with an increase in the concentration os ss fig 8 when ss were introduced into the column electrostatic interactions became the dominant factor ions such as potassium k na ca2 mg2 iron fe3 and al3 produced by the dissolution of ss increased the ionic strength of the environment and the depth of the secondary minimum also increased fig 9 weakening the electrical repulsion between the ions and enhancing their adsorption these ions also induced ion bridging with the eps rong et al 2010 bacteria colonized on the porous media formed biofilms and increased the surface roughness all of which accelerated ss settlement settled ss provide a larger specific surface area promoting the adsorption of bacteria therefore bacterial surface viscous materials can more easily connect with the porous media and ss surfaces through bridging the ions also promoted the growth and reproduction of microorganisms when the concentration of ss was higher the probability of adhesion between microorganisms and ss was greater and accumulation occurred more easily at the inlet due to filtration which was due to the accumulation of microorganisms and ss mostly occurring on the surface of the column inlet fig 6 4 1 3 bonding between ss and p a ftir xps during the later stage 2000 min hydrogen bonds chemical bonds functional groups and eps polymerization were the governing factors rong et al 2010 the interactions between ss and p a were further analyzed via ftir and xps all peaks were searched for in the national institute of standards and technology xps database by assessing the spectra of the clogging substances figs 10 12 the bands at 1436 cm 1 and the shift to 1438 1434 cm 1 represented a phenolic o h plane variable angle vibration gulnaz et al 2006 laurent et al 2009 and indicated the replacement of h by other cations such as ca2 mg2 and al3 chen et al 2002 the absorption bands at 1650 cm 1 and 1540 cm 1 were attributed to the c o and c n stretching vibrations in amide i proteins and the bending vibrations of nh and c n stretching vibrations in amide ii proteins respectively the band drift from 1650 cm 1 to 1643 cm 1 indicated that new c o and c n substances were created the results reveal that ss stimulated eps production and modified its characteristics chatterjee et al 2011 chen et al 2012 the absorption bond at 879 cm 1 was related to si o and drifted to 877 881 cm 1 under the action of bacteria ouyang et al 1996 ramazanpour esfahani et al 2020 indicating that the ss dissolution was caused by microbial activities and the dissolved ions and silica reacted with p a to form new precipitations ca2 reacted with the proteins phenols and o h functional group in the flocs leading to the transformation of the c n and n h vibration bands shift from 1540 cm 1 to 1538 cm 1 as presented in fig 10 the xps spectra of si 2p fig 11 a confirmed the biochemical binding between the biomass and solids and clarified the si precipitation mechanism in the packing columns for the control the peak at a binding energy be of 102 9 ev was assigned to o si o regarding the role of bacteria two new peaks appeared at bes of 102 5 ev si ch3 2o n and 103 1 ev si o fig 11 a which were attributed to the binding of the dissolved sio2 with the epss thus the si polymers bonded to epss to enhance biomass production and clogging the xps spectra of ca 2p fig 11 c clarified the ca precipitation mechanisms in the packing columns the ca 2p in the ss fit well with the peaks at bes of 347 3 ev ca o and 350 6 ev ca oh 2 regarding the role of bacteria new peaks appeared at 346 7 ev 347 4 ev 350 35 ev 351 15 ev and 351 75 ev showing that new substances were produced ca hcoo 2 ca o ca co3 and ca oh 2 ch2ch c o oh n this result indicates that ca precipitations exerted a significant influence on clogging additionally the xps spectra of mg 1 s fig 11 d from the clogging samples in the ss p a group fit well with new peaks at bes of 1303 85 ev and 1304 55 ev corresponding to mg oh 2 and mg sio4 and indicating that mg precipitations were produced during the clogging process xps spectra of fe 2p and al 2p existed for the ss however they disappeared in the ss p a clogging sample results which indicated that these ions were absorbed and utilized by bacteria fig 12 the xps and ftir spectra confirmed that ions dissolved from ss accelerated microbial activity and generated microbial products increasing the precipitation of mg oh 2 mgsio4 ca hcoo 2 caco3 si ch3 2o n and ca oh 2 ch2ch c o oh n additionally the precipitations aggregated with bacteria which further aggravated the clogging the quartz sand surface was modified by bacteria and precipitations during the recharging process and the deposition of these substances on the surface and in the pore throats resulted in more severe clogging 4 1 4 the interaction of ss and p a a lower zeta potential indicates a stronger absorption force and the ss and p a are more likely to be aggregated as a bacteria mineral polymer with a larger size table 4 fig 13 ss can be adsorbed into eps through charge neutralization bridging and or sweeping ma et al 2008 the structure of solids and porous media plays a dominant role in the migration and distribution processes of solids which also impacts the permeability and alters the preferential flow path the particle size ratio rp d dp where d is the ss diameter and dp is the size of the porous particle was analyzed to further understand the behavior of ss within the pore space for lower ss concentrations in the ss p a group the particle size was smaller than the pore diameter table 4 and the particles could therefore easily penetrate the porous media thus they tended to clog narrow pore throats the migration distance primarily depends on the hydrodynamic forces under this condition rp 0 15 however the bridging and clogging of fine solids could be observed in the pore space when rp 0 15 feng et al 2020 in the ss p a group for high ss concentrations 200 mg l and 400 mg l the pore structure was significant ju and fan 2009 and the combined clogging mechanism was filtration as cake under these conditions the amount of ss p a flocs deposited in the sand was calculated using the primary sedimentary dynamics hypothesis and convection diffusion equation where the deposition coefficient kdep can be calculated using eq 2 du et al 2018 2 k dep v ε l ln c c 0 where v cm s is the flow velocity ε is the porosity of the porous medium l cm is the effective length of the column and c c0 corresponds to the fraction of particles recovered in the effluent after the breakthrough curve plateaus the deposition rate coefficient increased with an increase in the ss concentration table 5 which promoted ss p a floc deposition and accelerated clogging the clogging mechanism was infiltration under high ss concentrations 4 2 contribution of ss and bacteria to combined clogging the identification of combined clogging mechanisms in section 4 1 demonstrated that both factors ss and p a were related to media clogging however it was difficult to distinguish their contribution rates certain combined clogging research has demonstrated that physical clogging due to the attachment and entrapment of solids on the surfaces of collectors and biological clogging primarily results from biomass accumulation at the inlet and mineral dissolution through microbial activity ramazanpour esfahani et al 2020 rinck pfeiffer et al 2000 however these factor contribution rates are rarely explored to determine the contribution rates of ss and p a to the combined clogging the clogging substance accumulation ratio was calculated and a correlation analysis was conducted 4 2 1 clogging substances accumulated ratio the accumulated ratio which is predominately characterized by the proportions of bacteria and ss accumulation in the clogging process was calculated to identify the impacts of ss and bacteria deposition on the combined clogging eq 3 as illustrated in table 6 3 c r mi m ss m p a where c r represents the bacteria accumulation ratio m ss is the ss accumulation amount m p a is the bacteria accumulation amount and mi is the amount of ss or bacteria the masses of the accumulated ss and p a in the first 3 cm and those of the total columns are displayed in table 6 the accumulated ratio demonstrated that both biomass and ss affected the combined clogging and the ss clogging mass was more significant than that of the biomass in the combined clogging ss accumulation accounted for over 64 9 of the total clogging substances the accumulated p a ratio in the surface layer was less than that in the entire column indirectly demonstrating that ss promote the migration of bacteria the ss were primarily deposited in the surface layer of the inlet as a result of the biofilm adhesion and filtration under high ss concentrations 4 2 2 interaction between ss and biomass content in ss p a clogging the clogging substance accumulation calculation only explains the clogging mass quantity and does not represent the true contribution of each substance type to the clogging therefore correlation analysis was conducted to determine the real contribution rates of the ss and biomass deposition to the combined clogging as exhibited in table 7 the relative significance of the correlations table 7 was as follows biomass ss kt k0 gradually decreased with the accumulation of biomass in the p a group ss deposition in the ss group and ss biomass deposition in the ss p a group fitting formulas for the different groups were also established as illustrated in fig 14 in the ss p a group bacteria cells continuously increased to 467 mg and ss accumulated to 4798 mg which contributed to the reduction in kt k0 throughout the experiment the results depicted that ss and biomass deposition were both significantly negatively associated with kt k0 which indicated that ss and biomass deposition not only affected kt k0 independently but also interactively to influence the clogging process the ss deposition and biomass were obtained for single clogging and kt k0 in the ss p a group was predicted at a certain ss concentration based on the equations in fig 14 c and d the predicted kt k0 in the ss and p a groups were assessed separately when the ss deposition and biomass were obtained for the ss p a group based on the equations in fig 14 a and b furthermore a quantitative analysis of biomass and ss combined clogging was conducted via path coefficient analysis and using spss table 8 the correlation coefficients and the direct and indirect effects of ss and biomass deposition on kt k0 in the ss p a group are displayed in table 8 the results of the regression analysis were as follows 4 k t k 0 0 755827 0 01662 d b 0 001458 d s where db is the biomass content deposited in the total column mg and ds is the content of ss deposited in the total column mg the significance of eq 4 was p 0 05 and r2 0 918 indicating that there was a sufficient fit between the measured and predicted data the results of the path analysis are displayed in table 8 these results demonstrate that the direct contribution of biomass 8 579 to kt k0 was greater than that of the ss 7 728 however the indirect effect of ss on kt k0 8 566 i e by influencing biomass production was higher than that of biomass 7 717 i e by influencing ss deposition this result indicates that ss promoted microbial growth and eps production and formed agglomerates with microorganisms that exhibited a significant effect on the kt k0 however the value of r2 0 918 in the statistical regression and the surplus factor e 1 r 2 0 3975 was high enough to indicate that not only the above two factors du and chen 2010 affect clogging when kt k0 declined to 0 3 the content of ss in the ss group was approximately 1 14 to 8 84 times higher than that in the ss p a group and the elapsed time to kt k0 0 3 in the ss group was approximately 1 62 5 12 times longer than that of the ss p a group ss concentration range of 20 400 mg l these results demonstrate that bacteria played a crucial role in kt k0 reduction by promoting ss attachment in the ss p a group comparing the ss biomass deposited in the ss p a group to that in the single clogging group the ss p a group took less time to accumulate a similar amount of ss biomass to that of the single group this result is consistent with the results of the adsorption of bacteria onto the ss surface where ss were more likely to settle in the upper layer within a short recharge period and the clogging rate in the ss p a group was larger than that of the single ss p a group during the combined clogging process the direct and indirect effects of ss and biomass on the medium permeability were analyzed using spss ss and biomass impacted clogging at different stages of the clogging process during the seepage stage clogging was primarily induced by ss deposition in the stable stage microbes displayed poor adhesion as free cells the adsorption force between the cell membrane and quartz sand was not strong enough to resist the shear force and gravity of the water flow and the bacteria migrated to the outside of the sand column with water flow these results demonstrate that the medium permeability increased and the migration and deposition of p a under the coexistence of ss is affected by van der waals forces electrostatic forces among the quartz sand hydrogen bonds hydrophobic interactions lewis acid base interaction rong et al 2010 and the space steric hindrance effect wu et al 2013 of the bacteria ss and porous media interactions in the rapidly decreasing stage ss and p a were absorbed on the sand surface both separately and together and they interacted and formed larger sized aggregates the absorption and deposition narrowed the flow path and the aggregates occupied the pore space and throat further influencing migration and deposition in the porous media thus both bacteria growth and ss accumulation contributed to the reduction in hydraulic conductivity finally the clogging stabilized in the slowly decreasing stage 5 conclusions in this study the evolution laws of single and combined clogging induced by ss and bacteria were investigated the combined clogging mechanism was identified and the contribution rate of ss and p a to combined clogging was calculated the primary findings can be summarized as follows ss addition weakened the typical bioclogging stage characteristics and modified the sand surface via ss and p a attachment the clogging rates in descending order were ss p a group p a group ss group the concentration of ss influenced bacteria migration and deposition ss at low concentrations exhibited high mobility and promoted the migration of bacteria while ss at high concentrations inhibited bacteria migration which affected the clogging position and spatial distribution microbial action induced the dissolution of soluble salts in the ss and promoted the combination of ss and bacteria through bridging ions eps polymerization chemical bonds functional groups and formed agglomerates with large sizes and volumes that influenced the clogging process via pore occupation or infiltration the combined contribution rate of ss and p a to clogging was assessed using the clogging substances accumulation and correlation analysis of ss and p a to combined clogging the results demonstrated that the direct effect of biomass was larger than ss but the indirect effects of biomass were less than those of the ss indicating that a series of interactions occurred during the ss p a combined clogging and more special attention should be paid to the interaction of ss and bacteria during the aquifer recharge process this study demonstrated that special attention should be paid to the interaction of ss and bacteria during the mar providing a new perspective for quantifying the contribution rate of factors on combined clogging in recharge anda rule for the prevention control and treatment of clogging in field application in summary we suggest that recharge water containing ss and bacteria should be employed with caution for recharging the correlation analysis also revealed that other factors cell counts and polysaccharides proteins hydrophobicity and so on affect the combined clogging evolution and a comprehensive analysis of the influencing factors needs to be performed funding this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china 41672231 41472213
