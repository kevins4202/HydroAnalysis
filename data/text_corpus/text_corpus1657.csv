8285,study region the commonwealth of massachusetts united states study focus the commonwealth of massachusetts is projected to experience significant impacts from future climate change and these impacts include but are not limited to increases in extreme precipitation flooding and droughts this study investigates the potential impacts of climate change and uncertainties on future floods and low flow conditions in the rivers and streams of massachusetts fourteen downscaled gcm projections under two greenhouse gas concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 are used as inputs into a distributed hydrological model to obtain future streamflow conditions new hydrological insights for the region seasonal change projections of 100 year flood and a measure of drought the seven day ten year low flow q7 10 are estimated through the near term years 2021 2060 and the far term years 2060 2099 relative to the base period years 1981 2016 the median estimates of 100 year flood during winter report a 15 or higher increases in many watersheds at the far term in contrast flood magnitudes in spring show decreases for most of the watersheds during both near and far term for seven day ten year low flow estimates largest decreases are projected during the fall and this trend is found to be consistent across future time periods two emission scenarios have shown similar trends for most cases although change projections are seen to be more prominent for rcp8 5 when compared to rcp4 5 keywords climate change gcms hydrological modeling 100 year floods low flows 1 introduction anthropogenic activity is a primary contributor to climate change leading to increases in global temperatures and an associated shift in the frequency and intensity of precipitation allen and ingram 2002 pachauri et al 2014 pendergrass et al 2017 in the future extreme precipitation events are expected to be more damaging than in the past marx et al 2018 wilcox et al 2018 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc suggests that global temperature could rise between 2 0 and 4 2 celsius by 2100 pachauri et al 2014 both temperature and precipitation are critical to the balance of the hydrologic cycle shifts in long term means and variability creates an imbalance in global and regional water cycles that will become more apparent in the future kay et al 2009 the impacts of climate change on regional hydrology will vary among regions in the future and will be impacted by local characteristics such as hydroclimatic geologic and topographic conditions caldwell et al 2012 hodgkins et al 2017 steele dunne et al 2008 during the later part of the 20th century and portions of the early portion of the 21st century the change in extreme precipitation such as the 100 year maximum daily precipitation event has been greater in the northeastern united states than in other portions of the country wuebbles et al 2017 over last sixty years massachusetts has exhibited increases by as much as 70 in the daily extreme precipitation event douglas and fairbank 2011 hayhoe et al 2007 patrick and schwartz 2010 these extreme precipitation events have shown direct impacts on local and regional flooding recent studies have identified patterns of increasing occurrences of flooding in the northeast compared to historic flooding records archfield et al 2009 armstrong et al 2014 collins 2009 hodgkins et al 2017 as clausius clapeyron equation suggests a 7 increase in the moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere with per degree temperature increase there will be increased events of extreme precipitation to make wet areas even wetter allen and ingram 2002 held and soden 2006 now the common argument is that during dry periods supply of moisture will be limited to fulfil the increased evaporative demand of the warming atmosphere which can lead us to longer durations of sparse precipitation and low flow this may result in the emergence of drought as an ongoing threat to massachusetts residents as experienced in 2016 2017 massachusetts vulnerability to damage from floods and droughts may be heightened due to aging infrastructure and the greater boston area s large population asce 2018 furthermore massachusetts communities depend on reliable water resources for many services including ecological integrity recreation hydropower production and agricultural sustainability these services may be compromised due to shifts in flood and drought patterns to best mitigate the impacts of hydrologic shifts on massachusetts residents policymakers local officials and experts need to develop preparation plans that will help communities adapt to changes in climate effective and informed climate adaptation planning requires collaboration among stakeholders to gain a shared understanding of the potential impacts and uncertainties associated with the changing climate fowler et al 2007 climate assessments conducted at global and national scales such as the ipcc and the national climate assessment nca respectively provide information on regional climate change but not necessarily at the spatial scales relevant for impacts assessment kirchhoff et al 2019 mendoza et al 2016 najafi and moradkhani 2015 more specifically global and continental scale changes cannot be directly projected onto regional or local scale because changes of opposite signal may exist in the same region for instance information regarding frequency and volumes of peak flows and floods are imperative for the design of infrastructure flood control reservoir operation etc and there is a high possibility that they exhibit a large variability in space within a particular region in addition it is inadequate to assume that design flood values will remain stationary over time under a changing climate precipitation temperature land use etc thus there is a need among stakeholders for information regarding changes in magnitudes of extreme events and their spatial variability in order to identify zones of high and low risks as such a detailed high resolution study to characterize current and future attributes of climate extremes is generally useful for planners and policy makers to ensure effective local planning for climate change in massachusetts governor baker signed executive order 569 in september of 2016 directing the executive office of energy and environmental affairs and the entire state government to begin planning and preparing for the ongoing impacts of climate change in addition the municipal vulnerability preparedness mvp program was established to provide support for cities and towns in massachusetts to plan for climate resiliency and initiate needed action oriented plans and projects in support of these efforts this study produces near term and long term projections of river streamflow across the state to explore the impacts of climate change on hydrologic extremes floods and droughts though important for adaptation planning procedures for estimating the magnitude and frequency of floods and droughts under a climate altered future are complex wobus et al 2017 and a variety of different approaches have emerged in the literature some researchers apply a statistical approach based on historical precipitation and or runoff signatures to estimate future flows condon et al 2015 delgado et al 2014 jain and lall 2001 tramblay et al 2014 other researchers apply a physically based approach creating hydrology models that incorporate meteorological data into a rainfall runoff model to generate streamflow time series berghuijs et al 2016 demaria et al 2016 hayhoe et al 2007 both of these techniques have strengths and weaknesses although statistical approaches have been widely used with attempts to characterize historical trends of floods and low flow events studies projecting future extremes especially in massachusetts and surrounding new england areas in the northeastern u s are limited sivasankkar et al 2016 vogel et al 2011 in addition findings in many of these studies focusing on peak flows or floods are at times contradictory boyer et al 2010 on the contrary peer reviewed publications document many successful studies that have chosen to utilize the physically based modeling approach to identify and describe the physical processes that influence model outputs on a global scale arnell and lloyd hughes 2014 hirabayashi et al 2013 kundzewicz et al 2014 physically based hydrological models although desirable are seldom used in regional climate studies due to extensive computational needs and data processing requirements bauwens et al 2011 demaria et al 2016 even though massachusetts has seen some of the biggest floods and droughts in recent decades there are few studies available for this region that provide future projections of riverine floods and droughts based on a high resolution physically based hydrological models and multiple climate change projections several parts of massachusetts have experienced major floods in the year of 2006 2009 and 2011 while some of the major droughts have occurred here in the year of 1985 2002 and 2016 consoer and milman 2018 many of these extreme events are not fully understood due to lack of statewide detailed analysis and comprehensive data miao 2019 as such employing high resolution climate projections and hydrological model is crucial to effectively characterize current and future hydrological extremes across massachusetts for this study a distributed physically based model is chosen as the most appropriate model technique to project changes in hydrological processes of rivers across massachusetts by implementing a high resolution distributed model we ensure a more detailed representation of topographical features and climate forcing as opposed to many other coarse resolution macro scale modeling studies campbell et al 2011 demaria et al 2016 naz et al 2018 that were performed at massachusetts or adjacent areas in the past in our study we have examined in total 86 small to medium sized river basins and by modeling such a large number of river basins within a small area like massachusetts we make an effort to obtain a detailed portrayal of spatial and temporal trends for hydrological extremes floods and droughts this modeling approach generates streamflow estimates under varying climate scenarios driven by global circulation models gcms the generated ensemble of streamflow projections provides a quantitative measure of uncertainty that can be used to inform stakeholders about the forecasts although hydrological modeling of watersheds can be affected by various sources of uncertainties e g gcms downscaling and or bias correction techniques emission scenarios hydrological modeling we emphasize on gcm driven uncertainties in this study since it remains the most critical and primary source of uncertainty in climate change assessments of hydrological extremes clark et al 2016 gao et al 2019 the primary goal of this study is to assess the changes in future flood and drought conditions across watersheds of the commonwealth of massachusetts seasonal characteristics of floods and droughts are identified for two projected climate scenarios and compared to baseline recent historic flows to develop the two climate scenarios fourteen gcm projections are applied from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 under two emission scenarios the emission scenarios are known as representative concentration pathways rcps and we employ one extreme rcp8 5 and one moderate rcp4 5 scenario for this study the selected gcms have been demonstrated to accurately capture regional climate features in the northeast u s karmalkar et al 2019 the gcm projections are regionally downscaled and then incorporated into a physically based distributed hydrological model to generate ensembles of future streamflow projections for 1981 2099 the simulated streamflow data are used to estimate 100 year floods and 7 day 10 year low flows the estimates of floods and drought are made for two different periods in the future in this report the near term is defined as the period between 2021 and 2060 and the far term is defined as the period between 2060 and 2099 this paper is structured as follows section 2 describes our study area methodology and datasets section 3 describes the results discussions are presented in section 4 section 5 summarizes our conclusions 2 methods and datasets 2 1 study area massachusetts is one of the more densely populated states in the u s northeast ranking 14th in total population with an area of approximately 10 565 km2 ranking 44th in geographic area the state is surrounded by new hampshire and vermont to the north new york to the west connecticut and rhode island to the south and the atlantic ocean to the east massachusetts has distinct land and topographical features parts of massachusetts are highly urbanized and the home of some important metropolitan centers including the greater boston area the eastern section of massachusetts consists of the low coastal plains of the atlantic ocean central part is mostly forested and the western section is mountainous also includes the berkshire mountains zen 1981 the climate in massachusetts shows diverse patterns in space and time the characteristics of precipitation and temperature show contrasts for different seasonal cycles for instance summers are normally hot and humid with temperature ranging from 21 c 30 c peak temperature generally reaches in july noaa 2013a evapotranspiration is also highest in summer with a seasonal average of 300 500 mm in winter weather is severely cold with precipitation falling as snow and average temperature during the season ranges between 7 c 10 c january is usually the snowiest month of the season having on average 380 500 mm of snow statewide noaa 2013b except the wet season rainfall in massachusetts for rest of the year is generally evenly distributed with an annual average of 1016 1270 mm the climate of western and central part of massachusetts is of humid continental type and show notable differences when compared to the climate of the coastal eastern part fig 1 massachusetts is prone to extreme weather dominated by northeasters thunderstorms hurricanes and tropical storms many rivers and streams flow across massachusetts toward the atlantic ocean including the connecticut the merrimack and the housatonic rivers socolow et al 2000 for this analysis 86 nested subwatersheds have been selected within 27 major watersheds across massachusetts ranging between 2 and 1785 km2 in area the boundary delineations for these 27 watersheds are classified under united states geological survey usgs classification of hydrologic unit code 8 huc 8 fig 1 for a few of these watersheds parts of upstream areas extend beyond the massachusetts boundary it should be noted that the main stems of the connecticut and the merrimack are not included in the analysis due to their high degree of upstream regulations 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 gcm and downscaled output the set of 14 climate models listed in table 1 used in this hydrological modeling effort are selected from the cmip5 taylor et al 2012 ensemble of 36 models under two scenarios rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 meinshausen et al 2011 four rcp scenarios have been used by researchers and climate modelers as part of the cmip5 experiment to provide a range of possible future trajectories for the evolution of atmospheric greenhouse gas ghg concentrations the four pathway scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 and rcp8 5 are labelled after the possible radiative forcing values 2 6 4 5 6 and 8 5 wm 2 in the year 2100 out of four pathways we employ one moderate rcp4 5 and one extreme scenario rcp8 5 for our study to understand the impacts of different ghg concentration the cmip5 ensemble of 36 climate models gcms and 4 different scenarios captures any of the uncertainties in projections though the ensemble is not systematically designed for the purpose while it is important to use all available data in production of climate change projections a careful evaluation of these models is necessary to establish their credibility in providing reliable climate information for the region of interest the ensemble may also contain redundant information on projections by combining information on model performance and similarities in their projections it is possible to reduce the size of the ensemble without losing critical climate change information karmalkar et al 2019 in this study we only use a subset of cmip5 models 14 that were carefully selected for studies of climate impacts in the northeastern u s the framework used for their selection is described in detail in karmalkar et al 2019 and is based on original coarse resolution gcm data the model selection involves a thorough assessment of the model performance of 36 cmip5 models to evaluate their ability to capture key climate features of the northeast u s including temperature and precipitation climatology the annual cycle variability and large scale circulation the subset of selected models adequately captures the uncertainty in temperature and precipitation projections seen across 36 cmip5 models and represent diversity in the spatial patterns of precipitation projections regional projections for the commonwealth of massachusetts are produced using the downscaled counterparts of the selected models the localized constructed analogs loca downscaled dataset pierce et al 2014 this statistical downscaling method pierce et al 2014 relies on selecting appropriate analog days from observations to downscale coarse resolution gcm data to finer spatial scales the loca downscaling method improves upon the previous statistical downscaling e g bcsd methods in particular the loca method produces a realistic depiction of precipitation extremes pierce et al 2014 that is lacking in other downscaling methods the loca dataset is available at 6 km resolution 2 2 2 observed meteorological and streamflow data we use multi sensor precipitation estimates mpes as the observed precipitation data for hydrological model calibration and validation runs mpes are produced hourly through the optimal combination of multiple radars and hourly rain gage data at 4 4 km2 grid resolution seo et al 2015 sharma et al 2017 zhang et al 2011 the mpe product used was obtained from the noaa s northeast river forecasting center nerfc and is similar to the ncep stage iv mpes nelson et al 2016 zhang et al 2011 gridded mpe products are now widely used in different hydrometeorological applications seo et al 2014 siddique et al 2015 siddique and mejia 2017 yang et al 2017 hl rdhm requires gridded temperature observations to obtain monthly potential evaporation and as input to the snow 17 model to determine snow accumulation and melt the gridded temperature data were obtained from the nerfc which generated the data by combining multiple observation networks metar usgs stations and nws cooperative observer program siddique et al 2015 all the gridded data used in this study were resampled using bilinear interpolation onto the regularly spaced grid 4 4 km2 cell size required by hl rdhm for the verification of the streamflow simulation and forecasts daily discharge data from the relevant usgs gages were used in total thirteen years 2004 2016 of streamflow observations were used we select this verification period in order to match the availability of meteorological observations mpes 2 3 hydrological modeling 2 3 1 model description the hydrological model selected for this work is noaa s hydrology laboratory research distributed hydrologic model hl rdhm koren et al 2004 within hl rdhm the heat transfer version of the sacramento soil moisture accounting model sac ht is employed for rainfall runoff generation as well as the snow 17 model to account for snow accumulation and melting the sac ht is a physics based model of the system conceptual type where the basin system is divided into regularly spaced square grid cells to account for spatial heterogeneity and variability each grid cell in turn is comprised of storage components that store and transmit water the cells are ultimately connected to each other through the stream network system i e each cell acts as a hillslope capable of generating surface and subsurface runoff that discharges directly into the streams specifically hl rdhm assumes at each grid cell a two layer subsurface soil moisture storage called the upper and lower zone as well as a surface interception and groundwater storage in each of these layers soil moisture can be stored in two ways tension or free water and surface runoff occurs with upper zone saturation excess on the contrary the snow 17 uses near surface temperature to differentiate between snow accumulation or rain at each grid cell and generates snow melt runoff the runoff generated at each cell is routed through channel and stream networks using hillslope and kinematic wave routing overall a fully distributed hl rdhm has been implemented at 2 2 km2 spatial resolution this particular hydrologic model has been widely applied sharma et al 2018 siddique and mejia 2017 wood et al 2016 the model is fully described in anderson et al 2006 burnash 1995 2 3 2 model calibration and validation the hydrological model has been calibrated separately at each of the 27 watersheds model calibration was a challenge since most of the watersheds in massachusetts and surrounding states are highly regulated upstream in total there are more than 1400 dams in the commonwealth among which 53 are large with a storage 30 000 acre ft2 and as a consequence both high and low flows are impacted levin 2016 weiskel et al 2010 due to such regulations it was difficult to identify multiple or in some cases one unregulated usgs stream gage at each of the 27 watersheds to calibrate the model a very careful selection was made of unregulated sites within those huc 8 watersheds based on the existing reports and published documents archfield et al 2009 armstrong et al 2008 expert opinion was also solicited from usgs personnel familiar with the basins more specifically at each of the huc 8 watersheds we identify one site that has no upstream flow regulation thus a total of 27 unregulated gauge locations are selected in 27 huc 8 watersheds for model parameter calibration through this process we calibrate one set of model parameters for each huc 8 watershed and calibrated parameters were then applied for the rest of the uncalibrated sites within the same huc 8 domain this regionalization strategy is adopted based on the assumption that runoff processes and other hydrological properties will show similar attributes within the same huc 8 domain oubeidillah et al 2014 yang et al 2019 for calibration the model is first ran using a priori parameter estimates previously derived from available datasets anderson et al 2006 koren et al 2004 reed et al 2004 to calibrate the a priori parameters we select 10 out of the 17 sac ht parameters based upon prior experience and preliminary parameter sensitivity tests sac ht parameters are shown in table 2 the a priori parameter fields are adjusted manually first once the manual changes do not yield noticeable improvements in the model performance the parameter values are tuned up using an automatic technique namely stepwise line search sls kuzmin et al 2008 sls is used since this method is readily available within hl rdhm and has been shown to provide reliable parameter estimates kuzmin et al 2008 with sls the following objective function j is optimized 1 j i 1 m y i s i x 2 where yi and si denote the daily observed and simulated flows respectively x is the parameter vector being estimated and m is the total number of days used for calibration sls is implemented over a period of 7 years 2004 2010 to calibrate the basins kuzmin et al 2008 describes the sls technique in details to assess model performance we use the following metrics the correlation coefficient r percent bias pb and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse model performance is measured over a period of 6 years 2011 2016 using two different flow conditions low to moderate flows and high flows the earlier represent flows smaller than 25th percentile in the overall flow distribution while the latter represent flows greater than 90th percentile through the validation process it is found that the nse for most cases ranges between 0 60 0 85 besides pb for most cases ranges between 5 10 percent in the sense of absolute value the range of correlation coefficient varies between 0 75 0 95 which can be considered a high standard for a physically based hydrological model newman et al 2017 siddique and mejia 2017 2 4 flood frequency and low flow analysis for this study we generate approximately 120 years of daily streamflow time series using forcing i e precipitation and temperature from 14 different climate models for two emission scenarios rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 thus we have an ensemble of 14 different future streamflow conditions for the years of 1981 2099 for each of the emission scenario to account for uncertainties for our analysis we divide the study period into three different time regimes current 1981 2016 near term 2021 2060 and far term 2060 2099 we estimate 100 year floods using annual peaks for these three respective time periods for comparison thus fourteen different estimates of 100 year floods are estimated for different gcms under each emission scenario we use the median of twenty eight different scenarios two rcps and fourteen gcms across current period as the base or reference projection the projected changes in 100 year flood are then measured relative to the base or reference projection across near and far term in the future using the median values instead of using all 14 estimates generated by different gcm projections for each emission scenario by using changes in 100 year flood here we refer to the changes in 100 year flood magnitudes not frequency we follow the same strategy to calculate the changes for low flow analysis among different low flow metrics we present in this study low flow events associated with the 7 day 10 year q7 10 low flow which can be defined as minimum 7 day average of flows that can recur on average once in every 10 years riggs 1980 q7 10 is one of the most widely used low flow metrics in water resources applications i e water quality monitoring hydropower irrigation water supply etc eslamian et al 2010 tasker 1987 3 results the future climate impacted changes in precipitation and temperature show strong seasonal patterns since the responses of the hydrological model are impacted directly by precipitation and temperature our analysis of hydrological extremes is discretized in different seasons in this study we will present seasonal characteristics of future 100 year floods and 7 day 10 year low flows in watersheds of different spatial scales across massachusetts through the rest of our analysis we will consider december february djf months as winter march may mam as spring june august jja as summer and september november son as fall season 3 1 changes in precipitation and temperature figs 2 and 3 show observed and simulated seasonal total precipitation and percent changes in seasonal precipitation for the far term 2060 2099 relative to the base period 1981 2016 for four different seasons and two emissions scenarios rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 the simulated precipitation for two rcps is shown for the winter djf spring mam summer jja and fall son in fig 2a d respectively as 10th to 90th percentile values for every year across 14 models the changes are reported for the far term 2060 2099 as the ensemble median changes in fig 3a h across 14 climate models for two emission scenarios we do not show changes for the near term 2021 2060 as their spatial patterns are similar to the far term changes but with smaller magnitudes for rcp8 5 maximum increases are observed in winter djf among all seasons for both the near and far term with over 20 percent increase in many places of massachusetts fig 3b similarly winter precipitation is also projected to be higher under rcp4 5 but with a smaller magnitude than rcp8 5 figs 2a and 3a during the spring mam rcp8 5 precipitation projections show higher increases compared to rcp4 5 projection scenario fig 3c and d overall these increases reflect the agreement between models about the direction of future precipitation change in winter and spring despite large differences in the magnitude of that increase see fig 2a b on the other hand precipitation projections for summer and fall fig 3e h indicate modest changes that are very similar for two rcps as evident from fig 2 there is no clear trend in precipitation in summer and fall with models indicating both increases and decreases in the future this large inter model spread results in modest and similar ensemble median projections seen fig 3e h the decreases suggested by some models however are noteworthy since they suggest the possibility of droughts mainly due to increases in evaporative demand under future warming in fig 4 a we have shown percent changes in average annual total number of precipitation days below 0 c for the months of winter across all models and scenarios for selected watersheds in massachusetts the solid lines represent the ensemble mean and the shaded region indicates the range of uncertainty consists of 28 various scenarios 2 rcps and 14 gcms from modeling perspective we can consider precipitation days with or below 0 c as snowy while precipitation days having a temperature above 0 c as rainy days the ensemble mean in fig 4a suggests a decrease in snowy days in the future which is shown to be in the range of 2 2 5 for the near term and 3 4 5 for the far term this is also an indication of potential future increases of days with liquid rain in fig 4b we show percent changes in average annual maximum number of consecutive dry days for different months throughout the year where precipitation days with 0 1 mm or less are counted as dry days we obtain fig 4b in a similar way where the shaded region represents outcomes from an ensemble of 14 models and two emission scenarios and the solid line represents the mean of the ensemble overall fig 4b indicates there will be increases in consecutive dry days during the months of summer and fall decreases are large for the far term when compared to the near term and maximum decreases are observed during the months of late summer and early fall figs 5 and 6 present changes in temperature for the far term period in c for most cases the results for rcp8 5 show similar spatial patterns of temperature changes across seasons for both time periods while the increases in temperature vary between 1 c 3 c for near term not shown the increases for far term ranges between 3 c 6 c fig 6a h depending on the location maximum increases in temperature are shown during the summer and fall specifically the increases of temperature are shown to be slightly larger across western part of the massachusetts compared to the eastern part similar trends are also observed for rcp4 5 although the increases are not as pronounced as they are for rcp8 5 fig 6 top row to better understand the overall trend we have provided table 3 where average projected changes in massachusetts precipitation and temperature are summarized for future time periods relative to the base period 3 2 100 year floods in winter djf for rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 we estimate 100 year floods for the months of winter djf across watersheds in massachusetts for three time periods the base or current 1981 2016 near term 2021 2060 and far term 2060 2099 in future fig 7 a b show percent changes in 100 year floods for near and far term respectively in comparison to base or current time period for rcp8 5 emission scenario here medians of 14 streamflow projections are used to calculate the differences in 100 year floods for near term more than half of total 86 locations report little or no increase in 100 year floods compared to the base period fig 7a the results for far term however indicate that majority of the watersheds will experience increases in 100 year floods compared to the base period except those in eastern massachusetts more than 30 locations out of 86 report 15 percent or higher increases in flood magnitudes at far term fig 7b this suggests that the increases in flow are not uniform in the state this non uniformity which may arise from the gcm projections or local physical factors or combination of both remains undetermined at this stage of our study the western and central massachusetts have shown to experience greater increases in winter precipitation than the eastern section by approximately 10 20 percent especially at the far term in fig 4a we have shown that total number of precipitation days below 0 c is expected to decrease during the winter months in the future which also indicates that there will be increases in liquid precipitation and rain events in winter increased rain on snow events thus may influence the magnitude of winter floods by a significant margin parr et al 2015 also because temperature increases during winter vary from one region to another snowpack will also be impacted in a non uniform fashion more specifically the eastern part of massachusetts may observe a smaller increase in temperature during the winter than the western section which is shown in fig 6b such temperature increases together with increased rain on snow events and snowmelt runoff may influence the winter peak flows to rise more in the future compared to the present fig 7a and b these seasonal anomalies in future of precipitation and temperature projections are likely to impact the spatial pattern of winter flooding more in the far term compared to the near term this is also shown in table 4 where we have summarized average changes in 100 year floods and 7 day 10 year low flows across massachusetts for different seasons while average increases in 100 year floods for rcp8 5 during winter remains at 1 63 percent for near term it rises up to approximately 12 27 percent for the far term table 4 we observe an almost similar effect with rcp4 5 scenario while most of the locations in massachusetts show an increase in 100 year floods for winter and both near and far term fig 7c and d table 4 this is a reflection of increased winter storms rain on snow events and snowmelt under rcp4 5 emission scenario fig 4a in addition the flood projections for rcp4 5 do not show large variations in space and time as opposed to what we have shown for rcp8 5 projections contrasting result between rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 are representative of scenario uncertainties which arises from variations in climate projections under multiple ghg concentration pathways the results in fig 7a d also show that scenario uncertainties for winter peak flows are much greater at far term as compared to the near term which is confirmed in other studies karmalkar and bradley 2017 as well our results for both rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 show that many watersheds in the eastern massachusetts will experience decreases in 100 year floods in the future this result can be subject to large uncertainty since our study only focuses on riverine floods and does not consider for storm surge or sea level rise which can be proved to be a significant factor while estimating flood in the coastal dominated eastern massachusetts similar features are reported in fig 8 where we show that diverse gcm projections have impacted flooding pattern during winter at near and far term period here fig 8 percent increases or decreases in 100 year floods are shown separately for each gcm across all watersheds for rcp8 5 and near term the median changes for all models range between 5 20 percent from which most of the models indicate moderate increases in flood magnitudes fig 8 we observe higher increases in 100 year floods for the years at far term with medians indicating changes between 20 60 percent in contrast uncertainties for rcp4 5 scenario show slightly different patterns for near term median estimates of approximately half of the gcms used 7 out of 14 show moderate changes between 5 10 percent in 100 year flood estimates as opposed to the rest of the models for which projected changes appear to be much larger fig 8 at far term we observe similar aspects in model performances although changes reported are more prominent between 8 75 percent compared to the near term this is an indication of large model disagreements among future rcp4 5 projections which seems to appear especially during winter months 3 3 100 year floods in spring mam in fig 9 the medians of fourteen future streamflow projections are used to show the trends of 100 year flood in spring mam across near term 2021 2060 and rcp 8 5 100 year flood estimates in a large number of watersheds approximately 50 of total indicate little or no change when compared to the baseline period 1981 2016 and these locations are spread all over massachusetts showing no visible spatial pattern fig 9a there are watersheds that also show a significant decrease between 5 to 15 percent in magnitude of 100 year floods and they are mostly located either towards eastern part near greater boston area or towards middle to northwest corner of massachusetts results have shown that these areas in the future may experience higher increases in temperature during spring in comparison to other areas of massachusetts which may cause earlier melt of snowpack in fig 10 we have shown changes in timing and frequency of spring peak flows for near and far term in the future and compared them with the base period for all the selected watersheds of massachusetts for the base period maximum spring peak flows are shown to be occurring during the month of april however peak flows in the future have shown a shift in timing indicating that they will occur more frequently during the months of february and march across both near and far term fig 10 change in timing of snowmelt will potentially reduce snowmelt water and thus impact the spring runoff by cutting down the peak flows in the middle section of massachusetts we observe an increase in spring floods where most of the watersheds are basically forested wang and stephenson 2018 across far term a majority of the watersheds in the southern and south eastern section of massachusetts show decreases in 100 year median flood estimates by more than 15 percent compared to the base period 1981 2016 fig 9b this is not too surprising because we have already shown in fig 10 that decreases in spring peak flows are greater at far term than near term due to earlier snowmelt and timing shifts similar to rcp8 5 scenario rcp4 5 also indicates that a large number of watersheds in the future may experience decreases in 100 year flood magnitudes fig 9c and d many of these watersheds that exhibit a decrease by more than 15 percent relative to the base period are located in the south eastern part of massachusetts where temperature is projected to rise more than other parts in future for both emission scenarios upstream watersheds that are located in northern part of massachusetts show comparatively smaller or no changes than downstream sections indicating a lesser impact of temperature rise in winter or spring overall spring peak flows are expected to experience more extreme impacts during the far term than near term and both scenarios in this period indicate a decrease in flood magnitudes for most watersheds table 4 this finding is alarming because reduction in spring peak flows can have impacts on plants growth and other natural environmental processes during this period 3 4 100 year high flows in summer jja in recent studies summer peak flows are observed to be increasing over last few decades frei et al 2015 although increasing with time summer peak flows in massachusetts watersheds are generally much smaller than winter or spring peak flows for this reason summer high flow events are defined as 100 year high flows instead of 100 year floods indicating most of the flood events in massachusetts occur generally in winter or spring months in fig 11 a and b we show percent changes in 100 year summer high flows at near and far term in future for rcp8 5 we use median values of fourteen 100 year flood estimates generated from 14 climate models to measure these changes overall summer high flows show an increasing trend although increases in far term are more pronounced than near term table 4 in far term summer high flows appeared to be increasing almost everywhere in the state except few areas in the south east corner many of these increases are over 30 percent in comparison to the base period indicating possibilities of increased summer floods in future fig 11b increases in summer high flows are reflections of increased summer precipitation and extreme events at far term especially across western middle and eastern part of massachusetts for near term projection increases in high flows are restricted in western and the middle part of massachusetts while many locations in the eastern part also report decreases fig 11a for rcp4 5 we observe very little differences between near and far term projections for summer high flows fig 11c and d in general summer precipitation is projected to increase more in high elevation areas around western and middle massachusetts than the much flatter eastern massachusetts this pattern is also observed for summer high flows where increases in western parts are higher than eastern parts here little contrasts between near and far term indicates that models for rcp4 5 projections and summer high flows show limited abilities to differentiate between projections of future time periods the results also show that scenario uncertainty plays a bigger role at far term than near term as summer high flows shows greater changes for rcp8 5 scenario as compared to rcp4 5 scenario 3 5 7 day 10 year low flow in fall son in fig 12a and b we show percent changes in 7 day 10 year q7 10 low flow in the months of fall son for rcp8 5 using the median values at near and far term respectively while most of the watersheds in massachusetts show a decreasing trend few points in the middle to southern part report little increase or no changes in q7 10 for near term fig 12a similar impacts are observed for far term as well however decreases in low flow become more pronounced in this period fig 12b gcm projections suggest that percent increase in temperature during fall son is amongst the highest while percent increase in precipitation is amongst the lowest especially during the years of 2060 2099 table 3 increased temperature is expected to result in increased et and soil will lose more water than normal as a consequence baseflows will be impacted in areas where drying of soil layers will lead to lowering of flows in rivers and streams particularly during fall season rcp4 5 shows a very similar effect to rcp8 5 for low flow conditions fig 12c and d these two emission scenarios even show similar effects in terms of model spread and uncertainty which is also clearly shown in fig 13 although model spread slightly decreases for rcp4 5 across far term it is also noted that low flows are decreasing more at far term fig 12d than near term fig 12c indicating more watersheds have been projected to get dry during the later half of the century this is again confirmed in table 4 where we have shown that average decreases in massachusetts watersheds for 7 day 10 year low flows ranges between 5 12 10 85 percent for near term and 22 13 27 32 percent during far term across both emission scenarios during fall total precipitation is projected to decrease fig 3g and h and consecutive dry days are projected to increase fig 4b to reduce the soil moisture almost everywhere in massachusetts during both near term and far term this is reflected in the future low flow projections which indicates that watersheds in those areas will have less water during low flow periods fig 13 shows that gcm model spread for low flow conditions across all watersheds are very similar between rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 and also near and far term for both scenarios 11 out of 14 models indicate decreases in low flows in the median sense for near term and similar model consensus are observed for far term suggesting a drier future during low flow period 3 6 7 day 10 year low flow in summer jja as was the case with high flows q7 10 low flows in summer also shows an overall increasing trend in both near and far term for rcp8 5 fig 14 a and b this can be a reflection of increased summer precipitation in a number of areas which has been indicated by gcm projections fig 3e and f although antecedent soil moisture plays a more important role to influence low flow conditions it is difficult to make any comments on that from our study since we have not looked into seasonal soil moisture content as such further investigation is required to better understand future trends of summer low flows and relevant physical processes rcp4 5 results for summer low flows show very similar results and there is very little to differentiate between near and far term as well fig 14c and d 4 discussion non stationarity in regional climate will influence to change patterns of hydrological extremes across the globe kundzewicz et al 2014 milly et al 2008 wobus et al 2017 as such design standards for hydraulic and other infrastructures particularly those built in river floodplains need to be revised with changing flood magnitudes similar strategies should be adopted for low flow conditions for sustainable management of water supply drought monitoring and reservoir operation unfortunately there is often incomplete or no data available for specific locations and rules of thumb based on past experience are used to estimate the design flow to overcome such situations we have investigated in this study seasonal characteristics of 100 year flood and 7 day 10 year low flows across 86 watersheds in massachusetts to understand and predict future changes in magnitudes of floods and low flows overall parts of our results presented in section 3 are in agreement with preceding literatures that were conducted for the u s northeastern region huntington et al 2009 marshall and randhir 2008 parr et al 2015 parr and wang 2014 however the major limitation encountered with previous studies were that they lacked in necessary details in providing climate change signals of extreme events and their spatial and temporal variations within the study region additionally most of the prior studies were based on either historical data or outputs from a simpler hydrological modeling system with limited abilities to accurately capture extreme events in contrast we have used state of the art hydrological modeling for our study and the cmip5 gcms used are highly respected and frequently applied in recent times the new insights gained from this study suggest that central and western part of massachusetts will be at risk of greater winter flooding than other parts whereas spring flood will experience decreases in majority of watersheds south and north eastern part of the state will be in greater risk of drought especially during the months of fall son here it should be noted that both 100 year flood and 7 day 10 year low flow estimates only refer to magnitudes of the events not frequency arnell and lloyd hughes 2014 also results for eastern coastal part of massachusetts presented in section 3 should be considered more carefully because our study focus is only limited to riverine analysis and takes no account of storm surge or sea level rise effects the use of gcm ensembles provides an estimate of future uncertainties gao et al 2019 in this study scenario uncertainties are addressed using simulations for two emission scenarios rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 while model uncertainties are accounted for each emission scenario by employing 14 different gcms that are best suited for the region although partitioning uncertainties is not the main focus of this study certain implications can be made based on model consensus and disagreements for rcp8 5 model uncertainties related to 100 year floods in winter are found to be greater at far term than near term while model uncertainties for rcp4 5 is less pronounced due to lack of contrasts between near and far term models however are found to be more in consensus for seasonal floods in spring for which median estimates show a decreasing trend almost everywhere in the state despite variations in models and emission scenarios uncertainties for low conditions are of similar characteristics except for the fall season which shows greater model spread for near term projections than far term overall it is found that changes for floods and low flows are more pronounced for rcp8 5 and far term projections when compared to rcp4 5 and near term projections this implies that risks from floods and drought will be much greater during the later half of the century if ghg emissions continue to follow current trend as modeling river basins using climate forecasts is a challenging task there are several limitations that can be noted these limitations may arise from 1 shortcomings in gcm projections 2 the lack of hydrologic data that is unimpaired by infrastructure management and 3 the challenges of hydrologic modeling the cmip5 gcms described in section 2 2 are products of state of the art climate modeling however there is great complexity in these models as they attempt to predict climate projections for century long time periods maloney et al 2014 sheffield et al 2013 additionally the horizontal resolutions of most of the gcms are coarse and ranges between 100 300 km to perform hydrological modeling at regional scale we have applied loca downscaling method to transform coarse resolution climate model data into a much finer resolution 6 6 km however loca downscaled products have shown some limitations in their ability to discriminate between precipitation extremes for different return intervals i e 50 year vs 100 year events alder and hostetler 2019 lopez cantu et al 2020 later we apply a bilinear interpolation to resample the climate data into 4 4 km which is the requirement of the hydrological model for input forcing thus rescaling and resampling climate data between different resolutions bring additional uncertainties to our estimates uncertainties may also originate from the hydrological modeling technique clark et al 2016 hydrological models are simplified representations of many physical processes and currently there exists no perfect model that can accurately capture these physical processes to predict runoff or streamflow gupta et al 1998 since we have employed just one hydrological model uncertainties that stem from hydrological sources model structure parameters initial and boundary conditions remain unaccounted in this study on top of that we have already mentioned in section 2 3 2 that watersheds in massachusetts are highly regulated upstream weiskel et al 2010 flow regulations can greatly alter natural flow regimes of rivers and streams which makes hydrological model calibration a challenging task although we made a sincere effort to carefully select watersheds that are least regulated it was impossible to calibrate the model for all 86 watersheds land use is another important driver of climate change that assumed to be constant throughout our analysis for future studies therefore we recommend to explicitly account for land use and land cover changes for more accurate and improved hydrological simulations 5 conclusions in this study we used climate projections from 14 carefully selected gcms to force a physically based distributed hydrological model to generate estimates of 100 year flood and 7 day 10 year low flows for 86 different watersheds within the state of massachusetts the results are presented for two ghg pathways scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the estimates of 100 year flood and 7 day 10 year low flows are obtained for three different time regimes current for the years 1981 2016 near term for the years 2021 2060 and far term for the years 2060 2099 ultimately percent changes in 100 year flood and 7 day 10 year low flows are compared between the current or base period and the near and far term period under two emission scenarios these percent changes were measured for different seasons using the median values of 14 different estimates that are generated using different gcms as inputs for both emission scenarios our analysis for 100 year floods in winter shows an increasing trend across near and far term in the future the increases are more prominent across far term with many locations showing an increase over 30 percent in flood magnitudes compared to the base period the watersheds in the eastern massachusetts are the only exceptions showing least amount of increases in flood magnitudes because increases in extreme precipitation events and temperature in these areas are not as pronounced as they are in the rest of the state during the spring 100 year flood estimates show a decreasing trend for both the emission scenarios rcp8 5 and 4 5 and decreases are more pronounced during the far term when compared to the base period increases in temperature 1 c 3 c are expected to drive the snowmelt lot earlier than normal which may cause a shift in spring peak flows in the future for rcp8 5 estimates of 7 day 10 year low flows during fall have been projected to decrease in most places across the state these results are shown to be consistent for both near and far term due to increased mean temperature and evaporative demand similar results are observed for rcp4 5 although decreases in the far term are more pronounced than near term both high and low flows during summer are projected to increase under rcp8 5 in most locations these increase goes over 15 percent the results for rcp4 5 shows similar effects and no real changes are observed in the spatiotemporal patterns the projections of hydrological extremes presented in this study show very little differences between rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 except for the last few decades of the 21 st century this is because regional precipitation is highly variable at interannual to decadal scales variations that are substantially larger than differences arising from using different emissions pathways karmalkar and bradley 2017 results show that the projected changes for most cases are spatially uniform across the state even though the absolute values for change projections may vary substantially in addition most of the results presented in this study are based on the median values of fourteen different 100 year floods or 7 day 10 year low flows generated from 14 climate models to develop a simpler understanding of plausible future direction of extreme hydrological events in massachusetts therefore the effect of uncertainties in gcm projections and hydrological modeling may not be well represented spatially for this reason the spatial trends shown in this study needs further revision or investigation since we use multiple gcms to drive one hydrologic model the uncertainty in the projections of hydrological extremes mainly reflects the uncertainty in regional projections produced by different climate models the use of a different hydrologic model will undoubtedly produce different projections which should also be further investigated despite few uncertainties mentioned above the use of multiple climate scenarios leads to a wide range of hydrologic projections providing valuable information in regard to risk assessment for planners structural designers transportation agencies water supply managers fish and wildlife conservation agencies etc outcomes from this study can be particularly beneficial for improved management of vulnerable water infrastructures property risk assessment and drought monitoring and mitigation from the point of view of evaluating risks special attention should be given to the extreme cases with disproportionately large hydrological impacts even though all the projections presented in this study are considered equally likely credit authorship

8285,study region the commonwealth of massachusetts united states study focus the commonwealth of massachusetts is projected to experience significant impacts from future climate change and these impacts include but are not limited to increases in extreme precipitation flooding and droughts this study investigates the potential impacts of climate change and uncertainties on future floods and low flow conditions in the rivers and streams of massachusetts fourteen downscaled gcm projections under two greenhouse gas concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 are used as inputs into a distributed hydrological model to obtain future streamflow conditions new hydrological insights for the region seasonal change projections of 100 year flood and a measure of drought the seven day ten year low flow q7 10 are estimated through the near term years 2021 2060 and the far term years 2060 2099 relative to the base period years 1981 2016 the median estimates of 100 year flood during winter report a 15 or higher increases in many watersheds at the far term in contrast flood magnitudes in spring show decreases for most of the watersheds during both near and far term for seven day ten year low flow estimates largest decreases are projected during the fall and this trend is found to be consistent across future time periods two emission scenarios have shown similar trends for most cases although change projections are seen to be more prominent for rcp8 5 when compared to rcp4 5 keywords climate change gcms hydrological modeling 100 year floods low flows 1 introduction anthropogenic activity is a primary contributor to climate change leading to increases in global temperatures and an associated shift in the frequency and intensity of precipitation allen and ingram 2002 pachauri et al 2014 pendergrass et al 2017 in the future extreme precipitation events are expected to be more damaging than in the past marx et al 2018 wilcox et al 2018 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc suggests that global temperature could rise between 2 0 and 4 2 celsius by 2100 pachauri et al 2014 both temperature and precipitation are critical to the balance of the hydrologic cycle shifts in long term means and variability creates an imbalance in global and regional water cycles that will become more apparent in the future kay et al 2009 the impacts of climate change on regional hydrology will vary among regions in the future and will be impacted by local characteristics such as hydroclimatic geologic and topographic conditions caldwell et al 2012 hodgkins et al 2017 steele dunne et al 2008 during the later part of the 20th century and portions of the early portion of the 21st century the change in extreme precipitation such as the 100 year maximum daily precipitation event has been greater in the northeastern united states than in other portions of the country wuebbles et al 2017 over last sixty years massachusetts has exhibited increases by as much as 70 in the daily extreme precipitation event douglas and fairbank 2011 hayhoe et al 2007 patrick and schwartz 2010 these extreme precipitation events have shown direct impacts on local and regional flooding recent studies have identified patterns of increasing occurrences of flooding in the northeast compared to historic flooding records archfield et al 2009 armstrong et al 2014 collins 2009 hodgkins et al 2017 as clausius clapeyron equation suggests a 7 increase in the moisture holding capacity of the atmosphere with per degree temperature increase there will be increased events of extreme precipitation to make wet areas even wetter allen and ingram 2002 held and soden 2006 now the common argument is that during dry periods supply of moisture will be limited to fulfil the increased evaporative demand of the warming atmosphere which can lead us to longer durations of sparse precipitation and low flow this may result in the emergence of drought as an ongoing threat to massachusetts residents as experienced in 2016 2017 massachusetts vulnerability to damage from floods and droughts may be heightened due to aging infrastructure and the greater boston area s large population asce 2018 furthermore massachusetts communities depend on reliable water resources for many services including ecological integrity recreation hydropower production and agricultural sustainability these services may be compromised due to shifts in flood and drought patterns to best mitigate the impacts of hydrologic shifts on massachusetts residents policymakers local officials and experts need to develop preparation plans that will help communities adapt to changes in climate effective and informed climate adaptation planning requires collaboration among stakeholders to gain a shared understanding of the potential impacts and uncertainties associated with the changing climate fowler et al 2007 climate assessments conducted at global and national scales such as the ipcc and the national climate assessment nca respectively provide information on regional climate change but not necessarily at the spatial scales relevant for impacts assessment kirchhoff et al 2019 mendoza et al 2016 najafi and moradkhani 2015 more specifically global and continental scale changes cannot be directly projected onto regional or local scale because changes of opposite signal may exist in the same region for instance information regarding frequency and volumes of peak flows and floods are imperative for the design of infrastructure flood control reservoir operation etc and there is a high possibility that they exhibit a large variability in space within a particular region in addition it is inadequate to assume that design flood values will remain stationary over time under a changing climate precipitation temperature land use etc thus there is a need among stakeholders for information regarding changes in magnitudes of extreme events and their spatial variability in order to identify zones of high and low risks as such a detailed high resolution study to characterize current and future attributes of climate extremes is generally useful for planners and policy makers to ensure effective local planning for climate change in massachusetts governor baker signed executive order 569 in september of 2016 directing the executive office of energy and environmental affairs and the entire state government to begin planning and preparing for the ongoing impacts of climate change in addition the municipal vulnerability preparedness mvp program was established to provide support for cities and towns in massachusetts to plan for climate resiliency and initiate needed action oriented plans and projects in support of these efforts this study produces near term and long term projections of river streamflow across the state to explore the impacts of climate change on hydrologic extremes floods and droughts though important for adaptation planning procedures for estimating the magnitude and frequency of floods and droughts under a climate altered future are complex wobus et al 2017 and a variety of different approaches have emerged in the literature some researchers apply a statistical approach based on historical precipitation and or runoff signatures to estimate future flows condon et al 2015 delgado et al 2014 jain and lall 2001 tramblay et al 2014 other researchers apply a physically based approach creating hydrology models that incorporate meteorological data into a rainfall runoff model to generate streamflow time series berghuijs et al 2016 demaria et al 2016 hayhoe et al 2007 both of these techniques have strengths and weaknesses although statistical approaches have been widely used with attempts to characterize historical trends of floods and low flow events studies projecting future extremes especially in massachusetts and surrounding new england areas in the northeastern u s are limited sivasankkar et al 2016 vogel et al 2011 in addition findings in many of these studies focusing on peak flows or floods are at times contradictory boyer et al 2010 on the contrary peer reviewed publications document many successful studies that have chosen to utilize the physically based modeling approach to identify and describe the physical processes that influence model outputs on a global scale arnell and lloyd hughes 2014 hirabayashi et al 2013 kundzewicz et al 2014 physically based hydrological models although desirable are seldom used in regional climate studies due to extensive computational needs and data processing requirements bauwens et al 2011 demaria et al 2016 even though massachusetts has seen some of the biggest floods and droughts in recent decades there are few studies available for this region that provide future projections of riverine floods and droughts based on a high resolution physically based hydrological models and multiple climate change projections several parts of massachusetts have experienced major floods in the year of 2006 2009 and 2011 while some of the major droughts have occurred here in the year of 1985 2002 and 2016 consoer and milman 2018 many of these extreme events are not fully understood due to lack of statewide detailed analysis and comprehensive data miao 2019 as such employing high resolution climate projections and hydrological model is crucial to effectively characterize current and future hydrological extremes across massachusetts for this study a distributed physically based model is chosen as the most appropriate model technique to project changes in hydrological processes of rivers across massachusetts by implementing a high resolution distributed model we ensure a more detailed representation of topographical features and climate forcing as opposed to many other coarse resolution macro scale modeling studies campbell et al 2011 demaria et al 2016 naz et al 2018 that were performed at massachusetts or adjacent areas in the past in our study we have examined in total 86 small to medium sized river basins and by modeling such a large number of river basins within a small area like massachusetts we make an effort to obtain a detailed portrayal of spatial and temporal trends for hydrological extremes floods and droughts this modeling approach generates streamflow estimates under varying climate scenarios driven by global circulation models gcms the generated ensemble of streamflow projections provides a quantitative measure of uncertainty that can be used to inform stakeholders about the forecasts although hydrological modeling of watersheds can be affected by various sources of uncertainties e g gcms downscaling and or bias correction techniques emission scenarios hydrological modeling we emphasize on gcm driven uncertainties in this study since it remains the most critical and primary source of uncertainty in climate change assessments of hydrological extremes clark et al 2016 gao et al 2019 the primary goal of this study is to assess the changes in future flood and drought conditions across watersheds of the commonwealth of massachusetts seasonal characteristics of floods and droughts are identified for two projected climate scenarios and compared to baseline recent historic flows to develop the two climate scenarios fourteen gcm projections are applied from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 under two emission scenarios the emission scenarios are known as representative concentration pathways rcps and we employ one extreme rcp8 5 and one moderate rcp4 5 scenario for this study the selected gcms have been demonstrated to accurately capture regional climate features in the northeast u s karmalkar et al 2019 the gcm projections are regionally downscaled and then incorporated into a physically based distributed hydrological model to generate ensembles of future streamflow projections for 1981 2099 the simulated streamflow data are used to estimate 100 year floods and 7 day 10 year low flows the estimates of floods and drought are made for two different periods in the future in this report the near term is defined as the period between 2021 and 2060 and the far term is defined as the period between 2060 and 2099 this paper is structured as follows section 2 describes our study area methodology and datasets section 3 describes the results discussions are presented in section 4 section 5 summarizes our conclusions 2 methods and datasets 2 1 study area massachusetts is one of the more densely populated states in the u s northeast ranking 14th in total population with an area of approximately 10 565 km2 ranking 44th in geographic area the state is surrounded by new hampshire and vermont to the north new york to the west connecticut and rhode island to the south and the atlantic ocean to the east massachusetts has distinct land and topographical features parts of massachusetts are highly urbanized and the home of some important metropolitan centers including the greater boston area the eastern section of massachusetts consists of the low coastal plains of the atlantic ocean central part is mostly forested and the western section is mountainous also includes the berkshire mountains zen 1981 the climate in massachusetts shows diverse patterns in space and time the characteristics of precipitation and temperature show contrasts for different seasonal cycles for instance summers are normally hot and humid with temperature ranging from 21 c 30 c peak temperature generally reaches in july noaa 2013a evapotranspiration is also highest in summer with a seasonal average of 300 500 mm in winter weather is severely cold with precipitation falling as snow and average temperature during the season ranges between 7 c 10 c january is usually the snowiest month of the season having on average 380 500 mm of snow statewide noaa 2013b except the wet season rainfall in massachusetts for rest of the year is generally evenly distributed with an annual average of 1016 1270 mm the climate of western and central part of massachusetts is of humid continental type and show notable differences when compared to the climate of the coastal eastern part fig 1 massachusetts is prone to extreme weather dominated by northeasters thunderstorms hurricanes and tropical storms many rivers and streams flow across massachusetts toward the atlantic ocean including the connecticut the merrimack and the housatonic rivers socolow et al 2000 for this analysis 86 nested subwatersheds have been selected within 27 major watersheds across massachusetts ranging between 2 and 1785 km2 in area the boundary delineations for these 27 watersheds are classified under united states geological survey usgs classification of hydrologic unit code 8 huc 8 fig 1 for a few of these watersheds parts of upstream areas extend beyond the massachusetts boundary it should be noted that the main stems of the connecticut and the merrimack are not included in the analysis due to their high degree of upstream regulations 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 gcm and downscaled output the set of 14 climate models listed in table 1 used in this hydrological modeling effort are selected from the cmip5 taylor et al 2012 ensemble of 36 models under two scenarios rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 meinshausen et al 2011 four rcp scenarios have been used by researchers and climate modelers as part of the cmip5 experiment to provide a range of possible future trajectories for the evolution of atmospheric greenhouse gas ghg concentrations the four pathway scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 and rcp8 5 are labelled after the possible radiative forcing values 2 6 4 5 6 and 8 5 wm 2 in the year 2100 out of four pathways we employ one moderate rcp4 5 and one extreme scenario rcp8 5 for our study to understand the impacts of different ghg concentration the cmip5 ensemble of 36 climate models gcms and 4 different scenarios captures any of the uncertainties in projections though the ensemble is not systematically designed for the purpose while it is important to use all available data in production of climate change projections a careful evaluation of these models is necessary to establish their credibility in providing reliable climate information for the region of interest the ensemble may also contain redundant information on projections by combining information on model performance and similarities in their projections it is possible to reduce the size of the ensemble without losing critical climate change information karmalkar et al 2019 in this study we only use a subset of cmip5 models 14 that were carefully selected for studies of climate impacts in the northeastern u s the framework used for their selection is described in detail in karmalkar et al 2019 and is based on original coarse resolution gcm data the model selection involves a thorough assessment of the model performance of 36 cmip5 models to evaluate their ability to capture key climate features of the northeast u s including temperature and precipitation climatology the annual cycle variability and large scale circulation the subset of selected models adequately captures the uncertainty in temperature and precipitation projections seen across 36 cmip5 models and represent diversity in the spatial patterns of precipitation projections regional projections for the commonwealth of massachusetts are produced using the downscaled counterparts of the selected models the localized constructed analogs loca downscaled dataset pierce et al 2014 this statistical downscaling method pierce et al 2014 relies on selecting appropriate analog days from observations to downscale coarse resolution gcm data to finer spatial scales the loca downscaling method improves upon the previous statistical downscaling e g bcsd methods in particular the loca method produces a realistic depiction of precipitation extremes pierce et al 2014 that is lacking in other downscaling methods the loca dataset is available at 6 km resolution 2 2 2 observed meteorological and streamflow data we use multi sensor precipitation estimates mpes as the observed precipitation data for hydrological model calibration and validation runs mpes are produced hourly through the optimal combination of multiple radars and hourly rain gage data at 4 4 km2 grid

et al 2016 zhang et al 2011 gridded mpe products are now widely used in different hydrometeorological applications seo et al 2014 siddique et al 2015 siddique and mejia 2017 yang et al 2017 hl rdhm requires gridded temperature observations to obtain monthly potential evaporation and as input to the snow 17 model to determine snow accumulation and melt the gridded temperature data were obtained from the nerfc which generated the data by combining multiple observation networks metar usgs stations and nws cooperative observer program siddique et al 2015 all the gridded data used in this study were resampled using bilinear interpolation onto the regularly spaced grid 4 4 km2 cell size required by hl rdhm for the verification of the streamflow simulation and forecasts daily discharge data from the relevant usgs gages were used in total thirteen years 2004 2016 of streamflow observations were used we select this verification period in order to match the availability of meteorological observations mpes 2 3 hydrological modeling 2 3 1 model description the hydrological model selected for this work is noaa s hydrology laboratory research distributed hydrologic model hl rdhm koren et al 2004 within hl rdhm the heat transfer version of the sacramento soil moisture accounting model sac ht is employed for rainfall runoff generation as well as the snow 17 model to account for snow accumulation and melting the sac ht is a physics based model of the system conceptual type where the basin system is divided into regularly spaced square grid cells to account for spatial heterogeneity and variability each grid cell in turn is comprised of storage components that store and transmit water the cells are ultimately connected to each other through the stream network system i e each cell acts as a hillslope capable of generating surface and subsurface runoff that discharges directly into the streams specifically hl rdhm assumes at each grid cell a two layer subsurface soil moisture storage called the upper and lower zone as well as a surface interception and groundwater storage in each of these layers soil moisture can be stored in two ways tension or free water and surface runoff occurs with upper zone saturation excess on the contrary the snow 17 uses near surface temperature to differentiate between snow accumulation or rain at each grid cell and generates snow melt runoff the runoff generated at each cell is routed through channel and stream networks using hillslope and kinematic wave routing overall a fully distributed hl rdhm has been implemented at 2 2 km2 spatial resolution this particular hydrologic model has been widely applied sharma et al 2018 siddique and mejia 2017 wood et al 2016 the model is fully described in anderson et al 2006 burnash 1995 2 3 2 model calibration and validation the hydrological model has been calibrated separately at each of the 27 watersheds model calibration was a challenge since most of the watersheds in massachusetts and surrounding states are highly regulated upstream in total there are more than 1400 dams in the commonwealth among which 53 are large with a storage 30 000 acre ft2 and as a consequence both high and low flows are impacted levin 2016 weiskel et al 2010 due to such regulations it was difficult to identify multiple or in some cases one unregulated usgs stream gage at each of the 27 watersheds to calibrate the model a very careful selection was made of unregulated sites within those huc 8 watersheds based on the existing reports and published documents archfield et al 2009 armstrong et al 2008 expert opinion was also solicited from usgs personnel familiar with the basins more specifically at each of the huc 8 watersheds we identify one site that has no upstream flow regulation thus a total of 27 unregulated gauge locations are selected in 27 huc 8 watersheds for model parameter calibration through this process we calibrate one set of model parameters for each huc 8 watershed and calibrated parameters were then applied for the rest of the uncalibrated sites within the same huc 8 domain this regionalization strategy is adopted based on the assumption that runoff processes and other hydrological properties will show similar attributes within the same huc 8 domain oubeidillah et al 2014 yang et al 2019 for calibration the model is first ran using a priori parameter estimates previously derived from available datasets anderson et al 2006 koren et al 2004 reed et al 2004 to calibrate the a priori parameters we select 10 out of the 17 sac ht parameters based upon prior experience and preliminary parameter sensitivity tests sac ht parameters are shown in table 2 the a priori parameter fields are adjusted manually first once the manual changes do not yield noticeable improvements in the model performance the parameter values are tuned up using an automatic technique namely stepwise line search sls kuzmin et al 2008 sls is used since this method is readily available within hl rdhm and has been shown to provide reliable parameter estimates kuzmin et al 2008 with sls the following objective function j is optimized 1 j i 1 m y i s i x 2 where yi and si denote the daily observed and simulated flows respectively x is the parameter vector being estimated and m is the total number of days used for calibration sls is implemented over a period of 7 years 2004 2010 to calibrate the basins kuzmin et al 2008 describes the sls technique in details to assess model performance we use the following metrics the correlation coefficient r percent bias pb and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse model performance is measured over a period of 6 years 2011 2016 using two different flow conditions low to moderate flows and high flows the earlier represent flows smaller than 25th percentile in the overall flow distribution while the latter represent flows greater than 90th percentile through the validation process it is found that the nse for most cases ranges between 0 60 0 85 besides pb for most cases ranges between 5 10 percent in the sense of absolute value the range of correlation coefficient varies between 0 75 0 95 which can be considered a high standard for a physically based hydrological model newman et al 2017 siddique and mejia 2017 2 4 flood frequency and low flow analysis for this study we generate approximately 120 years of daily streamflow time series using forcing i e precipitation and temperature from 14 different climate models for two emission scenarios rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 thus we have an ensemble of 14 different future streamflow conditions for the years of 1981 2099 for each of the emission scenario to account for uncertainties for our analysis we divide the study period into three different time regimes current 1981 2016 near term 2021 2060 and far term 2060 2099 we estimate 100 year floods using annual peaks for these three respective time periods for comparison thus fourteen different estimates of 100 year floods are estimated for different gcms under each emission scenario we use the median of twenty eight different scenarios two rcps and fourteen gcms across current period as the base or reference projection the projected changes in 100 year flood are then measured relative to the base or reference projection across near and far term in the future using the median values instead of using all 14 estimates generated by different gcm projections for each emission scenario by using changes in 100 year flood here we refer to the changes in 100 year flood magnitudes not frequency we follow the same strategy to calculate the changes for low flow analysis among different low flow metrics we present in this study low flow events associated with the 7 day 10 year q7 10 low flow which can be defined as minimum 7 day average of flows that can recur on average once in every 10 years riggs 1980 q7 10 is one of the most widely used low flow metrics in water resources applications i e water quality monitoring hydropower irrigation water supply etc eslamian et al 2010 tasker 1987 3 results the future climate impacted changes in precipitation and temperature show strong seasonal patterns since the responses of the hydrological model are impacted directly by precipitation and temperature our analysis of hydrological extremes is discretized in different seasons in this study we will present seasonal characteristics of future 100 year floods and 7 day 10 year low flows in watersheds of different spatial scales across massachusetts through the rest of our analysis we will consider december february djf months as winter march may mam as spring june august jja as summer and september november son as fall season 3 1 changes in precipitation and temperature figs 2 and 3 show observed and simulated seasonal total precipitation and percent changes in seasonal precipitation for the far term 2060 2099 relative to the base period 1981 2016 for four different seasons and two emissions scenarios rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 the simulated precipitation for two rcps is shown for the winter djf spring mam summer jja and fall son in fig 2a d respectively as 10th to 90th percentile values for every year across 14 models the changes are reported for the far term 2060 2099 as the ensemble median changes in fig 3a h across 14 climate models for two emission scenarios we do not show changes for the near term 2021 2060 as their spatial patterns are similar to the far term changes but with smaller magnitudes for rcp8 5 maximum increases are observed in winter djf among all seasons for both the near and far term with over 20 percent increase in many places of massachusetts fig 3b similarly winter precipitation is also projected to be higher under rcp4 5 but with a smaller magnitude than rcp8 5 figs 2a and 3a during the spring mam rcp8 5 precipitation projections show higher increases compared to rcp4 5 projection scenario fig 3c and d overall these increases reflect the agreement between models about the direction of future precipitation change in winter and spring despite large differences in the magnitude of that increase see fig 2a b on the other hand precipitation projections for summer and fall fig 3e h indicate modest changes that are very similar for two rcps as evident from fig 2 there is no clear trend in precipitation in summer and fall with models indicating both increases and decreases in the future this large inter model spread results in modest and similar ensemble median projections seen fig 3e h the decreases suggested by some models however are noteworthy since they suggest the possibility of droughts mainly due to increases in evaporative demand under future warming in fig 4 a we have shown percent changes in average annual total number of precipitation days below 0 c for the months of winter across all models and scenarios for selected watersheds in massachusetts the solid lines represent the ensemble mean and the shaded region indicates the range of uncertainty consists of 28 various scenarios 2 rcps and 14 gcms from modeling perspective we can consider precipitation days with or below 0 c as snowy while precipitation days having a temperature above 0 c as rainy days the ensemble mean in fig 4a suggests a decrease in snowy days in the future which is shown to be in the range of 2 2 5 for the near term and 3 4 5 for the far term this is also an indication of potential future increases of days with liquid rain in fig 4b we show percent changes in average annual maximum number of consecutive dry days for different months throughout the year where precipitation days with 0 1 mm or less are counted as dry days we obtain fig 4b in a similar way where the shaded region represents outcomes from an ensemble of 14 models and two emission scenarios and the solid line represents the mean of the ensemble overall fig 4b indicates there will be increases in consecutive dry days during the months of summer and fall decreases are large for the far term when compared to the near term and maximum decreases are observed during the months of late summer and early fall figs 5 and 6 present changes in temperature for the far term period in c for most cases the results for rcp8 5 show similar spatial patterns of temperature changes across seasons for both time periods while the increases in temperature vary between 1 c 3 c for near term not shown the increases for far term ranges between 3 c 6 c fig 6a h depending on the location maximum increases in temperature are shown during the summer and fall specifically the increases of temperature are shown to be slightly larger across western part of the massachusetts compared to the eastern part similar trends are also observed for rcp4 5 although the increases are not as pronounced as they are for rcp8 5 fig 6 top row to better understand the overall trend we have provided table 3 where average projected changes in massachusetts precipitation and temperature are summarized for future time periods relative to the base period 3 2 100 year floods in winter djf for rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 we estimate 100 year floods for the months of winter djf across watersheds in massachusetts for three time periods the base or current 1981 2016 near term 2021 2060 and far term 2060 2099 in future fig 7 a b show percent changes in 100 year floods for near and far term respectively in comparison to base or current time period for rcp8 5 emission scenario here medians of 14 streamflow projections are used to calculate the differences in 100 year floods for near term more than half of total 86 locations report little or no increase in 100 year floods compared to the base period fig 7a the results for far term however indicate that majority of the watersheds will experience increases in 100 year floods compared to the base period except those in eastern massachusetts more than 30 locations out of 86 report 15 percent or higher increases in flood magnitudes at far term fig 7b this suggests that the increases in flow are not uniform in the state this non uniformity which may arise from the gcm projections or local physical factors or combination of both remains undetermined at this stage of our study the western and central massachusetts have shown to experience greater increases in winter precipitation than the eastern section by approximately 10 20 percent especially at the far term in fig 4a we have shown that total number of precipitation days below 0 c is expected to decrease during the winter months in the future which also indicates that there will be increases in liquid precipitation and rain events in winter increased rain on snow events thus may influence the magnitude of winter floods by a significant margin parr et al 2015 also because temperature increases during winter vary from one region to another snowpack will also be impacted in a non uniform fashion more specifically the eastern part of massachusetts may observe a smaller increase in temperature during the winter than the western section which is shown in fig 6b such temperature increases together with increased rain on snow events and snowmelt runoff may influence the winter peak flows to rise more in the future compared to the present fig 7a and b these seasonal anomalies in future of precipitation and temperature projections are likely to impact the spatial pattern of winter flooding more in the far term compared to the near term this is also shown in table 4 where we have summarized average changes in 100 year floods and 7 day 10 year low flows across massachusetts for different seasons while average increases in 100 year floods for rcp8 5 during winter remains at 1 63 percent for near term it rises up to approximately 12 27 percent for the far term table 4 we observe an almost similar effect with rcp4 5 scenario while most of the locations in massachusetts show an increase in 100 year floods for winter and both near and far term fig 7c and d table 4 this is a reflection of increased winter storms rain on snow events and snowmelt under rcp4 5 emission scenario fig 4a in addition the flood projections for rcp4 5 do not show large variations in space and time as opposed to what we have shown for rcp8 5 projections contrasting result between rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 are representative of scenario uncertainties which arises from variations in climate projections under multiple ghg concentration pathways the results in fig 7a d also show that scenario uncertainties for winter peak flows are much greater at far term as compared to the near term which is confirmed in other studies karmalkar and bradley 2017 as well our results for both rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 show that many watersheds in the eastern massachusetts will experience decreases in 100 year floods in the future this result can be subject to large uncertainty since our study only focuses on riverine floods and does not consider for storm surge or sea level rise which can be proved to be a significant factor while estimating flood in the coastal dominated eastern massachusetts similar features are reported in fig 8 where we show that diverse gcm projections have impacted flooding pattern during winter at near and far term period here fig 8 percent increases or decreases in 100 year floods are shown separately for each gcm across all watersheds for rcp8 5 and near term the median changes for all models range between 5 20 percent from which most of the models indicate moderate increases in flood magnitudes fig 8 we observe higher increases in 100 year floods for the years at far term with medians indicating changes between 20 60 percent in contrast uncertainties for rcp4 5 scenario show slightly different patterns for near term median estimates of approximately half of the gcms used 7 out of 14 show moderate changes between 5 10 percent in 100 year flood estimates as opposed to the rest of the models for which projected changes appear to be much larger fig 8 at far term we observe similar aspects in model performances although changes reported are more prominent between 8 75 percent compared to the near term this is an indication of large model disagreements among future rcp4 5 projections which seems to appear especially during winter months 3 3 100 year floods in spring mam in fig 9 the medians of fourteen future streamflow projections are used to show the trends of 100 year flood in spring mam across near term 2021 2060 and rcp 8 5 100 year flood estimates in a large number of watersheds approximately 50 of total indicate little or no change when compared to the baseline period 1981 2016 and these locations are spread all over massachusetts showing no visible spatial pattern fig 9a there are watersheds that also show a significant decrease between 5 to 15 percent in magnitude of 100 year floods and they are mostly located either towards eastern part near greater boston area or towards middle to northwest corner of massachusetts results have shown that these areas in the future may experience higher increases in temperature during spring in comparison to other areas of massachusetts which may cause earlier melt of snowpack in fig 10 we have shown changes in timing and frequency of spring peak flows for near and far term in the future and compared them with the base period for all the selected watersheds of massachusetts for the base period maximum spring peak flows are shown to be occurring during the month of april however peak flows in the future have shown a shift in timing indicating that they will occur more frequently during the months of february and march across both near and far term fig 10 change in timing of snowmelt will potentially reduce snowmelt water and thus impact the spring runoff by cutting down the peak flows in the middle section of massachusetts we observe an increase in spring floods where most of the watersheds are basically forested wang and stephenson 2018 across far term a majority of the watersheds in the southern and south eastern section of massachusetts show decreases in 100 year median flood estimates by more than 15 percent compared to the base period 1981 2016 fig 9b this is not too surprising because we have already shown in fig 10 that decreases in spring peak flows are greater at far term than near term due to earlier snowmelt and timing shifts similar to rcp8 5 scenario rcp4 5 also indicates that a large number of watersheds in the future may experience decreases in 100 year flood magnitudes fig 9c and d many of these watersheds that exhibit a decrease by more than 15 percent relative to the base period are located in the south eastern part of massachusetts where temperature is projected to rise more than other parts in future for both emission scenarios upstream watersheds that are located in northern part of massachusetts show comparatively smaller or no changes than downstream sections indicating a lesser impact of temperature rise in winter or spring overall spring peak flows are expected to experience more extreme impacts during the far term than near term and both scenarios in this period indicate a decrease in flood magnitudes for most watersheds table 4 this finding is alarming because reduction in spring peak flows can have impacts on plants growth and other natural environmental processes during this period 3 4 100 year high flows in summer jja in recent studies summer peak flows are observed to be increasing over last few decades frei et al 2015 although increasing with time summer peak flows in massachusetts watersheds are generally much smaller than winter or spring peak flows for this reason summer high flow events are defined as 100 year high flows instead of 100 year floods indicating most of the flood events in massachusetts occur generally in winter or spring months in fig 11 a and b we show percent changes in 100 year summer high flows at near and far term in future for rcp8 5 we use median values of fourteen 100 year flood estimates generated from 14 climate models to measure these changes overall summer high flows show an increasing trend although increases in far term are more pronounced than near term table 4 in far term summer high flows appeared to be increasing almost everywhere in the state except few areas in the south east corner many of these increases are over 30 percent in comparison to the base period indicating possibilities of increased summer floods in future fig 11b increases in summer high flows are reflections of increased summer precipitation and extreme events at far term especially across western middle and eastern part of massachusetts for near term projection increases in high flows are restricted in western and the middle part of massachusetts while many locations in the eastern part also report decreases fig 11a for rcp4 5 we observe very little differences between near and far term projections for summer high flows fig 11c and d in general summer precipitation is projected to increase more in high elevation areas around western and middle massachusetts than the much flatter eastern massachusetts this pattern is also observed for summer high flows where increases in western parts are higher than eastern parts here little contrasts between near and far term indicates that models for rcp4 5 projections and summer high flows show limited abilities to differentiate between projections of future time periods the results also show that scenario uncertainty plays a bigger role at far term than near term as summer high flows shows greater changes for rcp8 5 scenario as compared to rcp4 5 scenario 3 5 7 day 10 year low flow in fall son in fig 12a and b we show percent changes in 7 day 10 year q7 10 low flow in the months of fall son for rcp8 5 using the median values at near and far term respectively while most of the watersheds in massachusetts show a decreasing trend few points in the middle to southern part report little increase or no changes in q7 10 for near term fig 12a similar impacts are observed for far term as well however decreases in low flow become more pronounced in this period fig 12b gcm projections suggest that percent increase in temperature during fall son is amongst the highest while percent increase in precipitation is amongst the lowest especially during the years of 2060 2099 table 3 increased temperature is expected to result in increased et and soil will lose more water than normal as a consequence baseflows will be impacted in areas where drying of soil layers will lead to lowering of flows in rivers and streams particularly during fall season rcp4 5 shows a very similar effect to rcp8 5 for low flow conditions fig 12c and d these two emission scenarios even show similar effects in terms of model spread and uncertainty which is also clearly shown in fig 13 although model spread slightly decreases for rcp4 5 across far term it is also noted that low flows are decreasing more at far term fig 12d than near term fig 12c indicating more watersheds have been projected to get dry during the later half of the century this is again confirmed in table 4 where we have shown that average decreases in massachusetts watersheds for 7 day 10 year low flows ranges between 5 12 10 85 percent for near term and 22 13 27 32 percent during far term across both emission scenarios during fall total precipitation is projected to decrease fig 3g and h and consecutive dry days are projected to increase fig 4b to reduce the soil moisture almost everywhere in massachusetts during both near term and far term this is reflected in the future low flow projections which indicates that watersheds in those areas will have less water during low flow periods fig 13 shows that gcm model spread for low flow conditions across all watersheds are very similar between rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 and also near and far term for both scenarios 11 out of 14 models indicate decreases in low flows in the median sense for near term and similar model consensus are observed for far term suggesting a drier future during low flow period 3 6 7 day 10 year low flow in summer jja as was the case with high flows q7 10 low flows in summer also shows an overall increasing trend in both near and far term for rcp8 5 fig 14 a and b this can be a reflection of increased summer precipitation in a number of areas which has been indicated by gcm projections fig 3e and f although antecedent soil moisture plays a more important role to influence low flow conditions it is difficult to make any comments on that from our study since we have not looked into seasonal soil moisture content as such further investigation is required to better understand future trends of summer low flows and relevant physical processes rcp4 5 results for summer low flows show very similar results and there is very little to differentiate between near and far term as well fig 14c and d 4 discussion non stationarity in regional climate will influence to change patterns of hydrological extremes across the globe kundzewicz et al 2014 milly et al 2008 wobus et al 2017 as such design standards for hydraulic and other infrastructures particularly those built in river floodplains need to be revised with changing flood magnitudes similar strategies should be adopted for low flow conditions for sustainable management of water supply drought monitoring and reservoir operation unfortunately there is often incomplete or no data available for specific locations and rules of thumb based on past experience are used to estimate the design flow to overcome such situations we have investigated in this study seasonal characteristics of 100 year flood and 7 day 10 year low flows across 86 watersheds in massachusetts to understand and predict future changes in magnitudes of floods and low flows overall parts of our results presented in section 3 are in agreement with preceding literatures that were conducted for the u s northeastern region huntington et al 2009 marshall and randhir 2008 parr et al 2015 parr and wang 2014 however the major limitation encountered with previous studies were that they lacked in necessary details in providing climate change signals of extreme events and their spatial and temporal variations within the study region additionally most of the prior studies were based on either historical data or outputs from a simpler hydrological modeling system with limited abilities to accurately capture extreme events in contrast we have used state of the art hydrological modeling for our study and the cmip5 gcms used are highly respected and frequently applied in recent times the new insights gained from this study suggest that central and western part of massachusetts will be at risk of greater winter flooding than other parts whereas spring flood will experience decreases in majority of watersheds south and north eastern part of the state will be in greater risk of drought especially during the months of fall son here it should be noted that both 100 year flood and 7 day 10 year low flow estimates only refer to magnitudes of the events not frequency arnell and lloyd hughes 2014 also results for eastern coastal part of massachusetts presented in section 3 should be considered more carefully because our study focus is only limited to riverine analysis and takes no account of storm surge or sea level rise effects the use of gcm ensembles provides an estimate of future uncertainties gao et al 2019 in this study scenario uncertainties are addressed using simulations for two emission scenarios rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 while model uncertainties are accounted for each emission scenario by employing 14 different gcms that are best suited for the region although partitioning uncertainties is not the main focus of this study certain implications can be made based on model consensus and disagreements for rcp8 5 model uncertainties related to 100 year floods in winter are found to be greater at far term than near term while model uncertainties for rcp4 5 is less pronounced due to lack of contrasts between near and far term models however are found to be more in consensus for seasonal floods in spring for which median estimates show a decreasing trend almost everywhere in the state despite variations in models and emission scenarios uncertainties for low conditions are of similar characteristics except for the fall season which shows greater model spread for near term projections than far term overall it is found that changes for floods and low flows are more pronounced for rcp8 5 and far term projections when compared to rcp4 5 and near term projections this implies that risks from floods and drought will be much greater during the later half of the century if ghg emissions continue to follow current trend as modeling river basins using climate forecasts is a challenging task there are several limitations that can be noted these limitations may arise from 1 shortcomings in gcm projections 2 the lack of hydrologic data that is unimpaired by infrastructure management and 3 the challenges of hydrologic modeling the cmip5 gcms described in section 2 2 are products of state of the art climate modeling however there is great complexity in these models as they attempt to predict climate projections for century long time periods maloney et al 2014 sheffield et al 2013 additionally the horizontal resolutions of most of the gcms are coarse and ranges between 100 300 km to perform hydrological modeling at regional scale we have applied loca downscaling method to transform coarse resolution climate model data into a much finer resolution 6 6 km however loca downscaled products have shown some limitations in their ability to discriminate between precipitation extremes for different return intervals i e 50 year vs 100 year events alder and hostetler 2019 lopez cantu et al 2020 later we apply a bilinear interpolation to resample the climate data into 4 4 km which is the requirement of the hydrological model for input forcing thus rescaling and resampling climate data between different resolutions bring additional uncertainties to our estimates uncertainties may also originate from the hydrological modeling technique clark et al 2016 hydrological models are simplified representations of many physical processes and currently there exists no perfect model that can accurately capture these physical processes to predict runoff or streamflow gupta et al 1998 since we have employed just one hydrological model uncertainties that stem from hydrological sources model structure parameters initial and boundary conditions remain unaccounted in this study on top of that we have already mentioned in section 2 3 2 that watersheds in massachusetts are highly regulated upstream weiskel et al 2010 flow regulations can greatly alter natural flow regimes of rivers and streams which makes hydrological model calibration a challenging task although we made a sincere effort to carefully select watersheds that are least regulated it was impossible to calibrate the model for all 86 watersheds land use is another important driver of climate change that assumed to be constant throughout our analysis for future studies therefore we recommend to explicitly account for land use and land cover changes for more accurate and improved hydrological simulations 5 conclusions in this study we used climate projections from 14 carefully selected gcms to force a physically based distributed hydrological model to generate estimates of 100 year flood and 7 day 10 year low flows for 86 different watersheds within the state of massachusetts the results are presented for two ghg pathways scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the estimates of 100 year flood and 7 day 10 year low flows are obtained for three different time regimes current for the years 1981 2016 near term for the years 2021 2060 and far term for the years 2060 2099 ultimately percent changes in 100 year flood and 7 day 10 year low flows are compared between the current or base period and the near and far term period under two emission scenarios these percent changes were measured for different seasons using the median values of 14 different estimates that are generated using different gcms as inputs for both emission scenarios our analysis for 100 year floods in winter shows an increasing trend across near and far term in the future the increases are more prominent across far term with many locations showing an increase over 30 percent in flood magnitudes compared to the base period the watersheds in the eastern massachusetts are the only exceptions showing least amount of increases in flood magnitudes because increases in extreme precipitation events and temperature in these areas are not as pronounced as they are in the rest of the state during the spring 100 year flood estimates show a decreasing trend for both the emission scenarios rcp8 5 and 4 5 and decreases are more pronounced during the far term when compared to the base period increases in temperature 1 c 3 c are expected to drive the snowmelt lot earlier than normal which may cause a shift in spring peak flows in the future for rcp8 5 estimates of 7 day 10 year low flows during fall have been projected to decrease in most places across the state these results are shown to be consistent for both near and far term due to increased mean temperature and evaporative demand similar results are observed for rcp4 5 although decreases in the far term are more pronounced than near term both high and low flows during summer are projected to increase under rcp8 5 in most locations these increase goes over 15 percent the results for rcp4 5 shows similar effects and no real changes are observed in the spatiotemporal patterns the projections of hydrological extremes presented in this study show very little differences between rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 except for the last few decades of the 21 st century this is because regional precipitation is highly variable at interannual to decadal scales variations that are substantially larger than differences arising from using different emissions pathways karmalkar and bradley 2017 results show that the projected changes for most cases are spatially uniform across the state even though the absolute values for change projections may vary substantially in addition most of the results presented in this study are based on the median values of fourteen different 100 year floods or 7 day 10 year low flows generated from 14 climate models to develop a simpler understanding of plausible future direction of extreme hydrological events in massachusetts therefore the effect of uncertainties in gcm projections and hydrological modeling may not be well represented spatially for this reason the spatial trends shown in this study needs further revision or investigation since we use multiple gcms to drive one hydrologic model the uncertainty in the projections of hydrological extremes mainly reflects the uncertainty in regional projections produced by different climate models the use of a different hydrologic model will undoubtedly produce different projections which should also be further investigated despite few uncertainties mentioned above the use of multiple climate scenarios leads to a wide range of hydrologic projections providing valuable information in regard to risk assessment for planners structural designers transportation agencies water supply managers fish and wildlife conservation agencies etc outcomes from this study can be particularly beneficial for improved management of vulnerable water infrastructures property risk assessment and drought monitoring and mitigation from the point of view of evaluating risks special attention should be given to the extreme cases with disproportionately large hydrological impacts even though all the projections presented in this study are considered equally likely credit authorship

has requested member nations to achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030 to meet this target as the country population reaches 257 8 million by 2030 in the face of limited freshwater resource will require collecting water resource water use socio economic and environmental data in accordance with the provision of the river basin development authority act cap 396 lfn 1990 section 4 1 e implementing data collection at the river basin level will help inform and support action towards the realisation of nigeria s drinking water target this study therefore explores the situation of data collection in nigeria and exposes the factors constraining its full implementation new hydrological insights evidence distilled from data gathering sources revealed that a only hydrological and meteorological data were being collected by the river basin development authorities rbdas b even with that inadequate financial resources constrained its full implementation and c the inability of the rbdas to collect hydrogeological water use socio economic and environmental data was traced to institutional factors this study offers proposals on measures which might help to improve the situation towards a better data collection implementation at the river basin level in nigeria keywords data collection technical institutional river basin nigeria 1 introduction sustainable use control and management of water resources at the river basin level have made data an important component data are central to the effective implementation of any water resources management paradigms be it integrated water resources management iwrm or adaptive management data whether in the form of verbal measured or textual global water partnership gwp 2001 2003 raw modelled or analysed mcdonnell 2008 are needed at different stages of the water resources management and in different forms by the various actors and water stakeholders for planning and other

data will also help in real time forecasting of the weather ijasan 2007 and hydrological phenomena federal ministry of water resources fmwr 2016 nigeria is a signatory to the 2030 united nations sustainable development goals sdgs target 6 1 of goal 6 has mandated member countries to achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030 in agreement with this mandate nigeria plans to achieve 100 per cent access to water supply as the population reaches 257 8 million by 2030 adamu 2017 roughly 52 7 million people lacked access to improved water sources in 2015 adamu 2016 freshwater demand is expected to rise from 5 93 109 in 2010 to 16 59 109 m3 in 2030 federal republic of nigeria frn 2014 arisen from limited rainfall and population increase the internal renewable water resource potential has decreased from 4699 in 1962 world bank 2020 to 1800 m3 per capita in 2010 frn 2014 it is expected to further decrease to 1100 m3 per capita in 2030 frn 2014 with the impacts of deforestation land degradation and land use changes on freshwater availability still poorly understood rising socio economic development in the face of climate change and climate variability will further increase per capita water use and promote competition among water users although still poorly quantified another factor exerting pressure on freshwater availability in nigeria is waste and wastewater from domestic and industries which are still being discharged untreated into open spaces streams and other water bodies fmwr 2016 taken together since freshwater availability and freshwater supply are positively linked to sustainably meet nigeria s drinking water target in accordance with the 2030 sdgs data collection is crucial to informing and supporting action towards the accomplishment of universal and equitable provision of safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030 the river basin development authorities rbdas by the law are responsible for the development supply and management of nigeria s basin water resources section 1 1 of the river basin development authority rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 although an area less investigated data collection seems poorly implemented in nigeria for example looking at the situation of groundwater management in nigeria akujieze et al 2002 and the commission of the european communities 2006 drawing on a country wide study both reported a lack of adequate groundwater data in nigeria also drawing on a country wide assessment the fmwr 2016 noted that water resources data were inadequately collected in nigeria while there is a lack of detailed analysis in the available literature see for example akujieze et al 2002 commission of the european communities 2006 fmwr 2016 goldface irokalibe 2008 on the specific areas where data collection are insufficiently being addressed by the rbdas the literature also offers little information about the factors constraining its full implementation that is the knowledge gap this study sets out to fill this knowledge will help planners and authorities of the river basins develop appropriate policy measures and strategic measures needed to ensure that basin freshwater resources are sustainably managed towards the realisation of the 2030 drinking water target failure to fully implement data collection nigeria may have difficulties realising sustainable water resources planning development and management as well as meeting target 6 1 of the sdgs while there is a dearth of river basin specific data available statistics revealed that the proportion of the nigeria population with access to piped water declined from 17 in 2000 to 11 per cent in 2017 united nations children s fund unicef and world health organisation who 2019 therefore given the need to explore the issue of data collection implementation in depth the study has utilised a case study research approach yin 2009 this study has relevance for both theory and practice and informs water sector reforms in nigeria particularly as it affects data collection at the river basin level besides this the study is expected to benefit the river basin operators the government practitioners and development partners as well as water sector researchers in nigeria and elsewhere however since it is likely that the problems facing water resources management organisations or river basin operators in the area of data collection are not limited to nigeria alone but may be similar in other developing economies to this end the findings of this study have relevance at national regional and international levels 2 methodology 2 1 case study data collection is one of the statutory functions of the rbdas as mandated by section 4 1 e of the river basin development authority act cap 396 lfn 1990 this study aims to expose the factors constraining the full implementation of this statutory function at the river basin level in nigeria using two river basins as a case study case study research approach which fits well with the gap this study intends to fill is regarded as most appropriate for researching organisational activities hartley 2004 over which the researcher has little or no control yin 2009 out of the twelve river basins in nigeria the benin owena river basin b orb and the ogun oshun river basin o orb located in the western littoral hydrological area fig 1 were purposively selected see table 1 for other details about the selected river basins the selection of these river basins was favoured by access to documents human population in the selected river basins was 35 9 million in 2010 expected to reach 57 8 million in 2030 frn 2014 among the eight hydrological areas in nigeria the western hydrological area where the two river basins are situated is expected to record the largest human population by 2030 frn 2014 because of an increase in human population the internal renewable water resources potential of the hydrological area was 1214 in 2010 expected to decrease to 754 m3 per capita in 2030 frn 2014 more importantly the ogun oshun river basin especially the lagos ibadan abeokuta axis is home to the bulk of industrial and trading activities in nigeria water pollution surface and subsurface is expected to be the highest as waste and wastewater from these sectors including the households are disposed untreated into water bodies and open spaces salt water intrusions in the coastal areas of these river basins are another important factor promoting a decrease in freshwater availability in both river basins through quality deterioration despite these challenges the b orb benin owena river basin is one of the least developed in nigeria in terms of availability of water infrastructure while the o orb ogun oshun river basin is moderate akinkoye 1997 this further underscores the importance of exploring the issue of data collection in nigeria using the two river basins as a case study the results would serve as a lesson for the case of nigeria since the rbdas work with uniform mandates and objectives akpabio 2008 which is consistent with the legal instrument setting them up and other countries with similar situations however prior to this research there is no documented study on the situation of data collection in the selected case river basins 2 2 data collection and analysis this study drew mainly on documentary sources of data to explore the situation of data collection and the factors constraining its full implementation at the river basin level in nigeria documentary data which are relevant to case studies yin 2009 are capable of presenting evidence about a phenomenon which cannot be obtained through observations or interviews ritchie 2003 and offer the ability to yield valuable insights into a social reality may 1993 the reviewed documents include legal and regulatory instruments obtained from courts of law in nigeria and reputable internet sources such as faolex of the fao organisation handbooks annual reports from the selected rbdas and other publications from the selected rbdas and the fmwr although not without its weakness zikmund 1991 in areas where documentary sources of data were deficient this was supplemented with unstructured interviews conducted between february and april 2019 to collect raw data to fill in gaps rbdas staff members relevant to proffering answers to emerging issues were interviewed in their work places in person by telephone communications based on previous contacts unstructured interviews with open ended questions offer the advantage of eliciting relevant responses as the issues emerge and enable respondents to expand on their answers unstructured interviews are capable of producing rich and valuable data without imposing any pre selected categories which might limit the scope of the inquiry punch 1998 being independent of theory and epistemology the data were analysed using the theoretical thematic analytic approach braun and clarke 2006 the raw data were open coded leech and onwuegbuzie 2007 the obtained evidence was sorted and organised around three major pre selected categories a what the legal and regulatory instruments the rbdas complied with in practice on their functional mandates say on data collection b what the selected rbdas do in practice and c the constraining factors categorised as either technical or institutional the selection of constraining categories responded to arguments in the institutional theory literature that both technical e g raw materials financial capital human capital or personnel technology energy etc and institutional e g regulative normative and cognitive elements place pressures on organisations beck and walgenbach 2003 and can constrain the ability of organisations to implement a task scott 1992 kraatz and zajac 1996 in the analysis the study viewed the rbdas as an open system according to boon et al 2009 open organisations are easily permeated by pressures in their internal and external environments described in detail elsewhere adeoti 2019 institutional theory employed as the study s theoretical framework is crucial for understanding the factors constraining the full implementation of data collection at the river basin level in nigeria institutional theory has been widely employed and has become the dominant framework in analysing organisational actions and performance scott 2014 for example currie and finnegan 2011 applied institutional theory to identify the driver and inhibitor to introducing enabling technologies in the health care environment in the uk national health service nhs in a more recent study adeoti 2019 employed institutional theory to understand the factors constraining the implementation of watershed management in nigeria evidence of the application of institutional theory is also found in other fields of studies such as information systems hu et al 2007 currie and finnegan 2011 sport management washington and patterson 2010 internet and e commerce kshetri and dholakia 2005 family business leaptrott 2005 accounting and auditing samsonova and turley 2006 and entrepreneurship amine and staub 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 rbdas nigeria legal and regulatory instruments the rbdas in nigeria were parastatals of the fmwr benin owena river basin development authority b orbda 2002 the nigerian public service rules of 2008 referred to parastatals as government owned organisations established by statutes to render specified services to the public parastatals which come under the policy directives of the government are structured and operated according to the instruments establishing them this indicates that the rbdas were formal organisations under the authority of the fmwr and their functional mandates specified by legal instruments the institutional theory literature asserts that a positive correlation exists between the regulative frameworks consisting of for example laws policies executive orders court rulings orders standards and guidelines and their ability to empower organisation action or constrain it ahlstrom and bruton 2002 scott 1995 of all the reviewed legal and regulatory instruments guiding the functional aspects of all the rbdas in nigeria o orbda 2011a 2013 only the rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 empowered and enabled the rbdas including the selected rbdas to collect and collate data section 4 1 e table 2 notwithstanding this the rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 was silent on the specific parameters to be monitored and measured by the rbdas although the two pioneer rbdas were created in 1973 and an additional nine in 1976 the review of the legal instruments constituting and re constituting the rbdas revealed that it was not until 1987 that all the rbdas in nigeria were mandated to undertake data collection as a part of their statutory functions by the rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 before then the mostly meteorological and hydrological data collection going on in the river basins were being implemented by the fmwr the rbdas supervisory body b orbda 2012 as a part of their core functions bassey 1998 fmwr 2001 2004 2011 3 2 the selected rbdas and data collection implementation in practice documentary evidence revealed that both the ogun oshun river basin development authority o orbda and the b orbda did not collect and neither were these rbdas dependent on other organisations for the collection of water use socio economic and environmental data instead as illustrated in table 3 they collected and collated hydrological and meteorological data b orbda 1992 1995 2007 benin owena river basin and rural development authority b orbrda 1997 2005 o orbda 2005 2007 2008 2009 2011a 2013 this indicates that the efforts of the selected rbdas were simply concentrated on having a fair knowledge of the surface water resources potential of their river basin areas in the fulfilment of this task the b orbda has produced five hydrological year books covering between 1989 and 2000 table 4 while the interview data revealed that the o orbda was yet to produce one reasons due mainly to the fact that yearbook production was seen by the rbda as not a major priority area of the organisation coupled with the problems of inadequate financial resources both documentary and interview evidence revealed that the hydrological and meteorological data being collected in both river basins table 3 were mostly through manual and automatic instruments oteze 1992 although the rbdas in nigeria have concerned themselves with surface water resources development akujieze et al 2002 the only data collected by the selected rbdas relating to hydrogeological or groundwater had to do with recording the number of boreholes sunk by the basin authorities in their river basin areas b orbda 2002 fmwr 2011 o orbda 1982 2011b there was no evidence of groundwater maps and no data on aquifer recharge as well as safe yield however a review of the data collected table 3 revealed the presence of gaps and reductions in the numbers of monitored stations in the b orb for example while data were harvested from 24 hydrological and 4 meteorological stations in 1980 oteze 1995 only 6 hydrological and 2 meteorological stations were in operation in year 2000 b orbda 2007 ijasan 2007 this situation similar to that of the o orbda was attributed to faulty vandalism and theft of equipment abdulmumin 1998 ijasan 2007 osula 1992 while inconsistency in publication table 4 was traced to financial constraints emefiene 2005 documentary and interview evidence revealed that the inability of the b orbda to continue with the production of the year book was also attributed to failure to continue with stations monitoring osula 2007 and a paucity of funds although the history of stream gauge data collection from 29 stations in the o orb dates back to 1965 o orbda 1982 there was no evidence to suggest that the rbdas in nigeria were mandated to publish the data collected by arrangement the fmwr was to be responsible for the dissemination of the data collected by the rbdas bassey 1998 fmwr 2011 the rbdas were only invested with the task of field monitoring management of stations field data collection and transfer of raw data to the fmwr bassey 1998 dongodaji 1998 supported by law the national water resources institute act cap no 83 lfn 2004 the national water resources institute had the mandate to maintain a national water resources databank relating to surface and subsurface water resources despite this there is a dearth of evidence to suggest that this arrangement was being followed possibly because of a lack of enforcement or financial resources on the part of the fmwr to put in place the necessary data management facilities to buttress this documentary evidence revealed that the fmwr often complained of inadequate financial resources to implement its tasks fmwr 2001 2011 the foregoing also affirms that the rbdas were responsible for data collection at the river basin level in nigeria there is little evidence to suggest that the hydrological and meteorological data being collected by the selected rbdas see table 3 were sufficient to inform and support action needed to realise target 6 1 of the sdgs as well as track changes in the various aspects of water resources development supply and use for example to meet universal and equitable access to safe drinking water will require important data on water resource quantity and quality water use demographics and environmental on the other hand to realise affordability issues in a sustainable manner this will also require detailed data on water use and water use patterns and socio economic parameters 3 3 rbdas data collection constraints in nigeria as revealed in subsection 3 2 two issues emerged firstly only hydrological and meteorological data table 3 were being collected by the selected case rbdas even with that there were traces of gaps and reductions in the numbers of reported parameters and stations secondly for hydrogeological water use socio economic and environmental no data were collected table 3 in the case of the first aspect available documents were quite clear on the factors constraining the full implementation of hydrological and meteorological data collection in the selected river basins the first set of evidence converged around untimely non release inadequate capital budgetary funding abdulmumin 1998 akinkoye 1997 2001 fatokun and ogunlana 1988 osula 1995 2005 o orbda 1989 2005 2007 2008 and the diversion of non budgetary or special intervention funds meant for data collection to other areas osula 2007 while the need to obtain certificates of no objection to contracts award from the due process office in accordance with the procurement act of 2007 and delay in budget approval were responsible for untimely and non release there was also a wide gap between allocation and actual release being responsible for the inadequate capital budgetary funding in most cases actual release which did not follow a specific timeline was tied to the amount of revenue collected by the federal government for example actual capital release in 2017 about the highest was 60 per cent of capital budgetary allocation muhammed et al 2018 however since the rbdas were expected to comply with extant legal and regulatory instruments one salient factor curbing the possibility of carrying over any released but unspent capital budgetary grants to the next budget year was a government policy on the return of unspent funds this policy reinforced by the finance control and management act cap 144 lfn of 1990 section 16 and some other circulars for example finance circular f 15775 and treasury circular a4 b4 2002 has compelled all publicly funded organisations in nigeria to return unspent capital budgetary releases back to the consolidated revenue fund at the end of the budget year although organisations are not passive receivers of pressures from their environments suddaby 2010 the institutional theory literature argues that organisations comply with legal and regulatory instruments for reasons of maximising rewards and avoiding penalty for non compliance leaptrott 2005 however for reasons of being sanctioned make publicly funded organisations in nigeria comply with regulative rules taken together poor funding impacted the ability of the selected rbdas to invest in modern and automated equipment rehabilitate and replace stolen damaged and obsolete equipment purchase vehicles for stations monitoring and implement regular training of monitoring crew bassey 1998 osula 1992 the other set of evidence converged around poor remuneration of gauge readers osula 2007 o orbda 2005 2007 2008 and a lack of appreciation of the importance of hydrological and meteorological data collection by most non technical staff osula 2005 2007 the latter being shaped by cognitive pressures is vital because it s capable of impacting the availability of capital budgetary funding at the river basin level as enabled by section 9 1 of the rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 all the rbdas were empowered to prepare their annual budget estimates before forwarding same to the national assembly through the fmwr therefore if the non technical staff members who prepare this budget estimates do not appreciate the importance of data collection bearing in mind that the rbdas have their budget caps it is either they allocate a reduced amount to data collection or they allocate none this lack of appreciation may also explain why special intervention funds meant for hydrological and meteorological data collection were diverted to other areas however once the budget proposal is passed by the national assembly and assented to by the president either adequate for data collection or not it becomes an act a legal instrument binding on the rbdas to implement with the poor remuneration of the gauge readers the motivation to monitor the stations collect and collate real data would be lacking as reported by osula 2007 due to poor remuneration most of the gauge readers eventually abandoned the stations therefore the key factor constraining the full implementation of hydrological and meteorological data collection was financial resources this can be classified as a technical factor although its adequacy and availability when needed were influenced by some forces on the second aspect as briefly hinted in subsection 3 1 prior to the promulgation of the rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 the fmwr established in 1976 bassey 1998 fmwr 2004 was responsible for water resources data collection in nigeria that the federal government depended on the world meteorological organisation of the united nations wmo for technical bassey 1998 and funding assistance osula 1995 informed the fmwr collecting hydrological and meteorological data this appeared evident because a the data to be collected would have to coincide with the areas of interests of the international funding body or wmo requirements or the purpose of the funding programme for instance during the period based on nigeria s drainage basins wmo recommended a minimum number of 482 primary hydrological monitoring stations for the country bassey 1998 fmwr 2001 and b the wmo by itself is an organisation involved in the provision of hydrological and meteorological data services wmo 2019 because of the roles they play and the value they command international agencies are sources of cognitive and or normative pressures through the directions instructions and or financial assistance they offer adeoti 2019 dependency on these external organisations can therefore empower certain organisational action and disable another in the dependent organisation therefore cooperating with wmo requirements explains why the equipment supplied under the nigeria wmo agreement was mostly related to those for meteorological and hydrological measurements ejodame 2005 osula 1995 oteze 1995 for the fmwr to implement its data collection task the ministry had zonal offices in the river basins in charge of hydrological and meteorological data collection abdulmumin 1998 however with the rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 transferring data collection function to the rbdas in 1987 the fmwr withdrew from this task and the zonal offices of the fmwr were merged with the rbdas in 1997 abdulmumin 1998 prior to the merger documentary evidence revealed that the hydrological and meteorological stations were being jointly monitored by the rbdas and the fmwr osula 1997 while the rbdas along the line had separately established some networks of hydrological and meteorological data gathering stations abdulmumin 1998 post merger to impress hydrological and meteorological data collection function on the rbdas a national workshop was facilitated by the then federal ministry of water resources and rural development fmwrrd in 1998 initially scheduled to hold in 1997 dongodaji 1998 to ensure that the rbdas comply with the directives of the fmwrrd which were in accordance with the wmo requirements standard formats for raw hydrological and meteorological data collection and reporting designed by the ministry were sent to all the rbdas in 1997 bassey 1998 because the rbdas were dependent on the fmwr for directions resources and support as empowered by the rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 and the water resources act 1993 cap w2 lfn of 2004 they simply accepted and continued with hydrological and meteorological data collection o orbda 2018 b orbrda 2005 b orbda 2007 being sensitive to what values and norms of conduct the fmwr deemed appropriate as pointed out by leaptrott 2005 the rbdas would strive to respect the collection of hydrological and meteorological data also the fmwr is the supervisory body of the rbdas as amplified by scott 1991 and applicable to the rbdas pressure by means of authority would meet with less resistance and had a high level of compliance and stability besides this on the part of the fmwr and the rbdas as emphasised by scott 1995 organisational practices that receive positive external support are likely to be promoted and retained than those lacking such support thus it is safe to hold that hydrological and meteorological data collection was internalised taken for granted as the proper way to function because doing so enabled the rbdas to gain legitimacy as well as obtain resources and support from the fmwr also the rbdas have right from the inception focussed on the design and construction of dams and irrigation schemes akinkoye 1997 benin river basin and rural development authority brbrda 1984 b orbda 2012 o orbda 1978 1982 2011a these activities have exclusively profited from data related to surface water resources this may explain why the rbdas had separately established some networks of hydrological and meteorological data gathering stations as reported by abdulmumin 1998 therefore borrowing from zucker 1987 those practices that is hydrological and meteorological data collection in the case of the selected rbdas that contributed to organisational performance were likely to be promoted and tend to persist over time and with the absence of government interrogating the rbdas or the public protesting against the selected case rbdas for not collecting hydrogeological water use socio economic and environmental data or these rbdas being sanctioned by the professional bodies the implementation of hydrological and meteorological data collection became routines defined by scott 2014 as deeply rooted habitualised activities once certain organisational activities become habitualised the ability to make changes can be difficult leaptrott 2005 this explains why there was no division responsible for the collection of hydrogeological water use socio economic and environmental data in the selected case river basins unlike hydrological and meteorological data which were being handled by personnel in the engineering department o orbda 2011b supported by taken for grantedness and normative expectations and as time passes sustained by habitual actions both taken for grantedness and normative expectations are rules like capable of promoting repetitive behaviour and without being fully conscious of it shape action in organisations as with legal and regulative instruments so also taken for grantedness and normative expectations are institutional pressures capable of constraining actions and performance of organisations scott 1995 2014 judge et al 2008 therefore the underlying factor constraining the implementation of hydrogeological water use socio economic and environmental data collection in the selected river basins was institutional in summary inadequate financial resources constrained the full implementation of hydrological and meteorological data collection while taken for grantedness and normative pressures guided action and resisted change thereby constrained the implementation of hydrogeological water use socio economic and environmental data collection in the selected river basins although the effect of cognitive pressures may precede that of normative both which are less visible tend to overlap to constrain the implementation of hydrogeological water use socio economic and environmental data collection although difficult to identify the dominant pressure it seems they worked in combination inadequate financial resources from the federal government and normative prescriptions from the fmwr were pressures operating in the external environment of the selected rbdas while the effects of taken for grantedness were pressures operating in the internal environment in support of the adopted open systems perspective findings of this study have illustrated that the selected rbdas were permeated by pressures in their internal and external environments although the rbdas and the fmwr were within the same operational environment being organisations within the same field impression from this study indicates that the pressures operating in the external environment had a dominant influence on the internal environment than the other way around while the pressures operating in the internal environment are accessible to the selected rbdas to manipulate those within the external environment are beyond their ability to alter directly therefore the inability of the selected rbdas to fully implement data collection as provided by the rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 section 4 1 e was sanctioned by technical and institutional factors operating in their internal and external environments this finding supports kirby and sebastian 1998 regarding the importance of technical and institutional pressures in shaping organisational performance and that such pressures can be rooted in the internal and external environments hu et al 2007 fig 2 summarises the factors constraining the full implementation of data collection in the selected river basins in nigeria identified from an institutional theory perspective with inadequate implementation of data collection as illustrated in this study the possibility for a sustainable water resources planning development use and management aimed at informing and supporting practices and programmes intended for the realisation of target 6 1 of the sdgs is limited this weakness which the fmwr 2001 viewed as being responsible for the poor design operation and maintenance of dams and reservoir operations may eventually limit the possibility of the country meeting its 2030 drinking water target while it is likely that this situation is not limited to nigeria alone focussing on the kafue river basin in zambia uhlendahl et al 2011 found that there was a lack of reliable hydrological data to support water allocation decisions in the survey of the water sector in cameroon ako et al 2009 found that data related to quantity and quality of water resources were inadequate in the case of mozambique and zimbabwe gwp 2009 discovered poor availability of reliable data also in the 2017 annual progress review for south asia gwp 2018 found that there was a dearth of adequate data related to water resources although the constraining factors were hard to identify this inadequacy was seen to curb effective water resources development and management 4 identified policy gaps and possible interventions this study has revealed that the investigated rbdas only collected and collated data related to hydrological and meteorological table 3 since all the rbdas in nigeria work with uniform mandates and objectives and are subjected to same institutional frameworks the data collection situation in other river basins in nigeria may not differ largely from the selected rbdas being constituted and operated by the same legal and regulatory instruments the identified policy gaps and possible interventions will also remain relevant to other rbdas in nigeria this study have shown that although all the rbdas in nigeria were statutorily empowered to collect and collate data at the river basin level in the case of the selected river basins there was an absence of organisational templates upon which budgetary allocations to the various statutory functions of the rbdas could be based from the review of the annual reports this is vital because all the rbdas in nigeria have budget caps instead of resting on the rules of thumb or the discretions of the non technical staff responsible for budget preparation the template based on some established objective parameters which may be basin specific will need to indicate what percentage of the total would go to each of the statutory functions besides this and as applicable to the case river basins the statutory functions of the rbdas have not informed the crafting of the organogram of the rbdas the most recent effort aimed at altering the rbdas organogram or organisational arrangement in support of the partial commercialisation programme only focussed on how to make the rbdas an economic service provider rather than a social service provider o orbrda 1998 even at that data are still needed this should inform the need to restructure the rbdas and to indicate on the organogram which departments will be responsible for the collection of hydrogeological water use socio economic and environmental data for example when the issue of climate change became a hot topic in nigeria a climate change unit was created in 2010 formed part of the organisational structure of the rbdas and was included on the rbdas organogram as reflected under the office of the managing director b orbda 2012 fmwr 2012a while the rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 empowered and enabled all the rbdas to collect and collate data it lacked any enforcement mechanisms although the water resources act 1993 cap w2 lfn of 2004 empowered the minister responsible for water resources to formulate regulations to enforce the water laws section 19 there were no regulations in practice to enforce the collection and collation of data consistent with the argument of hodgson 2006 to support the implementation of legal and regulatory instruments enforcement is required lastly to redirect the attention of the selected rbdas and other rbdas with similar performance to hydrogeological water use socio economic and environmental data collection which is vital to informing and supporting action towards accomplishing nigeria s drinking water target as well as monitoring changes in the various aspects of water resources development supply and use shocks are needed to destabilise persistent practices the institutional theory literature persuasively argues that shocks can be introduced dacin et al 2002 for organisations established by statues legal and regulatory instruments can serve as a vital tool to disrupt persistent practices since all the rbdas in nigeria were established by same statue amendments to the legal instruments they comply with in practice on their functional mandates can serve as an important low cost vehicle to destabilise their persistent focus on hydrological and meteorological data collection to realise this will require the introduction of functional audit to serve as a shock although section 10 1 of the rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 has empowered all the rbdas to produce annual reports the main emphasis has been on audited financial accounts of the authority for the preceding financial year and of the auditor s report o orbda 2009 therefore in addition to financial audit there is a need for functional audit if this is made a statutory requirement it will help not only the selected rbdas but others interrogate itself and examine which of the statutory functions are being implemented which ones are not why and generate possible solutions 5 conclusions and recommendations for nigeria to meet its drinking water target in accordance with the sdgs as the population grows to 257 8 million by 2030 the collection of water resources water use socio economic and environmental data is very crucial drawing mainly on secondary sources of data from two river basins in nigeria the study found that the full implementation of data collection was constrained by technical and institutional factors both of which played an important but different roles the technical factors served as a major barrier to fully implement hydrological and meteorological data collection in the selected river basins notwithstanding this and to the neglect of others the collection of hydrological and meteorological data persisted and was sustained because it was taken for granted normatively sanctioned and backed by the rbdas supervisory body the fmwr with data collection not being fully implemented the ability of the investigated rbdas to institute practices and programmes needed to inform and support action towards the realisation of universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water identify conflict areas and vulnerabilities establish water priorities and resolve water conflicts track and evaluate changes in the various water resources development supply and use and understand appropriate solutions to apply is thin however in accordance with the provision of the rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 section 4 1 e the full implementation of data collection will assist each of the rbdas to develop a comprehensive water resources master plan at the river basin level which is at present still lacking but central to achieving target 6 1 of the sdgs therefore to meet nigeria s drinking water target rests on the shoulders of the rbdas and their ability to effectively collect and collate data in light of the finding of this study and with the rbdas being organisations established by statute the following policy measures are recommended which might help to improve the situation not only in the selected river basins but in nigeria more broadly a the amendment of the rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 to include provisions that suggest the use of templates for capital budgetary allocations to the various statutory functions of the rbdas this amendment can be included as part of the proceedings of the rbdas under the second schedule to the rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 b the provision of enforcement mechanisms which will serve to drive the rbdas to fully implement their data collection function section 4 1 e by amending the rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 and the water resources act 1993 cap w2 lfn of 2004 to reduce the transaction cost of enforcement such mechanisms should relate more to incentives than to sanctions the use of incentives will enjoy more cultural support thereby making enforcement less expensive to implement c the introduction of functional audit as an item that will form part of the annual reports of the rbdas by amending section 10 of the rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 d while it may be difficult for an individual or organisation in nigeria to influence the timing of budget approval or close the gap between capital budgetary allocation and actual release it is however possible to free the rbdas from the provisions of the finance control and management act cap 144 lfn of 1990 this will enable the rbdas including the case rbdas have access to unspent capital budgetary releases in the next budget year to realise this section 10 of the finance control and management act cap 144 lfn of 1990 associated circulars and policy instruments should be amended to exclude all the rbdas with case studies less suited to generalisation the finding and methodological approach of this study will help practitioners and researchers to ask questions about what is going on in other river basins in nigeria and elsewhere with a view to generating an increasing understanding of the factors constraining data collection at the river basin level an area that remains relatively under investigated lastly this study has not explicitly explored the contribution of the internally generated revenues igrs of the selected rbdas to the situation of data collection at least by law all the rbdas in nigeria are empowered to supply raw water from their completed storage schemes to all users for a fee section 4 1 c of the rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 and neither have any legal and regulatory instruments governing the operations of the rbdas specified areas where the rbdas are to spend their igrs this therefore offers possibilities for future studies such an investigation using semi structure interviews and institutional theory as a lens should attempt to understand if the igrs are being committed to data collection implementation and why if not credit

sustainable development goals sdgs target 6 1 of goal 6 has mandated member countries to achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030 in agreement with this mandate nigeria plans to achieve 100 per cent access to water supply as the population reaches 257 8 million by 2030 adamu 2017 roughly 52 7 million people lacked access to improved water sources in 2015 adamu 2016 freshwater demand is expected to rise from 5 93 109 in 2010 to 16 59 109 m3 in 2030 federal republic of nigeria frn 2014 arisen from limited rainfall and population increase the internal renewable water resource potential has decreased from 4699 in 1962 world bank 2020 to 1800 m3 per capita in 2010 frn 2014 it is expected to further decrease to 1100 m3 per capita in 2030 frn 2014 with the impacts of deforestation land degradation and land use changes on freshwater availability still poorly understood rising socio economic development in the face of climate change and climate variability will further increase per capita water use and promote competition among water users although still poorly quantified another factor exerting pressure on freshwater availability in nigeria is waste and wastewater from domestic and industries which are still being discharged untreated into open spaces streams and other water bodies fmwr 2016 taken together since freshwater availability and freshwater supply are positively linked to sustainably meet nigeria s drinking water target in accordance with the 2030 sdgs data collection is crucial to informing and supporting action towards the accomplishment of universal and equitable provision of safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030 the river basin development authorities rbdas by the law are responsible for the development supply and management of nigeria s basin water resources section 1 1 of the river basin development authority rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 although an area less investigated data collection seems poorly implemented in nigeria for example looking at the situation of groundwater management in nigeria akujieze et al 2002 and the commission of the european communities 2006 drawing on a country wide study both reported a lack of adequate groundwater data in nigeria also drawing on a country wide assessment the fmwr 2016 noted that water resources data were inadequately collected in nigeria while there is a lack of detailed analysis in the available literature see for example akujieze et al 2002 commission of the european communities 2006 fmwr 2016 goldface irokalibe 2008 on the specific areas where data collection are insufficiently being addressed by the rbdas the literature also offers little information about the factors constraining its full implementation that is the knowledge gap this study sets out to fill this knowledge will help planners and authorities of the river basins develop appropriate policy measures and strategic measures needed to ensure that basin freshwater resources are sustainably managed towards the realisation of the 2030 drinking water target failure to fully implement data collection nigeria may have difficulties realising sustainable water resources planning development and management as well as meeting target 6 1 of the sdgs while there is a dearth of river basin specific data available statistics revealed that the proportion of the nigeria population with access to piped water declined from 17 in 2000 to 11 per cent in 2017 united nations children s fund unicef and world health organisation who 2019 therefore given the need to explore the issue of data collection implementation in depth the study has utilised a case study research approach yin 2009 this study has relevance for both theory and practice and informs water sector reforms in nigeria particularly as it affects data collection at the river basin level besides this the study is expected to benefit the river basin operators the government practitioners and development partners as well as water sector researchers in nigeria and elsewhere however since it is likely that the problems facing water resources management organisations or river basin operators in the area of data collection are not limited to nigeria alone but may be similar in other developing economies to this end the findings of this study have relevance at national regional and international levels 2 methodology 2 1 case study data collection is one of the statutory functions of the rbdas as mandated by section 4 1 e of the river basin development authority act cap 396 lfn 1990 this study aims to expose the factors constraining the full implementation of this statutory function at the river basin level in nigeria using two river basins as a case study case study research approach which fits well with the gap this study intends to fill is regarded as most appropriate for researching organisational activities hartley 2004 over which the researcher has little or no control yin 2009 out of the twelve river basins in nigeria the benin owena river basin b orb and the ogun oshun river basin o orb located in the western littoral hydrological area fig 1 were purposively selected see table 1 for other details about the selected river basins the selection of these river basins was favoured by access to documents human population in the selected river basins was 35 9 million in 2010 expected to reach 57 8 million in 2030 frn 2014 among the eight hydrological areas in nigeria the western hydrological area where the two river basins are situated is expected to record the largest human population by 2030 frn 2014 because of an increase in human population the internal renewable water resources potential of the hydrological area was 1214 in 2010 expected to decrease to 754 m3 per capita in 2030 frn 2014 more importantly the ogun oshun river basin especially the lagos ibadan abeokuta axis is home to the bulk of industrial and trading activities in nigeria water pollution surface and subsurface is expected to be the highest as waste and wastewater from these sectors including the households are disposed untreated into water bodies and open spaces salt water intrusions in the coastal areas of these river basins are another important factor promoting a decrease in freshwater availability in both river basins through quality deterioration despite these challenges the b orb benin owena river basin is one of the least developed in nigeria in terms of availability of water infrastructure while the o orb ogun oshun river basin is moderate akinkoye 1997 this further underscores the importance of exploring the issue of data collection in nigeria using the two river basins as a case study the results would serve as a lesson for the case of nigeria since the rbdas work with uniform mandates and objectives akpabio 2008 which is consistent with the legal instrument setting them up and other countries with similar situations however prior to this research there is no documented study on the situation of data collection in the selected case river basins 2 2 data collection and analysis this study drew mainly on documentary sources of data to explore the situation of data collection and the factors constraining its full implementation at the river basin level in nigeria documentary data which are relevant to case studies yin 2009 are capable of presenting evidence about a phenomenon which cannot be obtained through observations or interviews ritchie 2003 and offer the ability to yield valuable insights into a social reality may 1993 the reviewed documents include legal and regulatory instruments obtained from courts of law in nigeria and reputable internet sources such as faolex of the fao organisation handbooks annual reports from the selected rbdas and other publications from the selected rbdas and the fmwr although not without its weakness zikmund 1991 in areas where documentary sources of data were deficient this was supplemented with unstructured interviews conducted between february and april 2019 to collect raw data to fill in gaps rbdas staff members relevant to proffering answers to emerging issues were interviewed in their work places in person by telephone communications based on previous contacts unstructured interviews with open ended questions offer the advantage of eliciting relevant responses as the issues emerge and enable respondents to expand on their answers unstructured interviews are capable of producing rich and valuable data without imposing any pre selected categories which might limit the scope of the inquiry punch 1998 being independent of theory and epistemology the data were analysed using the theoretical thematic analytic approach braun and clarke 2006 the raw data were open coded leech and onwuegbuzie 2007 the obtained evidence was sorted and organised around three major pre selected categories a what the legal and regulatory instruments the rbdas complied with in practice on their functional mandates say on data collection b what the selected rbdas do in practice and c the constraining factors categorised as either technical or institutional the selection of constraining categories responded to arguments in the institutional theory literature that both technical e g raw materials financial capital human capital or personnel technology energy etc and institutional e g regulative normative and cognitive elements place pressures on organisations beck and walgenbach 2003 and can constrain the ability of organisations to implement a task scott 1992 kraatz and zajac 1996 in the analysis the study viewed the rbdas as an open system according to boon et al 2009 open organisations are easily permeated by pressures in their internal and external environments described in detail elsewhere adeoti 2019 institutional theory employed as the study s theoretical framework is crucial for understanding the factors constraining the full implementation of data collection at the river basin level in nigeria institutional theory has been widely employed and has become the dominant framework in analysing organisational actions and performance scott 2014 for example currie and finnegan 2011 applied institutional theory to identify the driver and inhibitor to introducing enabling technologies in the health care environment in the uk national health service nhs in a more recent study adeoti 2019 employed institutional theory to understand the factors constraining the implementation of watershed management in nigeria evidence of the application of institutional theory is also found in other fields of studies such as information systems hu et al 2007 currie and finnegan 2011 sport management washington and patterson 2010 internet and e commerce kshetri and dholakia 2005 family business leaptrott 2005 accounting and auditing samsonova and turley 2006 and entrepreneurship amine and staub 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 rbdas nigeria legal and regulatory instruments the rbdas in nigeria were parastatals of the fmwr benin owena river basin development authority b orbda 2002 the nigerian public service rules of 2008 referred to parastatals as government owned organisations established by statutes to render specified services to the public parastatals which come under the policy directives of the government are structured and operated according to the instruments establishing them this indicates that the rbdas were formal organisations under the authority of the fmwr and their functional mandates specified by legal instruments the institutional theory literature asserts that a positive correlation exists between the regulative frameworks consisting of for example laws policies executive orders court rulings orders standards and guidelines and their ability to empower organisation action or constrain it ahlstrom and bruton 2002 scott 1995 of all the reviewed legal and regulatory instruments guiding the functional aspects of all the rbdas in nigeria o orbda 2011a 2013 only the rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 empowered and enabled the rbdas including the selected rbdas to collect and collate data section 4 1 e table 2 notwithstanding this the rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 was silent on the specific parameters to be monitored and measured by the rbdas although the two pioneer rbdas were created in 1973 and an additional nine in 1976 the review of the legal instruments constituting and re constituting the rbdas revealed that it was not until 1987 that all the rbdas in nigeria were mandated to undertake data collection as a part of their statutory functions by the rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 before then the mostly meteorological and hydrological data collection going on in the river basins were being implemented by the fmwr the rbdas supervisory body b orbda 2012 as a part of their core functions bassey 1998 fmwr 2001 2004 2011 3 2 the selected rbdas and data collection implementation in practice documentary evidence revealed that both the ogun oshun river basin development authority o orbda and the b orbda did not collect and neither were these rbdas dependent on other organisations for the collection of water use socio economic and environmental data instead as illustrated in table 3 they collected and collated hydrological and meteorological data b orbda 1992 1995 2007 benin owena river basin and rural development authority b orbrda 1997 2005 o orbda 2005 2007 2008 2009 2011a 2013 this indicates that the efforts of the selected rbdas were simply concentrated on having a fair knowledge of the surface water resources potential of their river basin areas in the fulfilment of this task the b orbda has produced five hydrological year books covering between 1989 and 2000 table 4 while the interview data revealed that the o orbda was yet to produce one reasons due mainly to the fact that yearbook production was seen by the rbda as not a major priority area of the organisation coupled with the problems of inadequate financial resources both documentary and interview evidence revealed that the hydrological and meteorological data being collected in both river basins table 3 were mostly through manual and automatic instruments oteze 1992 although the rbdas in nigeria have concerned themselves with surface water resources development akujieze et al 2002 the only data collected by the selected rbdas relating to hydrogeological or groundwater had to do with recording the number of boreholes sunk by the basin authorities in their river basin areas b orbda 2002 fmwr 2011 o orbda 1982 2011b there was no evidence of groundwater maps and no data on aquifer recharge as well as safe yield however a review of the data collected table 3 revealed the presence of gaps and reductions in the numbers of monitored stations in the b orb for example while data were harvested from 24 hydrological and 4 meteorological stations in 1980 oteze 1995 only 6 hydrological and 2 meteorological stations were in operation in year 2000 b orbda 2007 ijasan 2007 this situation similar to that of the o orbda was attributed to faulty vandalism and theft of equipment abdulmumin 1998 ijasan 2007 osula 1992 while inconsistency in publication table 4 was traced to financial constraints emefiene 2005 documentary and interview evidence revealed that the inability of the b orbda to continue with the production of the year book was also attributed to failure to continue with stations monitoring osula 2007 and a paucity of funds although the history of stream gauge data collection from 29 stations in the o orb dates back to 1965 o orbda 1982 there was no evidence to suggest that the rbdas in nigeria were mandated to publish the data collected by arrangement the fmwr was to be responsible for the dissemination of the data collected by the rbdas bassey 1998 fmwr 2011 the rbdas were only invested with the task of field monitoring management of stations field data collection and transfer of raw data to the fmwr bassey 1998 dongodaji 1998 supported by law the national water resources institute act cap no 83 lfn 2004 the national water resources institute had the mandate to maintain a national water resources databank relating to surface and subsurface water resources despite this there is a dearth of evidence to suggest that this arrangement was being followed possibly because of a lack of enforcement or financial resources on the part of the fmwr to put in place the necessary data management facilities to buttress this documentary evidence revealed that the fmwr often complained of inadequate financial resources to implement its tasks fmwr 2001 2011 the foregoing also affirms that the rbdas were responsible for data collection at the river basin level in nigeria there is little evidence to suggest that the hydrological and meteorological data being collected by the selected rbdas see table 3 were sufficient to inform and support action needed to realise target 6 1 of the sdgs as well as track changes in the various aspects of water resources development supply and use for example to meet universal and equitable access to safe drinking water will require important data on water resource quantity and quality water use demographics and environmental on the other hand to realise affordability issues in a sustainable manner this will also require detailed data on water use and water use patterns and socio economic parameters 3 3 rbdas data collection constraints in nigeria as revealed in subsection 3 2 two issues emerged firstly only hydrological and meteorological data table 3 were being collected by the selected case rbdas even with that there were traces of gaps and reductions in the numbers of reported parameters and stations secondly for hydrogeological water use socio economic and environmental no data were collected table 3 in the case of the first aspect available documents were quite clear on the factors constraining the full implementation of hydrological and meteorological data collection in the selected river basins the first set of evidence converged around untimely non release inadequate capital budgetary funding abdulmumin 1998 akinkoye 1997 2001 fatokun and ogunlana 1988 osula 1995 2005 o orbda 1989 2005 2007 2008 and the diversion of non budgetary or special intervention funds meant for data collection to other areas osula 2007 while the need to obtain certificates of no objection to contracts award from the due process office in accordance with the procurement act of 2007 and delay in budget approval were responsible for untimely and non release there was also a wide gap between allocation and actual release being responsible for the inadequate capital budgetary funding in most cases actual release which did not follow a specific timeline was tied to the amount of revenue collected by the federal government for example actual capital release in 2017 about the highest was 60 per cent of capital budgetary allocation muhammed et al 2018 however since the rbdas were expected to comply with extant legal and regulatory instruments one salient factor curbing the possibility of carrying over any released but unspent capital budgetary grants to the next budget year was a government policy on the return of unspent funds this policy reinforced by the finance control and management act cap 144 lfn of 1990 section 16 and some other circulars for example finance circular f 15775 and treasury circular a4 b4 2002 has compelled all publicly funded organisations in nigeria to return unspent capital budgetary releases back to the consolidated revenue fund at the end of the budget year although organisations are not passive receivers of pressures from their environments suddaby 2010 the institutional theory literature argues that organisations comply with legal and regulatory instruments for reasons of maximising rewards and avoiding penalty for non compliance leaptrott 2005 however for reasons of being sanctioned make publicly funded organisations in nigeria comply with regulative rules taken together poor funding impacted the ability of the selected rbdas to invest in modern and automated equipment rehabilitate and replace stolen damaged and obsolete equipment purchase vehicles for stations monitoring and implement regular training of monitoring crew bassey 1998 osula 1992 the other set of evidence converged around poor remuneration of gauge readers osula 2007 o orbda 2005 2007 2008 and a lack of appreciation of the importance of hydrological and meteorological data collection by most non technical staff osula 2005 2007 the latter being shaped by cognitive pressures is vital because it s capable of impacting the availability of capital budgetary funding at the river basin level as enabled by section 9 1 of the rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 all the rbdas were empowered to prepare their annual budget estimates before forwarding same to the national assembly through the fmwr therefore if the non technical staff members who prepare this budget estimates do not appreciate the importance of data collection bearing in mind that the rbdas have their budget caps it is either they allocate a reduced amount to data collection or they allocate none this lack of appreciation may also explain why special intervention funds meant for hydrological and meteorological data collection were diverted to other areas however once the budget proposal is passed by the national assembly and assented to by the president either adequate for data collection or not it becomes an act a legal instrument binding on the rbdas to implement with the poor remuneration of the gauge readers the motivation to monitor the stations collect and collate real data would be lacking as reported by osula 2007 due to poor remuneration most of the gauge readers eventually abandoned the stations therefore the key factor constraining the full implementation of hydrological and meteorological data collection was financial resources this can be classified as a technical factor although its adequacy and availability when needed were influenced by some forces on the second aspect as briefly hinted in subsection 3 1 prior to the promulgation of the rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 the fmwr established in 1976 bassey 1998 fmwr 2004 was responsible for water resources data collection in nigeria that the federal government depended on the world meteorological organisation of the united nations wmo for technical bassey 1998 and funding assistance osula 1995 informed the fmwr collecting hydrological and meteorological data this appeared evident because a the data to be collected would have to coincide with the areas of interests of the international funding body or wmo requirements or the purpose of the funding programme for instance during the period based on nigeria s drainage basins wmo recommended a minimum number of 482 primary hydrological monitoring stations for the country bassey 1998 fmwr 2001 and b the wmo by itself is an organisation involved in the provision of hydrological and meteorological data services wmo 2019 because of the roles they play and the value they command international agencies are sources of cognitive and or normative pressures through the directions instructions and or financial assistance they offer adeoti 2019 dependency on these external organisations can therefore empower certain organisational action and disable another in the dependent organisation therefore cooperating with wmo requirements explains why the equipment supplied under the nigeria wmo agreement was mostly related to those for meteorological and hydrological measurements ejodame 2005 osula 1995 oteze 1995 for the fmwr to implement its data collection task the ministry had zonal offices in the river basins in charge of hydrological and meteorological data collection abdulmumin 1998 however with the rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 transferring data collection function to the rbdas in 1987 the fmwr withdrew from this task and the zonal offices of the fmwr were merged with the rbdas in 1997 abdulmumin 1998 prior to the merger documentary evidence revealed that the hydrological and meteorological stations were being jointly monitored by the rbdas and the fmwr osula 1997 while the rbdas along the line had separately established some networks of hydrological and meteorological data gathering stations abdulmumin 1998 post merger to impress hydrological and meteorological data collection function on the rbdas a national workshop was facilitated by the then federal ministry of water resources and rural development fmwrrd in 1998 initially scheduled to hold in 1997 dongodaji 1998 to ensure that the rbdas comply with the directives of the fmwrrd which were in accordance with the wmo requirements standard formats for raw hydrological and meteorological data collection and reporting designed by the ministry were sent to all the rbdas in 1997 bassey 1998 because the rbdas were dependent on the fmwr for directions resources and support as empowered by the rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 and the water resources act 1993 cap w2 lfn of 2004 they simply accepted and continued with hydrological and meteorological data collection o orbda 2018 b orbrda 2005 b orbda 2007 being sensitive to what values and norms of conduct the fmwr deemed appropriate as pointed out by leaptrott 2005 the rbdas would strive to respect the collection of hydrological and meteorological data also the fmwr is the supervisory body of the rbdas as amplified by scott 1991 and applicable to the rbdas pressure by means of authority would meet with less resistance and had a high level of compliance and stability besides this on the part of the fmwr and the rbdas as emphasised by scott 1995 organisational practices that receive positive external support are likely to be promoted and retained than those lacking such support thus it is safe to hold that hydrological and meteorological data collection was internalised taken for granted as the proper way to function because doing so enabled the rbdas to gain legitimacy as well as obtain resources and support from the fmwr also the rbdas have right from the inception focussed on the design and construction of dams and irrigation schemes akinkoye 1997 benin river basin and rural development authority brbrda 1984 b orbda 2012 o orbda 1978 1982 2011a these activities have exclusively profited from data related to surface water resources this may explain why the rbdas had separately established some networks of hydrological and meteorological data gathering stations as reported by abdulmumin 1998 therefore borrowing from zucker 1987 those practices that is hydrological and meteorological data collection in the case of the selected rbdas that contributed to organisational performance were likely to be promoted and tend to persist over time and with the absence of government interrogating the rbdas or the public protesting against the selected case rbdas for not collecting hydrogeological water use socio economic and environmental data or these rbdas being sanctioned by the professional bodies the implementation of hydrological and meteorological data collection became routines defined by scott 2014 as deeply rooted habitualised activities once certain organisational activities become habitualised the ability to make changes can be difficult leaptrott 2005 this explains why there was no division responsible for the collection of hydrogeological water use socio economic and environmental data in the selected case river basins unlike hydrological and meteorological data which were being handled by personnel in the engineering department o orbda 2011b supported by taken for grantedness and normative expectations and as time passes sustained by habitual actions both taken for grantedness and normative expectations are rules like capable of promoting repetitive behaviour and without being fully conscious of it shape action in organisations as with legal and regulative instruments so also taken for grantedness and normative expectations are institutional pressures capable of constraining actions and performance of organisations scott 1995 2014 judge et al 2008 therefore the underlying factor constraining the implementation of hydrogeological water use socio economic and environmental data collection in the selected river basins was institutional in summary inadequate financial resources constrained the full implementation of hydrological and meteorological data collection while taken for grantedness and normative pressures guided action and resisted change thereby constrained the implementation of hydrogeological water use socio economic and environmental data collection in the selected river basins although the effect of cognitive pressures may precede that of normative both which are less visible tend to overlap to constrain the implementation of hydrogeological water use socio economic and environmental data collection although difficult to identify the dominant pressure it seems they worked in combination inadequate financial resources from the federal government and normative prescriptions from the fmwr were pressures operating in the external environment of the selected rbdas while the effects of taken for grantedness were pressures operating in the internal environment in support of the adopted open systems perspective findings of this study have illustrated that the selected rbdas were permeated by pressures in their internal and external environments although the rbdas and the fmwr were within the same operational environment being organisations within the same field impression from this study indicates that the pressures operating in the external environment had a dominant influence on the internal environment than the other way around while the pressures operating in the internal environment are accessible to the selected rbdas to manipulate those within the external environment are beyond their ability to alter directly therefore the inability of the selected rbdas to fully implement data collection as provided by the rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 section 4 1 e was sanctioned by technical and institutional factors operating in their internal and external environments this finding supports kirby and sebastian 1998 regarding the importance of technical and institutional pressures in shaping organisational performance and that such pressures can be rooted in the internal and external environments hu et al 2007 fig 2 summarises the factors constraining the full implementation of data collection in the selected river basins in nigeria identified from an institutional theory perspective with inadequate implementation of data collection as illustrated in this study the possibility for a sustainable water resources planning development use and management aimed at informing and supporting practices and programmes intended for the realisation of target 6 1 of the sdgs is limited this weakness which the fmwr 2001 viewed as being responsible for the poor design operation and maintenance of dams and reservoir operations may eventually limit the possibility of the country meeting its 2030 drinking water target while it is likely that this situation is not limited to nigeria alone focussing on the kafue river basin in zambia uhlendahl et al 2011 found that there was a lack of reliable hydrological data to support water allocation decisions in the survey of the water sector in cameroon ako et al 2009 found that data related to quantity and quality of water resources were inadequate in the case of mozambique and zimbabwe gwp 2009 discovered poor availability of reliable data also in the 2017 annual progress review for south asia gwp 2018 found that there was a dearth of adequate data related to water resources although the constraining factors were hard to identify this inadequacy was seen to curb effective water resources development and management 4 identified policy gaps and possible interventions this study has revealed that the investigated rbdas only collected and collated data related to hydrological and meteorological table 3 since all the rbdas in nigeria work with uniform mandates and objectives and are subjected to same institutional frameworks the data collection situation in other river basins in nigeria may not differ largely from the selected rbdas being constituted and operated by the same legal and regulatory instruments the identified policy gaps and possible interventions will also remain relevant to other rbdas in nigeria this study have shown that although all the rbdas in nigeria were statutorily empowered to collect and collate data at the river basin level in the case of the selected river basins there was an absence of organisational templates upon which budgetary allocations to the various statutory functions of the rbdas could be based from the review of the annual reports this is vital because all the rbdas in nigeria have budget caps instead of resting on the rules of thumb or the discretions of the non technical staff responsible for budget preparation the template based on some established objective parameters which may be basin specific will need to indicate what percentage of the total would go to each of the statutory functions besides this and as applicable to the case river basins the statutory functions of the rbdas have not informed the crafting of the organogram of the rbdas the most recent effort aimed at altering the rbdas organogram or organisational arrangement in support of the partial commercialisation programme only focussed on how to make the rbdas an economic service provider rather than a social service provider o orbrda 1998 even at that data are still needed this should inform the need to restructure the rbdas and to indicate on the organogram which departments will be responsible for the collection of hydrogeological water use socio economic and environmental data for example when the issue of climate change became a hot topic in nigeria a climate change unit was created in 2010 formed part of the organisational structure of the rbdas and was included on the rbdas organogram as reflected under the office of the managing director b orbda 2012 fmwr 2012a while the rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 empowered and enabled all the rbdas to collect and collate data it lacked any enforcement mechanisms although the water resources act 1993 cap w2 lfn of 2004 empowered the minister responsible for water resources to formulate regulations to enforce the water laws section 19 there were no regulations in practice to enforce the collection and collation of data consistent with the argument of hodgson 2006 to support the implementation of legal and regulatory instruments enforcement is required lastly to redirect the attention of the selected rbdas and other rbdas with similar performance to hydrogeological water use socio economic and environmental data collection which is vital to informing and supporting action towards accomplishing nigeria s drinking water target as well as monitoring changes in the various aspects of water resources development supply and use shocks are needed to destabilise persistent practices the institutional theory literature persuasively argues that shocks can be introduced dacin et al 2002 for organisations established by statues legal and regulatory instruments can serve as a vital tool to disrupt persistent practices since all the rbdas in nigeria were established by same statue amendments to the legal instruments they comply with in practice on their functional mandates can serve as an important low cost vehicle to destabilise their persistent focus on hydrological and meteorological data collection to realise this will require the introduction of functional audit to serve as a shock although section 10 1 of the rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 has empowered all the rbdas to produce annual reports the main emphasis has been on audited financial accounts of the authority for the preceding financial year and of the auditor s report o orbda 2009 therefore in addition to financial audit there is a need for functional audit if this is made a statutory requirement it will help not only the selected rbdas but others interrogate itself and examine which of the statutory functions are being implemented which ones are not why and generate possible solutions 5 conclusions and recommendations for nigeria to meet its drinking water target in accordance with the sdgs as the population grows to 257 8 million by 2030 the collection of water resources water use socio economic and environmental data is very crucial drawing mainly on secondary sources of data from two river basins in nigeria the study found that the full implementation of data collection was constrained by technical and institutional factors both of which played an important but different roles the technical factors served as a major barrier to fully implement hydrological and meteorological data collection in the selected river basins notwithstanding this and to the neglect of others the collection of hydrological and meteorological data persisted and was sustained because it was taken for granted normatively sanctioned and backed by the rbdas supervisory body the fmwr with data collection not being fully implemented the ability of the investigated rbdas to institute practices and programmes needed to inform and support action towards the realisation of universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water identify conflict areas and vulnerabilities establish water priorities and resolve water conflicts track and evaluate changes in the various water resources development supply and use and understand appropriate solutions to apply is thin however in accordance with the provision of the rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 section 4 1 e the full implementation of data collection will assist each of the rbdas to develop a comprehensive water resources master plan at the river basin level which is at present still lacking but central to achieving target 6 1 of the sdgs therefore to meet nigeria s drinking water target rests on the shoulders of the rbdas and their ability to effectively collect and collate data in light of the finding of this study and with the rbdas being organisations established by statute the following policy measures are recommended which might help to improve the situation not only in the selected river basins but in nigeria more broadly a the amendment of the rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 to include provisions that suggest the use of templates for capital budgetary allocations to the various statutory functions of the rbdas this amendment can be included as part of the proceedings of the rbdas under the second schedule to the rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 b the provision of enforcement mechanisms which will serve to drive the rbdas to fully implement their data collection function section 4 1 e by amending the rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 and the water resources act 1993 cap w2 lfn of 2004 to reduce the transaction cost of enforcement such mechanisms should relate more to incentives than to sanctions the use of incentives will enjoy more cultural support thereby making enforcement less expensive to implement c the introduction of functional audit as an item that will form part of the annual reports of the rbdas by amending section 10 of the rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 d while it may be difficult for an individual or organisation in nigeria to influence the timing of budget approval or close the gap between capital budgetary allocation and actual release it is however possible to free the rbdas from the provisions of the finance control and management act cap 144 lfn of 1990 this will enable the rbdas including the case rbdas have access to unspent capital budgetary releases in the next budget year to realise this section 10 of the finance control and management act cap 144 lfn of 1990 associated circulars and policy instruments should be amended to exclude all the rbdas with case studies less suited to generalisation the finding and methodological approach of this study will help practitioners and researchers to ask questions about what is going on in other river basins in nigeria and elsewhere with a view to generating an increasing understanding of the factors constraining data collection at the river basin level an area that remains relatively under investigated lastly this study has not explicitly explored the contribution of the internally generated revenues igrs of the selected rbdas to the situation of data collection at least by law all the rbdas in nigeria are empowered to supply raw water from their completed storage schemes to all users for a fee section 4 1 c of the rbda act cap 396 lfn 1990 and neither have any legal and regulatory instruments governing the operations of the rbdas specified areas where the rbdas are to spend their igrs this therefore offers possibilities for future studies such an investigation using semi structure interviews and institutional theory as a lens should attempt to understand if the igrs are being committed to data collection implementation and why if not credit

8287,study region iberia algarve basin south portugal study focus this study evaluates the performance of several grace products in iberia using the closure of the water budget then it focusses on the algarve region and explores the potential of grace as a tool of quantitative groundwater monitoring capable of bridging gaps in the existing ground based network monthly data from grace ancillary datasets from e obs gleam grun and era5 and groundwater level measurements from 12 karst porous aquifers in the algarve basin 5000 km2 are analyzed from 2004 to 2014 new hydrological insights for the region when considering the closure of the water budget at the iberian scale grace mascon solutions perform remarkably well and better than the products based on spherical harmonics when considering only the algarve region the results are similar to the ones obtained for iberia but the grace solution that performs the best is the average of the csr and jpl mascon products in spite of the algarve s extremely small area when compared to the grace footprint the satellite is capable of capturing the regionally averaged seasonal and de seasonalized variations in observed groundwater storage correlation between grace derived and regionally averaged ground based measurements is 0 82 for the first time ever at the regional algarve scale bounds are placed on the aquifer s storage properties which vary from 3 65 10 3 to 4 92 10 2 keywords iberia algarve grace groundwater storativity 1 introduction the algarve is a semi arid region in the southwestern part of the iberia peninsula where water demand for irrigation purposes is heavily dependent on groundwater evidence of a drying trend in this region is compelling guerreiro et al 2017a calling for the need of better aquifer monitoring however the quality and continuity of the existing ground based monitoring network is at risk due to budget restriction in recent years the motivation behind this study is to improve monitoring through the use of remote sensing datasets which can mitigate problems in the spatial and temporal coverage of groundwater levels in this region bearing in mind the doubts regarding the validity of using coarse resolution satellite data at such a local scale the work begins by analyzing the performance of the various products at the scale of iberia fig 1 current knowledge of the global water cycle is increasingly dependent on the integration of conventional observations and remote datasets from satellite missions rodell et al 2015 the first experiment providing satellite based monitoring of groundwater changes at regional to global scales was the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace a joint mission between nasa and the german aerospace center primarily designed to provide measurements of the earth s gravity field tapley et al 2004 measurements of gravity carried out between 2002 and 2017 were based on the distance between two polar sun synchronous satellites separated 200 km apart equipped with microwave k band sensors accelerometers and global positioning system receivers the measurements added by other data as well as models provided a global coverage of gravity changes reflecting mass changes in the earth over land these changes in mass are mainly due to changes in total terrestrial water storage δtws an integrated measure of water storage that includes snow surface water soil moisture and groundwater over the past two decades grace derived data has been shown to match in situ measurements of groundwater levels in many large basins frappart and ramillien 2018 rodell et al 2004 strassberg et al 2007 yeh et al 2006 used to quantify the interannual variability of δtws at some of the largest aquifers in the world cao et al 2019 huang et al 2019 humphrey et al 2016 to estimate aquifer storage parameters bhanja et al 2018 sun et al 2010 and to evaluate groundwater storage anomalies related to natural and anthropogenic forcing asoka et al 2017 rodell et al 2018 solander et al 2017 the processing chain of grace data involves a large number of corrections and uncertainties that introduce errors and impose restrictions on its use swenson and wahr 2006 one of the most important errors is the signal leakage between neighboring grid cells caused by the truncation of spherical harmonics and gaussian filtering landerer and swenson 2012 for hydrological investigations it is commonly referred that the catchment size should not be less than the spatial resolution of the grace products 200 000 km2 for mascon and 300 000 km2 for rl05 solutions vishwakarma et al 2018 however several studies showed that catchments smaller than this could be well observed by grace despite the resolution limitations becker et al 2010 ouma et al 2015 wang et al 2011 for example biancamaria et al 2019 showed good agreement between δtws and hydrological models in the garonne river basin in south west france 50 000 km2 drainage area liesch and ohmer 2016 showed it was possible to estimate groundwater depletion from grace data in jordan over basins ranging from 1500 to 18 000 km2 hachborn et al 2017 determined that grace is sufficiently sensitive to obtain a meaningful groundwater storage signal in southern ontario 45 000 km2 area and rahimzadegan and entezari 2019 showed that grace derived estimation of groundwater level changes can be used at local scale in iran with an acceptable accuracy areas ranging from 5 000 20 000 km2 a major factor contributing to these recent successful applications is the progress in the processing algorithms of grace data namely the development of global equal area mascon products with reduced leakage errors across land ocean boundaries and better signal to noise ratios which makes them more suitable for regional applications wiese et al 2016 however these regional applications of grace data have to be evaluated against ground station measurements and this is the main objective of the present study the algarve is characterized by a warm mediterranean climate with a dry summer nearly 5 month long and low average annual rainfall groundwater in the region is vital to sustain agriculture and has been used as a backup system against temporary water shortages from immemorial time in 2001 the emplacement of a public district water supply system based on dams enabled the shift from groundwater to surface water irrigation however operational problems and recent dramatic droughts 2004 2006 2016 2017 pointed to the necessity of a mixed source supply system using both surface and groundwater hugman et al 2017 stigter et al 2006 today groundwater constitutes 88 of the water used in agriculture which in turn accounts for 60 of the total water demand in the region in the context of climate change the algarve faces a major water resource management challenge this is one of the regions in europe where climate projections for 2041 2070 forecast the highest indexes of drought frequency and drought severity under all emissions scenarios guerreiro et al 2017b spinoni et al 2018 in order to mitigate future water crisis there is an urgent need to maintain and improve the monitoring of groundwater resources in the area to our knowledge this is the first study exploring the potential of grace to monitor groundwater storage changes in this part of the world iberia and portugal in particular the paper is structured in three parts 1 the first is an assessment of different grace products using a water budget analysis based on precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff obtained from public databases and re analysis datasets the aim is to determine which grace solution provides the best closure of the water budget first in iberia and then in the algarve 2 the second examines the match between grace derived groundwater storage and in situ groundwater level measurements obtained from a set of 51 piezometers distributed across 12 aquifers in the algarve we apply a robust optimization method for estimating aquifer storage parameters similar to the proposed by sun et al 2010 to obtain estimates of the storativity or specific yield distribution in the region the optimization problem is formulated to explicitly account for uncertainty in remotely sensed and in situ data by incorporating bounds on data variations 3 finally groundwater time series are decomposed into trends seasonal and residual components this decomposition is of interest from the point of view of water resource management since knowledge of water storage fluctuations is essential to establish relationships between water scarcity climate forcing and human intervention 2 data 2 1 study area mountain ranges in the iberian peninsula predominantly running from west to east have influenced the river network and the spatial configuration of the major river basins fig 1 the topography and large weather circulation patterns generate a strong gradient in precipitation which decreases from north to south as a result river basins in the northern sector of the peninsula have abundant yields while rivers in the southern sector have only modest mean annual streamflows the guadiana river which defines the border between portugal and spain in southwestern iberia is the only major river at the edge of the algarve and presents an annual streamflow of less than 4000 hm3 year the remaining rivers and streams in the algarve have torrential character and there are no natural lakes the areal extent of surface water held by dams is less than 1 4 of the of the total area occupied by aquifers snirh 2020 and thus surface water represents a very small fraction of the total available freshwater resources in the region in terms of geology the algarve basin 130 40 km is an e w oriented sedimentary depocenter it overlays a paleozoic basement mainly composed of schists and greywackes cross cut by hercynian nnw sse to nw se and ene wsw faults which exerted a significant tectonic control during sediment deposition ribeiro et al 1979 the basin is composed of more than 3000 m of essentially marine sediments accumulated during mesozoic and cenozoic times manuppella 1992 according to the geometry and permeability of the deposited lithologies 17 aquifer systems were defined with predominantly karstic and porous detrital hydro stratigraphic units almeida et al 2000 this study focusses on 12 of these aquifers selected for their piezometric coverage fig 1 and table 1 the mesozoic sequence is essentially comprised of limestones dolomites and marls of jurassic age that outcrop in the northernmost part of the study area locally known as barrocal fig 1 this region is characterized by gentle hills and rocky soils covered by mediterranean vegetation and traditional crops such as olive almond fig and carob trees the jurassic and lower cretaceous carbonate lithologies promoted the development of highly permeable karst formations that support some of the most important aquifers in the algarve such as the querença silves m5 the karstic depressions covered by silts and clays are nowadays mainly occupied by citrus orchards and vineyards thanks to the widespread use of groundwater irrigation nevertheless the irrigated area represents only around 4 of the total hydrographic basin being estimated that 24 of the irrigation water returns to the groundwater reservoirs apa 2016 to the south the barrocal gives way to the coastal algarve a flattened region whose altitude does not generally exceed a few hundred meters this region is largely covered by cenozoic rocks namely sandstones and bioclastic limestones from the miocene as well as plio quaternary sands and gravels which are widespread distributed along the coast fig 1 a detailed description of all aquifers in continental portugal is provided by almeida et al 2000 most aquifers in the algarve region are multi layer mixed karst porous systems with the exceptions of m2 m5 m8 m13 classified as karst and m17 classified as porous table 1 the jurassic dolomites and limestones as well as the miocene carbonates constitute the main water bearing formations in the majority of them like karst aquifers in general they show highly heterogeneous hydraulic properties this is mainly due to spatial variations in the density and connectivity of the fracture network but is also controlled by variations in aquifer thickness depth and lateral extent sands and gravels of plio quaternary age often support shallow unconfined aquifer sections that are directly recharged by precipitation the climate in the algarve region is temperate with hot and dry summers mediterranean of type csa in the classification of köppen geiger the monthly average temperature ranges between 12 and 24 c and the total annual rainfall is about 500 mm year 1981 2010 climate normal ipma 2020 on average about 42 of the annual precipitation falls during the 3 month winter season miranda et al 2002 due to the orography the precipitation decreases substantially from north to south with coastal areas receiving on average less 70 of precipitation than the hilly northern areas the very low recharge rates in the paleozoic metamorphic rocks to the north of the study area 10 or less of the precipitation force the generation of flash floods during precipitation episodes that is transformed in allogenic recharge when the limits of the more permeable lithologies of the algarve sedimentary basin are intercepted to the south 2 2 in situ groundwater levels the portuguese national system for water resources maintains a nationwide groundwater level monitoring network and provides monthly time series of measurements through its site snirh 2020 in the algarve the observation network comprises 139 piezometers distributed among 17 aquifer systems but not all piezometers have been operating continuously and some present evidence of sensor calibration problems or other lack of appropriate quality control therefore a selection of 51 piezometer locations distributed over 12 aquifers fig 1 was performed based primarily on the completeness and consistency of the time series and secondly on a distributed geographic location sampling as many aquifers as possible preprocessing steps such as searching for outliers and interpolation for estimating missing values were carried out for all piezometric records before analysis initial screening detected some records containing inconsistent seasonal patterns that reveal the influence of human activity these records were kept on purpose to check their departures from regional averages the groundwater level data has a monthly frequency and spans the period from january 2004 to december 2014 2 3 grace water storage anomalies several solutions for grace total water storage monthly anomalies deviations from the mean denoted as δtws are available from different processing centers university of texas center for space research csr german research center for geosciences gfz jet propulsion laboratory jpl among others all released versions have processing chains involving corrections for gravity variations caused by atmospheric effects ocean tides and glacial isostatic adjustment in this study we use five solutions falling into two main categories of grace datasets 1 the grctellus land rl05 release of grace data from jpl csr and gfz available at https grace jpl nasa gov data get data monthly mass grids land and 2 the mascon mass concentration blocks solutions from csr rl06 available at http www2 csr utexas edu grace and from jpl rl06 available at https grace jpl nasa gov data get data jpl global mascons the rl05 solutions from gfz csr and jpl are released in grid form available at 1 1 resolution they are derived from monthly spherical harmonic sh coefficients post processed for truncation de stripping and spatial smoothing through the application of 300 km radius gaussian filters landerer and swenson 2012 swenson and wahr 2006 for land hydrological applications the monthly mass grids need to be multiplied by grids of scaling coefficients which are gain factors based on numerical land hydrology models the processing centers supply grids with thescaling coefficient and grids with estimates of total δtws error resulting from a combination of measurement and signal leakage errors landerer and swenson 2012 the mascon solutions are an improved version of grace products with reduced leakage errors at ocean continent boundaries which are more appropriate to regional studies especially in coastal regions the csr mascon is based on spherical harmonic coefficients and is available at native 1 x 1 resolution although it is released at 0 25 save et al 2018 2016 relative to previous csr solutions the rl06 mascon uses a newly defined grid which better split tiles along the coastline to minimize the leakage between land and ocean signals since this product does not use empirical de striping or filtering there is no need to apply any additional scaling factors to this solution the jpl mascon rl06 uses an alternative form of gravity field basis functions with a priori constraints in space and time to minimize the effect of measurement errors watkins et al 2015 wiese et al 2016 despite provided with a spatial sampling of 0 5 in both latitude and longitude the jpl mascon grid has a native resolution of 3 x 3 in size fig 1 shows the extent of the jpl mascon grid cell used to study the algarve region we apply a set of optional gain factors for continental hydrology applications derived from the clm hydrology model which are designed to study mass change signals at sub mascon resolution these land grid scaling factors as well as the scaled uncertainty estimates associated to each mascon are also provided within the same data directory as the mascon data as grid cells along coastlines such as the one in fig 1 contain mixed land and ocean signals we use the cri filtered version of the mascon solution this version of the data employs a coastline resolution improvement cri filter in a post processing step to separate the land and ocean portions of mass within each land ocean mascon the joint effect of the cri filter and gain factors has been shown to reduce leakage errors when determining the mass balance of large hydrological basins of up to 30 with local improvements ranging from 38 to 81 wiese et al 2016 for visualization purposes fig 2 displays an example of a snapshot at one particular month january 2016 of the five grace solutions in iberia as provided by the processing centers after application of the scaling factors the solutions represent total water storage anomalies expressed in units of equivalent water height in cm the image highlights differences in the pixel resolution and the much better discrimination of land and ocean regions in the mascon products at the top in comparison with the solutions based on truncated spherical harmonics at the bottom since water budgets are based on land variables described in the next section we use a wet dry mask grid computed using the shoreline database of the generic mapping tools wessel et al 2019 to isolate the land part of the grace products over iberia spatial averages also known as zonal means over the masked grids produce the grace iberia time series displayed in fig 3 time series corresponding to spatial averages over the algarve region are obtained in the same way but are limited to the region between 7 8 w of longitude and 37 38 n of latitude grace algarve all time series represent anomalies in total water storage relative to the 2004 2014 time mean baseline 2 4 ancillary data public available estimates of precipitation evapotranspiration runoff and soil moisture are used for two purposes 1 provide alternative independent estimates of the total water balanceused for grace validation over iberia and the algarve and 2 provide estimates of the different components of the water cycle needed for the disaggregation of δtws in the algarve a flowchart showing the main datasets and processing steps is shown in fig 4 the balance between precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff constitutes the simplest estimate of the water budget or net flux of water between the atmosphere and the earth s surface monthly precipitation data with a spatial resolution of 0 1 is extracted from the e obs gridded dataset v20 0e which is based on ground station observations this dataset is currently maintained and provided by the european climate assessment dataset project https www ecad eu monthly grids of evapotranspiration and volumetric soil moisture are obtained from the third version of the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam v3 at 0 25 spatial resolution https www gleam eu gleam is a set of algorithms dedicated to the estimation of terrestrial evaporation and root zone soil moisture from satellite data martens et al 2017 it uses the priestley and taylor equation to calculate potential evaporation based on observations of surface net radiation and near surface air temperature as well as combination of satellite ground station and reanalysis input data other estimates of soil moisture such as the provided by the earthh2observed project https www earth2observe eu were also tested but gave essentially the same results as the gleam estimates runoff data was extracted from grun an observation based gridded global reconstruction of monthly runoff timeseries ghiggi et al 2019 the dataset corresponds to the ensemble mean of 50 reconstructions obtained from a machine learning model with different subsets of data and is provided at 0 5 spatial resolution from 1902 to 2014 aiming at checking the hydrological consistency between different products the basin scale water budget is also computed using the era 5 reanalysis data available from the copernicus climate change service c3s climate data store https cds climate copernicus eu the variables extracted from the era 5 land global grids are the precipitation evaporation and runoff with monthly frequency and spatial resolution of 0 1 3 methodology 3 1 assessment of grace products closure of the water budget time variations in total water storage tws t are computed from the monthly scaled grace time series using a central difference formula 1 t w s t δ t w s t 1 δ t w s t 1 2 where t represents a given month at a regional scale these variations are related to discharge runoff q precipitation p and evapotranspiration e via the water budget equation 2 t w s t q p e 3 2 validation of grace derived groundwater storage variations in the algarve groundwater storage changes derived from grace are typically computed by subtracting the other components of the water budget from δtws rodell and famiglietti 1999 in semi arid environments with negligible surface water components and no snow the changes in total water storage measured by grace can simply be partitioned into changes in groundwater storage δgws and changes in soil moisture δsm so that the water budget equation becomes 3 δ g w s δ t w s δ s m in order to compare δgws derived from grace with in situ observations it is necessary to convert groundwater levels measurements into groundwater storage changes a common way of making this conversion is to use the equation bhanja et al 2018 hachborn et al 2017 nanteza et al 2016 sun et al 2010 swenson et al 2006 4 δ g w s o b s s δ h where s is the storativity dimensionless and δh are the changes in hydraulic head observed in situ this equation derives from the relation v w s a δ h between the volume of water v w drained from an aquifer with overlying surface area a and the average decline in head δ h eq 3 35 from fetter 2001 in a confined aquifer the storativity is the product of the specific storage s s and the aquifer thickness b one dimensional approximation 5 s s s b 6 s s ρ w g α n β where ρ w is the water density g is the acceleration of gravity α is the compressibility of the mineral aquifer skeleton n is the porosity and β is the compressibility of the water in a confined aquifer when the head falls the water released comes from the entire thickness of the aquifer and is accounted for by the compressibility of the mineral skeleton and the compressibility of the pore water the value of the storativity of confined aquifers ranges from 5 10 3 to 5 10 5 freeze and cherry 1979 in an unconfined aquifer the storativity is fetter 2001 7 s s y s s b where in addition to the water expelled or stored in connection to the specific storage and saturated thickness we have also to consider the specific yield s y the specific yield represents the volume of water that a rock will yield by gravity drainage it is defined as the ratio of the volume of water that drains from the pore spaces owing to the attraction of gravity to the total rock volume the value of s y is several orders of magnitude greater than s s b for an unconfined aquifer and therefore in this case the storativity is usually taken to be equal to the specific yield the usual range for s y is 0 01 0 30 freeze and cherry 1979 in the present case study where the aquifer systems are mainly carbonate karst aquifers sometimes covered and alternating with porous detritic hydrostratigraphic units the flow domains present transitional characteristics varying between unconfined confined and semi confined systems therefore we expect to have transitional storativity values varying between those of typical confined and unconfined aquifers it is not possible to simply solve eq 4 because s is unknown in the majority of the aquifers considered in this study in addition the relative contribution of soil moisture to the total water variations is uncertain and that uncertainty needs to be taken into account to solve the problem this study uses a robust optimization method similar to the proposed by sun et al 2010 to infer aquifer storage parameters from a set of linear equations 8 s j δ h j δ t w s k j δ s m where j represents each individual in situ observation δhj is the change in hydraulic head relative to the 2004 2014 average at each piezometer and kj is a local weighting factor for soil moisture that can be considered proportional to the local soil layer thickness the two unknowns in this equation sj and kj are determined at an individual piezometer basis using the generalized reduced gradient grg algorithm which is an extension of the reduced gradient method designed to accommodate inequality constraints the lower and upper bounds on the storativity were set to 1 10 9 and 0 3 respectively the weighting factor k j is set as an unconstrained non negative variable first the objective function eq 8 is rewritten to match the form f s j k j 0 then the solver looks at the gradient or slope of the objective function as the input values or decision variables change and decides that it reached an optimum solution when the partial derivatives equal zero we implement the grg solver in excel solver add in using the multistart option which creates a randomly distributed population of initial values that are each evaluated using the traditional grg algorithm by starting multiple times from different initial conditions this option increases the chance of finding a solution that is a global rather than a local minimum the method is applied repeatedly at each individual observation that is for each j finally after finding the best s at each location the ability of grace to monitor groundwater storage is evaluated by comparing the in situ δgwsobs from eq 4 with the grace derived δgws from eq 3 using the spatial average of the error provided by the grace processing centers measurement and leakage errors we estimate a regional δtws error of 2 15 cm in the algarve region the δsm error is estimated to be 2 66 cm corresponding to the upper bound of the standard deviation of the spatial average of soil moisture the error in grace derived δgws is computed by propagating δtws and δsm errors following rodell and famiglietti 2002 and is on average 3 4 cm 3 3 groundwater storage in the algarve trends and seasonality the hodrick prescott hp filter is a data decomposition technique applied in time series analysis to reveal long term trends and isolate short term fluctuations hodrick and prescott 1997 the method offers advantages over linear regression analysis when nonlinear trends are present and has been successfully applied in grace related studies over the past few years bhanja et al 2018 2016 sun 2013 in order to separate the trend component of a time series the hp filter minimizes the objective function 9 t 1 m y t y t 2 λ t 2 m 2 y t 1 y t y t y t 1 2 where y t is a time series y t is the trend term computed using time steps of t t 1 and t 1 and λ is a smoothing parameter recommended to be equal to 129 600 for monthly frequency data ravn and uhlig 2002 once the trend is determined the cyclical seasonal components are computed as deviations from the trend y t y t the hp filter is applied to the average groundwater storage computed as the mean of the in situ observations over the entire algarve region according to 10 δ g w s 1 ˆ j n w j s j δ h j w i t h w j 1 n where n is the total number of piezometers and s j δ h j come from eq 8 this hypothesis acknowledges the heterogeneity inside each aquifer and gives equal weight w j to every piezometer alternatively we also computed the average groundwater storage considering the aggregated contributions from each aquifer e g hachborn et al 2017 sun et al 2010 11 δ g w s 2 ˆ 1 12 w i s i δ h i w i t h w i a i a where s i is the median value of the storativity at each aquifer δ h i is the mean observed groundwater level anomaly and w i is the aquifer s weight considered proportional to the ratio between the aquifer s area a i and the total area a of the 12 aquifers in the studied region following the application of the hp filter the annual cycle monthly climatology is removed from the seasonal component to obtain a de seasonalized residual groundwater level time series the association between the observed and grace derived seasonal and de seasonalized components is quantified using the pearson s coefficient of correlation rp the association between trends is found to be non linear which prevents the use of pearson s correlation coefficient 4 results 4 1 closure of the water budget over iberia and the algarve the performance of the different grace products is assessed using the water budget equation eq 2 and the ancillary datasets fig 5 a shows some of these ancillary datasets averaged over iberia namely p extracted from e obs e from gleam and q from grun expressed as anomalies in cm month relative to the 2004 2014 time mean baseline the analysis of their relative magnitude shows that precipitation and evapotranspiration are the main components of the iberian water budget contributing to 63 2 and 32 3 of the total water changes respectively while runoff accounts for only 4 5 of the variance the two independent estimates of p e q based on the above and on the re analysis product era5 are consistent fig 5b and produce nearly identical fits to the time variations of the grace data fig 5c time variations of the csr m grace mascon solution computed according to eq 1 show good agreement to the water budget with a pearson s coefficient of about 0 8 and a time lag of maximum correlation of 1 month fig 5c similar time evolution patterns and relationships among components of the water budget are obtained when considering the averages over just the algarve region time series not shown at this more local scale precipitation and evapotranspiration contribute to 65 and 35 of the total water change and runoff contributes to less than 0 5 of the total variance thus in semi arid regions without major rivers or lakes such as the algarve surface waters are often considered negligible taylor diagrams summarize best the strength of the statistical association between time series using the pearson correlation coefficient the root mean square error rmse and the standard deviation they are useful to compare the skill of different models or datasets and have been computed to compare grace and p e q estimates at both the regional scale of iberia and the more local scale of the algarve fig 6 the grace solution that agrees best with the water budget p e q will lie the closest to the observation point on the x axis all diagrams show that the rl05 solutions from gfz csr and jpl are the poorer performing since they present the largest rmse fig 6 although all products perform better at the iberian scale as expected the mascon products have actually good scores in the algarve not differing much from the scores obtained at the iberian scale these results gave us the necessary confidence to proceed with the evaluation of the grace products as a tool of quantitative groundwater monitoring in the algarve presented in the next sections in iberia the best mascon solution is the csr m since it shows the smallest rmse the better correlation with p e q and the best standard deviation fig 6 in the algarve the csr m and the jpl m mascon solutions are similar in terms of correlation coefficient but one of them csr mascon underestimates the variability in amplitude of the observations standard deviation of about 5 cm while the other jpl mascon overestimates it the best fit to the water budget closure in the algarve region is thus provided by an average of the grace mascon products arithmetic mean of csr m and jpl m this result is independent of the ancillary datasets since the results for era5 are almost identical to the results for e obs gleam and grun other studies have also shown that averaging grace products can be advantageous since it reduces random uncorrelated errors resulting from individual solutions cao et al 2019 xiao et al 2015 4 2 comparison between grace and in situ groundwater data in the algarve this section is focused in the algarve region where groundwater level data collected from 51 piezometers is compared to the grace mascon average solution fig 7 a shows the relative magnitudes of δtws and δsm converted into units of equivalent water height cm the weighting factors calculated through the robust optimization fitting constrain the soil moisture variability to be limited to the upper 30 cm of the soil column at most locations 1 m is the upper bound attained at just few locations therefore changes in soil moisture are estimated to contribute to only a small fraction up to 16 but only 2 on average of the total water storage changes in the algarve the comparison between the in situ groundwater storage and the satellite based estimate δtws δsm is displayed in fig 7b the two forms of spatial averaging considered in this study using eq 10 and using eq 11 produce almost identical time series of regionally averaged in situ groundwater storage δ g w s 1 ˆ and δ g w s 2 ˆ the reason for this is that the number of piezometers per aquifer is roughly proportional to the aquifer s area the grace derived and in situ data portray consistent variations and have a correlation coefficient of 0 82 fig 7b the main deviations between grace and the in situ observations occur after 2012 and are attributed to gaps in the satellite time series thus in order to extend the satellite lifespan and save battery the grace satellite has been switched off periodically for 4 5 weeks every 5 6 months since 2011 landerer and swenson 2012 excluding this exceptional period grace can monitor the basin integrated change of groundwater storage in the algarve with good accuracy the storativity computed from the robust fitting method is displayed in fig 8 aggregated per aquifer the median s ranges from 3 65 10 3 to 4 92 10 2 showing large variability within the same aquifer inter aquifer variability for s is high as also shown by coefficients of interquartile variation ranging from 63 in m10 s joao da venda quelfes to over 79 in m17 montegordo as well as by wide ranges with s estimates in some aquifer systems attaining the maximum programmed ranges i e 1 10 9 to 0 3 table 2 such variability may be explained by the fact that aquifer systems are mostly constituted by overlaying unconfined and confined aquifers with varying and in many cases still unknown degrees of connectivity and independence in consequence the median sy values show nonsignificant differences between aquifer systems kruskal wallis chi squared 11 393 29 dunn post hoc test p 0 05 see supplementary material for the purpose of studying the relationship between grace signal and that of the aquifer systems this variability should be considered as a property of the system which nonetheless still allows good agreements between grace estimated values and field estimates as shown in table 2 taken together the regionally averaged storativity for the algarve aquifers is 2 4 10 2 4 3 trends and seasonality of groundwater storage changes considering the results of the previous section it can be argued that the good correlation found between satellite and in situ groundwater storage anomalies is just due to the seasonal and annual cycles in order to exclude this hypothesis the total signals are decomposed into trends seasonal and residual patterns and the correlations re computed for each component the results are only shown for the grace derived and in situ δ g w s 1 ˆ time series fig 9 since δ g w s 2 ˆ would lead to equivalent conclusions trends obtained with the hp filter are non linear and slightly positive over the period of study fig 9a grace overestimates the positive tendency and is found not suitable to examine the trend of groundwater storage in the algarve especially after 2012 the seasonal components on the other hand show very good matches having a correlation coefficient of 0 85 fig 9b the anomalies are typically positive in winter spring and negative in summer autumn and range from 10 to 10 cm fig 9c shows the de seasonalized signals which expose periodicities larger than 12 months these components are useful to detect exceptionally wet and dry periods lasting for more than one hydrological year the major droughts that affected the iberian peninsula in 2004 2006 and 2011 2012 can be clearly identified as well as the anomalously wet years of 2010 and 2011 the regional impact of these extreme events is evident in both the ground based δ g w s 1 ˆ and grace estimates in addition the degree of association between the de seasonalized grace and in situ time series rp 0 82 in fig 9c demonstrates that the good match described in the previous section is not just due to the seasonal and annual variations overall grace performs well in capturing the multi year deficits and surplus of groundwater storage in the algarve basin the observed multi year deficits and low frequency cycles are related to low frequency oscillations in the amount of precipitation which in turn are associated to climate patterns such as the north atlantic oscillation and the east atlantic pattern neves et al 2019 the results also show a time lag of about 1 2 months between grace and the average of the in situ measurements fig 9b however the delays of the in situ observations relative to the satellite data reflect the local hydrogeological properties at the piezometric locations such as transmissivity and depth to the water table and are not a regional uniform feature sites dominated by porous or fractured rocks and shallow water tables have a fast response to heavy rainfall events for instance in winter 2010 and are more likely to be well synchronized with grace in the study area the aquifers that most visibly belong to this category are m16 and m17 supplementary data in the opposite extreme the aquifers having the largest damping of high frequencies and greater lags relative to grace are m5 m6 and m7 another advantage of comparing residual components fig 9c is the detection of possible anthropogenic activity the negative peak in groundwater storage observed during 2005 is probably related to drought induced abstraction in that period 2004 2006 drought all existing dams in the algarve were almost depleted and restrictions on water use were imposed for all economic sectors with exceptional measures being taken to avoid the total disruption of the public water system when the public water supply could not be ensured by surface waters emergency boreholes were made and the old boreholes were reactivated nunes et al 2006 unfortunately there is still no proper data on groundwater pumping as most boreholes are privately owned and keep no abstraction records climate induced pumping contributing to fast resource depletion at an integrated basin scale can be easily detected using comparisons with grace applying the same methodology at an individual aquifer level may be useful to detect sharp local deviations from the regional average for example the most outstanding examples of negative deviations in summer 2005 occur in aquifers m13 and m15 supplementary data note that for individual aquifers similar conclusions can be drawn if in situ averages such as δ g w s 1 ˆ rather than grace are considered as the regional reference they will be harder to compute and not as readily available as the satellite data though table 3 shows the pearson s correlation coefficients computed between grace and in situ total seasonal and residual components at individual aquifers in the form of a heat map it provides a direct overview of which aquifers are the ones where grace has the greatest potential for being used as a complementary tool of groundwater storage monitoring aquifer m4 stands out as the aquifer whose fluctuations are best captured by the satellite in the time span of this study 5 discussion and future perspectives 5 1 errors and limitations due to grace resolution the suitability of grace to represent large scale freshwater variations has been demonstrated around the world rodell et al 2018 tapley et al 2019 however at regional scales the use of grace satellite data for monitoring aquifers is questionable requiring a case by case validation e g becker et al 2010 biancamaria et al 2019 hachborn et al 2017 rahimzadegan and entezari 2019 grace data close to its spatial resolution limit 200 km for mascon products is known to suffer from low signal to noise ratio and from leakage errors across neighboring regions ancillary data employed by processing centers to invert δtws such as outputs from glacial isostatic adjustment atmosphere ocean and land models have their own source of uncertainties which also increase with increasing resolution another source of error when considering grace data are the gaps resulting from the periodic satellite shutdowns to save battery life especially after 2012 landerer and swenson 2012 at the scale of iberia and also algarve some mismatch between time variations in δtws and net fluxes of precipitation evaporation and runoff via the water budget equation can also be due to errors not only in grace but also in the ancillary datasets themselves era5 grun e obs gleam an application of grace to monitor groundwater storage changes at the scale of iberia is out of the scope of this study acknowledging the large degree of uncertainty associated to grace at small scales we tested the use of grace in the algarve not as an alternative but as a complementary tool to the in situ existing network this study demonstrates the feasibility of using grace as a fast and relatively reliable form of estimating regionally integrated changes in groundwater storage in the algarve despite its extremely small area when compared to the grace footprint the correlation between in situ and satellite data in the algarve with pearson s correlation coefficient of 0 82 is comparable to values reported in the literature for example 0 58 in the high plains aquifer strassberg et al 2007 0 6 in east africa nanteza et al 2016 0 71 in southwest china huang et al 2019 ranging from 0 33 to 0 91 over the major river basins in india bhanja et al 2016 and from 0 55 to 0 74 in jordan liesch and ohmer 2016 three factors may explain the good match obtained at this small scale 1 the good performance of mascon products regarding the separation of land and ocean signals at this particular location 2 the fact that aquifers in the algarve are isolated far from other neighboring water masses and the only significant water reservoirs in the area and 3 the fact that the extent of the algarve region coincides with the extent of the grace jpl mascon pixel over land fig 1 5 2 future perspectives when computing the net balance of groundwater storage in the algarve region integral of the in situ observed groundwater anomalies it is found that the net values are negative for the majority of the aquifers and that the average loss in the algarve region is 4 cm of equivalent water thickness this generalized depletion is not evident when analyzing only the trends thus the net effect of the seasonal variations is what contributes the most to the groundwater storage decrease observed between 2004 and 2014 the time span of this study is too short to conclude whether this is a persistent feature although climate model projections for this region leave no doubt about an existing drying tendency spinoni et al 2018 model projections for iberia are also alarming showing an intensification of drought conditions for the main iberian international basins with multi year droughts reaching a drought severity index dsi 12 of up to 800 i e 8 years of mean annual rainfall missing and an average of 80 of basin areas experiencing extreme drought by the end of the century guerreiro et al 2017b given the disturbing observations of declining groundwater storage throughout the world grace may add value to hydrological investigations in areas where there is a significant fraction of groundwater abstraction döll et al 2014 several studies in different parts of the globe present evidence of groundwater depletion based on grace satellite data for instance in southeast australia leblanc et al 2009 india rodell et al 2009 and california central valley scanlon et al 2012 groundwater over abstraction in periods of drought is one of the factors that most contributes to the long term depletion of aquifers with an increasing frequency and duration of meteorological droughts expected for iberia and the algarve in the coming years spinoni et al 2018 it becomes urgent to find and adjust ways of identifying the onset of groundwater droughts in 2011 nasa started distributing operational wetness drought indicators for shallow groundwater and soil moisture based on the assimilation of grace into a land surface model houborg et al 2012 more recently other groundwater drought indices have been proposed based on grace anomalies which can detect and monitor droughts resulting from either natural or anthropogenic variations li and rodell 2015 thomas et al 2017 grace based indices have the advantage of providing basin integrated estimates and of overcoming the lack of in situ observations in space or in time however these indices have to be validated locally because sometimes they are found to be not suitable van loon et al 2017 although studies like this have not yet been conducted in iberia the present work provides an optimistic outlook for the use of such indices in the region monitoring the onset of groundwater drought using all available data sources is vital to achieve an adaptable planning of water management capable of mitigating the negative impacts of drought 6 conclusions data from ground station observations e obs grun land surface models gleam and atmospheric reanalysis era5 indicate that the main components of the water budget in iberia algarve are precipitation and evapotranspiration contributing to approximately 63 65 and 32 35 respectively of the total water storage changes among the 5 grace products tested in this study the one that produces the best fit to the closure of the water budget in iberia is the csr mascon and in the algarve is the average of the csr and jpl mascon solutions release rl06 it is concluded that grace provides a consistent representation of the hydrological cycle and thus can be used as an aid in monitoring climate related water mass transports in both iberia and the algarve grace data in the algarve has large uncertainties due the small size of the study area the lack of field measurements of soil moisture and of aquifer storage properties adds extra uncertainties in the validation of the grace derived groundwater changes nonetheless the robust optimization method used in this study provides some bounding constraints on the above factors and produces realistic results consistent with the existing field measurements it is estimated that soil moisture contributes to only a small fraction between 2 and 16 of the total water storage variations the storativity parameters of the aquifers in turn are bounded to range between 3 65 10 3 and 4 92 10 2 with a median value of 2 4 10 2 the inferred storage properties show great spatial variability even within the same aquifer in agreement to the great heterogeneity inherent to the multilayer and karst characteristics of most aquifers in the algarve groundwater is the main responsible for total water storage anomalies captured by grace in the algarve the association between satellite derived and in situ data is good correlation coefficient of 0 82 even after removing the trend seasonal and annual cyclic components we conclude that grace is effectively capable of capturing the regionally integrated groundwater storage changes in the algarve with good accuracy being also able to capture the multi year deficits and surplus resulting from the natural fluctuations driven by climate grace is therefore recommended as a complementary and diagnostic source of hydrologic data in iberia and in particular

8287,study region iberia algarve basin south portugal study focus this study evaluates the performance of several grace products in iberia using the closure of the water budget then it focusses on the algarve region and explores the potential of grace as a tool of quantitative groundwater monitoring capable of bridging gaps in the existing ground based network monthly data from grace ancillary datasets from e obs gleam grun and era5 and groundwater level measurements from 12 karst porous aquifers in the algarve basin 5000 km2 are analyzed from 2004 to 2014 new hydrological insights for the region when considering the closure of the water budget at the iberian scale grace mascon solutions perform remarkably well and better than the products based on spherical harmonics when considering only the algarve region the results are similar to the ones obtained for iberia but the grace solution that performs the best is the average of the csr and jpl mascon products in spite of the algarve s extremely small area when compared to the grace footprint the satellite is capable of capturing the regionally averaged seasonal and de seasonalized variations in observed groundwater storage correlation between grace derived and regionally averaged ground based measurements is 0 82 for the first time ever at the regional algarve scale bounds are placed on the aquifer s storage properties which vary from 3 65 10 3 to 4 92 10 2 keywords iberia algarve grace groundwater storativity 1 introduction the algarve is a semi arid region in the southwestern part of the iberia peninsula where water demand for irrigation purposes is heavily dependent on groundwater evidence of a drying trend in this region is compelling guerreiro et al 2017a calling for the need of better aquifer monitoring however the quality and continuity of the existing ground based monitoring network is at risk due to budget restriction in recent years the motivation behind this study is to improve monitoring through the use of remote sensing datasets which can mitigate problems in the spatial and temporal coverage of groundwater levels in this region bearing in mind the doubts regarding the validity of using coarse resolution satellite data at such a local scale the work begins by analyzing the performance of the various products at the scale of iberia fig 1 current knowledge of the global water cycle is increasingly dependent on the integration of conventional observations and remote datasets from satellite missions rodell et al 2015 the first experiment providing satellite based monitoring of groundwater changes at regional to global scales was the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace a joint mission between nasa and the german aerospace center primarily designed to provide measurements of the earth s gravity field tapley et al 2004 measurements of gravity carried out between 2002 and 2017 were based on the distance between two polar sun synchronous satellites separated 200 km apart equipped with microwave k band sensors accelerometers and global positioning system receivers the measurements added by other data as well as models provided a global coverage of gravity changes reflecting mass changes in the earth over land these changes in mass are mainly due to changes in total terrestrial water storage δtws an integrated measure of water storage that includes snow surface water soil moisture and groundwater over the past two decades grace derived data has been shown to match in situ measurements of groundwater levels in many large basins frappart and ramillien 2018 rodell et al 2004 strassberg et al 2007 yeh et al 2006 used to quantify the interannual variability of δtws at some of the largest aquifers in the world cao et al 2019 huang et al 2019 humphrey et al 2016 to estimate aquifer storage parameters bhanja et al 2018 sun et al 2010 and to evaluate groundwater storage anomalies related to natural and anthropogenic forcing asoka et al 2017 rodell et al 2018 solander et al 2017 the processing chain of grace data involves a large number of corrections and uncertainties that introduce errors and impose restrictions on its use swenson and wahr 2006 one of the most important errors is the signal leakage between neighboring grid cells caused by the truncation of spherical harmonics and gaussian filtering landerer and swenson 2012 for hydrological investigations it is commonly referred that the catchment size should not be less than the spatial resolution of the grace products 200 000 km2 for mascon and 300 000 km2 for rl05 solutions vishwakarma et al 2018 however several studies showed that catchments smaller than this could be well observed by grace despite the resolution limitations becker et al 2010 ouma et al 2015 wang et al 2011 for example biancamaria et al 2019 showed good agreement between δtws and hydrological models in the garonne river basin in south west france 50 000 km2 drainage area liesch and ohmer 2016 showed it was possible to estimate groundwater depletion from grace data in jordan over basins ranging from 1500 to 18 000 km2 hachborn et al 2017 determined that grace is sufficiently sensitive to obtain a meaningful groundwater storage signal in southern ontario 45 000 km2 area and rahimzadegan and entezari 2019 showed that grace derived estimation of groundwater level changes can be used at local scale in iran with an acceptable accuracy areas ranging from 5 000 20 000 km2 a major factor contributing to these recent successful applications is the progress in the processing algorithms of grace data namely the development of global equal area mascon products with reduced leakage errors across land ocean boundaries and better signal to noise ratios which makes them more suitable for regional applications wiese et al 2016 however these regional applications of grace data have to be evaluated against ground station measurements and this is the main objective of the present study the algarve is characterized by a warm mediterranean climate with a dry summer nearly 5 month long and low average annual rainfall groundwater in the region is vital to sustain agriculture and has been used as a backup system against temporary water shortages from immemorial time in 2001 the emplacement of a public district water supply system based on dams enabled the shift from groundwater to surface water irrigation however operational problems and recent dramatic droughts 2004 2006 2016 2017 pointed to the necessity of a mixed source supply system using both surface and groundwater hugman et al 2017 stigter et al 2006 today groundwater constitutes 88 of the water used in agriculture which in turn accounts for 60 of the total water demand in the region in the context of climate change the algarve faces a major water resource management challenge this is one of the regions in europe where climate projections for 2041 2070 forecast the highest indexes of drought frequency and drought severity under all emissions scenarios guerreiro et al 2017b spinoni et al 2018 in order to mitigate future water crisis there is an urgent need to maintain and improve the monitoring of groundwater resources in the area to our knowledge this is the first study exploring the potential of grace to monitor groundwater storage changes in this part of the world iberia and portugal in particular the paper is structured in three parts 1 the first is an assessment of different grace products using a water budget analysis based on precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff obtained from public databases and re analysis datasets the aim is to determine which grace solution provides the best closure of the water budget first in iberia and then in the algarve 2 the second examines the match between grace derived groundwater storage and in situ groundwater level measurements obtained from a set of 51 piezometers distributed across 12 aquifers in the algarve we apply a robust optimization method for estimating aquifer storage parameters similar to the proposed by sun et al 2010 to obtain estimates of the storativity or specific yield distribution in the region the optimization problem is formulated to explicitly account for uncertainty in remotely sensed and in situ data by incorporating bounds on data variations 3 finally groundwater time series are decomposed into trends seasonal and residual components this decomposition is of interest from the point of view of water resource management since knowledge of water storage fluctuations is essential to establish relationships between water scarcity climate forcing and human intervention 2 data 2 1 study area mountain ranges in the iberian peninsula predominantly running from west to east have influenced the river network and the spatial configuration of the major river basins fig 1 the topography and large weather circulation patterns generate a strong gradient in precipitation which decreases from north to south as a result river basins in the northern sector of the peninsula have abundant yields while rivers in the southern sector have only modest mean annual streamflows the guadiana river which defines the border between portugal and spain in southwestern iberia is the only major river at the edge of the algarve and presents an annual streamflow of less than 4000 hm3 year the remaining rivers and streams in the algarve have torrential character and there are no natural lakes the areal extent of surface water held by dams is less than 1 4 of the of the total area occupied by aquifers snirh 2020 and thus surface water represents a very small fraction of the total available freshwater resources in the region in terms of geology the algarve basin 130 40 km is an e w oriented sedimentary depocenter it overlays a paleozoic basement mainly composed of schists and greywackes cross cut by hercynian nnw sse to nw se and ene wsw faults which exerted a significant tectonic control during sediment deposition ribeiro et al 1979 the basin is composed of more than 3000 m of essentially marine sediments accumulated during mesozoic and cenozoic times manuppella 1992 according to the geometry and permeability of the deposited lithologies 17 aquifer systems were defined with predominantly karstic and porous detrital hydro stratigraphic units almeida et al 2000 this study focusses on 12 of these aquifers selected for their piezometric coverage fig 1 and table 1 the mesozoic sequence is essentially comprised of limestones dolomites and marls of jurassic age that outcrop in the northernmost part of the study area locally known as barrocal fig 1 this region is characterized by gentle hills and rocky soils covered by mediterranean vegetation and traditional crops such as olive almond fig and carob trees the jurassic and lower cretaceous carbonate lithologies promoted the development of highly permeable karst formations that support some of the most important aquifers in the algarve such as the querença silves m5 the karstic depressions covered by silts and clays are nowadays mainly occupied by citrus orchards and vineyards thanks to the widespread use of groundwater irrigation nevertheless the irrigated area represents only around 4 of the total hydrographic basin being estimated that 24 of the irrigation water returns to the groundwater reservoirs apa 2016 to the south the barrocal gives way to the coastal algarve a flattened region whose altitude does not generally exceed a few hundred meters this region is largely covered by cenozoic rocks namely sandstones and bioclastic limestones from the miocene as well as plio quaternary sands and gravels which are widespread distributed along the coast fig 1 a detailed description of all aquifers in continental portugal is provided by almeida et al 2000 most aquifers in the algarve region are multi layer mixed karst porous systems with the exceptions of m2 m5 m8 m13 classified as karst and m17 classified as porous table 1 the jurassic dolomites and limestones as well as the miocene carbonates constitute the main water bearing formations in the majority of them like karst aquifers in general they show highly heterogeneous hydraulic properties this is mainly due to spatial variations in the density and connectivity of the fracture network but is also controlled by variations in aquifer thickness depth and lateral extent sands and gravels of plio quaternary age often support shallow unconfined aquifer sections that are directly recharged by precipitation the climate in the algarve region is temperate with hot and dry summers mediterranean of type csa in the classification of köppen geiger the monthly average temperature ranges between 12 and 24 c and the total annual rainfall is about 500 mm year 1981 2010 climate normal ipma 2020 on average about 42 of the annual precipitation falls during the 3 month winter season miranda et al 2002 due to the orography the precipitation decreases substantially from north to south with coastal areas receiving on average less 70 of precipitation than the hilly northern areas the very low recharge rates in the paleozoic metamorphic rocks to the north of the study area 10 or less of the precipitation force the generation of flash floods during precipitation episodes that is transformed in allogenic recharge when the limits of the more permeable lithologies of the algarve sedimentary basin are intercepted to the south 2 2 in situ groundwater levels the portuguese national system for water resources maintains a nationwide groundwater level monitoring network and provides monthly time series of measurements through its site snirh 2020 in the algarve the observation network comprises 139 piezometers distributed among 17 aquifer systems but not all piezometers have been operating continuously and some present evidence of sensor calibration problems or other lack of appropriate quality control therefore a selection of 51 piezometer locations distributed over 12 aquifers fig 1 was performed based primarily on the completeness and consistency of the time series and secondly on a distributed geographic location sampling as many aquifers as possible preprocessing steps such as searching for outliers and interpolation for estimating missing values were carried out for all piezometric records before analysis initial screening detected some records containing inconsistent seasonal patterns that reveal the influence of human activity these records were kept on purpose to check their departures from regional averages the groundwater level data has a monthly frequency and spans the period from january 2004 to december 2014 2 3 grace water storage anomalies several solutions for grace total water storage monthly anomalies deviations from the mean denoted as δtws are available from different processing centers university of texas center for space research csr german research center for geosciences gfz jet propulsion laboratory jpl among others all released versions have processing chains involving corrections for gravity variations caused by atmospheric effects ocean tides and glacial isostatic adjustment in this study we use five solutions falling into two main categories of grace datasets 1 the grctellus land rl05 release of grace data from jpl csr and gfz available at https grace jpl nasa gov data get data monthly mass grids land and 2 the mascon mass concentration blocks solutions from csr rl06 available at http www2 csr utexas edu grace and from jpl rl06 available at https grace jpl nasa gov data get data jpl global mascons the rl05 solutions from gfz csr and jpl are released in grid form available at 1 1 resolution they are derived from monthly spherical harmonic sh coefficients post processed for truncation de stripping and spatial smoothing through the application of 300 km radius gaussian filters landerer and swenson 2012 swenson and wahr 2006 for land hydrological applications the monthly mass grids need to be multiplied by grids of scaling coefficients which are gain factors based on numerical land hydrology models the processing centers supply grids with thescaling coefficient and grids with estimates of total δtws error resulting from a combination of measurement and signal leakage errors landerer and swenson 2012 the mascon solutions are an improved version of grace products with reduced leakage errors at ocean continent boundaries which are more appropriate to regional studies especially in coastal regions the csr mascon is based on spherical harmonic coefficients and is available at native 1 x 1 resolution although it is released at 0 25 save et al 2018 2016 relative to previous csr solutions the rl06 mascon uses a newly defined grid which better split tiles along the coastline to minimize the leakage between land and ocean signals since this product does not use empirical de striping or filtering there is no need to apply any additional scaling factors to this solution the jpl mascon rl06 uses an alternative form of gravity field basis functions with a priori constraints in space and time to minimize the effect of measurement errors watkins et al 2015 wiese et al 2016 despite provided with a spatial sampling of 0 5 in both latitude and longitude the jpl mascon grid has a native resolution of 3 x 3 in size fig 1 shows the extent of the jpl mascon grid cell used to study the algarve region we apply a set of optional gain factors for continental hydrology applications derived from the clm hydrology model which are designed to study mass change signals at sub mascon resolution these land grid scaling factors as well as the scaled uncertainty estimates associated to each mascon are also provided within the same data directory as the mascon data as grid cells along coastlines such as the one in fig 1 contain mixed land and ocean signals we use the cri filtered version of the mascon solution this version of the data employs a coastline resolution improvement cri filter in a post processing step to separate the land and ocean portions of mass within each land ocean mascon the joint effect of the cri filter and gain factors has been shown to reduce leakage errors when determining the mass balance of large hydrological basins of up to 30 with local improvements ranging from 38 to 81 wiese et al 2016 for visualization purposes fig 2 displays an example of a snapshot at one particular month january 2016 of the five grace solutions in iberia as provided by the processing centers after application of the scaling factors the solutions represent total water storage anomalies expressed in units of equivalent water height in cm the image highlights differences in the pixel resolution and the much better discrimination of land and ocean regions in the mascon products at the top in comparison with the solutions based on truncated spherical harmonics at the bottom since water budgets are based on land variables described in the next section we use a wet dry mask grid computed using the shoreline database of the generic mapping tools wessel et al 2019 to isolate the land part of the grace products over iberia spatial averages also known as zonal means over the masked grids produce the grace iberia time series displayed in fig 3 time series corresponding to spatial averages over the algarve region are obtained in the same way but are limited to the region between 7 8 w of longitude and 37 38 n of latitude grace algarve all time series represent anomalies in total water storage relative to the 2004 2014 time mean baseline 2 4 ancillary data public available estimates of precipitation evapotranspiration runoff and soil moisture are used for two purposes 1 provide alternative independent estimates of the total water balanceused for grace validation over iberia and the algarve and 2 provide estimates of the different components of the water cycle needed for the disaggregation of δtws in the algarve a flowchart showing the main datasets and processing steps is shown in fig 4 the balance between precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff constitutes the simplest estimate of the water budget or net flux of water between the atmosphere and the earth s surface monthly precipitation data with a spatial resolution of 0 1 is extracted from the e obs gridded dataset v20 0e which is based on ground station observations this dataset is currently maintained and provided by the european climate assessment dataset project https www ecad eu monthly grids of evapotranspiration and volumetric soil moisture are obtained from the third version of the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam v3 at 0 25 spatial resolution https www gleam eu gleam is a set of algorithms dedicated to the estimation of terrestrial evaporation and root zone soil moisture from satellite data martens et al 2017 it uses the priestley and taylor equation to calculate potential evaporation based on observations of surface net radiation and near surface air temperature as well as combination of satellite ground station and reanalysis input data other estimates of soil moisture such as the provided by the earthh2observed project https www earth2observe eu were also tested but gave essentially the same results as the gleam estimates runoff data was extracted from grun an observation based gridded global reconstruction of monthly runoff timeseries ghiggi et al 2019 the dataset corresponds to the ensemble mean of 50 reconstructions obtained from a machine learning model with different subsets of data and is provided at 0 5 spatial resolution from 1902 to 2014 aiming at checking the hydrological consistency between different products the basin scale water budget is also computed using the era 5 reanalysis data available from the copernicus climate change service c3s climate data store https cds climate copernicus eu the variables extracted from the era 5 land global grids are the precipitation evaporation and runoff with monthly frequency and spatial resolution of 0 1 3 methodology 3 1 assessment of grace products closure of the water budget time variations in total water storage tws t are computed from the monthly scaled grace time series using a central difference formula 1 t w s t δ t w s t 1 δ t w s t 1 2 where t represents a given month at a regional scale these variations are related to discharge runoff q precipitation p and evapotranspiration e via the water budget equation 2 t w s t q p e 3 2 validation of grace derived groundwater storage variations in the algarve groundwater storage changes derived from grace are typically computed by subtracting the other components of the water budget from δtws rodell and famiglietti 1999 in semi arid environments with negligible surface water components and no snow the changes in total water storage measured by grace can simply be partitioned into changes in groundwater storage δgws and changes in soil moisture δsm so that the water budget equation becomes 3 δ g w s δ t w s δ s m in order to compare δgws derived from grace with in situ observations it is necessary to convert groundwater levels measurements into groundwater storage changes a common way of making this conversion is to use the equation bhanja et al 2018 hachborn et al 2017 nanteza et al 2016 sun et al 2010 swenson et al 2006 4 δ g w s o b s s δ h where s is the storativity dimensionless and δh are the changes in hydraulic head observed in situ this equation derives from the relation v w s a δ h between the volume of water v w drained from an aquifer with overlying surface area a and the average decline in head δ h eq 3 35 from fetter 2001 in a confined aquifer the storativity is the product of the specific storage s s and the aquifer thickness b one dimensional approximation 5 s s s b 6 s s ρ w g α n β where ρ w is the water density g is the acceleration of gravity α is the compressibility of the mineral aquifer skeleton n is the porosity and β is the compressibility of the water in a confined aquifer when the head falls the water released comes from the entire thickness of the aquifer and is accounted for by the compressibility of the mineral skeleton and the compressibility of the pore water the value of the storativity of confined aquifers ranges from 5 10 3 to 5 10 5 freeze and cherry 1979 in an unconfined aquifer the storativity is fetter 2001 7 s s y s s b where in addition to the water expelled or stored in connection to the specific storage and saturated thickness we have also to consider the specific yield s y the specific yield represents the volume of water that a rock will yield by gravity drainage it is defined as the ratio of the volume of water that drains from the pore spaces owing to the attraction of gravity to the total rock volume the value of s y is several orders of magnitude greater than s s b for an unconfined aquifer and therefore in this case the storativity is usually taken to be equal to the specific yield the usual range for s y is 0 01 0 30 freeze and cherry 1979 in the present case study where the aquifer systems are mainly carbonate karst aquifers sometimes covered and alternating with porous detritic hydrostratigraphic units the flow domains present transitional characteristics varying between unconfined confined and semi confined systems therefore we expect to have transitional storativity values varying between those of typical confined and unconfined aquifers it is not possible to simply solve eq 4 because s is unknown in the majority of the aquifers considered in this study in addition the relative contribution of soil moisture to the total water variations is uncertain and that uncertainty needs to be taken into account to solve the problem this study uses a robust optimization method similar to the proposed by sun et al 2010 to infer aquifer storage parameters from a set of linear equations 8 s j δ h j δ t w s k j δ s m where j represents each individual in situ observation δhj is the change in hydraulic head relative to the 2004 2014 average at each piezometer and kj is a local weighting factor for soil moisture that can be considered proportional to the local soil layer thickness the two unknowns in this equation sj and kj are determined at an individual piezometer basis using the generalized reduced gradient grg algorithm which is an extension of the reduced gradient method designed to accommodate inequality constraints the lower and upper bounds on the storativity were set to 1 10 9 and 0 3 respectively the weighting factor k j is set as an unconstrained non negative variable first the objective function eq 8 is rewritten to match the form f s j k j 0 then the solver looks at the gradient or slope of the objective function as the input values or decision variables change and decides that it reached an optimum solution when the partial derivatives equal zero we implement the grg solver in excel solver add in using the multistart option which creates a randomly distributed population of initial values that are each evaluated using the traditional grg algorithm by starting multiple times from different initial conditions this option increases the chance of finding a solution that is a global rather than a local minimum the method is applied repeatedly at each individual observation that is for each j finally after finding the best s at each location the ability of grace to monitor groundwater storage is evaluated by comparing the in situ δgwsobs from eq 4 with the grace derived δgws from eq 3 using the spatial average of the error provided by the grace processing centers measurement and leakage errors we estimate a regional δtws error of 2 15 cm in the algarve region the δsm error is estimated to be 2 66 cm corresponding to the upper bound of the standard deviation of the spatial average of soil moisture the error in grace derived δgws is computed by propagating δtws and δsm errors following rodell and famiglietti 2002 and is on average 3 4 cm 3 3 groundwater storage in the algarve trends and seasonality the hodrick prescott hp filter is a data decomposition technique applied in time series analysis to reveal long term trends and isolate short term fluctuations hodrick and prescott 1997 the method offers advantages over linear regression analysis when nonlinear trends are present and has been successfully applied in grace related studies over the past few years bhanja et al 2018 2016 sun 2013 in order to separate the trend component of a time series the hp filter minimizes the objective function 9 t 1 m y t y t 2 λ t 2 m 2 y t 1 y t y t y t 1 2 where y t is a time series y t is the trend term computed using time steps of t t 1 and t 1 and λ is a smoothing parameter recommended to be equal to 129 600 for monthly frequency data ravn and uhlig 2002 once the trend is determined the cyclical seasonal components are computed as deviations from the trend y t y t the hp filter is applied to the average groundwater storage computed as the mean of the in situ observations over the entire algarve region according to 10 δ g w s 1 ˆ j n w j s j δ h j w i t h w j 1 n where n is the total number of piezometers and s j δ h j come from eq 8 this hypothesis acknowledges the heterogeneity inside each aquifer and gives equal weight w j to every piezometer alternatively we also computed the average groundwater storage considering the aggregated contributions from each aquifer e g hachborn et al 2017 sun et al 2010 11 δ g w s 2 ˆ 1 12 w i s i δ h i w i t h w i a i a where s i is the median value of the storativity at each aquifer δ h i is the mean observed groundwater level anomaly and w i is the aquifer s weight considered proportional to the ratio between the aquifer s area a i and the total area a of the 12 aquifers in the studied region following the application of the hp filter the annual cycle monthly climatology is removed from the seasonal component to obtain a de seasonalized residual groundwater level time series the association between the observed and grace derived seasonal and de seasonalized components is quantified using the pearson s coefficient of correlation rp the association between trends is found to be non linear which prevents the use of pearson s correlation coefficient 4 results 4 1 closure of the water budget over iberia and the algarve the performance of the different grace products is assessed using the water budget equation eq 2 and the ancillary datasets fig 5 a shows some of these ancillary datasets averaged over iberia namely p extracted from e obs e from gleam and q from grun expressed as anomalies in cm month relative to the 2004 2014 time mean baseline the analysis of their relative magnitude shows that precipitation and evapotranspiration are the main components of the iberian water budget contributing to 63 2 and 32 3 of the total water changes respectively while runoff accounts for only 4 5 of the variance the two independent estimates of p e q based on the above and on the re analysis product era5 are consistent fig 5b and produce nearly identical fits to the time variations of the grace data fig 5c time variations of the csr m grace mascon solution computed according to eq 1 show good agreement to the water budget with a pearson s coefficient of about 0 8 and a time lag of maximum correlation of 1 month fig 5c similar time evolution patterns and relationships among components of the water budget are obtained when considering the averages over just the algarve region time series not shown at this more local scale precipitation and evapotranspiration contribute to 65 and 35 of the total water change and runoff contributes to less than 0 5 of the total variance thus in semi arid regions without major rivers or lakes such as the algarve surface waters are often considered negligible taylor diagrams summarize best the strength of the statistical association between time series using the pearson correlation coefficient the root mean square error rmse and the standard deviation they are useful to compare the skill of different models or datasets and have been computed to compare grace and p e q estimates at both the regional scale of iberia and the more local scale of the algarve fig 6 the grace solution that agrees best with the water budget p e q will lie the closest to the observation point on the x axis all diagrams show that the rl05 solutions from gfz csr and jpl are the poorer performing since they present the largest rmse fig 6 although all products perform better at the iberian scale as expected the mascon products have actually good scores in the algarve not differing much from the scores obtained at the iberian scale these results gave us the necessary confidence to proceed with the evaluation of the grace products as a tool of quantitative groundwater monitoring in the algarve presented in the next sections in iberia the best mascon solution is the csr m since it shows the smallest rmse the better correlation with p e q and the best standard deviation fig 6 in the algarve the csr m and the jpl m mascon solutions are similar in terms of correlation coefficient but one of them csr mascon underestimates the variability in amplitude of the observations standard deviation of about 5 cm while the other jpl mascon overestimates it the best fit to the water budget closure in the algarve region is thus provided by an average of the grace mascon products arithmetic mean of csr m and jpl m this result is independent of the ancillary datasets since the results for era5 are almost identical to the results for e obs gleam and grun other studies have also shown that averaging grace products can be advantageous since it reduces random uncorrelated errors resulting from individual solutions cao et al 2019 xiao et al 2015 4 2 comparison between grace and in situ groundwater data in the algarve this section is focused in the algarve region where groundwater level data collected from 51 piezometers is compared to the grace mascon average solution fig 7 a shows the relative magnitudes of δtws and δsm converted into units of equivalent water height cm the weighting factors calculated through the robust optimization fitting constrain the soil moisture variability to be limited to the upper 30 cm of the soil column at most locations 1 m is the upper bound attained at just few locations therefore changes in soil moisture are estimated to contribute to only a small fraction up to 16 but only 2 on average of the total water storage changes in the algarve the comparison between the in situ groundwater storage and the satellite based estimate δtws δsm is displayed in fig 7b the two forms of spatial averaging considered in this study using eq 10 and using eq 11 produce almost identical time series of regionally averaged in situ groundwater storage δ g w s 1 ˆ and δ g w s 2 ˆ the reason for this is that the number of piezometers per aquifer is roughly proportional to the aquifer s area the grace derived and in situ data portray consistent variations and have a correlation coefficient of 0 82 fig 7b the main deviations between grace and the in situ observations occur after 2012 and are attributed to gaps in the satellite time series thus in order to extend the satellite lifespan and save battery the grace satellite has been switched off periodically for 4 5 weeks every 5 6 months since 2011 landerer and swenson 2012 excluding this exceptional period grace can monitor the basin integrated change of groundwater storage in the algarve with good accuracy the storativity computed from the robust fitting method is displayed in fig 8 aggregated per aquifer the median s ranges from 3 65 10 3 to 4 92 10 2 showing large variability within the same aquifer inter aquifer variability for s is high as also shown by coefficients of interquartile variation ranging from 63 in m10 s joao da venda quelfes to over 79 in m17 montegordo as well as by wide ranges with s estimates in some aquifer systems attaining the maximum programmed ranges i e 1 10 9 to 0 3 table 2 such variability may be explained by the fact that aquifer systems are mostly constituted by overlaying unconfined and confined aquifers with varying and in many cases still unknown degrees of connectivity and independence in consequence the median sy values show nonsignificant differences between aquifer systems kruskal wallis chi squared 11 393 29 dunn post hoc test p 0 05 see supplementary material for the purpose of studying the relationship between grace signal and that of the aquifer systems this variability should be considered as a property of the system which nonetheless still allows good agreements between grace estimated values and field estimates as shown in table 2 taken together the regionally averaged storativity for the algarve aquifers is 2 4 10 2 4 3 trends and seasonality of groundwater storage changes considering the results of the previous section it can be argued that the good correlation found between satellite and in situ groundwater storage anomalies is just due to the seasonal and annual cycles in order to exclude this hypothesis the total signals are decomposed into trends seasonal and residual patterns and the correlations re computed for each component the results are only shown for the grace derived and in situ δ g w s 1 ˆ time series fig 9 since δ g w s 2 ˆ would lead to equivalent conclusions trends obtained with the hp filter are non linear and slightly positive over the period of study fig 9a grace overestimates the positive tendency and is found not suitable to examine the trend of groundwater storage in the algarve especially after 2012 the seasonal components on the other hand show very good matches having a correlation coefficient of 0 85 fig 9b the anomalies are typically positive in winter spring and negative in summer autumn and range from 10 to 10 cm fig 9c shows the de seasonalized signals which expose periodicities larger than 12 months these components are useful to detect exceptionally wet and dry periods lasting for more than one hydrological year the major droughts that affected the iberian peninsula in 2004 2006 and 2011 2012 can be clearly identified as well as the anomalously wet years of 2010 and 2011 the regional impact of these extreme events is evident in both the ground based δ g w s 1 ˆ and grace estimates in addition the degree of association between the de seasonalized grace and in situ time series rp 0 82 in fig 9c demonstrates that the good match described in the previous section is not just due to the seasonal and annual variations overall grace performs well in capturing the multi year deficits and surplus of groundwater storage in the algarve basin the observed multi year deficits and low frequency cycles are related to low frequency oscillations in the amount of precipitation which in turn are associated to climate patterns such as the north atlantic oscillation and the east atlantic pattern neves et al 2019 the results also show a time lag of about 1 2 months between grace and the average of the in situ measurements fig 9b however the delays of the in situ observations relative to the satellite data reflect the local hydrogeological properties at the piezometric locations such as transmissivity and depth to the water table and are not a regional uniform feature sites dominated by porous or fractured rocks and shallow water tables have a fast response to heavy rainfall events for instance in winter 2010 and are more likely to be well synchronized with grace in the study area the aquifers that most visibly belong to this category are m16 and m17 supplementary data in the opposite extreme the aquifers having the largest damping of high frequencies and greater lags relative to grace are m5 m6 and m7 another advantage of comparing residual components fig 9c is the detection of possible anthropogenic activity the negative peak in groundwater storage observed during 2005 is probably related to drought induced abstraction in that period 2004 2006 drought all existing dams in the algarve were almost depleted and restrictions on water use were imposed for all economic sectors with exceptional measures being taken to avoid the total disruption of the public water system when the public water supply could not be ensured by surface waters emergency boreholes were made and the old boreholes were reactivated nunes et al 2006 unfortunately there is still no proper data on groundwater pumping as most boreholes are privately owned and keep no abstraction records climate induced pumping contributing to fast resource depletion at an integrated basin scale can be easily detected using comparisons with grace applying the same methodology at an individual aquifer level may be useful to detect sharp local deviations from the regional average for example the most outstanding examples of negative deviations in summer 2005 occur in aquifers m13 and m15 supplementary data note that for individual aquifers similar conclusions can be drawn if in situ averages such as δ g w s 1 ˆ rather than grace are considered as the regional reference they will be harder to compute and not as readily available as the satellite data though table 3 shows the pearson s correlation coefficients computed between grace and in situ total seasonal and residual components at individual aquifers in the form of a heat map it provides a direct overview of which aquifers are the ones where grace has the greatest potential for being used as a complementary tool of groundwater storage monitoring aquifer m4 stands out as the aquifer whose fluctuations are best captured by the satellite in the time span of this study 5 discussion and future perspectives 5 1 errors and limitations due to grace resolution the suitability of grace to represent large scale freshwater variations has been demonstrated around the world rodell et al 2018 tapley et al 2019 however at regional scales the use of grace satellite data for monitoring aquifers is questionable requiring a case by case validation e g becker et al 2010 biancamaria et al 2019 hachborn et al 2017 rahimzadegan and entezari 2019 grace data close to its spatial resolution limit 200 km for mascon products is known to suffer from low signal to noise ratio and from leakage errors across neighboring regions ancillary data employed by processing centers to invert δtws such as outputs from glacial isostatic adjustment atmosphere ocean and land models have their own source of uncertainties which also increase with increasing resolution another source of error when considering grace data are the gaps resulting from the periodic satellite shutdowns to save battery life especially after 2012 landerer and swenson 2012 at the scale of iberia and also algarve some mismatch between time variations in δtws and net fluxes of precipitation evaporation and runoff via the water budget equation can also be due to errors not only in grace but also in the ancillary datasets themselves era5 grun e obs gleam an application of grace to monitor groundwater storage changes at the scale of iberia is out of the scope of this study acknowledging the large degree of uncertainty associated to grace at small scales we tested the use of grace in the algarve not as an alternative but as a complementary tool to the in situ existing network this study demonstrates the feasibility of using grace as a fast and relatively reliable form of estimating regionally integrated changes in groundwater storage in the algarve despite its extremely small area when compared to the grace footprint the correlation between in situ and satellite data in the algarve with pearson s correlation coefficient of 0 82 is comparable to values reported in the literature for example 0 58 in the high plains aquifer strassberg et al 2007 0 6 in east africa nanteza et al 2016 0 71 in southwest china huang et al 2019 ranging from 0 33 to 0 91 over the major river basins in india bhanja et al 2016 and from 0 55 to 0 74 in jordan liesch and ohmer 2016 three factors may explain the good match obtained at this small scale 1 the good performance of mascon products regarding the separation of land and ocean signals at this particular location 2 the fact that aquifers in the algarve are isolated far from other neighboring water masses and the only significant water reservoirs in the area and 3 the fact that the extent of the algarve region coincides with the extent of the grace jpl mascon pixel over land fig 1 5 2 future perspectives when computing the net balance of groundwater storage in the algarve region integral of the in situ observed groundwater anomalies it is found that the net values are negative for the majority of the aquifers and that the average loss in the algarve region is 4 cm of equivalent water thickness this generalized depletion is not evident when analyzing only the trends thus the net effect of the seasonal variations is what contributes the most to the groundwater storage decrease observed between 2004 and 2014 the time span of this study is too short to conclude whether this is a persistent feature although climate model projections for this region leave no doubt about an existing drying tendency spinoni et al 2018 model projections for iberia are also alarming showing an intensification of drought conditions for the main iberian international basins with multi year droughts reaching a drought severity index dsi 12 of up to 800 i e 8 years of mean annual rainfall missing and an average of 80 of basin areas experiencing extreme drought by the end of the century guerreiro et al 2017b given the disturbing observations of declining groundwater storage throughout the world grace may add value to hydrological investigations in areas where there is a significant fraction of groundwater abstraction döll et al 2014 several studies in different parts of the globe present evidence of groundwater depletion based on grace satellite data for instance in southeast australia leblanc et al 2009 india rodell et al 2009 and california central valley scanlon et al 2012 groundwater over abstraction in periods of drought is one of the factors that most contributes to the long term depletion of aquifers with an increasing frequency and duration of meteorological droughts expected for iberia and the algarve in the coming years spinoni et al 2018 it becomes urgent to find and adjust ways of identifying the onset of groundwater droughts in 2011 nasa started distributing operational wetness drought indicators for shallow groundwater and soil moisture based on the assimilation of grace into a land surface model houborg et al 2012 more recently other groundwater drought indices have been proposed based on grace anomalies which can detect and monitor droughts resulting from either natural or anthropogenic variations li and rodell 2015 thomas et al 2017 grace based indices have the advantage of providing basin integrated estimates and of overcoming the lack of in situ observations in space or in time however these indices have to be validated locally because sometimes they are found to be not suitable van loon et al 2017 although studies like this have not yet been conducted in iberia the present work provides an optimistic outlook for the use of such indices in the region monitoring the onset of groundwater drought using all available data sources is vital to achieve an adaptable planning of water management capable of mitigating the negative impacts of drought 6 conclusions data from ground station observations e obs grun land surface models gleam and atmospheric reanalysis era5 indicate that the main components of the water budget in iberia algarve are precipitation and evapotranspiration contributing to approximately 63 65 and 32 35 respectively of the total water storage changes among the 5 grace products tested in this study the one that produces the best fit to the closure of the water budget in iberia is the csr mascon and in the algarve is the average of the csr and jpl mascon solutions release rl06 it is concluded that grace provides a consistent representation of the hydrological cycle and thus can be used as an aid in monitoring climate related water mass transports in both iberia and the algarve grace data in the algarve has large uncertainties due the small size of the study area the lack of field measurements of soil moisture and of aquifer storage properties adds extra uncertainties in the validation of the grace derived groundwater changes nonetheless the robust optimization method used in this study provides some bounding constraints on the above factors and produces realistic results consistent with the existing field measurements it is estimated that soil moisture contributes to only a small fraction between 2 and 16 of the total water storage variations the storativity parameters of the aquifers in turn are bounded to range between 3 65 10 3 and 4 92 10 2 with a median value of 2 4 10 2 the inferred storage properties show great spatial variability even within the same aquifer in agreement to the great heterogeneity inherent to the multilayer and karst characteristics of most aquifers in the algarve groundwater is the main responsible for total water storage anomalies captured by grace in the algarve the association between satellite derived and in situ data is good correlation coefficient of 0 82 even after removing the trend seasonal and annual cyclic components we conclude that grace is effectively capable of capturing the regionally integrated groundwater storage changes in the algarve with good accuracy being also able to capture the multi year deficits and surplus resulting from the natural fluctuations driven by climate grace is therefore recommended as a complementary and diagnostic source of hydrologic data in iberia and in particular

8288,study region the greater new orleans in southeastern louisiana usa study focus flooding is a major threat to new orleans due to its geographic location and geologic condition however potential groundwater flooding is seldom studied and poorly understood this study investigated potential groundwater flooding and seepage induced hazards to levees in new orleans high fidelity stratigraphy and groundwater models were developed to investigate groundwater dynamics and identify areas prone to groundwater flooding and low levee factor of safety new hydrological insights for the region the stratigraphy model showed that 74 of shallow sediments in new orleans are fine grains and noticeable amounts of coarse sediments connect to surface waters the groundwater model showed that shallow sands such as beach sands and point bar sands have strong hydraulic connections with lakes canals and mississippi river groundwater flow simulation in 2018 found that 40 of new orleans metropolitan area may have groundwater level above ground surface all year round low lying areas with relatively permeable surficial sediments and high groundwater head in shallow sands are concerned about potential groundwater flooding the simulation results also indicated that levees in these areas have high probabilities of low factors of safety not only did the model prediction agree well to the previous levee assessments for the hurricane katrina disaster but it also indicated additional areas with potential levee safety issues keywords groundwater flooding modeling seepage levee new orleans 1 introduction flooding along coastlines of the united states becomes more frequent since 1950s especially in the gulf coast noaa 2014 factors that cause flooding in coastal cities include heavy rainfall storms surges sea level rise levee overtopping levee breach inadequate drainage poor land management and subsidence adelekan 2010 bhat et al 2013 rosenzweig et al 2011 hydrological models are tools to help identify coastal flooding issues arising from poor drainage designs rain et al 2011 storm surges yin et al 2011 and intensive rainfall with high tides zope et al 2015 although rainfall and surface water are major contributors to flooding during hurricanes or storm events flood induced high groundwater level can also cause flooding garcía gil et al 2015 but is seldom discussed in the literature groundwater flooding refers to the emergence of groundwater on land surface due to the rise of groundwater level in permeable strata although rarely causing loss of life groundwater flooding usually lasts longer than fluvial flooding because of slow response to surface water recedence morris et al 2018 a groundwater flooding incidence was reported in illinois usa that resulted in a 100 year groundwater flooding risk map visocky 1995 groundwater flooding in southwest wisconsin usa was caused by significant recharge from intense precipitation to aquifers gotkowitz et al 2014 following the devastating flood from a chalk aquifer in england uk hughes et al 2011 interests in groundwater flooding studies increase in europe ascott et al 2017 upton and jackson 2011 high groundwater level coincided with heavy rainfall was considered as a trigger to groundwater flooding from chalk aquifers adams et al 2010 finch et al 2004 there are three types of groundwater flooding caused by different mechanisms macdonald et al 2008 the first type of groundwater flooding is caused by rising water table above land surface in response to extreme rainfall events this type of groundwater flooding is often extensive and long lasting the second type of groundwater flooding is caused by high water in rivers or lakes that well connect to shallow unconsolidated sedimentary aquifers with limited storage capacity e g underlain by relatively impermeable deposits the third type of groundwater flooding is caused by reduction of groundwater abstraction that allows depressed water table to recover and thus can cause inundation of subsurface infrastructures groundwater flooding in coastal areas could occur mainly due to recharge by surrounding surface water the second type of groundwater flooding macdonald et al 2012 assessed risks of groundwater flooding and concluded that groundwater flooding is prone to low lying areas where groundwater level has strong response to surrounding surface water stage and rainfall which is a typical hydrogeological condition in coastal areas groundwater flooding was predicted using monitored groundwater level data macdonald et al 2012 and groundwater flooding extent was measured by aerial photography finch et al 2004 moreover a groundwater potentiometric map and a digital elevation model dem were used to analyze occurrence of groundwater flooding in a regional scale hoover et al 2017 high groundwater level can also produce excessive pore water pressure under levees and elevate geohazard risks such as piping and sand boils which can impact stability of levee foundations usace 1956 levee underseepage analysis is important to evaluate potentials of these geohazards such analyses were conducted along inner harbor navigation canal ihnc london avenue canal and the 17th street canal in new orleans after hurricane katrina to explore levee failure mechanisms ipet 2006 seed et al 2008b c d stark et al 2014 the objective of this study is to investigate groundwater dynamics in the new orleans metropolitan area and its impacts on flooding and seepage induced levee safety analyses in this study focused on the year 2018 when no hurricanes or storm events occurred for assessments in a normal climatic condition to authors knowledge this study is the first effort to understand impacts of shallow groundwater dynamics in new orleans on a large scale in this study a shallow new orleans stratigraphy model was constructed with a large amount of well logs then a groundwater model was built using modflow usg panday et al 2017 on the basis of the stratigraphy model due to limited groundwater data sensitivity analysis was performed to identify significant parameters for model calibration parameter uncertainties were incorporated in results of groundwater dynamics groundwater flooding and levee factor of safety in new orleans the correlation between the modeling results and previous levee underseepage studies in new orleans was discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area nola new orleans metropolitan area new orleans or nola in the southeastern louisiana usa has a population of approximately 1 2 million which makes it the 46th largest city in the country the city is known for flooding problems due to more than 50 of the city below sea level relatively high mississippi river and lake pontchartrain water stages poor natural drainage poor geological settings land subsidence and constant threats from tropical storms and hurricanes dixon et al 2006 griffis 2007 specifically land development by reclaiming marshlands adjacent to lake pontchartrain dunbar and britsch 2008 caused pronounced land subsidence and formed an interior basin snowden et al 1980 fifteen 15 percent of new orleans was reported to be 3 m or more below mean sea level in 2006 ilit 2006 the overwhelming lake water stages during hurricane katrina in 2005 resulted in several levee breaches and over 70 percent of new orleans flooded ilit 2006 after hurricane katrina flood protection systems including levees and surge barriers along mississippi river lakes canals and waterways along with canal locks and pumping systems were constructed improved and enhanced in order to prevent new orleans from flooding the study area covers the entire new orleans metropolitan area fig 1 including 4 parishes the study area is bounded by lake pontchartrain to the north lake borgne and a part of mississippi river to the east lake salvador and barataria water route to the south and duncan canal to the west major waterways such as inner harbor navigation canal ihnc gulf intracoastal waterway giww and mississippi river gulf outlet mrgo and canals such as the 17th street canal and london avenue canal are in the east bank of mississippi river harvey canal and intracoastal waterway icw are in the west bank 2 1 1 hydrogeology of new orleans previous studies have revealed complex geological settings in new orleans over half of new orleans is covered by swamps and marshes consisting of clay and organic matters that usually have low strength depending on water content ilit 2006 the pleistocene deposits are generally overlain by holocene fills with thickness ranging between 55 and 80 feet in new orleans dunbar and britsch 2008 high natural levees consisting of clay silt and silty sand were formed along the current course of mississippi river usace 1956 the buried pine island beach sand fig 1 stretched along the southern shore of lake pontchartrain was formed approximately 3500 years saucier 1963 point bars with downward graded grain size from silty sand to clean sand along parts of the mississippi river are buried by fine grained materials kolb et al 1975 metairie gentilly ridges and bayou des families ridge fig 1 were sediment fills of old mississippi river channel during the formation of st bernard delta frazier 1967 the u s geological survey usgs classifies four principal aquifers from shallow to deep depths gramercy norco gonzales new orleans and 1200 foot sand aquifers dial and tomaszewski 1988 fine grain aquitards with thickness varying from a few feet to approximately 200 feet separate each aquifer dial and tomaszewski 1988 in addition to the four aquifers localized shallow aquifers water bearing units consisting of point bar sands distributary channel deposits and isolated sand beds exist near land surface shallow aquifers occur in a thick clay layer overlying gramercy aquifer that distributes in the depth between 100 and 300 feet without continuity in new orleans dial and tomaszewski 1988 industries pump groundwater from gonzales new orleans aquifer which is the most continuous sand layer containing fresh water eddards et al 1956 dial and tomaszewski 1988 developed a three dimensional groundwater model to evaluate the impact of pumping on saltwater intrusion in gonzales new orleans aquifer a four layer groundwater model was also developed by dial and sumner 1989 to evaluate the capacity of each principle aquifer to supply the needs of new orleans 2 1 2 groundwater monitoring most piezometers in the study area are used to monitor groundwater head at deep confined aquifers such as gonzales new orleans aquifer piezometers in shallow aquifers of new orleans are quite limited 34 piezometers shown in fig 1 in shallow aquifers identified by the louisiana department of natural resources ldnr were owned by industries however no groundwater data are available from industrial piezometers only four usgs piezometers noted as observation wells in fig 1 along mississippi river have available groundwater data recorded in 1957 1962 2 1 3 surface water monitoring the locations of stream gages in the study area are shown in fig 1 which includes five stream gages along the mississippi river four stream gages for ihnc and giww one stream gage for lake pontchartrain one stream gage for harvey canal two stream gages for intracoastal waterway and two stream gages for lake borgne stream data after 1986 are available from the u s army corps of engineers usace website http rivergages mvr usace army mil the hydrograph of each stream gage in 2018 fig 2 was collected for groundwater model development fig 2a illustrates that mississippi river stage at three gages in new orleans varied from 0 5 m to 5 m in 2018 the hydrographs cover a flood season of the river from february to july the difference of the river stage between the upstream and downstream gages during the 2018 flood season was as high as 1 m the peak river stage in the flood season lasted for 19 days in march fig 2a according to a digital elevation model dem in new orleans love et al 2010 the elevation of artificial levees along mississippi river is up to 8 4 m referenced to the north american vertical datum of 1988 navd 88 the mississippi river levee height at the gage 01300 is 6 6 m which is about 1 6 m higher than the peak water stage in 2018 the bonnet carré spillway about 20 km upstream to the western model boundary was partially opened for 28 days starting march 8 to reduce mississippi river water level in new orleans fig 2b and c show that water stages of ihnc giww and lake pontchartrain lake borgne have similar patterns indicting propagation of lake water into the industrial canal the water stages at these gages range between 0 3 m and 1 2 m the levee height along ihnc giww varies from 3 4 m to 4 7 m love et al 2010 indicating at least 2 2 m higher than the peak stage in 2018 the 100 year storm surge of lake pontchartrain is 2 7 m 3 5 m usace 2009 which is 1 5 2 3 m higher than the peak stage of the lake in 2018 the water levels at the gages of harvey canal and icw varied from 1 m to 1 9 m in 2018 fig 2d the peak water level in 2018 was 1 1 m lower than the 100 year designed levee height of harvey canal and icw usace 2009 water stages in other surface water bodies were relatively low and stable compared to the mississippi river as there was no hurricane event in 2018 2 2 nola groundwater model development 2 2 1 geological data geology is the backbone of a groundwater model and is usually explored through well logs in this study geotechnical borings and drillers logs well log data were collected from the ldnr the coastal protection and restoration authorities of louisiana cpra and the usace as a result 2873 well logs were digitized and shown in fig 3 the well logs are mainly available in the metropolitan area and around infrastructures less well logs are available in undeveloped areas e g swamps and marshlands in the east and southwest 76 of well logs are shallow and have bottom elevation higher than 15 m 50 ft 17 of well logs have bottom elevation lower than 61 m 200 ft around 7 of well logs have bottom elevation between 15 m and 61 m therefore we have sufficient well log data to develop a groundwater model up to 61 m which is below the bathymetry of mississippi river that is deep down to 59 4 m topobathymetric data for the model domain were derived from a dem of new orleans love et al 2010 the dem has the resolution from 10 m to 30 m lithologic information in each well log was interpreted into 4 sediment groups and 11 sediment classes table 1 pham and tsai 2017 developed a groundwater model by interpolating well log data using an indicator kriging method given a dip direction and a dip angle indicator kriging interpolates binary data sand facies and clay facies on dipping planes a stacking approach was employed to assemble all dipping planes into a three dimensional stratigraphy model a grid generator converted the stratigraphy model into a modflow grid technical details are skipped in this study and are referred to pham and tsai 2017 the well logs of 11 sediment classes were used to build a stratigraphy model based on a multi indicator natural neighbor interpolation minn method li and tsai 2020 which was extended from the indicator kriging method elshall et al 2013 pham and tsai 2017 to multiple indicators with a natural neighbor interpolation method green and sibson 1978 sibson 1980 1981 then the stratigraphy model was further developed into a groundwater model 2 2 2 groundwater model this study employed modflow usg to develop a groundwater model as a tool to investigate groundwater dynamics in new orleans the modflow usg was based on an underlying control volume finite difference cvfd formulation which allows a computational cell to connect with an arbitrary number of adjacent cells the reason for adopting modflow usg is that it provides the flexibility of having finer meshes around mississippi river major canals and waterways while keeping a coarser mesh for the model domain in this study we designed the new orleans groundwater model to have base cell size 200 m and gradually refined cells down to 50 m around mississippi river ihnc giww harvey canal and icw as a result there were 68 492 cells for each model layer and 24 model layers the groundwater model was set up for the whole year of 2018 the initial condition of groundwater head on january 1 2018 was determined by a steady state solution general head boundary ghb conditions were applied to grid cells that contact mississippi river lakes and canals fig 4 ghb conditions allow daily surface groundwater interactions through the contact surface of boundary cells e g streambeds data required for a ghb cell include daily water stage bathymetry and permeability of the contact surface daily water stages of five stream gages along the mississippi river fig 2a were linearly interpolated for the mississippi river ghb cells a ghb condition with daily water stages averaged over the four gages in fig 2b was assigned to computational cells that contact the ihnc giww similarly daily water stages averaged over the three gages in fig 2d were assigned as ghb values to the harvey canal icw lake pontchartrain lake borgne and the chef menteur pass connecting channel only have one gage for each fig 2c as their waters are interconnected and there was little water stage difference in 2018 among the three gages daily water stages averaged over the three gages were used to assign a ghb condition for these boundary cells it is noted that the impact of the opening of the bonnet carré spillway in march 2018 was indirectly considered through the water stage changes in lake pontchartrain and mississippi river which in turn changed the boundary conditions other boundaries of the model domain without ghb conditions were assumed to be no flow boundaries 2 2 3 identify sensitive model parameters the composited scaled sensitivity css hill 1998 was adopted to identify sensitive parameters for model calibration which is especially needed when observation data is very limited the css calculates a dimensionless model parameter sensitivity to a set of simulated groundwater heads at selected locations e g observation locations or locations of interest thus css is able to compare influence of different types of model parameters on simulation results large css values indicate influential parameters to simulated groundwater heads at selected locations css is calculated as follows ely 2006 1 cs s j 1 n i 1 n h i b j b j σ i 2 where h i b j is the sensitivity of simulated groundwater head h i to parameter b j σ i is the standard deviation of h i and n is the number of simulated groundwater head data in this study css was calculated for hydraulic conductivity k specific storage ss specific yield sy of four sediment groups streambed leakances of mississippi river canals and waterways and lakebed leakances of lake pontchartrain and lake borgne for the 34 piezometer locations groundwater data are not available and the 4 usgs groundwater observation wells groundwater data are available in fig 1 the css values were scaled scaled css between 0 and 1 for comparison 2 2 4 model calibration and parameter uncertainty once sensitive model parameters are determined by the css calibration of the groundwater model can be formulated as a least squares problem which can be solved by an optimization approach model parameters can be estimated by minimizing the root mean square error rmse based on maximum likelihood ml estimation between simulated groundwater heads and observed data 2 rmse 1 l i 1 l h i h i o b s 2 where h i and h i o b s represent the i th simulated groundwater head and the i th observed data respectively and l is number of observed data this study minimized the rmse using the sequential quadratic programming sqp approach boggs and tolle 1995 2000 in the matlab optimization toolbox mathworks 2015 as for uncertainty in the ml estimated model parameters this study adopted the linear statistical approach bard 1974 to determine the covariance of model parameters as follows 3 cov 1 l m i 1 l h i h i o b s 2 j t j 1 where cov is the covariance matrix of model parameters j is the l m jacobian matrix of sensitivities of l groundwater head data to m model parameters in order to analyze modeling uncertainty arising from model parameters monte carlo simulation was performed together with the latin hypercube sampling lhs florian 1992 huntington and lyrintzis 1998 iman and conover 1980 to sample model parameters ensemble mean and ensemble standard deviation of model outputs were derived 2 2 5 seepage calculation seepage to land surface that indicates groundwater emergence was estimated at computational cells that contact land surface surficial cells based on darcy s law morris et al 2018 4 q k δ h b a where q is the seepage rate for a surficial cell k is the hydraulic conductivity of the surficial cell a is the top area of the surficial cell δh is the difference between groundwater head of the surficial cell and land surface elevation and b is the distance between the cell center and the cell top δ h b refers to upward hydraulic gradient at a surficial cell seepage was not calculated if groundwater head of surficial cells is below land surface or surficial cells are in undeveloped areas 2 2 6 seepage based factor of safety calculation seepage based factor of safety fs against uplift was calculated to identify areas of risk where sand boils introduced by strong underseepage may potentially occur especially along landside levee toes fs at a point of interest can be computed as follows cheng et al 2014 5 f s i c i v i c h b h t b where i c is the critical hydraulic gradient required to result in sand boils i v is the vertical hydraulic gradient across the top stratum silt and clay h b is the groundwater head in the substratum sand h t is the total hydraulic head at land surface and b is the thickness of the top stratum the critical hydraulic gradient for lower mississippi river levees was suggested to be between 0 8 and 0 85 usace 1956 this study used a critical hydraulic gradient of 0 8 h t becomes land surface elevation if water depth is negligible at surface moreover transformed top stratum thickness was calculated for a composite top stratum as suggested by the usace usace 1992 3 results 3 1 stratigraphy model the nola s geological features in the stratigraphy model shown in fig 5 are similar to previous studies ilit 2006 74 percent of sediments in the stratigraphy model consists of fine grains clay silty clay fig 5 shows that 79 3 percent of the land in new orleans is covered by clayey sediments the percentage of sandy deposits silty sediments and organic matters on the land is 10 1 8 9 and 1 7 respectively surficial coarse grains sand and silty sand appear to the channels of mississippi river indicating point bar sands the pine island beach sand saucier 1963 is pronounced along the shore of lake pontchartrain the stratigraphy model appears that the natural levees along mississippi river are relatively high ground varying between 1 3 meters above navd 88 fig 6 cross sections bb cc and dd in fig 6 show land surface in the east bank of mississippi river lower than navd 88 3 m or more because of the subsidence resulted from dewatering drain of shallow groundwater during land development such as apparent low lying areas in front of lake pontchartrain jones et al 2016 ilit 2006 cross sections aa and bb fig 6 illustrate the pine island beach sand layer with thickness of about 10 m along the shore of lake pontchartrain in the northeastern new orleans as shown in cross section cc the western reach of the beach sand extends to the area around the 17th street canal besides cross sections aa and bb show gramercy aquifer with the thickness ranging between 25 30 meters underneath the beach sand dial and sumner 1989 lake borgne is underlain by fine grains the giww cuts into sandy deposits and organic matters organic clay and organics cross section bb indicates connections between icw and underlying sandy sediments moreover clay sandy clay and silty clay appear in the top stratum along mississippi river and compose the natural levees isolated sand beds appear in cross sections aa cc dd and ee the sand beds are part of shallow aquifers in new orleans dial and tomaszewski 1988 all of the cross sections in fig 6 indicate that buried point bars connect with part of mississippi river with varying thickness and elevations especially at the river bends these point bars consist of various sediment classes including sand silty sand sandy silt and sandy clay which match the descriptions of geology in new orleans by kolb et al 1975 3 2 sensitivity analysis since groundwater data are very limited estimating hydrogeological parameters of the 11 sediment classes would result in large parameter uncertainty instead we estimated hydrogeological parameters for only 4 sediment groups sand silt clay and organic along with streambed leakance and lakebed leakance in the groundwater model groundwater heads were simulated for year 2018 fig 7 shows scaled css values for 16 parameters computed with simulated groundwater heads at 34 piezometers and 4 usgs groundwater observation wells both css results show the same top five sensitive parameters hydraulic conductivity of sand and clay specific storage of sand and clay and streambed leakance of mississippi river scaled css values for specific yields of sand silt clay and organic are nearly zero indicating that sediments are fully saturated at the estimation locations parameters relating to silt and organic have a relatively low impact on groundwater heads because silt and organic are not extensively distributed around the estimation locations the css values for streambed leakance of ihnc giww lakes and harvey canal icw are also relatively low indicating groundwater heads at the estimation locations are less sensitive to these parameters therefore the top five sensitive model parameters were selected for model calibration 3 3 model calibration results of 1960 1961 the groundwater model was calibrated with groundwater data between 1960 and 1961 measured by the usgs to do so the groundwater model was run for a year from 10 12 1960 to 10 11 1961 with a daily time step stream gage data for this period were provided by the usace five model parameters k sand k clay ss sand ss clay and mr leakance were estimated in model calibration it was assumed that the hydrogeological parameters of the 4 groups estimated using usgs observation wells near mississippi river are applicable to the entire study domain other parameters were assigned with median values of their respective reference ranges the ranges are derived from previous studies that are based on in situ or laboratory tests in the study area parameter values after calibration are shown in table 2 fig 8 shows that most of the simulated groundwater heads fit well with the corresponding observed data the rmse is 0 528 m and the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse yin and tsai 2020 is 0 742 which means that the model has sufficient quality and predictive powers a monte carlo simulation was performed with 50 realizations to evaluate the uncertainties that are associated with the model parameters and that affects the model outputs although not showing here results of 50 100 and 200 realizations were no considerable difference after deriving the parameter covariance matrix eq 3 the sensitive parameters identified by the sensitivity analysis were assumed to follow the multi gaussian distribution other parameters were assumed the uniform distribution with their ranges shown in table 2 latin hypercube sampling lhs was adopted to sample parameter values fig 9 shows that the mean simulated groundwater levels by monte carlo simulation follow the mississippi river stage because the four observation wells were screened at point bar sands that connect the river the shadow of one standard deviation fig 9 indicates that groundwater heads at the observation wells are sensitive to the parameter values at high river water in other words groundwater level prediction is relatively uncertain during high mississippi river stage the simulated head at jf 62 matches well with observed data fig 9b groundwater heads at jf 47 and jf 91 were noticeably overestimated by the model fig 9a d indicating the possibility of local pumping activities occurring in the early 1960s when groundwater drainage was conducted for massive urban development dunbar and britsch 2008 the model underestimated groundwater heads in jf 75 during the flood of 1961 fig 9c indicating the possibility of local heterogeneity effects around jf 75 which was not captured by the well log data sediment heterogeneity along the mississippi river can exhibit high variability usace 1962 deviation from reality is inevitable due to the limited groundwater data and other information which introduces uncertainty to the groundwater model model uncertainty analysis was carried out for the following discussions 3 4 groundwater dynamics of 2018 based on the 50 realizations the mean simulated groundwater levels at 5 representative days which cover the pre flood mississippi river stage and stages of the flood event in 2018 are analyzed to understand groundwater dynamics fig 10 shows that high groundwater level in the east and central areas and along mississippi river is the result of relatively high mississippi river stage high river water can propagate into coarse sands and silt and result in high pore water pressure in those water bearing sediments along mississippi river furthermore groundwater levels adjacent to mississippi river can remain higher than the river stage after the peak due to relatively slow response to river dynamics this is apparent in fig 10e the river stage on june 30th can be up to 1 07 m lower than the groundwater level adjacent to the east bank of the river the study also found relatively low groundwater level along harvey canal and icw suggesting strong hydraulic connections with underlying coarse sediments harvey canal and icw may act as drains to groundwater when their water stages are low simulated groundwater levels in the areas near the ihnc the giww and the lakes are close to the surface water stages suggesting that groundwater levels in these areas would be hardly influenced by mississippi river the groundwater level variation along parts of the giww indicates hydraulic connections to underlying coarse sediments and potential hydraulic pressure propagation groundwater level in the pine island beach sand fig 5 varied from 0 03 m to 0 24 m when water stages of ihnc and lake pontchartrain fluctuated from 0 08 m to 0 31 m fig 10 which suggests that groundwater level in the beach sand directly responds to water stages of the ihnc and lake pontchartrain due to strong hydraulic connections 3 5 groundwater flooding groundwater head in shallow confined aquifers above land surface is a strong indicator of groundwater flooding based on 50 realizations estimated mean groundwater head above land surface on the days with low and peak mississippi river stages are presented fig 11 for analyses since stages of other surface waters were relatively stable in 2018 apparent differences of groundwater head above land surface between the two maps in fig 11 appear only along mississippi river during low river stage the elevated natural levees prevent groundwater level in the vicinity of the river from being above land surface fig 11a however for high river stage as shown in fig 11b the vicinity area can have groundwater head in confined point bar sands more than 2 m higher than the ground surface estimated groundwater levels in the undeveloped areas around the mrgo and lake borgne were below land surface or less than 0 5 m above land surface in the urban areas estimated groundwater head was generally over 0 5 ms higher than land surface the vicinity areas of metairie gentilly ridges and bayou des families ridge have groundwater head below land surface due to the elevated natural levees created by abandoned mississippi river distributaries frazier 1967 however shallow confined aquifers in the areas north of the metairie gentilly ridges could have groundwater head 2 5 m above ground surface suggesting high potentials of groundwater flooding this is caused by the low lying land in the vicinity of lake pontchartrain as the result of historical groundwater drain induced land subsidence ilit 2006 the mean seepage depth of 50 realizations was calculated by dividing seepage rates eq 4 over cell area fig 12 shows that the main difference between the low stage january 18 and the peak stage march 21 of mississippi river is seepage changes along the river during low water stage no seepage occurred in the vicinity of mississippi river fig 12a at peak stage seepage was estimated up to 4 3 mm fig 12b nevertheless the majority of the vicinity area of the mississippi river appears to have a negligible groundwater flooding issue a more pronouncing groundwater flooding issue is in the gentilly to little woods communities in the north which encompass the london avenue canal and ihnc seepage was estimated up to 5 mm the problematic area aligns with the buried pine island beach sand the model also shows high seepage depth around the 17th street canal harvey canal and icw fig 12 varying from 1 5 to 4 mm per day seepage of 2 3 mm was estimated in the lower ninth ward the seepage came from saturated peat the mean daily seepage during the flood of 2018 from january 18 to july 30 in the vicinity of mississippi river is less than 1 5 mm per day the standard deviation of the daily seepage varies from 0 025 to 1 8 mm in summary areas adjacent to london avenue canal ihnc lake pontchartrain harvey canal icw and lower ninth ward potentially have a long lasting groundwater flooding issue however areas along mississippi river are likely not have a groundwater flooding issue groundwater flooding in new orleans is mainly triggered by high groundwater head in shallow confined sands that receive significant recharge from surface water the second type of groundwater flooding macdonald et al 2008 it is noted that high groundwater head is not necessarily result in severe groundwater flooding according to fig 11 40 55 of urban areas could have groundwater head over 1 m higher than land surface however only around 5 of the urban areas might be subject to considerable groundwater flooding based on relatively large seepage rates larger than 1 5 mm per day fig 12b groundwater flooding depends on both of groundwater head in shallow sands and the permeability of surficial sediments relatively severe groundwater flooding usually occurs in areas with surficial silty and sandy sediments that are underlain by shallow confined aquifers with high groundwater head exceeding land surface because these surficial sediments are relatively permeable and are able to cause noticeable seepage in contrast the groundwater flooding issue might not be a concern in areas covered by thick and less permeable sediments clay layers such as the vicinity area of mississippi river even though the area is adjacent to high staged surface water or underlain by sands with high groundwater head 3 6 factor of safety seepage based fs at a location was calculated by equation 5 a substratum was determined as the first coarse sediment layer that has thickness greater than 3 m transformed thickness of a top stratum was also calculated based on the ratios of sand and silt hydraulic conductivities to clay hydraulic conductivity table 2 low fs resulting from excessive pore water pressures indicates strong underseepage and potential sand boils which may impact the stability of levee foundations stark et al 2014 locations with fs less than 1 0 are concerned of potential underseepage issues cheng et al 2014 though the usace s general guideline is to have levee fs greater than 1 5 usace 1992 mean fs at the peak mississippi river stage march 21 2018 is shown in fig 13 a based on the 50 realizations the mississippi river levees have fs greater than 1 0 expect for a few spots underlain by shallow point bar sands with high groundwater head high fs is because of the presence of elevated natural levees consisting of fine grained sediments levees for low lying areas in the north of metairie gentilly ridges fig 1 and in the lower 9th ward see fig 12 are concerned because of factor of safety less than 1 0 areas with low fs away from levees could be concerned of unstable foundation of infrastructures such as roads bridges and buildings modeling results also indicate low fs around some of harvey canal icw and giww levees probability of factor of safety less than 1 0 was calculated based on the 50 realizations and is shown in fig 13b areas exceeding 80 coincide with areas where the mean fs is less than 1 0 fig 13a mississippi river levees at some spots may have very high chance that fs is less than 1 0 due to shallow buried point bar sands located close to land surface 4 modeling results with respect to hurricane katrina event areas of low factor of safety fs 1 0 identified by the model coincide with the locations of breached levees reported by the interagency performance evaluation task force for the hurricane katrina disaster ipet 2006 the majority of breach sites fig 13 are in the east bank of the mississippi river from the 17th street canal eastward to lake borgne these areas are of concern from the model that high groundwater level above land surface fig 11 and noticeable seepage rate fig 12 are likely to persist all year around the ipet interagency performance evaluation team specifically focused on the major levee breaches at the london avenue canal the 17th street canal and the ihnc south reach the london avenue canal breaches were likely caused by underseepage dunbar and britsch 2008 where the model shows more than 80 chance of seepage based fs 1 0 fig 13b on the contrary the model shows low chance of seepage based fs 1 0 at the 17th street canal breach site and the ihnc east south reach breach sites which supports the ipet report and the dunbar britsch study that seepage was likely not the cause the 17th street canal breach was likely due to weak lacustrine soils with rich organic matters seed et al 2008d the southern ihnc breaches were likely caused by i wall failures that created a scour trench and reduced levee s stability dunbar and britsch 2008 besides seed et al 2008a reported levee breaches of northern ihnc and lake pontchartrain and a breach along giww fig 13 however failure mechanisms were not fully investigated the model shows high probability of fs 1 0 in these areas and suggests that underseepage could be a potential contributor to these failures 5 conclusions the stratigraphy model showed that new orleans is rich in clay in upper 60 m 74 of sediments in new orleans are fine grains clay and silty clay nevertheless there are shallow water bearing sediments hydraulically connecting to surface waters and impacting seepage and levees the buried pine island beach sand along the shore of lake pontchartrain is the most distinguished shallow formation in the region and has adverse implications to groundwater flooding and levee safety the beach sand acts as an underground passage that links lake pontchartrain ihnc london avenue canal and surrounding communities coupled with low lying land and relatively permeable surficial sediments the beach sand areas are the most concerned about groundwater flooding and levee safety buried point bar sands represent important permeable sediments to interact with mississippi river however the model suggested that high groundwater head in the sands hardly triggers groundwater flooding or risks levee safety due to the overlying elevated fine grained sediments furthermore near surface sands also connect with icw and giww at several places where potential groundwater flooding and levee underseepage were indicated by the model comparing to ipet s levee assessment in the aftermath of hurricane katrina the model results supported the conclusions that underseepage was likely to cause the london avenue canal levee breaches but was not the primary cause to the 17th street canal breach and ihnc east south reach breaches additionally this study indicated that parts of levees along lake pontchartrain northern ihnc and icw could be subject to potential seepage induced hazards though failures were not recorded at those sites as groundwater was found impactful on flooding and levee safety sufficient groundwater data is indeed needed for new orleans and to improve the current groundwater model further research may focus on groundwater data collection and integration of the groundwater model with a flood forecasting model to improve flood forecasting and levee safety evaluation for the greater new orleans region this study revealed the imperative of understanding hydrogeology for new orleans with respect to groundwater flooding and levee underseepage as similar geographical and geological conditions exist in many coastal cities around the world the analyses of groundwater flooding and seepage induced factor of safety help delineate potential geo hazard areas and will help better engineering designs in the coastal zones which otherwise would not be known

8288,study region the greater new orleans in southeastern louisiana usa study focus flooding is a major threat to new orleans due to its geographic location and geologic condition however potential groundwater flooding is seldom studied and poorly understood this study investigated potential groundwater flooding and seepage induced hazards to levees in new orleans high fidelity stratigraphy and groundwater models were developed to investigate groundwater dynamics and identify areas prone to groundwater flooding and low levee factor of safety new hydrological insights for the region the stratigraphy model showed that 74 of shallow sediments in new orleans are fine grains and noticeable amounts of coarse sediments connect to surface waters the groundwater model showed that shallow sands such as beach sands and point bar sands have strong hydraulic connections with lakes canals and mississippi river groundwater flow simulation in 2018 found that 40 of new orleans metropolitan area may have groundwater level above ground surface all year round low lying areas with relatively permeable surficial sediments and high groundwater head in shallow sands are concerned about potential groundwater flooding the simulation results also indicated that levees in these areas have high probabilities of low factors of safety not only did the model prediction agree well to the previous levee assessments for the hurricane katrina disaster but it also indicated additional areas with potential levee safety issues keywords groundwater flooding modeling seepage levee new orleans 1 introduction flooding along coastlines of the united states becomes more frequent since 1950s especially in the gulf coast noaa 2014 factors that cause flooding in coastal cities include heavy rainfall storms surges sea level rise levee overtopping levee breach inadequate drainage poor land management and subsidence adelekan 2010 bhat et al 2013 rosenzweig et al 2011 hydrological models are tools to help identify coastal flooding issues arising from poor drainage designs rain et al 2011 storm surges yin et al 2011 and intensive rainfall with high tides zope et al 2015 although rainfall and surface water are major contributors to flooding during hurricanes or storm events flood induced high groundwater level can also cause flooding garcía gil et al 2015 but is seldom discussed in the literature groundwater flooding refers to the emergence of groundwater on land surface due to the rise of groundwater level in permeable strata although rarely causing loss of life groundwater flooding usually lasts longer than fluvial flooding because of slow response to surface water recedence morris et al 2018 a groundwater flooding incidence was reported in illinois usa that resulted in a 100 year groundwater flooding risk map visocky 1995 groundwater flooding in southwest wisconsin usa was caused by significant recharge from intense precipitation to aquifers gotkowitz et al 2014 following the devastating flood from a chalk aquifer in england uk hughes et al 2011 interests in groundwater flooding studies increase in europe ascott et al 2017 upton and jackson 2011 high groundwater level coincided with heavy rainfall was considered as a trigger to groundwater flooding from chalk aquifers adams et al 2010 finch et al 2004 there are three types of groundwater flooding caused by different mechanisms macdonald et al 2008 the first type of groundwater flooding is caused by rising water table above land surface in response to extreme rainfall events this type of groundwater flooding is often extensive and long lasting the second type of groundwater flooding is caused by high water in rivers or lakes that well connect to shallow unconsolidated sedimentary aquifers with limited storage capacity e g underlain by relatively impermeable deposits the third type of groundwater flooding is caused by reduction of groundwater abstraction that allows depressed water table to recover and thus can cause inundation of subsurface infrastructures groundwater flooding in coastal areas could occur mainly due to recharge by surrounding surface water the second type of groundwater flooding macdonald et al 2012 assessed risks of groundwater flooding and concluded that groundwater flooding is prone to low lying areas where groundwater level has strong response to surrounding surface water stage and rainfall which is a typical hydrogeological condition in coastal areas groundwater flooding was predicted using monitored groundwater level data macdonald et al 2012 and groundwater flooding extent was measured by aerial photography finch et al 2004 moreover a groundwater potentiometric map and a digital elevation model dem were used to analyze occurrence of groundwater flooding in a regional scale hoover et al 2017 high groundwater level can also produce excessive pore water pressure under levees and elevate geohazard risks such as piping and sand boils which can impact stability of levee foundations usace 1956 levee underseepage analysis is important to evaluate potentials of these geohazards such analyses were conducted along inner harbor navigation canal ihnc london avenue canal and the 17th street canal in new orleans after hurricane katrina to explore levee failure mechanisms ipet 2006 seed et al 2008b c d stark et al 2014 the objective of this study is to investigate groundwater dynamics in the new orleans metropolitan area and its impacts on flooding and seepage induced levee safety analyses in this study focused on the year 2018 when no hurricanes or storm events occurred for assessments in a normal climatic condition to authors knowledge this study is the first effort to understand impacts of shallow groundwater dynamics in new orleans on a large scale in this study a shallow new orleans stratigraphy model was constructed with a large amount of well logs then a groundwater model was built using modflow usg panday et al 2017 on the basis of the stratigraphy model due to limited groundwater data sensitivity analysis was performed to identify significant parameters for model calibration parameter uncertainties were incorporated in results of groundwater dynamics groundwater flooding and levee factor of safety in new orleans the correlation between the modeling results and previous levee underseepage studies in new orleans was discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area nola new orleans metropolitan area new orleans or nola in the southeastern louisiana usa has a population of approximately 1 2 million which makes it the 46th largest city in the country the city is known for flooding problems due to more than 50 of the city below sea level relatively high mississippi river and lake pontchartrain water stages poor natural drainage poor geological settings land subsidence and constant threats from tropical storms and hurricanes dixon et al 2006 griffis 2007 specifically land development by reclaiming marshlands adjacent to lake pontchartrain dunbar and britsch 2008 caused pronounced land subsidence and formed an interior basin snowden et al 1980 fifteen 15 percent of new orleans was reported to be 3 m or more below mean sea level in 2006 ilit 2006 the overwhelming lake water stages during hurricane katrina in 2005 resulted in several levee breaches and over 70 percent of new orleans flooded ilit 2006 after hurricane katrina flood protection systems including levees and surge barriers along mississippi river lakes canals and waterways along with canal locks and pumping systems were constructed improved and enhanced in order to prevent new orleans from flooding the study area covers the entire new orleans metropolitan area fig 1 including 4 parishes the study area is bounded by lake pontchartrain to the north lake borgne and a part of mississippi river to the east lake salvador and barataria water route to the south and duncan canal to the west major waterways such as inner harbor navigation canal ihnc gulf intracoastal waterway giww and mississippi river gulf outlet mrgo and canals such as the 17th street canal and london avenue canal are in the east bank of mississippi river harvey canal and intracoastal waterway icw are in the west bank 2 1 1 hydrogeology of new orleans previous studies have revealed complex geological settings in new orleans over half of new orleans is covered by swamps and marshes consisting of clay and organic matters that usually have low strength depending on water content ilit 2006 the pleistocene deposits are generally overlain by holocene fills with thickness ranging between 55 and 80 feet in new orleans dunbar and britsch 2008 high natural levees consisting of clay silt and silty sand were formed along the current course of mississippi river usace 1956 the buried pine island beach sand fig 1 stretched along the southern shore of lake pontchartrain was formed approximately 3500 years saucier 1963 point bars with downward graded grain size from silty sand to clean sand along parts of the mississippi river are buried by fine grained materials kolb et al 1975 metairie gentilly ridges and bayou des families ridge fig 1 were sediment fills of old mississippi river channel during the formation of st bernard delta frazier 1967 the u s geological survey usgs classifies four principal aquifers from shallow to deep depths gramercy norco gonzales new orleans and 1200 foot sand aquifers dial and tomaszewski 1988 fine grain aquitards with thickness varying from a few feet to approximately 200 feet separate each aquifer dial and tomaszewski 1988 in addition to the four aquifers localized shallow aquifers water bearing units consisting of point bar sands distributary channel deposits and isolated sand beds exist near land surface shallow aquifers occur in a thick clay layer overlying gramercy aquifer that distributes in the depth between 100 and 300 feet without continuity in new orleans dial and tomaszewski 1988 industries pump groundwater from gonzales new orleans aquifer which is the most continuous sand layer containing fresh water eddards et al 1956 dial and tomaszewski 1988 developed a three dimensional groundwater model to evaluate the impact of pumping on saltwater intrusion in gonzales new orleans aquifer a four layer groundwater model was also developed by dial and sumner 1989 to evaluate the capacity of each principle aquifer to supply the needs of new orleans 2 1 2 groundwater monitoring most piezometers in the study area are used to monitor groundwater head at deep confined aquifers such as gonzales new orleans aquifer piezometers in shallow aquifers of new orleans are quite limited 34 piezometers shown in fig 1 in shallow aquifers identified by the louisiana department of natural resources ldnr were owned by industries however no groundwater data are available from industrial piezometers only four usgs piezometers noted as observation wells in fig 1 along mississippi river have available groundwater data recorded in 1957 1962 2 1 3 surface water monitoring the locations of stream gages in the study area are shown in fig 1 which includes five stream gages along the mississippi river four stream gages for ihnc and giww one stream gage for lake pontchartrain one stream gage for harvey canal two stream gages for intracoastal waterway and two stream gages for lake borgne stream data after 1986 are available from the u s army corps of engineers usace website http rivergages mvr usace army mil the hydrograph of each stream gage in 2018 fig 2 was collected for groundwater model development fig 2a illustrates that mississippi river stage at three gages in new orleans varied from 0 5 m to 5 m in 2018 the hydrographs cover a flood season of the river from february to july the difference of the river stage between the upstream and downstream gages during the 2018 flood season was as high as 1 m the peak river stage in the flood season lasted for 19 days in march fig 2a according to a digital elevation model dem in new orleans love et al 2010 the elevation of artificial levees along mississippi river is up to 8 4 m referenced to the north american vertical datum of 1988 navd 88 the mississippi river levee height at the gage 01300 is 6 6 m which is about 1 6 m higher than the peak water stage in 2018 the bonnet carré spillway about 20 km upstream to the western model boundary was partially opened for 28 days starting march 8 to reduce mississippi river water level in new orleans fig 2b and c show that water stages of ihnc giww and lake pontchartrain lake borgne have similar patterns indicting propagation of lake water into the industrial canal the water stages at these gages range between 0 3 m and 1 2 m the levee height along ihnc giww varies from 3 4 m to 4 7 m love et al 2010 indicating at least 2 2 m higher than the peak stage in 2018 the 100 year storm surge of lake pontchartrain is 2 7 m 3 5 m usace 2009 which is 1 5 2 3 m higher than the peak stage of the lake in 2018 the water levels at the gages of harvey canal and icw varied from 1 m to 1 9 m in 2018 fig 2d the peak water level in 2018 was 1 1 m lower than the 100 year designed levee height of harvey canal and icw usace 2009 water stages in other surface water bodies were relatively low and stable compared to the mississippi river as there was no hurricane event in 2018 2 2 nola groundwater model development 2 2 1 geological data geology is the backbone of a groundwater model and is usually explored through well logs in this study geotechnical borings and drillers logs well log data were collected from the ldnr the coastal protection and restoration authorities of louisiana cpra and the usace as a result 2873 well logs were digitized and shown in fig 3 the well logs are mainly available in the metropolitan area and around infrastructures less well logs are available in undeveloped areas e g swamps and marshlands in the east and southwest 76 of well logs are shallow and have bottom elevation higher than 15 m 50 ft 17 of well logs have bottom elevation lower than 61 m 200 ft around 7 of well logs have bottom elevation between 15 m and 61 m therefore we have sufficient well log data to develop a groundwater model up to 61 m which is below the bathymetry of mississippi river that is deep down to 59 4 m topobathymetric data for the model domain were derived from a dem of new orleans love et al 2010 the dem has the resolution from 10 m to 30 m lithologic information in each well log was interpreted into 4 sediment groups and 11 sediment classes table 1 pham and tsai 2017 developed a groundwater model by interpolating well log data using an indicator kriging method given a dip direction and a dip angle indicator kriging interpolates binary data sand facies and clay facies on dipping planes a stacking approach was employed to assemble all dipping planes into a three dimensional stratigraphy model a grid generator converted the stratigraphy model into a modflow grid technical details are skipped in this study and are referred to pham and tsai 2017 the well logs of 11 sediment classes were used to build a stratigraphy model based on a multi indicator natural neighbor interpolation minn method li and tsai 2020 which was extended from the indicator kriging method elshall et al 2013 pham and tsai 2017 to multiple indicators with a natural neighbor interpolation method green and sibson 1978 sibson 1980 1981 then the stratigraphy model was further developed into a groundwater model 2 2 2 groundwater model this study employed modflow usg to develop a groundwater model as a tool to investigate groundwater dynamics in new orleans the modflow usg was based on an underlying control volume finite difference cvfd formulation which allows a computational cell to connect with an arbitrary number of adjacent cells the reason for adopting modflow usg is that it provides the flexibility of having finer meshes around mississippi river major canals and waterways while keeping a coarser mesh for the model domain in this study we designed the new orleans groundwater model to have base cell size 200 m and gradually refined cells down to 50 m around mississippi river ihnc giww harvey canal and icw as a result there were 68 492 cells for each model layer and 24 model layers the groundwater model was set up for the whole year of 2018 the initial condition of groundwater head on january 1 2018 was determined by a steady state solution general head boundary ghb conditions were applied to grid cells that contact mississippi river lakes and canals fig 4 ghb conditions allow daily surface groundwater interactions through the contact surface of boundary cells e g streambeds data required for a ghb cell include daily water stage bathymetry and permeability of the contact surface daily water stages of five stream gages along the mississippi river fig 2a were linearly interpolated for the mississippi river ghb cells a ghb condition with daily water stages averaged over the four gages in fig 2b was assigned to computational cells that contact the ihnc giww similarly daily water stages averaged over the three gages in fig 2d were assigned as ghb values to the harvey canal icw lake pontchartrain lake borgne and the chef menteur pass connecting channel only have one gage for each fig 2c as their waters are interconnected and there was little water stage difference in 2018 among the three gages daily water stages averaged over the three gages were used to assign a ghb condition for these boundary cells it is noted that the impact of the opening of the bonnet carré spillway in march 2018 was indirectly considered through the water stage changes in lake pontchartrain and mississippi river which in turn changed the boundary conditions other boundaries of the model domain without ghb conditions were assumed to be no flow boundaries 2 2 3 identify sensitive model parameters the composited scaled sensitivity css hill 1998 was adopted to identify sensitive parameters for model calibration which is especially needed when observation data is very limited the css calculates a dimensionless model parameter sensitivity to a set of simulated groundwater heads at selected locations e g observation locations or locations of interest thus css is able to compare influence of different types of model parameters on simulation results large css values indicate influential parameters to simulated groundwater heads at selected locations css is calculated as follows ely 2006 1 cs s j 1 n i 1 n h i b j b j σ i 2 where h i b j is the sensitivity of simulated groundwater head h i to parameter b j σ i is the standard deviation of h i and n is the number of simulated groundwater head data in this study css was calculated for hydraulic conductivity k specific storage ss specific yield sy of four sediment groups streambed leakances of mississippi river canals and waterways and lakebed leakances of lake pontchartrain and lake borgne for the 34 piezometer locations groundwater data are not available and the 4 usgs groundwater observation wells groundwater data are available in fig 1 the css values were scaled scaled css between 0 and 1 for comparison 2 2 4 model calibration and parameter uncertainty once sensitive model parameters are determined by the css calibration of the groundwater model can be formulated as a least squares problem which can be solved by an optimization approach model parameters can be estimated by minimizing the root mean square error rmse based on maximum likelihood ml estimation between simulated groundwater heads and observed data 2 rmse 1 l i 1 l h i h i o b s 2 where h i and h i o b s represent the i th simulated groundwater head and the i th observed data respectively and l is number of observed data this study minimized the rmse using the sequential quadratic programming sqp approach boggs and tolle 1995 2000 in the matlab optimization toolbox mathworks 2015 as for uncertainty in the ml estimated model parameters this study adopted the linear statistical approach bard 1974 to determine the covariance of model parameters as follows 3 cov 1 l m i 1 l h i h i o b s 2 j t j 1 where cov is the covariance matrix of model parameters j is the l m jacobian matrix of sensitivities of l groundwater head data to m model parameters in order to analyze modeling uncertainty arising from model parameters monte carlo simulation was performed together with the latin hypercube sampling lhs florian 1992 huntington and lyrintzis 1998 iman and conover 1980 to sample model parameters ensemble mean and ensemble standard deviation of model outputs were derived 2 2 5 seepage calculation seepage to land surface that indicates groundwater emergence was estimated at computational cells that contact land surface surficial cells based on darcy s law morris et al 2018 4 q k δ h b a where q is the seepage rate for a surficial cell k is the hydraulic conductivity of the surficial cell a is the top area of the surficial cell δh is the difference between groundwater head of the surficial cell and land surface elevation and b is the distance between the cell center and the cell top δ h b refers to upward hydraulic gradient at a surficial cell seepage was not calculated if groundwater head of surficial cells is below land surface or surficial cells are in undeveloped areas 2 2 6 seepage based factor of safety calculation seepage based factor of safety fs against uplift was calculated to identify areas of risk where sand boils introduced by strong underseepage may potentially occur especially along landside levee toes fs at a point of interest can be computed as follows cheng et al 2014 5 f s i c i v i c h b h t b where i c is the critical hydraulic gradient required to result in sand boils i v is the vertical hydraulic gradient across the top stratum silt and clay h b is the groundwater head in the substratum sand h t is the total hydraulic head at land surface and b is the thickness of the top stratum the critical hydraulic gradient for lower mississippi river levees was suggested to be between 0 8 and 0 85 usace 1956 this study used a critical hydraulic gradient of 0 8 h t becomes land surface elevation if water depth is negligible at surface moreover transformed top stratum thickness was calculated for a composite top stratum as suggested by the usace usace 1992 3 results 3 1 stratigraphy model the nola s geological features in the stratigraphy model shown in fig 5 are similar to previous studies ilit 2006 74 percent of sediments in the stratigraphy model consists of fine grains clay silty clay fig 5 shows that 79 3 percent of the land in new orleans is covered by clayey sediments the percentage of sandy deposits silty sediments and organic matters on the land is 10 1 8 9 and 1 7 respectively surficial coarse grains sand and silty sand appear to the channels of mississippi river indicating point bar sands the pine island beach sand saucier 1963 is pronounced along the shore of lake pontchartrain the stratigraphy model appears that the natural levees along mississippi river are relatively high ground varying between 1 3 meters above navd 88 fig 6 cross sections bb cc and dd in fig 6 show land surface in the east bank of mississippi river lower than navd 88 3 m or more because of the subsidence resulted from dewatering drain of shallow groundwater during land development such as apparent low lying areas in front of lake pontchartrain jones et al 2016 ilit 2006 cross sections aa and bb fig 6 illustrate the pine island beach sand layer with thickness of about 10 m along the shore of lake pontchartrain in the northeastern new orleans as shown in cross section cc the western reach of the beach sand extends to the area around the 17th street canal besides cross sections aa and bb show gramercy aquifer with the thickness ranging between 25 30 meters underneath the beach sand dial and sumner 1989 lake borgne is underlain by fine grains the giww cuts into sandy deposits and organic matters organic clay and organics cross section bb indicates connections between icw and underlying sandy sediments moreover clay sandy clay and silty clay appear in the top stratum along mississippi river and compose the natural levees isolated sand beds appear in cross sections aa cc dd and ee the sand beds are part of shallow aquifers in new orleans dial and tomaszewski 1988 all of the cross sections in fig 6 indicate that buried point bars connect with part of mississippi river with varying thickness and elevations especially at the river bends these point bars consist of various sediment classes including sand silty sand sandy silt and sandy clay which match the descriptions of geology in new orleans by kolb et al 1975 3 2 sensitivity analysis since groundwater data are very limited estimating hydrogeological parameters of the 11 sediment classes would result in large parameter uncertainty instead we estimated hydrogeological parameters for only 4 sediment groups sand silt clay and organic along with streambed leakance and lakebed leakance in the groundwater model groundwater heads were simulated for year 2018 fig 7 shows scaled css values for 16 parameters computed with simulated groundwater heads at 34 piezometers and 4 usgs groundwater observation wells both css results show the same top five sensitive parameters hydraulic conductivity of sand and clay specific storage of sand and clay and streambed leakance of mississippi river scaled css values for specific yields of sand silt clay and organic are nearly zero indicating that sediments are fully saturated at the estimation locations parameters relating to silt and organic have a relatively low impact on groundwater heads because silt and organic are not extensively distributed around the estimation locations the css values for streambed leakance of ihnc giww lakes and harvey canal icw are also relatively low indicating groundwater heads at the estimation locations are less sensitive to these parameters therefore the top five sensitive model parameters were selected for model calibration 3 3 model calibration results of 1960 1961 the groundwater model was calibrated with groundwater data between 1960 and 1961 measured by the usgs to do so the groundwater model was run for a year from 10 12 1960 to 10 11 1961 with a daily time step stream gage data for this period were provided by the usace five model parameters k sand k clay ss sand ss clay and mr leakance were estimated in model calibration it was assumed that the hydrogeological parameters of the 4 groups estimated using usgs observation wells near mississippi river are applicable to the entire study domain other parameters were assigned with median values of their respective reference ranges the ranges are derived from previous studies that are based on in situ or laboratory tests in the study area parameter values after calibration are shown in table 2 fig 8 shows that most of the simulated groundwater heads fit well with the corresponding observed data the rmse is 0 528 m and the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse yin and tsai 2020 is 0 742 which means that the model has sufficient quality and predictive powers a monte carlo simulation was performed with 50 realizations to evaluate the uncertainties that are associated with the model parameters and that affects the model outputs although not showing here results of 50 100 and 200 realizations were no considerable difference after deriving the parameter covariance matrix eq 3 the sensitive parameters identified by the sensitivity analysis were assumed to follow the multi gaussian distribution other parameters were assumed the uniform distribution with their ranges shown in table 2 latin hypercube sampling lhs was adopted to sample parameter values fig 9 shows that the mean simulated groundwater levels by monte carlo simulation follow the mississippi river stage because the four observation wells were screened at point bar sands that connect the river the shadow of one standard deviation fig 9 indicates that groundwater heads at the observation wells are sensitive to the parameter values at high river water in other words groundwater level prediction is relatively uncertain during high mississippi river stage the simulated head at jf 62 matches well with observed data fig 9b groundwater heads at jf 47 and jf 91 were noticeably overestimated by the model fig 9a d indicating the possibility of local pumping activities occurring in the early 1960s when groundwater drainage was conducted for massive urban development dunbar and britsch 2008 the model underestimated groundwater heads in jf 75 during the flood of 1961 fig 9c indicating the possibility of local heterogeneity effects around jf 75 which was not captured by the well log data sediment heterogeneity along the mississippi river can exhibit high variability usace 1962 deviation from reality is inevitable due to the limited groundwater data and other information which introduces uncertainty to the groundwater model model uncertainty analysis was carried out for the following discussions 3 4 groundwater dynamics of 2018 based on the 50 realizations the mean simulated groundwater levels at 5 representative days which cover the pre flood mississippi river stage and stages of the flood event in 2018 are analyzed to understand groundwater dynamics fig 10 shows that high groundwater level in the east and central areas and along mississippi river is the result of relatively high mississippi river stage high river water can propagate into coarse sands and silt and result in high pore water pressure in those water bearing sediments along mississippi river furthermore groundwater levels adjacent to mississippi river can remain higher than the river stage after the peak due to relatively slow response to river dynamics this is apparent in fig 10e the river stage on june 30th can be up to 1 07 m lower than the groundwater level adjacent to the east bank of the river the study also found relatively low groundwater level along harvey canal and icw suggesting strong hydraulic connections with underlying coarse sediments harvey canal and icw may act as drains to groundwater when their water stages are low simulated groundwater levels in the areas near the ihnc the giww and the lakes are close to the surface water stages suggesting that groundwater levels in these areas would be hardly influenced by mississippi river the groundwater level variation along parts of the giww indicates hydraulic connections to underlying coarse sediments and potential hydraulic pressure propagation groundwater level in the pine island beach sand fig 5 varied from 0 03 m to 0 24 m when water stages of ihnc and lake pontchartrain fluctuated from 0 08 m to 0 31 m fig 10 which suggests that groundwater level in the beach sand directly responds to water stages of the ihnc and lake pontchartrain due to strong hydraulic connections 3 5 groundwater flooding groundwater head in shallow confined aquifers above land surface is a strong indicator of groundwater flooding based on 50 realizations estimated mean groundwater head above land surface on the days with low and peak mississippi river stages are presented fig 11 for analyses since stages of other surface waters were relatively stable in 2018 apparent differences of groundwater head above land surface between the two maps in fig 11 appear only along mississippi river during low river stage the elevated natural levees prevent groundwater level in the vicinity of the river from being above land surface fig 11a however for high river stage as shown in fig 11b the vicinity area can have groundwater head in confined point bar sands more than 2 m higher than the ground surface estimated groundwater levels in the undeveloped areas around the mrgo and lake borgne were below land surface or less than 0 5 m above land surface in the urban areas estimated groundwater head was generally over 0 5 ms higher than land surface the vicinity areas of metairie gentilly ridges and bayou des families ridge have groundwater head below land surface due to the elevated natural levees created by abandoned mississippi river distributaries frazier 1967 however shallow confined aquifers in the areas north of the metairie gentilly ridges could have groundwater head 2 5 m above ground surface suggesting high potentials of groundwater flooding this is caused by the low lying land in the vicinity of lake pontchartrain as the result of historical groundwater drain induced land subsidence ilit 2006 the mean seepage depth of 50 realizations was calculated by dividing seepage rates eq 4 over cell area fig 12 shows that the main difference between the low stage january 18 and the peak stage march 21 of mississippi river is seepage changes along the river during low water stage no seepage occurred in the vicinity of mississippi river fig 12a at peak stage seepage was estimated up to 4 3 mm fig 12b nevertheless the majority of the vicinity area of the mississippi river appears to have a negligible groundwater flooding issue a more pronouncing groundwater flooding issue is in the gentilly to little woods communities in the north which encompass the london avenue canal and ihnc seepage was estimated up to 5 mm the problematic area aligns with the buried pine island beach sand the model also shows high seepage depth around the 17th street canal harvey canal and icw fig 12 varying from 1 5 to 4 mm per day seepage of 2 3 mm was estimated in the lower ninth ward the seepage came from saturated peat the mean daily seepage during the flood of 2018 from january 18 to july 30 in the vicinity of mississippi river is less than 1 5 mm per day the standard deviation of the daily seepage varies from 0 025 to 1 8 mm in summary areas adjacent to london avenue canal ihnc lake pontchartrain harvey canal icw and lower ninth ward potentially have a long lasting groundwater flooding issue however areas along mississippi river are likely not have a groundwater flooding issue groundwater flooding in new orleans is mainly triggered by high groundwater head in shallow confined sands that receive significant recharge from surface water the second type of groundwater flooding macdonald et al 2008 it is noted that high groundwater head is not necessarily result in severe groundwater flooding according to fig 11 40 55 of urban areas could have groundwater head over 1 m higher than land surface however only around 5 of the urban areas might be subject to considerable groundwater flooding based on relatively large seepage rates larger than 1 5 mm per day fig 12b groundwater flooding depends on both of groundwater head in shallow sands and the permeability of surficial sediments relatively severe groundwater flooding usually occurs in areas with surficial silty and sandy sediments that are underlain by shallow confined aquifers with high groundwater head exceeding land surface because these surficial sediments are relatively permeable and are able to cause noticeable seepage in contrast the groundwater flooding issue might not be a concern in areas covered by thick and less permeable sediments clay layers such as the vicinity area of mississippi river even though the area is adjacent to high staged surface water or underlain by sands with high groundwater head 3 6 factor of safety seepage based fs at a location was calculated by equation 5 a substratum was determined as the first coarse sediment layer that has thickness greater than 3 m transformed thickness of a top stratum was also calculated based on the ratios of sand and silt hydraulic conductivities to clay hydraulic conductivity table 2 low fs resulting from excessive pore water pressures indicates strong underseepage and potential sand boils which may impact the stability of levee foundations stark et al 2014 locations with fs less than 1 0 are concerned of potential underseepage issues cheng et al 2014 though the usace s general guideline is to have levee fs greater than 1 5 usace 1992 mean fs at the peak mississippi river stage march 21 2018 is shown in fig 13 a based on the 50 realizations the mississippi river levees have fs greater than 1 0 expect for a few spots underlain by shallow point bar sands with high groundwater head high fs is because of the presence of elevated natural levees consisting of fine grained sediments levees for low lying areas in the north of metairie gentilly ridges fig 1 and in the lower 9th ward see fig 12 are concerned because of factor of safety less than 1 0 areas with low fs away from levees could be concerned of unstable foundation of infrastructures such as roads bridges and buildings modeling results also indicate low fs around some of harvey canal icw and giww levees probability of factor of safety less than 1 0 was calculated based on the 50 realizations and is shown in fig 13b areas exceeding 80 coincide with areas where the mean fs is less than 1 0 fig 13a mississippi river levees at some spots may have very high chance that fs is less than 1 0 due to shallow buried point bar sands located close to land surface 4 modeling results with respect to hurricane katrina event areas of low factor of safety fs 1 0 identified by the model coincide with the locations of breached levees reported by the interagency performance evaluation task force for the hurricane katrina disaster ipet 2006 the majority of breach sites fig 13 are in the east bank of the mississippi river from the 17th street canal eastward to lake borgne these areas are of concern from the model that high groundwater level above land surface fig 11 and noticeable seepage rate fig 12 are likely to persist all year around the ipet interagency performance evaluation team specifically focused on the major levee breaches at the london avenue canal the 17th street canal and the ihnc south reach the london avenue canal breaches were likely caused by underseepage dunbar and britsch 2008 where the model shows more than 80 chance of seepage based fs 1 0 fig 13b on the contrary the model shows low chance of seepage based fs 1 0 at the 17th street canal breach site and the ihnc east south reach breach sites which supports the ipet report and the dunbar britsch study that seepage was likely not the cause the 17th street canal breach was likely due to weak lacustrine soils with rich organic matters seed et al 2008d the southern ihnc breaches were likely caused by i wall failures that created a scour trench and reduced levee s stability dunbar and britsch 2008 besides seed et al 2008a reported levee breaches of northern ihnc and lake pontchartrain and a breach along giww fig 13 however failure mechanisms were not fully investigated the model shows high probability of fs 1 0 in these areas and suggests that underseepage could be a potential contributor to these failures 5 conclusions the stratigraphy model showed that new orleans is rich in clay in upper 60 m 74 of sediments in new orleans are fine grains clay and silty clay nevertheless there are shallow water bearing sediments hydraulically connecting to surface waters and impacting seepage and levees the buried pine island beach sand along the shore of lake pontchartrain is the most distinguished shallow formation in the region and has adverse implications to groundwater flooding and levee safety the beach sand acts as an underground passage that links lake pontchartrain ihnc london avenue canal and surrounding communities coupled with low lying land and relatively permeable surficial sediments the beach sand areas are the most concerned about groundwater flooding and levee safety buried point bar sands represent important permeable sediments to interact with mississippi river however the model suggested that high groundwater head in the sands hardly triggers groundwater flooding or risks levee safety due to the overlying elevated fine grained sediments furthermore near surface sands also connect with icw and giww at several places where potential groundwater flooding and levee underseepage were indicated by the model comparing to ipet s levee assessment in the aftermath of hurricane katrina the model results supported the conclusions that underseepage was likely to cause the london avenue canal levee breaches but was not the primary cause to the 17th street canal breach and ihnc east south reach breaches additionally this study indicated that parts of levees along lake pontchartrain northern ihnc and icw could be subject to potential seepage induced hazards though failures were not recorded at those sites as groundwater was found impactful on flooding and levee safety sufficient groundwater data is indeed needed for new orleans and to improve the current groundwater model further research may focus on groundwater data collection and integration of the groundwater model with a flood forecasting model to improve flood forecasting and levee safety evaluation for the greater new orleans region this study revealed the imperative of understanding hydrogeology for new orleans with respect to groundwater flooding and levee underseepage as similar geographical and geological conditions exist in many coastal cities around the world the analyses of groundwater flooding and seepage induced factor of safety help delineate potential geo hazard areas and will help better engineering designs in the coastal zones which otherwise would not be known

8289,study region south africa study focus the probable maximum precipitation pmp is the theoretical upper limit of extreme rainfall and is widely used by engineers and hydrologists to determine the probable maximum flood pmf which is critical for the design and risk management of high hazard hydraulic structures in south africa the pmp was last estimated over 50 years ago using approximately 30 years of data since then numerous severe rainfall events have occurred which exceed presently available pmp estimates despite this the outdated estimates are currently used in professional practice in addition modernised methods have been developed and applied globally to estimate the pmp highlighting the need to update the pmp estimates for south africa this paper aims to present updated and modernised pmps for the country new hydrological insights for the region using updated rainfall records and a storm maximisation and transposition approach this paper provides new 1 day pmp estimates for the country the importance of revising the pmp to include new extreme rainfall events is highlighted as the majority of the events used in this study occurred after the publication of the previous estimates the use of extended rainfall records and modernised methods produces generally larger pmp estimates compared to the previous estimates and continual revision of the pmp is recommend to include new extreme rainfall events keywords extreme rainfall probable maximum precipitation south africa storm maximisation 1 introduction the probable maximum precipitation pmp is an extreme rainfall quantity which represents the maximum depth of precipitation that could possibly occur in a specific area and for a specific duration wmo 2009 the pmp is commonly used to derive the probable maximum flood pmf which is used by engineers and hydrologists in the planning design and risk assessment of high hazard hydraulic structures chavan and srinivas 2015 wang 1984 the south african national committee on large dams sancold guidelines for the estimation of the pmf is dependent on the pmp sancold 1991 numerous methods have been developed globally to estimate the pmp in south africa the pmp is currently determined using the hydrological research unit hru report no 1 72 hru 1972 which was developed based on approximately 30 years of rainfall data from the 1930s to 1960s using a total of 170 storms across the country for small area storms the pmp is presented as an envelope of maximum observed storm values and for large area storms the pmp is presented as depth area duration dad curves for meteorologically homogeneous regions cullis et al 2007 since the publication of these guidelines there has been no update in the development of pmp estimation in south africa and these guidelines are still used in professional practice today studies have shown that numerous extreme rainfall events have occurred since this publication which have exceeded the pmp estimates cullis et al 2007 görgens et al 2007 these pmp estimates may thus no longer be the best estimates of extreme rainfall and require urgent updating and modernisation smithers et al 2014 the use of outdated pmp estimates potentially affects the accuracy of pmf estimations and consequently the design of high hazard hydraulic structures the world meteorological organisation wmo has published a number of guidelines which describe methods for estimating the pmp the latest wmo guideline published in 2009 provides two approaches for estimating the pmp i hydro meteorological methods which maximise rainfall events based on atmospheric moisture conditions and ii statistical methods which can be used when sufficient meteorological data are not available wmo 2009 pmps derived using hydro meteorological methods produce reliable and precise estimates fattahi et al 2011 salas et al 2014 wmo 2009 and are most widely applied globally lee et al 2016 johnson and smithers 2019 provide a comprehensive review of various methods for estimating the pmp the aim of this paper is to present new pmp estimates for south africa using an updated database and modernised methods the objectives of this paper are to i report on the collation of an updated hydro meteorological database ii estimate the pmp using appropriate hydro meteorological methods prescribed by the wmo and iii to critically evaluate the newly derived pmp estimates 2 study area and data this section contains a brief description of the rainfall characteristics of the study area and detailed information of the data used to derive the pmps this study focusses on the estimation of pmp for the entire country south africa is a semi arid with an uneven spatial distribution of rainfall and most of the country receiving an average of less than 500 mm of rainfall annually the countries latitudinal location lies between the tropical subtropical and temperate pressure systems braun et al 2017 which results in three rainfall seasonality zones across the country summer rainfall zone october to march winter rainfall zone april to september and year round rainfall zone roffe et al 2019 rainfall varies considerably across the country with the summer rainfall zones in the east experiencing the greatest rainfalls with a mean annual precipitation map in excess of 800 mm and gradually decreasing westward schulze 2011 2 1 homogeneous rainfall districts homogeneous rainfall districts obtained from the south african weather service saws were used as a basis for this study the development of these districts started in the 1930s where homogeneous regions were divided into rainfall districts based on the statistics of maximum rainfalls and the seasonal distribution of precipitation schumann and hofmeyer 1938 and calculations of district rainfall has continually improved over the years landman et al 2006 south african weather bureau 1960 1972 the latest improvement occurred in 2016 and this entailed that at least 90 of the rainfall data of a month for a station should be available before the station is included in the calculations presently there are 94 homogeneous rainfall districts as delineated in fig a1 in appendix a 2 2 hydro meteorological data 2 2 1 rainfall for estimating the pmp a high quality database containing the most extreme rainfall events is required daily rainfall data from 1 629 stations across the country with at least 40 years of quality controlled daily records were selected for this study as shown in fig 1 a the annual maximum daily rainfall data from smithers and schulze 2000b was the primary source of data the majority of which was contributed by the south african weather service saws and the agricultural research council arc the data record contained in the database was limited up to the year 2000 and additional saws station data were obtained from the university of cape town climate systems analysis group csag and used to extend approximately 50 of the existing database with data for the period 2000 2010 thus the end dates for the rainfall records used in this study range between 2000 and 2010 at the time of the study funds were not available to purchase the full dataset from saws to update the database up to 2018 fig 1 b shows the distribution of the record lengths for the stations used in this study 2 2 2 temperature and relative humidity daily estimates of temperature t and relative humidity rh data were obtained from the gridded database developed by schulze and maharaj 2004 and were used to determine daily dew point temperatures td values for this study however the duration of t and rh data available through the gridded database is limited to the period 1950 2000 data from other sources were not available at the time of the study and funds were not available to purchase these data from saws 3 methodology 3 1 pmp estimation using the generalised estimation method for this study the generalised estimation method prescribed by wmo 2009 has been adopted to estimate the 1 day pmps for south africa the generalised estimation method is a hydro meteorological approach used for estimating the pmp for large meteorological homogeneous regions it is a physical approach that requires site specific meteorological and geographical data this method is one of the most commonly used and accepted methods for pmp estimation which provides more reliable estimates when compared to other methods afzali gorouh et al 2018 boota et al 2018 fattahi et al 2011 the basis of pmp estimation is the maximisation of observed extreme precipitation using the relationship between observed representative precipitable water content and the theoretical maximum precipitable water content followed by the transposition of the maximised precipitations to ungauged regions the main steps involved in this approach are summarised in fig 2 3 1 1 selection of extreme rainfall events identification of a high efficiency storm involves the analysis of observed rainfall data and the selection of major storm events based on the assumption that the precipitations of the selected storms were operating at or close to maximum efficiency from the daily rainfall data the annual maximum daily rainfall amdr values were analysed and the largest amdr was selected as the most extreme rainfall event at each station a map of the amdr is provided in fig a2 in appendix a of the 1 629 available stations 380 stations were selected as initial representative stations for the 94 districts with an average of 4 stations per district these stations were selected based on the date of the occurrence of most extreme amdr firstly only stations where the greatest amdr occurred between 1950 and 2000 were considered for the representative stations as the temperature and relative humidity data available for the maximisation of the storm events was limited to this period secondly it was observed that often the most extreme amdr values recorded at close neighbouring stations resulted from the same storm event based on this observation where possible only stations where unique storms resulted in the largest amdr were chosen as such the stations selected represent a range of unique storm events within each district and are also well spatially distributed the locations of the 380 representative stations are shown in fig 3 3 1 2 moisture maximisation in this process the moisture factors of high efficiency storms are adjusted to their theoretical maximum storm efficiency is linked to the precipitable water content in the atmosphere abbs 1999 wmo 2009 precipitable water content is the quantity of water measured in a vertical column of the atmosphere that is potentially available for precipitation nws 1980 adjusting storms to their maximum efficiency is performed by multiplying the selected observed storm rainfall by the moisture maximisation ratio defined as rm wm ws where wm represents the maximum precipitable water content of the maximum persistent 12 h 100 kpa dew point for the date of the storm occurrence or the 15 days before and 15 days after the storm and ws is the precipitable water content estimated for the actual storm for the persistent 12 h 100 kpa dew point the precipitable water content can be estimated from the surface dew point temperature based on the assumption of a saturated atmosphere and a pseudo adiabatic lapse rate during a storm event using the corresponding dew point temperatures the precipitable water values are obtained from table a 1 3 in wmo 2009 the table provides precipitable water content mm as a function of 100 kpa dew point temperature oc as dew point temperature is not measured directly daily temperature t and relative humidity rh data were used to calculate daily maximum dew point temperatures td using eq 1 wanielista et al 1997 based on the time scale of the available t and rh data the daily 24 h td values were used as an alternative to the 12 h values as they provide minimal differences for this application thuy et al 2019 wmo 2009 1 t d r h 100 1 8 112 0 9 t 0 1 t 112 where td dew point temperature oc rh relative humidity and t surface temperature oc moisture maximisation ratios were determined for the 380 representative stations and applied to the selected amdr values to determine at site pmp estimates due to the limitation of the duration of the t and rh database many significant storm events that occurred outside of the 1950 2000 window could not be maximised in this way assuming that atmospheric moisture conditions associated with the drivers of similar storm events are translatable to adjacent locations within homogeneous rainfall districts in order to maximise all the extreme rainfall events selected in section 3 1 1 isolines of the moisture maximisation ratios calculated for the 380 representative stations were constructed by interpolation and spatially joined to the remaining stations to associate an rm value with every amdr these ratios were then applied to the amdrs at stations without t and rh data in order to maximise these events and generate at site pmp estimates at all 1629 locations there are various suggestions for limiting the moisture maximisation ratios in pmp estimation the concept of limiting the maximisation ratio is to maintain the original dynamics of a particular storm event hansen et al 1988 and setting upper boundaries may be recommended in order to not produce exaggerated pmp values lee et al 2016 however there is no scientific justification for limiting the moisture maximisation ratio rouhani and leconte 2016 and a study by papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2006 showed no evidence of upper bounds in atmospheric moisture or precipitation in australia upper limits have been chosen based on the analysis of actual storm events where the largest ratios were observed bureau of meteorology 2003 minty et al 1996 walland et al 2003 the limits chosen for australia have been adopted in other studies lee et al 2016 rousseau et al 2014 although this decision was not based on the actual storm characteristics of the study areas for this study the only limits placed on the moisture maximisation ratios are based on the rm values determined at the representative stations such that interpolated rm values applied to the remaining stations will not exceed the calculated values at the representative stations 3 1 3 transposition transposition of the maximised amdr events translates the meteorological characteristics of observed extreme storm events from gauged locations to locations without adequate records of major storm events due to the spatial distribution of the stations used in this study standard linear geo statistical interpolation methods such as inverse distance weighting idw performed poorly in translating the pmp estimates to ungauged locations and preserving the original sample point values to overcome this multiquadric radial basis functions mrbf which is a deterministic interpolation method widely used for interpolating meteorological data and often yields superior results degaetano and belcher 2007 has been used to transpose the at site pmp estimates to ungauged locations without compromising the at site pmp values mrbf provide a higher accuracy interpolation and are superior in preserving the original sample point values when compared to other commonly used geo statistical methods such as kriging bronowicka mielniczuk et al 2019 unlike kriging mrbf does not require variogram modelling which requires numerous inputs and is dependent on the application of advanced statistical concepts and tools a proper variographic study is difficult to perform in smaller data sets with irregular spatial distribution and inappropriate variogram modelling can yield highly inaccurate results rusu and rusu 2006 using mrbf interpolation the at site pmp estimates were transposed across the country to generate a 5 5 km gridded database for the 1 day pmp 3 2 isohyetal patterns and adjustment of the interpolated surface the use of the mrbf procedures aims to yield a model that will produce the smallest residual errors i e a model that will fit the actual data points used in the interpolation the best however these discrepancies between the actual pmps and the modelled values may result in different at site pmp values to those determined through the moisture maximisation process being obtained an example of such a case is depicted in fig 4 the ratios of the pmp estimated using the mrbf to the observed pmp were determined as the residuals the inverses of these residuals were then interpolated using the same approach used in the mrbf interpolation for the pmp estimates to generate a residual adjustment surface this residual adjustment surface was then applied to the estimated pmp surface to adjust the pmp surface locally to fit the at site values and globally to the ungauged locations in this way the surface was adjusted to fit the actual pmp values determined at the rainfall stations and the surrounding areas were adjusted according to the interpolated residual adjustment surface a graphical explanation of the technique used to adjust the residuals in the interpolated pmp surface is shown in fig 5 adjustment of the interpolated pmp estimates was vital as large differences between the at site pmps and the corresponding interpolated values would result in significant discrepancies in the pmp estimates residuals of as much as 30 were observed in the interpolated surface 4 results and discussion a storm maximisation and transposition approach was applied to daily rainfall data in south africa in order to determine 1 day pmp estimates for the entire country as shown in fig 6 the estimates vary across the country due to the various rainfall seasonality zones and corresponding rainfall drivers 4 1 consideration of extraordinary pmps estimating the pmp using hydro meteorological methods considers the physical atmospheric characteristics of specific storm events however taking into account atmospheric variables may result in unreasonably large pmps the selection of the high efficiency storms is based on the assumption that the precipitation efficiencies of the selected storms were near or at the maximum further maximisation of such events by taking into account the maximum potential atmospheric moisture conditions increases the potential rainfall depth to what is atmospherically feasible although pmp estimates may seem uncharacteristically large in some parts studies have shown that unprecedented extreme weather events in the order of magnitude of the pmp have occurred globally bureau of meteorology 2003 kappel 2019 micovic et al 2014 while the method applied in this study assumes that the selected rainfall events have relatively high efficiencies storms of greater efficiency may still occur in future typically extraordinary pmps are shown to occur in high rainfall producing regions in the eastern parts of the country and in instances where large pmps occur in locations uncharacteristic of the maps such as the central interior and western parts it is noted that the observed rainfall events that resulted in these pmps were significantly greater than what is typical for these particular locations furthermore these pmps do not result from a single rainfall station but rather several neighbouring stations which on analysis of the daily rainfall data are likely to be affected by the same storm events and have similar storm dates and magnitudes in addition a discordancy test hosking and wallis 1997 was performed using the amdr for each district and no discordant sites were identified the largest estimates are of particular interest for engineering design purposes according to the daily rainfall records the largest recorded 1 day rainfall depth is 670 mm at a site in the north eastern parts of the country with an map of around 1 100 mm the maximisation of this event has yielded the highest pmp value for the country with an rm of 2 7 applied to 670 mm yielding a pmp estimate of 1 820 mm the greatest recorded 24 h point rainfall depth in the world is 1 825 mm which occurred in 1966 in la réunion an island east of south africa wmo 1994 this island has an map of 860 mm once more indicating that extraordinary events uncharacteristic of the map can occur 4 2 consideration of large moisture maximisation ratios the limitation of the moisture maximisation ratio may be implemented in order to limit exaggerated pmp estimates however it is not known if the parameters that produce precipitation are upper bounded and if so how closely pmp estimates approach the theoretical limit micovic et al 2014 therefore limiting the corresponding atmospheric moisture conditions without scientific justification is arbitrary hence the moisture maximisation ratios were not limited arbitrarily for this study but rather based on the calculated values understanding that large moisture maximisation ratios can yield excessively high pmps several amdrs with associated rm values greater than 3 were investigated the amdrs at 17 stations as shown in fig 7 were found to be associated with well documented significant flooding events most of these stations were part of the 380 representative stations where the rm values were calculated based on the actual storm event data this indicates that the atmospheric moisture conditions associated with these types of rainfalls are possibly linked to flooding table b1 in appendix b summarises the details of the flooding associated with the rainfall events with large moisture maximisation ratios 4 3 comparison of new pmp values to hru pmp the hru guidelines provide depth area duration dad curves for the pmp for each meteorologically homogeneous region as defined in hru 1972 which are applicable at any location within the region the locations of the 380 representative stations were matched to the corresponding hru regions to make direct comparisons between the new 1 day pmps and the 1 day hru pmps a frequency distribution of the ratios of the newly derived pmps to the corresponding hru pmps are depicted in fig 8 where ratio of up to 1 1 indicates that the new pmp is equal to within 10 or less than the hru estimate and the upper limit ratios 2 6 indicate that the new pmp is greater than the hru pmp approximately 80 of the new pmps are greater than the corresponding hru estimates with some new estimates shown to be greater than 5 times the hru estimates it is noteworthy that at the particular sites where the new pmp is at least 5 times larger the most extreme events occurred after the period of record used for the hru estimates showing the impact of an updated record on pmp estimates although the hru pmps are applicable at any location within the region in reality the pmp can vary with location within the same homogeneous region or rainfall district as an example the stations in rainfall district 70 all fall within the same hru homogeneous region and as such a blanketed value for the hru pmp is applied across the region as depicted in fig 9 pmp estimates can vary even within the same region or district and applying a blanket value can result in over or under estimation of the pmp furthermore when the occurrence of the maximum amdrs selected for this study were within an overlapping window with the data record used in hru 1972 i e the 1950s comparisons of the storm events were done to check if it were possible that the same events were used for both studies in order to compare the pmps derived for the same storm events using two different methods only 40 of the rainfall events were found to occur in the overlapping window after analysing and comparing the rainfall depths for each of the 40 recorded storm events to the corresponding locations and rainfall depths in hru 1972 it was assumed that events selected for these stations were common for both studies based on this 75 of the newly derived pmps were found to be larger than the hru estimates an example of four stations is shown in fig 10 this indicates that even if the same storm events were analysed the differences between the two approaches yield different results with the newer approach in this study generally producing larger pmp estimates approximately 70 of the most extreme storm events used in this study occurred after the 1960s this highlights the importance of revising pmp estimates using updated and extended records overall the approach used in this study provides larger pmp estimates when compared to the hru estimates this is likely due to the many differences used in the new approach in instances where the new estimates are lower than the hru estimates this indicates that the previous pmp values may have been overestimated a summary of the difference between the hru methods and the methods used for this study is contained in table 1 from the summary the shortcomings of the old methods and the advantages of the new approach are clear and this gives an indication that the new approach undertaken in this study provides improved pmp estimates 4 4 comparison to the 1 500 year and 1 1000 year rainfalls the pmp defines the upper limit of extreme rainfall and is not associated with an exceedance probability although it may be exceeded in the future with longer datasets and improved estimation methods to evaluate if the estimated pmps can be considered as an upper limit of extreme rainfalls the pmp has been compared to the 1 500 and 1 1000 year rainfall estimates derived using the generalised extreme value gev distribution fitted to the 1 day amdr data series using the method of l moments hosking and wallis 1997 the gev is the most appropriate distribution for extreme rainfall estimation in south africa smithers 1996 smithers and schulze 2000a b the maps of the 1 500 and 1 1000 year rainfalls compared with the pmp are shown in fig 11 a c generally the pmp is greater than the 1 1000 year rainfall however occasionally the pmp is exceeded by the 1 500 and the 1 1000 year estimates as summarised in fig 11 d further analysis to estimate the actual return period associated with the pmp is recommended for future research 5 conclusion and recommendations the pmp is an important consideration for engineering design particularly for the design of high hazard hydraulic structures with the availability of an updated rainfall record and the development of new approaches globally there is an urgent need to update the pmp estimates for south africa in this paper a storm maximisation and transposition approach was used to estimate the 1 day pmp for south africa the use of an extended rainfall database and modernised methodology has produced improved pmps compared to the previous estimates the definition of the pmp implies a zero probability of exceedance however many studies have shown that previously derived pmp estimates have been exceeded by new events which are not typical or characteristic of the region or map furthermore the maximisation of such uncharacteristic extreme rainfalls may result in extraordinary pmps the pmp is based on extreme rainfalls which have been documented up to a certain point and should be updated periodically to include new extreme rainfalls large moisture maximisation ratios may also result in unusually large pmps however these ratios are based on actual storm event data and indicate the realistic potential atmospheric moisture available to cause a pmp event as the climate variables which cause precipitation are unbounded imposing an upper bound or limit on the moisture maximisation ratio is not realistic and cannot be justified rouhani and leconte 2016 propose that if such limits exit they would be based on climate variables this study presents 1 day pmps for south africa however sub daily and multi day pmps are also needed for engineering design the limited availability of sub daily rainfall data in south africa prevents the estimation of reliable and accurate sub daily pmps multipliers for sub daily storm durations may be applied to the 1 day pmps to estimate sub daily pmps due to the limitation in the data available to maximise multi day extreme rainfalls it is not possible to determine multi day pmps using the methodology in this paper given current data availability policies significant funds will be required to purchase large quantities of temperature and relative humidity or dew point temperature data associated with multi day rainfall events for all stations across the country to address this it is recommended that relationships between the 1 day pmp and 1 day high return period design rainfall estimates be determined and these relationships be used to investigate possible methods of obtaining multi day pmps to gain insight to the possible exceedance probabilities of the pmp it is recommended that the relationships between the 1 day pmps and 1 day high return period design rainfall estimates may give an indication of the return period that could possibly be associated with the pmp a scientific basis to limit the moisture maximisation ratios should be investigated implementing thresholds on atmospheric moisture conditions should not be arbitrary but rather site specific time dependent and a function of storm characteristics an updated hydro meteorological database is critical to the success of estimating

8289,study region south africa study focus the probable maximum precipitation pmp is the theoretical upper limit of extreme rainfall and is widely used by engineers and hydrologists to determine the probable maximum flood pmf which is critical for the design and risk management of high hazard hydraulic structures in south africa the pmp was last estimated over 50 years ago using approximately 30 years of data since then numerous severe rainfall events have occurred which exceed presently available pmp estimates despite this the outdated estimates are currently used in professional practice in addition modernised methods have been developed and applied globally to estimate the pmp highlighting the need to update the pmp estimates for south africa this paper aims to present updated and modernised pmps for the country new hydrological insights for the region using updated rainfall records and a storm maximisation and transposition approach this paper provides new 1 day pmp estimates for the country the importance of revising the pmp to include new extreme rainfall events is highlighted as the majority of the events used in this study occurred after the publication of the previous estimates the use of extended rainfall records and modernised methods produces generally larger pmp estimates compared to the previous estimates and continual revision of the pmp is recommend to include new extreme rainfall events keywords extreme rainfall probable maximum precipitation south africa storm maximisation 1 introduction the probable maximum precipitation pmp is an extreme rainfall quantity which represents the maximum depth of precipitation that could possibly occur in a specific area and for a specific duration wmo 2009 the pmp is commonly used to derive the probable maximum flood pmf which is used by engineers and hydrologists in the planning design and risk assessment of high hazard hydraulic structures chavan and srinivas 2015 wang 1984 the south african national committee on large dams sancold guidelines for the estimation of the pmf is dependent on the pmp sancold 1991 numerous methods have been developed globally to estimate the pmp in south africa the pmp is currently determined using the hydrological research unit hru report no 1 72 hru 1972 which was developed based on approximately 30 years of rainfall data from the 1930s to 1960s using a total of 170 storms across the country for small area storms the pmp is presented as an envelope of maximum observed storm values and for large area storms the pmp is presented as depth area duration dad curves for meteorologically homogeneous regions cullis et al 2007 since the publication of these guidelines there has been no update in the development of pmp estimation in south africa and these guidelines are still used in professional practice today studies have shown that numerous extreme rainfall events have occurred since this publication which have exceeded the pmp estimates cullis et al 2007 görgens et al 2007 these pmp estimates may thus no longer be the best estimates of extreme rainfall and require urgent updating and modernisation smithers et al 2014 the use of outdated pmp estimates potentially affects the accuracy of pmf estimations and consequently the design of high hazard hydraulic structures the world meteorological organisation wmo has published a number of guidelines which describe methods for estimating the pmp the latest wmo guideline published in 2009 provides two approaches for estimating the pmp i hydro meteorological methods which maximise rainfall events based on atmospheric moisture conditions and ii statistical methods which can be used when sufficient meteorological data are not available wmo 2009 pmps derived using hydro meteorological methods produce reliable and precise estimates fattahi et al 2011 salas et al 2014 wmo 2009 and are most widely applied globally lee et al 2016 johnson and smithers 2019 provide a comprehensive review of various methods for estimating the pmp the aim of this paper is to present new pmp estimates for south africa using an updated database and modernised methods the objectives of this paper are to i report on the collation of an updated hydro meteorological database ii estimate the pmp using appropriate hydro meteorological methods prescribed by the wmo and iii to critically evaluate the newly derived pmp estimates 2 study area and data this section contains a brief description of the rainfall characteristics of the study area and detailed information of the data used to derive the pmps this study focusses on the estimation of pmp for the entire country south africa is a semi arid with an uneven spatial distribution of rainfall and most of the country receiving an average of less than 500 mm of rainfall annually the countries latitudinal location lies between the tropical subtropical and temperate pressure systems braun et al 2017 which results in three rainfall seasonality zones across the country summer rainfall zone october to march winter rainfall zone april to september and year round rainfall zone roffe et al 2019 rainfall varies considerably across the country with the summer rainfall zones in the east experiencing the greatest rainfalls with a mean annual precipitation map in excess of 800 mm and gradually decreasing westward schulze 2011 2 1 homogeneous rainfall districts homogeneous rainfall districts obtained from the south african weather service saws were used as a basis for this study the development of these districts started in the 1930s where homogeneous regions were divided into rainfall districts based on the statistics of maximum rainfalls and the seasonal distribution of precipitation schumann and hofmeyer 1938 and calculations of district rainfall has continually improved over the years landman et al 2006 south african weather bureau 1960 1972 the latest improvement occurred in 2016 and this entailed that at least 90 of the rainfall data of a month for a station should be available before the station is included in the calculations presently there are 94 homogeneous rainfall districts as delineated in fig a1 in appendix a 2 2 hydro meteorological data 2 2 1 rainfall for estimating the pmp a high quality database containing the most extreme rainfall events is required daily rainfall data from 1 629 stations across the country with at least 40 years of quality controlled daily records were selected for this study as shown in fig 1 a the annual maximum daily rainfall data from smithers and schulze 2000b was the primary source of data the majority of which was contributed by the south african weather service saws and the agricultural research council arc the data record contained in the database was limited up to the year 2000 and additional saws station data were obtained from the university of cape town climate systems analysis group csag and used to extend approximately 50 of the existing database with data for the period 2000 2010 thus the end dates for the rainfall records used in this study range between 2000 and 2010 at the time of the study funds were not available to purchase the full dataset from saws to update the database up to 2018 fig 1 b shows the distribution of the record lengths for the stations used in this study 2 2 2 temperature and relative humidity daily estimates of temperature t and relative humidity rh data were obtained from the gridded database developed by schulze and maharaj 2004 and were used to determine daily dew point temperatures td values for this study however the duration of t and rh data available through the gridded database is limited to the period 1950 2000 data from other sources were not available at the time of the study and funds were not available to purchase these data from saws 3 methodology 3 1 pmp estimation using the generalised estimation method for this study the generalised estimation method prescribed by wmo 2009 has been adopted to estimate the 1 day pmps for south africa the generalised estimation method is a hydro meteorological approach used for estimating the pmp for large meteorological homogeneous regions it is a physical approach that requires site specific meteorological and geographical data this method is one of the most commonly used and accepted methods for pmp estimation which provides more reliable estimates when compared to other methods afzali gorouh et al 2018 boota et al 2018 fattahi et al 2011 the basis of pmp estimation is the maximisation of observed extreme precipitation using the relationship between observed representative precipitable water content and the theoretical maximum precipitable water content followed by the transposition of the maximised precipitations to ungauged regions the main steps involved in this approach are summarised in fig 2 3 1 1 selection of extreme rainfall events identification of a high efficiency storm involves the analysis of observed rainfall data and the selection of major storm events based on the assumption that the precipitations of the selected storms were operating at or close to maximum efficiency from the daily rainfall data the annual maximum daily rainfall amdr values were analysed and the largest amdr was selected as the most extreme rainfall event at each station a map of the amdr is provided in fig a2 in appendix a of the 1 629 available stations 380 stations were selected as initial representative stations for the 94 districts with an average of 4 stations per district these stations were selected based on the date of the occurrence of most extreme amdr firstly only stations where the greatest amdr occurred between 1950 and 2000 were considered for the representative stations as the temperature and relative humidity data available for the maximisation of the storm events was limited to this period secondly it was observed that often the most extreme amdr values recorded at close neighbouring stations resulted from the same storm event based on this observation where possible only stations where unique storms resulted in the largest amdr were chosen as such the stations selected represent a range of unique storm events within each district and are also well spatially distributed the locations of the 380 representative stations are shown in fig 3 3 1 2 moisture maximisation in this process the moisture factors of high efficiency storms are adjusted to their theoretical maximum storm efficiency is linked to the precipitable water content in the atmosphere abbs 1999 wmo 2009 precipitable water content is the quantity of water measured in a vertical column of the atmosphere that is potentially available for precipitation nws 1980 adjusting storms to their maximum efficiency is performed by multiplying the selected observed storm rainfall by the moisture maximisation ratio defined as rm wm ws where wm represents the maximum precipitable water content of the maximum persistent 12 h 100 kpa dew point for the date of the storm occurrence or the 15 days before and 15 days after the storm and ws is the precipitable water content estimated for the actual storm for the persistent 12 h 100 kpa dew point the precipitable water content can be estimated from the surface dew point temperature based on the assumption of a saturated atmosphere and a pseudo adiabatic lapse rate during a storm event using the corresponding dew point temperatures the precipitable water values are obtained from table a 1 3 in wmo 2009 the table provides precipitable water content mm as a function of 100 kpa dew point temperature oc as dew point temperature is not measured directly daily temperature t and relative humidity rh data were used to calculate daily maximum dew point temperatures td using eq 1 wanielista et al 1997 based on the time scale of the available t and rh data the daily 24 h td values were used as an alternative to the 12 h values as they provide minimal differences for this application thuy et al 2019 wmo 2009 1 t d r h 100 1 8 112 0 9 t 0 1 t 112 where td dew point temperature oc rh relative humidity and t surface temperature oc moisture maximisation ratios were determined for the 380 representative stations and applied to the selected amdr values to determine at site pmp estimates due to the limitation of the duration of the t and rh database many significant storm events that occurred outside of the 1950 2000 window could not be maximised in this way assuming that atmospheric moisture conditions associated with the drivers of similar storm events are translatable to adjacent locations within homogeneous rainfall districts in order to maximise all the extreme rainfall events selected in section 3 1 1 isolines of the moisture maximisation ratios calculated for the 380 representative stations were constructed by interpolation and spatially joined to the remaining stations to associate an rm value with every amdr these ratios were then applied to the amdrs at stations without t and rh data in order to maximise these events and generate at site pmp estimates at all 1629 locations there are various suggestions for limiting the moisture maximisation ratios in pmp estimation the concept of limiting the maximisation ratio is to maintain the original dynamics of a particular storm event hansen et al 1988 and setting upper boundaries may be recommended in order to not produce exaggerated pmp values lee et al 2016 however there is no scientific justification for limiting the moisture maximisation ratio rouhani and leconte 2016 and a study by papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2006 showed no evidence of upper bounds in atmospheric moisture or precipitation in australia upper limits have been chosen based on the analysis of actual storm events where the largest ratios were observed bureau of meteorology 2003 minty et al 1996 walland et al 2003 the limits chosen for australia have been adopted in other studies lee et al 2016 rousseau et al 2014 although this decision was not based on the actual storm characteristics of the study areas for this study the only limits placed on the moisture maximisation ratios are based on the rm values determined at the representative stations such that interpolated rm values applied to the remaining stations will not exceed the calculated values at the representative stations 3 1 3 transposition transposition of the maximised amdr events translates the meteorological characteristics of observed extreme storm events from gauged locations to locations without adequate records of major storm events due to the spatial distribution of the stations used in this study standard linear geo statistical interpolation methods such as inverse distance weighting idw performed poorly in translating the pmp estimates to ungauged locations and preserving the original sample point values to overcome this multiquadric radial basis functions mrbf which is a deterministic interpolation method widely used for interpolating meteorological data and often yields superior results degaetano and belcher 2007 has been used to transpose the at site pmp estimates to ungauged locations without compromising the at site pmp values mrbf provide a higher accuracy interpolation and are superior in preserving the original sample point values when compared to other commonly used geo statistical methods such as kriging bronowicka mielniczuk et al 2019 unlike kriging mrbf does not require variogram modelling which requires numerous inputs and is dependent on the application of advanced statistical concepts and tools a proper variographic study is difficult to perform in smaller data sets with irregular spatial distribution and inappropriate variogram modelling can yield highly inaccurate results rusu and rusu 2006 using mrbf interpolation the at site pmp estimates were transposed across the country to generate a 5 5 km gridded database for the 1 day pmp 3 2 isohyetal patterns and adjustment of the interpolated surface the use of the mrbf procedures aims to yield a model that will produce the smallest residual errors i e a model that will fit the actual data points used in the interpolation the best however these discrepancies between the actual pmps and the modelled values may result in different at site pmp values to those determined through the moisture maximisation process being obtained an example of such a case is depicted in fig 4 the ratios of the pmp estimated using the mrbf to the observed pmp were determined as the residuals the inverses of these residuals were then interpolated using the same approach used in the mrbf interpolation for the pmp estimates to generate a residual adjustment surface this residual adjustment surface was then applied to the estimated pmp surface to adjust the pmp surface locally to fit the at site values and globally to the ungauged locations in this way the surface was adjusted to fit the actual pmp values determined at the rainfall stations and the surrounding areas were adjusted according to the interpolated residual adjustment surface a graphical explanation of the technique used to adjust the residuals in the interpolated pmp surface is shown in fig 5 adjustment of the interpolated pmp estimates was vital as large differences between the at site pmps and the corresponding interpolated values would result in significant discrepancies in the pmp estimates residuals of as much as 30 were observed in the interpolated surface 4 results and discussion a storm maximisation and transposition approach was applied to daily rainfall data in south africa in order to determine 1 day pmp estimates for the entire country as shown in fig 6 the estimates vary across the country due to the various rainfall seasonality zones and corresponding rainfall drivers 4 1 consideration of extraordinary pmps estimating the pmp using hydro meteorological methods considers the physical atmospheric characteristics of specific storm events however taking into account atmospheric variables may result in unreasonably large pmps the selection of the high efficiency storms is based on the assumption that the precipitation efficiencies of the selected storms were near or at the maximum further maximisation of such events by taking into account the maximum potential atmospheric moisture conditions increases the potential rainfall depth to what is atmospherically feasible although pmp estimates may seem uncharacteristically large in some parts studies have shown that unprecedented extreme weather events in the order of magnitude of the pmp have occurred globally bureau of meteorology 2003 kappel 2019 micovic et al 2014 while the method applied in this study assumes that the selected rainfall events have relatively high efficiencies storms of greater efficiency may still occur in future typically extraordinary pmps are shown to occur in high rainfall producing regions in the eastern parts of the country and in instances where large pmps occur in locations uncharacteristic of the maps such as the central interior and western parts it is noted that the observed rainfall events that resulted in these pmps were significantly greater than what is typical for these particular locations furthermore these pmps do not result from a single rainfall station but rather several neighbouring stations which on analysis of the daily rainfall data are likely to be affected by the same storm events and have similar storm dates and magnitudes in addition a discordancy test hosking and wallis 1997 was performed using the amdr for each district and no discordant sites were identified the largest estimates are of particular interest for engineering design purposes according to the daily rainfall records the largest recorded 1 day rainfall depth is 670 mm at a site in the north eastern parts of the country with an map of around 1 100 mm the maximisation of this event has yielded the highest pmp value for the country with an rm of 2 7 applied to 670 mm yielding a pmp estimate of 1 820 mm the greatest recorded 24 h point rainfall depth in the world is 1 825 mm which occurred in 1966 in la réunion an island east of south africa wmo 1994 this island has an map of 860 mm once more indicating that extraordinary events uncharacteristic of the map can occur 4 2 consideration of large moisture maximisation ratios the limitation of the moisture maximisation ratio may be implemented in order to limit exaggerated pmp estimates however it is not known if the parameters that produce precipitation are upper bounded and if so how closely pmp estimates approach the theoretical limit micovic et al 2014 therefore limiting the corresponding atmospheric moisture conditions without scientific justification is arbitrary hence the moisture maximisation ratios were not limited arbitrarily for this study but rather based on the calculated values understanding that large moisture maximisation ratios can yield excessively high pmps several amdrs with associated rm values greater than 3 were investigated the amdrs at 17 stations as shown in fig 7 were found to be associated with well documented significant flooding events most of these stations were part of the 380 representative stations where the rm values were calculated based on the actual storm event data this indicates that the atmospheric moisture conditions associated with these types of rainfalls are possibly linked to flooding table b1 in appendix b summarises the details of the flooding associated with the rainfall events with large moisture maximisation ratios 4 3 comparison of new pmp values to hru pmp the hru guidelines provide depth area duration dad curves for the pmp for each meteorologically homogeneous region as defined in hru 1972 which are applicable at any location within the region the locations of the 380 representative stations were matched to the corresponding hru regions to make direct comparisons between the new 1 day pmps and the 1 day hru pmps a frequency distribution of the ratios of the newly derived pmps to the corresponding hru pmps are depicted in fig 8 where ratio of up to 1 1 indicates that the new pmp is equal to within 10 or less than the hru estimate and the upper limit ratios 2 6 indicate that the new pmp is greater than the hru pmp approximately 80 of the new pmps are greater than the corresponding hru estimates with some new estimates shown to be greater than 5 times the hru estimates it is noteworthy that at the particular sites where the new pmp is at least 5 times larger the most extreme events occurred after the period of record used for the hru estimates showing the impact of an updated record on pmp estimates although the hru pmps are applicable at any location within the region in reality the pmp can vary with location within the same homogeneous region or rainfall district as an example the stations in rainfall district 70 all fall within the same hru homogeneous region and as such a blanketed value for the hru pmp is applied across the region as depicted in fig 9 pmp estimates can vary even within the same region or district and applying a blanket value can result in over or under estimation of the pmp furthermore when the occurrence of the maximum amdrs selected for this study were within an overlapping window with the data record used in hru 1972 i e the 1950s comparisons of the storm events were done to check if it were possible that the same events were used for both studies in order to compare the pmps derived for the same storm events using two different methods only 40 of the rainfall events were found to occur in the overlapping window after analysing and comparing the rainfall depths for each of the 40 recorded storm events to the corresponding locations and rainfall depths in hru 1972 it was assumed that events selected for these stations were common for both studies based on this 75 of the newly derived pmps were found to be larger than the hru estimates an example of four stations is shown in fig 10 this indicates that even if the same storm events were analysed the differences between the two approaches yield different results with the newer approach in this study generally producing larger pmp estimates approximately 70 of the most extreme storm events used in this study occurred after the 1960s this highlights the importance of revising pmp estimates using updated and extended records overall the approach used in this study provides larger pmp estimates when compared to the hru estimates this is likely due to the many differences used in the new approach in instances where the new estimates are lower than the hru estimates this indicates that the previous pmp values may have been overestimated a summary of the difference between the hru methods and the methods used for this study is contained in table 1 from the summary the shortcomings of the old methods and the advantages of the new approach are clear and this gives an indication that the new approach undertaken in this study provides improved pmp estimates 4 4 comparison to the 1 500 year and 1 1000 year rainfalls the pmp defines the upper limit of extreme rainfall and is not associated with an exceedance probability although it may be exceeded in the future with longer datasets and improved estimation methods to evaluate if the estimated pmps can be considered as an upper limit of extreme rainfalls the pmp has been compared to the 1 500 and 1 1000 year rainfall estimates derived using the generalised extreme value gev distribution fitted to the 1 day amdr data series using the method of l moments hosking and wallis 1997 the gev is the most appropriate distribution for extreme rainfall estimation in south africa smithers 1996 smithers and schulze 2000a b the maps of the 1 500 and 1 1000 year rainfalls compared with the pmp are shown in fig 11 a c generally the pmp is greater than the 1 1000 year rainfall however occasionally the pmp is exceeded by the 1 500 and the 1 1000 year estimates as summarised in fig 11 d further analysis to estimate the actual return period associated with the pmp is recommended for future research 5 conclusion and recommendations the pmp is an important consideration for engineering design particularly for the design of high hazard hydraulic structures with the availability of an updated rainfall record and the development of new approaches globally there is an urgent need to update the pmp estimates for south africa in this paper a storm maximisation and transposition approach was used to estimate the 1 day pmp for south africa the use of an extended rainfall database and modernised methodology has produced improved pmps compared to the previous estimates the definition of the pmp implies a zero probability of exceedance however many studies have shown that previously derived pmp estimates have been exceeded by new events which are not typical or characteristic of the region or map furthermore the maximisation of such uncharacteristic extreme rainfalls may result in extraordinary pmps the pmp is based on extreme rainfalls which have been documented up to a certain point and should be updated periodically to include new extreme rainfalls large moisture maximisation ratios may also result in unusually large pmps however these ratios are based on actual storm event data and indicate the realistic potential atmospheric moisture available to cause a pmp event as the climate variables which cause precipitation are unbounded imposing an upper bound or limit on the moisture maximisation ratio is not realistic and cannot be justified rouhani and leconte 2016 propose that if such limits exit they would be based on climate variables this study presents 1 day pmps for south africa however sub daily and multi day pmps are also needed for engineering design the limited availability of sub daily rainfall data in south africa prevents the estimation of reliable and accurate sub daily pmps multipliers for sub daily storm durations may be applied to the 1 day pmps to estimate sub daily pmps due to the limitation in the data available to maximise multi day extreme rainfalls it is not possible to determine multi day pmps using the methodology in this paper given current data availability policies significant funds will be required to purchase large quantities of temperature and relative humidity or dew point temperature data associated with multi day rainfall events for all stations across the country to address this it is recommended that relationships between the 1 day pmp and 1 day high return period design rainfall estimates be determined and these relationships be used to investigate possible methods of obtaining multi day pmps to gain insight to the possible exceedance probabilities of the pmp it is recommended that the relationships between the 1 day pmps and 1 day high return period design rainfall estimates may give an indication of the return period that could possibly be associated with the pmp a scientific basis to limit the moisture maximisation ratios should be investigated implementing thresholds on atmospheric moisture conditions should not be arbitrary but rather site specific time dependent and a function of storm characteristics an updated hydro meteorological database is critical to the success of estimating accurate pmps such a database should be continually updated and used to revise the pmp following the occurrence of new extreme rainfall events this study and the use of the pmps in the design of hydraulic structures have been impacted by the lack of freely available rainfall data and climate data in south africa funding this research was supported by the department of higher education and
