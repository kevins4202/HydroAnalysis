energy and power engineering xi an jiaotong university 28 xianning west road xi an 710049 china corresponding authors supercritical water oxidation scwo as a promising technology for treating organic wastewater and sludge has attracted the attention of many scholars nitrogen containing organics are refractory substances that widely exist in industrial waste and their effective degradation is of great significance to the environment in this paper the treatment effects reaction kinetics and migration and transformation pathways of various nitrogen containing organics amino group nitro group mixed group and nitrogen heteroatom under scwo conditions are summarized and the influences of the reaction temperature oxidant type and concentration residence time and initial concentration of organics on the degradation of organics are also discussed nh3 n is the primary intermediate product produced during the oxidation process of the amino group and nitrogen heteroatom organics and the further degradation of nh3 n is the limiting step for the whole reaction this paper focuses on the relevant strengthening technologies used to enhance the degradation of nh3 n including heterogeneous catalytic oxidation with reactor wall or metal oxides co oxidation with auxiliary fuels such as methanol ethanol isopropanol and glycol strong oxidation with no3 or no2 and segmented oxidation by multi injection of oxidants or fuels in addition in order to achieve the complete removal of nh3 n and cod synergistically under relatively mild scwo conditions avoid the formation of nox no3 and no2 and convert organic nitrogen into environmentally friendly products such as n2 and n2o further research requirements and challenges are introduced graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords supercritical water oxidation nitrogen containing organics ammonia nitrogen reaction mechanism process enhancement 1 introduction the rapid development of industry has caused serious environmental pollution problems and the safety of the ecological environment has become a key issue worldwide although the annual discharge of industrial wastewater and sludge is decreasing gradually the total emissions remain high for example the total discharge of industrial wastewater and sludge is still of the order of tens of billions of tons in china which mainly originates from petrochemical paper printing and dyeing pharmaceutical and other industrial fields most of this wastewater and sludge contains nitrogen containing organics such as sulfonamides and quinolones in pharmaceutical wastewater pyridine and quinoline in pesticide wastewater pyridine indole and amide in coking wastewater and pyridine aniline and nitrobenzene in printing and dyeing wastewater in addition high concentrations of organics nh3 n heavy metals and salinity and poor biodegradability are also the main characteristics of industrial wastewater and sludge these wastes are not only difficult to degrade in the environment but also highly toxic to humans as they can adversely affect the blood and nervous system and cause acute poisoning cancer or even death with long term exposure therefore achieving the efficient degradation of nitrogen containing organics is of great significance to humans and the environment conventional methods used to treat nitrogen containing organics are physicochemical methods such as adsorption extraction and membrane separation hasar 2009 biochemical methods joshiba et al 2019 incineration li 2005 and advanced oxidation technology such as chemical oxidation electrochemical oxidation and wet oxidation gautam et al 2019 oliviero et al 2003 however physicochemical methods are usually applied as a pretreatment technology and are combined with biochemical methods a few hours of operation time or a catalyzer are required for chemical and wet oxidation to effectively degrade nitrogen containing organics although nitrogen containing organics could be treated completely by incineration the secondary pollutant nox transformed from organic nitrogen is generated and must be subsequently treated supercritical water oxidation scwo proposed by professor modell of mit in the 1980s is a promising technology for treating industrial wastewater and sludge modell 1980 that can homogeneously dissolve organics as well as oxygen transform the carbon hydrogen and nitrogen in the organics into harmless co2 h2o and n2 respectively savage 1999 convert the heterocyclic atoms chlorine sulfur and phosphorus into corresponding inorganic acids or salts armellini et al 1994 and mineralize and deposit heavy metals into stable solid residue compared with the conventional methods mentioned above scwo has the advantages of a rapid reaction rate high removal efficiency environmental friendliness and high economic efficiency the scwo system can also realize auto thermal equilibrium when the mass concentration of organics exceeds 3 wt cocero et al 2002 a basic diagram of scwo is shown in fig 1 including feedstock pretreatment oxidant pretreatment scwo reaction cooling and energy recovery of products depressurization and separation and recovery of products in the early development stage of scwo it was mainly used to destroy dangerous military wastes such as chemical weapons nuclear consumables waste ammunition and harmful waste liquid of warships cohen et al 1998 scwo has aroused the wide interest and attention of scholars owing to its advantages including scholars from mit helling and tester 1987 the university of michigan martino and savage 1999b university of texas li et al 1991 tokyo university shimoda et al 2016 tsinghua university xiang et al 2002 zhejiang university zou et al 2013 chinese academy of sciences chen et al 2015 shanghai jiaotong university yang et al 2018b tianjin university zhang et al 2015 and xi an jiaotong university xu et al 2012 the research contents have covered degradation rules reaction mechanisms reaction kinetics and reaction models of refractory organic compounds such as dioxin zhao et al 2014 polychlorinated biphenyls hatakeda et al 1999 phenol thornton and savage 1992 acetic acid meyer et al 1995 and nitrobenzene zhang and hua 2003 industrial wastewater such as coking wastewater du et al 2013 semi coke wastewater li et al 2020 landfill leachate gong et al 2018 alcohol distillery wastewater goto et al 1998 hospital wastewater stavbar et al 2017 pesticide wastewater xu et al 2015 and olive wastewater erkonak et al 2008 and solid waste such as industrial sludge zhang et al 2017 municipal sludge qian et al 2016 spoiled food jin et al 2001 and human metabolites wang et al 1997 at present scwo has been commercialized in many countries to treat different types of waste for example ecowaste technologies in the usa built a 3 8 ton d scwo device to treat simple organics such as hydrocarbons and amines in 1994 general atomics in the usa established scwo plants with different scales to degrade industrial wastewater pink water chemical weapons explosives and propellants from 2001 to 2011 marrone 2013 and hanwha chemical in south korea modar in japan and hydrothermal oxidation option in france have set up scwo units to process wastewater from dnt and tpa production melamine wastewater laboratory wastewater and food industry wastewater marrone 2013 as for sludge hydroprocessing supercritical fluids international and superwater solutions in the usa chematur engineering ab in sweden and xi an jiaotong university in china have all built commercial scwo devices with different processing capacities griffith and raymond 2002 schmieder and abeln 2015 stavbar et al 2017 xu et al 2012 in addition innoveox in france chematur engineering in the uk modar and sri international in japan and foster wheeler in the usa have also established plants to degrade hazardous industrial waste spent catalysts semiconductor manufacturing wastes pcbs smokes and dyes marrone 2013 clearly the feasibility of using scwo for the treatment of different organic wastes has been confirmed in experimental and industrial conditions however for the nitrogen containing organics and industrial wastewater and sludge with high concentrations of nh3 n besides the effective degradation of cod or toc in organics the removal of nitrogen should also be of serious concern as it can greatly threaten the function of the water body therefore in this paper the treatment effects and kinetic parameters of different types of nitrogen containing organics and nh3 n in the scwo environment are summarized and the influence of the reaction temperature oxidant type and concentration residence time and initial concentration of organics on the degradation of organics are discussed the migration and transformation pathways of organic nitrogen in different nitrogen containing groups are analyzed to understand the mechanisms of degradation furthermore measures including catalytic supercritical water oxidation cscwo co oxidation with auxiliary fuels strong oxidation with nitrates and nitrites and segmented oxidation are elaborated in detail to enhance the process of treating cod or toc and nh3 n synchronously in one scwo system under relatively mild reaction conditions and the corresponding problems and challenges are introduced 2 degradation of typical nitrogen containing organics by supercritical water oxidation 2 1 treatment effect and reaction kinetics of different nitrogen containing organics the focus of scwo in the treatment of nitrogen containing organics can be divided into four aspects namely 1 amine organics such as methylamine aniline ethylenediamine and isopropylamine 2 nitro organics such as nitrobenzene nitrophenol and aliphatic nitro compounds 3 mixed group amine and nitro organics such as nitroaniline and 4 heteroatom organics such as pyridine quinoline and acrylonitrile which are abundant in industrial organic waste therefore we summarized the treatment effects and reaction kinetic parameters calculated by different models such as the pseudo first order non linear regression and multi variable non linear least squares models of various nitrogen containing organics under scwo or cscwo conditions in the past few years as shown in tables 1 and 2 the reaction rates of organics are described by the global power law reaction rate expression as shown in eq 1 the reaction order of water is approximately equal to 0 owing to the large quantities of water in the scwo system mateos et al 2005 1 d c d t k 0 c a o b h 2 o c a exp

initial concentration of organics mol l o initial concentration of oxidants mol l h2o concentration of water mol l a reaction order of organics b reaction order of oxidants c reaction order of water as concluded from table 1 more than 90 removal efficiency of most of the nitrogen containing organics or their concentrations of cod or toc could be obtained under typical scwo conditions 500 600 c 24 28 mpa with o2 or h2o2 oxidants it is known that scwo follows the free radical reaction mechanism which mainly includes initiation propagation and termination stages and the major reaction pathways are described in table 3 boock and klein 1993 croiset et al 1997 li et al 1991 more concretely the scwo reaction is initiated by the hydrogen abstraction between organics and oxidants furthermore the steps of chain propagation between radicals and molecules including oxygen addition to a radical to form peroxy radicals ro2 which could react with initial organics to produce hydroperoxides rooh by hydrogen abstraction and isomerization intramolecular hydrogen abstraction reactions increase the stability of free radicals with no change in the concentration the β scission reaction breaks the weak β bond in the radical center and generates some smaller radicals and molecules with double bonds the reactions in the propagation stage maintain balance in the consumption and formation of radicals furthermore the disproportionation reaction non terminating radical recombination between ro2 results in the formation of ro which also transfers the reaction chain in addition the generated rooh will decompose to produce ro and hydroxyl radicals oh finally radicals such as r ro and roo will collide to form stable molecules by recombination and or disproportionation reactions in the termination step the total concentration of radicals is determined by the initiation branching and termination stages clearly oh is the primary active component which could react with almost all of the organics furthermore the operation parameters such as reaction temperature the type and concentration of oxidant residence time and initial concentration of organics could all influence the production of oh to a certain extent but the reaction pressure has an insignificant effect when it reaches the supercritical pressure chang and liu 2007 liu et al 2009 oshima et al 1998 2 1 1 influence of reaction temperature the reaction temperature has a positive influence on the treatment of nitrogen containing organics regardless of whether they have amino nitro or nitrogen heteroatoms and the degradation efficiency of cod or toc significantly increases with the increase in the reaction temperature dong et al 2015a gong et al 2016 ma et al 2012 yang et al 2018a gong et al 2016 found that the toc removal efficiency of quinazoline increased from 91 4 to 96 2 when the reaction temperature increased from 400 c to 600 c and a higher temperature was favored to produce less co and more co2 the maximum yield of co2 8 55 mol mol which seemed to approach a constant value was obtained at 600 c similar results were also obtained by zhou et al 2013 who explored the scwo of copper complex ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid cu ii edta and found that a higher temperature improved the conversion of toc 77 4 at 420 c and 99 0 at 500 c and decreased the production of co by increasing the oxidation rate of co and changing the reaction pathways furthermore ren et al 2019 displayed that the scwo reaction could be initiated earlier at a higher temperature because the co2 yield was high at 480 c and 510 c while it was less than 10 at 420 c and 450 c within 2 min yang et al 2018c studied the influence of temperature on the treatment of 44 nitrogen containing compounds including amino nitro nitrogen heteroatom diazo and mixed group organics and found that the toc removal efficiency increased sharply as the temperature increased from 350 c to 500 c which was in the range of 80 to 100 and then remained stable after 500 c furthermore diazo organics obtained the highest toc removal efficiency because it was easily attacked by oh the reasons for these results could be divided into three aspects first the increasing temperature could increase the percentage of activated molecules such as oh and enhance the effective collision between activated molecules such as oh and r thereby improving the reaction rate second for the refractory organics or intermediate products with higher activation energies increasing the reaction temperature could even exceed the activation energy barrier of these substances thereby leading to an active reaction and effective removal chang and liu 2007 chen et al 2001 indicated that more than 90 removal efficiency could be achieved only when the reaction temperature reached 600 c and 650 c for aniline and nitrobenzene respectively third the increase in the reaction temperature also has a negative effect on the reaction rate because the density of water will decrease under the fixed reaction pressure which will decrease the concentration of reactants and result in a lower reaction rate dong et al 2015a nevertheless the positive effect of the reaction temperature still plays a more dominant role than the negative effect and a higher temperature contributes to the degradation of organics 2 1 2 influence of oxidants the oxidants commonly utilized to treat nitrogen containing organics in the scwo environment are mainly o2 and h2o2 which will produce oh by different hydrogen abstraction steps as shown in table 3 o2 first reacts with organics to produce ho2 which reacts with organics in return to form h2o2 and then produce oh while h2o2 could generate oh directly by thermal decomposition lee et al 1990 li et al 1991 nevertheless the effects of o2 and h2o2 on organic degradation and the reaction rate are related to the pretreatment method which means that h2o2 should be distinguished as the resource of o2 or as the major oxidant under scwo conditions phenix et al 2002 for instance h2o2 has more active oxidation characteristics and could obtain a higher removal efficiency of organics than o2 when h2o2 or o2 mix with organics directly at ambient temperature and the mixed solution is preheated to supercritical state together this is because h2o2 can more easily initiate the hydrogen abstraction reaction that is considered the rate limiting step and consume less energy than o2 to generate oh by decomposition which bypasses the reaction with a relatively low reaction rate between organics and o2 and ho2 meanwhile the mass transfer resistance between o2 and organics also exists and means that h2o2 solution is easier to mix homogeneously with the reactants than gaseous oxygen at the initial state before reaching the supercritical temperature li et al 1991 ren et al 2019 in addition 99 95 removal efficiency of 2 4 dichlorophenol could be obtained at 450 c with h2o2 while only 62 50 was removed with o2 under the same conditions the same results were also obtained when oxidizing acetic acid lee et al 1990 moreover ren et al 2019 also indicated that compared with o2 h2o2 can strongly enhance the formation of co2 during the scwo of quinoline however the h2o2 would be decomposed into o2 and h2o if it is preheated before entering the reactor and a similar oxidation effect was achieved compared with that of o2 phenix et al 2002 bourhis et al 1995 found that h2o2 has a more significant influence on the treatment of organics in the initial stage of scwo while the effect of o2 dominated the reaction rate when the medium environment became homogeneous furthermore li et al 1993 also found that h2o2 is more reactive at 200 300 c while o2 obtains better removal results at 400 500 c when degrading dnt wastewater because oh produced by h2o2 would cause side reactions under supercritical conditions furthermore gong et al 2016 showed that increasing the oxidation coefficient strongly affects the degradation of quinazoline even at a lower oxidant concentration a 97 2 toc removal efficiency was obtained with an oxidation coefficient of 4 while a removal efficiency of only approximately 80 0 was obtained with stoichiometric oxygen the increase started to stabilize when the oxidation coefficient was greater than 2 moreover a higher oxidant concentration could also inhibit the formation of coke liu et al 2009 also indicated that a higher h2o2 concentration could strongly enhance the treatment of sodium 3 5 6 trichloropyridin 2 ol and a removal efficiency of almost 100 was achieved with 1 wt h2o2 moreover ma et al 2012 expressed that the degradation of aniline greatly depends on the oxidation coefficient when the oxidation coefficient increased from 1 1 to 2 3 the toc removal efficiency could increase by approximately 6 and the yield of co2 was greatly enhanced similar results were also achieved by ren et al 2019 who found that increasing the concentration of h2o2 significantly enhances the conversion of quinoline furthermore al duri et al 2016 found that the toc removal could be enhanced steadily by increasing the oxidation coefficient even if it was 2 but the improvement was not as remarkable as that when the reaction temperature was increased shin et al 2009 found that the oxidant concentration has an insignificant influence on the treatment of toc removal when it is excessive clearly increasing the oxidation coefficient appropriately could greatly enhance the treatment of organics but different from the reaction temperature an excess oxidant concentration will not promote further degradation and only keep it stable therefore there is an optimal oxidant concentration value to degrade organics chang and liu 2007 dong et al 2015a gong et al 2016 this is because the quantity of oh will increase with the increase in the oxidant concentration thereby accelerating the reaction rate however a higher concentration of oh will consume h2o2 and produce ho2 with relatively low activity which is regarded as a competitive reaction with organics moreover excess oxidants will also greatly increase the energy consumption of the pump or compressor chang and liu 2007 suggested that an oxidation coefficient of 3 is suitable for treating 2 4 6 trinitrotoluene tnt and 2 3 times stoichiometric oxygen is required to better remove aniline ma et al 2012 in addition the mixed mode between oxidants and organics also influences the reaction rate of scwo choosing an appropriate mixer could improve the mixing intensity and rate to reduce the induction time for initiating free radical reactions phenix et al 2002 proved that the oxidation kinetics are related to the mixing efficiency and the induction time could be decreased from 3 2 s to 0 7 s when the mixture of oxidants and organics in the fully developed turbulent region is mixed using the mixing crosses installed in small inserts 2 1 3 influence of residence time residence time is another key operation parameter during the scwo process it determines the length of the tubular reactor in the continuous experimental system as with the oxidation coefficient an optimal value exists for residence time the removal efficiency of toc or cod can increase significantly with the extension of the residence time but it will remain almost constant when the residence time reaches a definite value this phenomenon was observed in the cases of tnt aniline nitrobenzene p nitrophenol or quinazoline treatments chang and liu 2007 chen et al 2001 dong et al 2015a gong et al 2016 this is because most organics can be removed and the concentration of reactants can be reduced gradually as the reaction progresses leading to the termination steps with a lower conversion rate mentioned in table 3 becoming dominant vogel et al 2005 gong et al 2016 found that the removal of toc in quinazoline increased significantly in the first 60 s and then remained constant as the residence time increased the degradation of sodium 3 5 6 trichloropyridin 2 ol would not be affected by the residence time when it was greater than 6 5 min and 99 14 of organics could be decomposed liu et al 2009 furthermore the toc removal efficiency increased by approximately 35 when the residence time increased from 1 min to 3 min during the scwo process of 2 nitroaniline and 100 degradation could be achieved at 6 min the change tended to be stable after 4 5 min yang et al 2018a and a residence time of 6 s was suggested for p nitrophenol at 400 c dong et al 2015a 2 1 4 influence of initial concentration of organics the initial concentration of organics positively influences the oxidation efficiency to some extent qi et al 2002 ma et al 2012 indicated that the destruction efficiency of toc could increase by 7 4 when the concentration of aniline increased from 0 5 wt to 1 0 wt but if the concentration increased further then the removal efficiency changed slightly and was negligible a similar conclusion was obtained by shin et al 2009 who suggested that the toc removal efficiency remained almost unchanged when the initial concentration of toc in acrylonitrile wastewater increased from 0 26 mol l to 2 10 mol l ren et al 2019 expressed that the temperature rise in the reactor would become much steeper with the increase in the quinoline concentration and a temperature peak occurred when the concentration reached 8 wt a greater than 100 c temperature rise was obtained with 10 wt quinoline thereby resulting in the improvement in conversion of quinoline and production of co2 the authors suggested that the higher concentration of organics could cause a clear temperature rise in the reactor by releasing more heat thereby enhancing the formation of oh to accelerate the reaction rate even so compared with the significant effects of the reaction temperature oxidation coefficient and residence time on the degradation of organics the change in the initial concentration of organics has an inconspicuous influence perez et al 2004 2 2 transformation pathway of organic nitrogen in different nitrogen containing organics 2 2 1 amine group organics as for organics with an amine group organic nitrogen is mainly transformed into nh3 n through simple intermediate products containing nitrogen the primary reaction pathways for methylamine and aniline are shown in fig 2 and other substances such as nox and n2o are trace benjamin and savage 2005a established a detailed chemical kinetic model of methylamine and found that the main products are formamide nh3 n co2 and formic acid in the scwo process and nh3 n mainly originates from the hydrolysis of formamide the other experimental results of benjamin and savage 2005b and li and oshima 2005 showed that nh3 n is the main intermediate product of methylamine and could be further oxidized to n2o and n2 under suitable conditions in addition li and oshima 2005 also found the existence of hcn and nox and indicated that the selectivity of nh3 n is not affected by the amount of oxidant but by the reaction temperature that is the yield of nh3 n will be increased with the increase in temperature when dimethylamine and trimethylamine are regarded as reactants nh3 n mainly originates from the intermediate product dimethylamine and the concentrations of nox n2o and n2 are small li and oshima 2006 a similar conclusion could be applied to aromatic organics with an amino group ma et al 2012 showed that aniline can be attacked by oh to produce the intermediate products phenol and nh3 n which will be further converted into the final products of n2 n2o and no3 with the increase in the reaction temperature oxidation coefficient and residence time under the action of metal catalysts furthermore nh3 n also exists in large quantities during the scwo process of other relatively complex organics with an amine group such as 2 aminoethanol funazukuri and takahashi 1999 ethylenediamine zhang and ma 2011 and cu ii edta zhou et al 2013 2 2 2 nitro group organics transformation of organics with a nitro group differs from that of organics with an amine group in the former nox no2 and no3 is considered the main intermediate product during the scwo process lee and park 1996 investigated the pyrolysis of nitrobenzene and found that the c n bond on nitrobenzene was first attacked by oh to produce benzene and no2 which could be further reduced to n2 owing to its oxidation and little nh3 n and no3 were also detected abundant n2 is formed when o2 is added while the total yield of nh3 n no2 and no3 is less than 10 furthermore zhang and hua 2003 also examined the scwo of nitrobenzene under the conditions of 378 600 c 25 0 34 6 mpa and 80 160 s and it was suggested that more than 85 of nitrobenzene was converted into n2 no2 and no3 but the yield of nox was always less than 10 under all the conditions and the concentration of no2 was higher than that of no3 the authors explained that the weak bond of c n would be directly attacked by oh resulting in the formation of no2 radicals which could react with oh again to produce n2 and no2 in addition dong et al 2015a studied the scwo of p nitrophenol and the corresponding migration and transformation pathways are shown in fig 3 clearly the nitro group will be destroyed first and experiments on other organics such as 2 nitrophenol 2 nitrotoluene 4 nitrophenol and 3 nitrobenzoic acid were also conducted at 350 500 c 24 mpa and 500 excess oxygen within 150 s no3 was proved to be the major nitrogen containing product while nh3 n was produced only in trace amounts yang et al 2018b yang et al 2018c yang et al 2017 in addition the amount of no3 generated from 2 nitrophenol was higher than that generated from 4 nitrophenol thereby implying that the ortho nitro group more easily produces no3 than that at the para position yang et al 2018c chang and liu 2007 also proposed that the ortho nitro group is attacked by oh first followed by the para nitro group when tnt is degraded via scwo 2 2 3 mixed group amino and nitro organics different from organics with a single nitrogen containing group such as amine and nitro here the mixed group organics are the compounds that contain both lee et al 1997 conducted an experiment on the hydrothermal decomposition of p nitroaniline without oxidants at 385 440 c and 25 mpa within 5 30 s but the oxidation reaction was also observed in the same process the p nitroaniline was decomposed to form o2 co co2 and n2 which was due to the oxidation of no2 produced from the hydrothermal reaction when injecting o2 into the reactant the removal efficiency of p nitroaniline could be further improved in addition yang et al 2017 degraded 2 nitroaniline and the results indicated that n2 was the predominant nitrogen containing product fig 4 indicates the simplified transformation pathway of organic nitrogen in 2 nitroaniline including the denitrification ring opening and mineralization stages the author believed that oh would attack nh2 to form nh4 first and then break the no2 to produce no2 and the oxidative no2 would react with nh4 to finally generate n2 under the scwo environment furthermore they also compared the reaction of the mixed solution aniline and nitrobenzene with a single solution 2 nitroaniline 3 nitroaniline and 4 nitroaniline yang et al 2018a and the conclusion showed that the removal efficiency of total nitrogen tn in single solutions was higher than that in the mixed solution under the same conditions thereby suggesting that the reaction between no2 and nh4 occurred more easily within the molecule rather than between the molecules furthermore lee et al 1997 also proposed that the nitro group can be utilized as an oxidant together with o2 or h2o2 to create a synergistic effect in the treatment of nitrogen containing organics and the nitro group mainly contributes to the treatment of inorganic nitrogen such as nh3 n and nox while o2 or h2o2 focus on the degradation of organics and its intermediate organic products 2 2 4 nitrogen heteroatom organics the transformation pathway of organic nitrogen in nitrogen heteroatom compounds is also discussed here pinto et al 2006a studied the scwo treatment of quinoline and concluded that the organic nitrogen was mainly converted into n2 and nh3 n when the temperature was higher than 525 c trace no2 and no3 were also detected which could be neglected a similar result was obtained by gong et al 2016 who explained that nh3 n was the major product when the temperature ranged from 400 c to 525 c crain et al 1993 researched the reaction pathways of pyridine as shown in fig 5 nh3 n was also found as the major product in liquid effluent while little no2 existed but no n2 was detected in the gaseous state which meant that nh3 n could not be decomposed effectively under 522 c and 25 mpa within 6 59 s in addition complex nitrogen containing organics have also been studied by some scholars the scwo of 1 8 diazabicyclo 5 4 0 undec 7 ene dbu was explored and the organic nitrogen was primarily transformed into nh3 n and an insignificant amount of no2 and no3 furthermore n2 was formed when the temperature exceeded 550 c but 60 of nh3 n still remained in the liquid effluent even at 650 c in addition nh3 n tends to be converted into n2o rather than n2 when the concentration of the oxidant is increased al duri et al 2016 al duri et al 2008 aymonier et al 2000 reported the fate of nitrogen in hydrothermal oxidation of fenuron and found that fenuron first transformed into nitrobenzene nh3 n and a small amount of no3 and then the nitrobenzene could be further oxidized into nh3 n and no3 in the liquid effluent no n2o or nox were detected in the gaseous effluents and the nitrogen could be completely converted into n2 at 540 c within 39 s thereby indicating that a redox reaction occurred between no3 and nh3 n which was considered the limiting step throughout the transformation process of nitrogen in fenuron 2 2 5 comparison of different transformation pathways for nitrogen containing organics as mentioned in 2 2 1 2 2 4 we concluded that the transformation pathways of organic nitrogen are significantly affected by the types of nitrogenous groups as for amine group organics oh would attack the amine groups directly to produce nh3 n and then the nh3 n could be oxidized by oh further into n2 and trace n2o and no3 under suitable reaction conditions even with catalysts however the organic nitrogen in nitro group organics behaves differently where nox no2 and no3 is the dominant intermediate product owing to the weak bond of c n which could be easily attacked by oh furthermore the oxidizing nox would react with hydrocarbon compounds and a certain amount of n2 would be generated when treating organics containing both an amine group and a nitro group the oh would attack the amine and nitro groups to produce nh4 and nox as intermediate products step by step and then the oxidative nox could react with the reductive nh4 to produce n2 compared with the organics with a single amine group or nitro group the transformation of organic nitrogen into n2 is much easier even under relatively mild reaction conditions as for nitrogen heteroatom organics nh4 is the major intermediate product and trace nox would also be generated moreover the transformation of nitrogen to n2 in this system is dependent on the reaction conditions to some extent 3 degradation of ammonia by supercritical water oxidation compared with nox the further degradation of refractory nh3 n is the key rate limiting step throughout the treatment of nitrogen containing compounds al duri et al 2008 therefore the removal of nh3 n during the scwo process has aroused wide interest of scholars owing to its refractory characteristics even though the structure of nh3 n is simple studies on the degradation effects are shown in table 4 the parameters of the reaction kinetics based on eq 1 are shown in table 5 and the different process enhancement methods are described in detail in the following section concluding from tables 4 and 5 there are some differences in the treatment efficiency and kinetic parameters of nh3 n between the results obtained from different scholars which are mainly due to the various reaction systems such as the type size and material of the reactor reaction conditions such as the temperature pressure residence time and oxidant and sources of nh3 n such as pure aqueous nh3 industrial wastewater sludge or wastes utilized in the experiments nevertheless helling and tester 1988 pointed out that nh3 n cannot be degraded by scwo when the temperature is below 525 c and an nh3 n removal efficiency of only 5 can be obtained at 540 c which is similar to the results obtained by ding et al 1998 when treating nh3 n without a catalyst even at 680 c with a 10 9 s residence time only 10 9 of nh3 n was degraded effectively webley et al 1991 furthermore as shown in table 5 the reaction order of nh3 n was higher than that of the oxidant when the scwo reaction occurred without catalysts thereby indicating that changing the concentration of nh3 n influences the treatment of nh3 n more than changing the oxidant concentration clearly the effective removal of nh3 n is more difficult than that of cod or toc when compared with table 1 which requires harsh reaction conditions such as a higher reaction temperature 650 c higher reaction pressure 28 30 mpa longer residence time 10 min and more oxidants excess of 300 1000 however these severe conditions will undoubtedly enlarge the size of the reactor and increase the requirements for material properties with high temperature and corrosion resistance in addition the supplementation of oxidants will also be doubled and additional heat sources will be required thereby resulting in high investment and operation costs and reducing the economic efficiency of the system to a large extent therefore realizing the collaborative removal of cod and nh3 n under a relatively mild reaction environment is important to optimize the process of scwo 4 enhancement of the supercritical water oxidation process for ammonia 4 1 catalytic supercritical water oxidation based on the catalytic wet oxidation of nh3 n the catalysts commonly used to enhance the reaction process are mainly divided into the following categories metal oxide catalysts coo cr2o3 mno2 nio n2o3 v2o5 zno co2o3 and fe2o3 composite metal oxide catalysts mn ce 7 3 and co bi mixed oxides transition metals and precious metals iridium platinum gold palladium rhodium iron nickel tungsten copper and cobalt these all have significant effects on the degradation of nh3 n and the selectivity of gaseous products oliviero et al 2003 therefore cscwo of nh3 n has aroused the extensive interest of scholars including reactor surface catalysts such as inconel 625 sus316 and hastelloy c 276 and metal oxide catalysts such as mno2 mno2 ceo2 mno2 γ al2o3 mn cu o ta 55 and ceo2 mnox tio2 table 6 summarizes the treatment effect of cscwo on nh3 n 4 1 1 heterogeneous catalysis of the reactor surface as the core equipment of the scwo system several scholars found that the reactor surface has a catalytic effect during the nh3 n degradation process webley et al 1991 compared the treatment of nh3 n in the tubular reactor and packed bed reactor filled with some inconel 625 beads and the results showed that only 1 1 of nh3 n could be removed at 700 c within 10 5 s and no no no2 or n2o was detected in the tubular reactor the activation energy of nh3 n was 38 kcal mol in the temperature range of 640 700 c while the removal efficiency of nh3 n could reach up to 13 9 at 531 c and 9 5 s and a trace amount of n2o was found in the packed reactor the corresponding activation energy was 7 1 kcal mol within 530 680 c which was lower than that in the tubular reactor and the reaction rate in the packed reactor was over four times greater than that in the tubular reactor owing to the catalysis of the inconel 625 reactor surface segond et al 2002 conducted experiments on the scwo reaction of nh3 n in two isothermal and isobaric plug flow reactors made of stainless steel 316 with different surface to volume ratios s v and found that when the s v increased from 1 85 to 4 00 the nh3 n removal efficiency increased from 51 to 93 at 603 c and the yields of n2 and n2o also increased moreover the corresponding reaction rate constant also increased positively with the s v the authors suggested that the metal in the reactor surface mainly enhanced the reactions given in eqs 2 and 3 and homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions both occurred while the heterogeneous reaction on the reactor wall was dominant in addition akizuki et al 2016 studied the hydrolysis of benzamide in sub supercritical water and proved that the metal oxides fe2o3 fe3o4 cr2o3 and fecr2o4 on the surface of the sus316 reactor have the catalytic activity to accelerate the reaction rate rather than the metal ions dissolved in the supercritical water the catalytic activity was in the order of fe2o3 fe3o4 cr2o3 fecr2o4 while fe2o3 was the main contributor to the heterogeneous catalytic reaction in addition benjamin and savage 2005b and ma et al 2012 also investigated the catalytic effect of the hastelloy c 276 reactor on the degradation of methylamine and nh3 n and proposed that the catalytic activity of hastelloy c 276 is even faster than that of stainless steel and inconel and the main gas product is n2o rather than n2 under the action of the hastelloy c 276 therefore choosing a reactor with a suitable type size and material contributed to reducing the reaction conditions and enhancing the reaction rate of nh3 n degradation 2 2 nh 3 1 5 o 2 metal n 2 3 h 2 o 3 2 nh 3 2 o 2 metal n 2 o 3 h 2 o 4 1 2 heterogeneous catalysis of metal oxides oshima et al 2001 showed that mno2 can increase the degradation efficiency of nh3 n and promote the conversion of nh3 n to n2 in the scwo environment nh3 n was degraded completely at 510 c and the gas product selectivity for n2 was 90 at 470 c under the catalysis of mno2 although a small amount of n2o was also generated through a parallel reaction path ding et al 1998 studied the cscwo of nh3 n in a continuous flow packed bed reactor and observed that the removal efficiency of nh3 n could reach 96 at 450 c and 1 s with an mno2 ceo2 catalyst nh3 n was primarily transformed into n2 and trace n2o in the gas product while a small amount of no3 was detected in the liquid product but the conversion of nh3 n could be neglected under similar reaction conditions without a catalyst even with excess oxidant the authors proposed that the activity of oxygen molecules adsorbed on the mno2 ceo2 catalyst was much higher than that of oh and ho2 radicals produced by the oxidant and thus accelerated the oxidation rate moreover the mechanism of the nh3 n catalytic reaction could be described as follows where represents the active site on the catalyst surface 4 o 2 k 1 o 2 2 o 5 n h 3 o k 2 n h h 2 o 6 n h o k 3 hn o 7 n h hn o k 4 n 2 h 2 o 3 8 hn o hn o k 5 n 2 o h 2 o 4 furthermore ding et al 1998 also tested the physical and chemical performance of the mno2 ceo2 catalyst in the harsh environment of scwo although the removal efficiency of nh3 n changed less when the catalyst was exposed to scwo conditions for 30 min clear physical inactivation also occurred for example the surface area of the catalyst decreased from 198 0 m2 g to 13 5 m2 g and the oxidation state of mno2 ceo2 also changed and mn2o3 was formed moreover the catalyst changed from an amorphous structure to partial crystallization and the strength of the catalyst was greatly reduced therefore improving the thermal stability and activity of the catalyst in scwo is another important goal that also influences the removal effect and system stability the physical performance of the catalyst such as the mechanical strength specific surface area pore volume crystal structure dispersion of active components and particle size mainly depends on the preparation method and process of the catalyst ding et al 1996 guan et al 2018 the key parameters include the ph value temperature pressure drying method baking temperature and baking time furthermore the methods applied to prepare metal oxide catalysts include impregnation sol gel co precipitation precipitation adsorption and ion exchange while the impregnation method is generally used in the scwo reaction tang et al 2006 prepared a mnox ceo2 catalyst using different methods such as the sol gel method co precipitation method and modified co precipitation method to improve the oxidation of formaldehyde and indicated that the catalyst created using the modified co precipitation method possessed both a high catalytic activity and great physical properties for example the surface areas for the sol gel method co precipitation method and modified co precipitation method were 22 2 m2 g 126 3 m2 g and 124 0 m2 g respectively and richer lattice oxygen as well as more manganese oxide species with higher oxidation states existed in the catalyst created by the modified co precipitation method moreover guan et al 2018 compared the preparation methods of mno2 composite catalyst including the sol gel method rheological phase reaction method micro emulsion method chemical co precipitation method solid phase synthesis and template method during the oxidation of formaldehyde in detail and found that different methods influence the catalytic performance to some extent therefore selecting an appropriate preparation method and optimizing the preparation conditions might greatly improve the hydrothermal stability and activity of the catalyst in the scwo environment however we noted that the catalysts utilized to treat nh3 n are mostly single metal oxides such as mno2 or single metal oxide supported catalysts such as mno2 ceo2 but some researchers have proved that the interaction between composite metals can enhance the activity stability and selectivity of catalysts such as modifying the surface properties of catalysts reducing the hydrogen spillover effect of basic active metal components or producing the group effect ligand effect stability effect synergistic effect and dual function effect among others alonso et al 2012 for example the addition of copper oxide was confirmed to increase the content of defective oxygen on the surface of the catalyst promote the dispersion of manganese and increase its oxidation state and reduce the corresponding reduction temperature of catalysts thereby eventually resulting in the enhancement of the interaction between manganese and copper oxide in addition benzene can be degraded completely at 285 c by combustion under the catalysis of 8 mno2 2 cuo al2o3 ce0 45zr0 45y0 05la0 05o1 95 cao et al 2012 in addition in the combustion process of propane and ethanol the catalytic activity of the mn cu composite oxide mncux is superior to that of pure mn2o3 or cuo and the excellent catalytic performance might result from the presence of cu1 5mn1 5o4 where mno2 has the ability to adsorb and activate o2 and the active phase can also be improved and stabilized by cuo morales et al 2006 furthermore vu et al 2009 also found that the composite catalyst mncuox tio2 has significant catalytic activity when degrading chlorobenzene through wet oxidation owing to the formation of mn1 6cu1 4o4 spinel supported on anatase tio2 on the basis of catalytic combustion and wet catalytic oxidation some studies have been conducted to degrade nh3 n using composite catalysts under the scwo environment gong et al 2018 prepared a cemnox tio2 catalyst to treat landfill leachate by scwo the removal efficiency of nh3 n could increase from 92 43 to 98 99 when the catalyst addition increased from 0 5 wt to 2 0 wt and the ratio of ce mn was 1 2 at 600 c 25 mpa and 600 s with an oxidation coefficient of 1 67 in addition the activity and thermal stability could still be maintained even if the catalyst was used repeatedly five times an nh3 n removal efficiency of 97 09 was obtained and the specific surface area pore diameter distribution crystal phase composition and structure did not change significantly the authors suggested that mnox was treated as the major active component while ceo2 was mainly regarded as the additive and o2 provider hu et al 2014 compared the performance of mn o tio2 al2o3 mn cu o tio2 al2o3 mn ce o tio2 al2o3 and mn co o tio2 al2o3 catalysts during the scwo of nh3 n and found that although the addition of active components of cu ce or co had no clear effect on the specific surface area of the catalyst it was highly doped and dispersed on the support surface the results also showed that mn cu o tio2 al2o3 had a higher catalyst activity and could degrade 55 8 of nh3 n at 460 c 26 mpa and 4 5 s residence time with an oxidation coefficient of 1 67 when the ratio of mn cu was 5 5 the authors assumed that the reduction of manganese oxide was catalyzed by the reduced copper due to the hydrogen overflow effect which greatly improved the oxidation performance of the catalyst in addition peng et al 2007 also indicated that the degradation efficiency of nh3 n was 99 7 at 450 c 25 mpa and 1 s with an oxidation coefficient of 2 94 under the action of an mn ce o composite metal oxide catalyst when the mn ce ratio was 5 5 which was attributed to the strong synergistic effect between manganese and cerium promoting the mobility of oxygen 4 2 co oxidation with auxiliary alcohols co oxidation refers to the rapid oxidation of active organics to produce active radicals which can promote the decomposition of refractory compounds further in one oxidation reaction system moreover active organics such as alcohols usually have a high calorific value thus a significant amount of heat will be released during the scwo process leading to the rise in the actual reaction temperature thus the system operation temperature required for degradation of refractory substances could be minimized hayashi et al 2007 savage et al 2000 cabeza et al 2011 found that when the initial concentration of isopropanol ipa increases from 1 wt to 5 wt the reaction temperature can be increased from 440 c to 708 c during the scwo process of methylamine at 450 c and 24 9 mpa benjamin and savage 2005b observed that the oxidation rate of nh3 n 1 58 10 4 mol l s was higher than that of pure nh3 was 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than that found by other scholars such as 4 81 10 8 mol l s for webley et al 1991 and 9 38 10 7 mol l s for segond et al 2002 in the tubular reactor and five times higher than that in the packed bed reactor with a high surface area it is believed that the existence of methylamine or its related intermediate active radicals enhance the oxidation of nh3 n and promote the conversion of gaseous products to n2o rather than n2 at present some scholars have confirmed that alcohol auxiliaries such as methanol ethanol and ipa have a significant impact on the degradation characteristics of nh3 n in the scwo environment as shown in table 7 but there are still some differences in the interaction rules and enhancement mechanisms 4 2 1 methanol webley et al 1991 indicated that the degradation of ch3oh and nh3 n do not influence each other and their reaction paths are mutually independent in the tubular reactor the removal efficiency of ch3oh could reach 100 while only 7 nh3 n was degraded at 530 c 24 5 mpa and 8 s when the experiments were conducted in the packed bed reactor the presence of ch3oh was found to inhibit the oxidation of nh3 n to some extent whose reaction rate was approximately 33 3 of that for pure nh3 n this was because the heterogeneous catalysis by the reactor surface was dominant in the packed reactor and the addition of ch3oh would increase the competitive adsorption between ch3oh and nh3 n on the catalytic surface thereby reducing the oxidation rate of nh3 n oe et al 2007 found that the addition of ch3oh could strongly affect the oxidation behavior of nh3 n nh3 n could be degraded completely at 590 c 25 mpa and 65 s when the concentration ratio of ch3oh and nh3 was 1 1 but the yield of n2o in the gas product was increased greatly and could be four times greater than that without ch3oh when the concentration of ch3oh was twice that of nh3 the concentration of no3 in the liquid product also increased significantly meanwhile trace amounts of no2 no and no2 were also detected which was due to the presence of co produced from ch3oh the catalytic reaction is suggested to reduce n2o while continuous stirred tank reactors with noble metal material a longer heating time and two step reactions are expected to inhibit the formation of no3 under scwo conditions zhang et al 2019a showed that nh3 started to decompose when the concentration of ch3oh was higher than 10 mmol l and 97 5 nh3 n removal efficiency could be obtained at 600 c 25 mpa and an oxidation coefficient of 1 5 with 800 mmol l of ch3oh meanwhile 9 mg l of no3 was also detected which was more easily produced at a higher reaction temperature and oxidation coefficient the authors indicated that the kinetics and thermal effect produced from ch3oh improves the degradation of nh3 synergistically under a relatively low reaction temperature on one hand the enhancement effect of ch3oh on the degradation of nh3 mainly occurs in the initial stage of the co oxidation reaction as shown in eqs 9 12 which could promote the production of ho2 and h2o2 the further decomposition of h2o2 could form active oh radicals to accelerate the initial hydrogen extraction step of nh3 on the other hand the heat released during the scwo of ch3oh could cause an increase in the reaction temperature to increase the reaction rate constant of the chain initiated reaction between nh3 and oh furthermore the authors also pointed out that the concentration of nh3 has a positive relationship with the degradation of ch3oh owing to the oxidation exotherm of the high concentration of nh3 n and extra oh radicals generated from the reaction between nh and no2 radicals as shown in eq 14 9 h c h 2 oh o 2 c h 2 oh ho 2 10 c h 2 oh ho 2 c h 2 o h 2 o 2 11 h c h 2 oh h o c h 2 oh h 2 o 2 12 h 2 o 2 2 o h 13 n h 3 oh nh 2 h 2 o 14 nh n o 2 n 2 o o h the kinetic analysis and reaction mechanism of the ch3oh and nh3 mixture were also studied by shimoda et al 2016 they showed that the removal efficiency of nh3 n could reach 19 and n2o was the major gas product at 530 c 25 mpa and 90 s when the initial concentration ratio of ch3oh and nh3 was 3 1 1 the removal effect of nh3 n increased with the initial ch3oh concentration when the ch3oh was oxidized completely the decomposition of nh3 n became slight in return the treatment of ch3oh and selectivity of gas products to co2 were also enhanced by the existence of nh3 n the authors indicated that the radicals produced from ch3oh and nh3 were shared and eventually promoted mutual oxidation moreover the reaction mechanism between ch3oh and nh3 proposed by shimoda et al 2016 is displayed in fig 6 which is mainly divided into two stages first when the concentration of ch3oh is high it means that the conditions for the oxidation of both ch3oh and nh3 exist in the system the oh produced from ch3oh and its corresponding intermediate products such as ch2oh and hoco first attack nh3 n and form nh2 radicals which react with ho2 to increase the generation of oh thereby leading to the higher concentration of oh in the nh3 ch3oh system compared with that in the single ch3oh system and enhancing the co degradation of nh3 n and ch3oh the generation of n2o is due to the presence of ch3oh which would promote the formation of nh radicals and the reaction between nh and no2 radicals would produce n2o when the ch3oh is completely oxidized into co2 the oxidation of nh3 is maintained by nitrogenous radicals such as nh2 and active ho2 and oh radicals as shown in fig 6 b to maintain the continuous supply of oh radicals during the scwo of nh3 n shimoda and oshima 2017 also conducted experiments by injecting ch3oh in two stages a higher nh3 n removal efficiency was obtained compared with that when injecting ch3oh once at the inlet of the reactor and the second injection time for ch3oh also influenced the decomposition of nh3 n the authors indicated that there is an optimal value for the secondary ch3oh injection time which could guarantee the optimal removal efficiency of nh3 n with the shortest total reaction time for example to acquire an nh3 n removal efficiency of 15 if injecting the secondary ch3oh in 10 s then the total residence time must be 20 s if the second injection time is reduced to 3 s then the total residence time would be 25 s and if the second injection time is increased to 20 s then 27 s would be required to achieve the target removal efficiency which provides a design basis for the optimization of the reactor structure as well as the regulation and control of the co oxidation system 4 2 2 ethanol ethanol has also been considered an auxiliary fuel to improve the treatment of nh3 n owing to its rapid degradation to produce ho2 and oh radicals in the scwo environment however helling and tester 1988 showed that the presence of ethanol or nh3 has no significant effect on their treatment owing to the limitation of the reaction temperature the highest operation temperature was 550 c and they suggested that the co oxidation of ethanol and nh3 should be studied at higher reaction temperatures above 600 c and a longer residence time killilea et al 1992 reported that nh3 n could be degraded completely at 690 c when adding ethanol in the reaction system while only 41 of nh3 n was removed without ethanol the primary gas product was n2 at a higher temperature approximately 621 693 c while more n2o was produced than n2 at a relatively low temperature approximately 525 608 c and small amounts of no2 and no3 were also detected in the liquid product the degradation rules product distribution and co oxidation model between nh3 and ethanol in the scwo environment were investigated by ploeger et al 2007 compared with the scwo of pure nh3 the co oxidation experiment results indicated that the conversion of nh3 n could be increased from 20 to 64 while the yield of n2o was also increased from 4 to approximately 40 at 700 c 24 1 mpa and 2 s when adding stoichiometric oxygen they also proposed that the formation of n2o mainly depends on the existence of ethanol and co oxidation primarily occurs in the first 2 s after the ethanol was degraded completely the nh3 n was treated and slowly transformed into n2 ploeger et al 2006a indicated the reaction pathways of ethanol during the co oxidation system with refractory substances as shown in eqs 15 21 ethanol will consume oh or ho2 first eq 15 eq 16 and then form the major substance of ho2 eq 17 which determines the amount of oh radicals to some extent on one hand the concentration of ho2 produced during the co oxidation system is three orders of magnitude greater than that of oh radicals on the other hand ho2 could react with ho2 or h2o to produce h2o2 which could decompose directly to form oh radicals as shown in eqs 18 20 furthermore the reaction of eq 21 is the chain termination reaction in the process of co oxidation and the relative reaction rate between eq 20 and eq 21 determines the amount of active free radicals and the enhancement of co oxidation 15 r h 2 o h r h h 2 o 16 r h 2 ho 2 r h h 2 o 2 17 r h o 2 r ho 2 18 ho 2 ho 2

specifically the main nitrogen containing gaseous products are n2 and n2o the oxidation of nh3 is caused by the gradual hydrogen abstraction reaction of nitrogen containing species such as nh3 and nh2 and the generated n2h3 from the mutual reaction between nhx could lose three hydrogen atoms through hydrogen abstraction or direct decomposition into n2 as shown in eqs 22 24 as for the production of n2o the authors established a model to accurately predict the yield of n2o with the change in the reaction temperature by improving the sub mechanism of nh2 nox under the low pressure condition as shown in eqs 25 28 which introduces the intermediate adduct species hxnnoy that could be collision stabilized under the high pressure system and undergo rearrangement decomposition hydrogen abstraction and other reactions at a relatively low temperature 655 c the net flux of h2nno2 which is the only source of n2o is higher than that of h2nono thereby resulting in a higher yield of n2o the n2o would decrease with the increase in the reaction temperature meanwhile the authors also found that the addition of ethanol has little influence on the formation of oh radicals at 700 c but the concentration of ho2 radicals will increase by three orders of magnitude and the concentration of ho2 radicals will decrease rapidly owing to the fast recombination reaction between ho2 to generate h2o2 and o2 however this mechanism model could not predict the conversion rate of nh3 with the change in temperature well because the generation of h2nnox and h2nono adducts strongly influences the conversion of nh3 and it must be improved further in the aspect of transient species such as ammonia oxide h3no hydrocarbons abstracted by nh2 and the adducts of nh2 and carbon radicals such as ch3 22

and ethanol ipa has also been widely utilized in the co oxidation of nh3 cabeza et al 2014 proposed that when the concentration ratio of ipa nh4 increased from 0 to 0 125 the removal efficiency of tn could reach up to 35 at 450 c 25 mpa and 6 s with stoichiometric oxygen but the further increase in the amount of ipa had a negative effect on the degradation of tn that is a lower tn removal efficiency than that without ipa was obtained when the ratio was greater than 0 5 they suggested that this was because the low concentration of ipa could promote the conversion of nh3 to n2 while the high concentration of ipa enhanced other reaction pathways in addition the positive influences of treating nh3 n with ipa are shown in eqs 29 32 as an active auxiliary fuel ipa will react with o2 first to generate ho2 radicals and then the ho2 could react with ipa and its intermediate again to produce extra oh radicals which could attack nh3 n effectively and eventually enhance the degradation of nh3 n furthermore oh and ho2 radicals could also be produced from o2 and h2o as shown in eqs 33 36 additionally no3 was also detected in the liquid product which would increase with the addition of ipa the removal of ipa was proved to have no relationship with nh3 n however zhang et al 2019b thought that the inhibitory effect of high concentrations of ipa on the treatment of nh3 n due to the limitation of stoichiometric oxidation which will first react with active ipa and leave insufficient radicals for persistent nh3 n 29 h c 3 h 6 oh o 2 c 3 h 6 oh ho 2 30 c 3 h 6 oh ho 2 c 3 h 6 o h 2

concentrations of nh3 1 7 wt in the presence of ipa in a cold wall reactor and found that the concentration of nh3 influences the required temperature to completely degrade toc and nh3 n and obtain the lowest concentration of no3 and acetic acid in the liquid effluent for example when the concentration of nh3 increased from 1 wt to 7 wt the corresponding temperature needed to rise from 710 c to 780 c at 23 mpa 35 45 s and with excess oxidant thereby indicating that the ipa could accelerate the oxidation of nh3 n by itself or with its related radicals but nh3 inhibited the oxidation rate of ipa cocero et al 2000 conducted experiments on the co oxidation between ipa and nh3 n in a pilot scale plant to study the oxidation behavior under different operation parameters such as the oxidation coefficient reaction temperature and initial nh3 concentration and 98 4 of nh3 n could be removed at 645 c 25 mpa 40 s and with stoichiometric oxidants with 6 wt ipa but the distribution of nitrogen products was related to the oxidation coefficient and temperature the concentrations of no2 and no3 in the liquid product and nox in the gas products will increase with the increase in the number of oxidants and excess oxidants will cause higher no3 and nox thus 1 1 times of stoichiometric oxidant requirement is suggested furthermore when the temperature was greater than 670 c nox was also detected similar reaction rules were also obtained when treating aniline acetonitrile and pyridine with ipa complex nitrogenous organics such as dbu and dimethylformamide dmf were also chosen as reactants to react with h2o2 under the action of ipa and the results were compared with the co oxidation of pure nh3 al duri and alsoqyani 2017 al duri et al 2015 al duri et al 2016 the addition of ipa had a significant positive effect on the reaction rate constant the removal efficiency of nh3 n could reach 98 under the conditions of 450 c 25 mpa and 6 s with stoichiometric oxidants when the ratio of ipa nh3 n was 4 1 they also proposed that additional oh and ho2 radicals could be generated from ipa as shown in eqs 29 32 thereby promoting the transformation of nh3 n to n2 and n2o furthermore the reaction kinetics of dmf were also analyzed by the global rate expression and the activation energy was reduced by at least 50 when adding ipa to the reaction system however compared with dbu whose tn removal efficiency was less than 80 the enhancement of co oxidation with ipa on pure nh3 was more effective under the same conditions they assumed that this was because the nitrogen containing organics underwent more reaction pathways to convert organic nitrogen into nh3 n which also consumed ipa therefore injecting ipa in stages into more than one reactor port to maintain the concentration of active radicals is suggested a phenomenon was discovered where a supercritical hydrothermal combustion reaction occurs which means that the organics could be ignited and produce hydrothermal flames in the supercritical water when the concentration of organics is high enough and the reaction temperature reaches the autoignition temperature where auxiliary fuel is usually used to supply the required heat to ignite the organics for combustion augustine and tester 2009 wellig et al 2005 cabeza et al 2011 studied the hydrothermal combustion characteristics of ipa and nh3 in a tubular reactor and observed that the maximum toc degradation efficiency could reach up to 99 while 94 of tn could be removed at the moment of ignition under 700 750 c 25 mpa and 0 7 s the removal of tn changed slightly as the temperature surpassed 710 c and the primary gas products were n2 with a small amount of nh3 while no3 and no2 were detected in the liquid effluent and the concentration of no3 increased with the temperature and the amount of oxidant furthermore at least 2 wt ipa is required to achieve more than 90 removal of nh3 which is also the minimum concentration to ignite nh3 to obtain the complete degradation of nh3 and simultaneously eliminate the formation of no3 the design of the reactor is recommended to be optimized to match the operation parameters such as the temperature oxidant concentration and residence time based on this research they also conducted other studies to optimize the treatment of nh3 under the hydrothermal combustion conditions in a new vessel reactor instead of the tubular reactor which uses an empty reactor chamber to realize the stabilization of the hydrothermal flame and injects the feedstock at ambient temperature to avoid material corrosion and salt deposition the highest toc and nh3 n removal efficiencies were more than 99 99 and 99 90 respectively and the lowest nox and no3 concentrations below the limit of detection were acquired when the temperature was less than 650 c excess oxidant was below 2 5 and residence time was in the range of 20 30 s cabeza et al 2013 4 2 4 glycol similarly as a type of active alcohol the oxidation characteristics of glycol by scwo have also attracted the attention of some scholars bong gean et al 2003 showed that the decomposition of glycol was greatly accelerated above 400 c and could be completely degraded at approximately 425 c and a high concentration of glycol promoted its decomposition further in addition glycol has also been applied as an auxiliary fuel to enhance the treatment of organics owing to its activity ma 2014 indicated that adding 150 mg l of glycol could increase the cod removal efficiency of drilling fluid from 82 50 without glycol to 99 85 at 580 c 25 mpa and 10 min which was due to the enhancement of oh and ho2 produced from glycol as shown in eqs 37 40 the cod removal efficiency was directly proportional to the concentration of glycol added furthermore yu 2015 also found that the addition of trace glycol 25 mg l could improve the cod removal efficiency in phenolic wastewater from 90 0 to 97 8 at 400 c and 25 mpa compared with ch3oh ethanol and ipa glycol has a higher flash point which will ensure greater safety in engineering applications however the effect of the addition of glycol on the degradation of nh3 n has not been studied which is of great significance and should be explored in depth 37 hoc h 2 c h 2 oh 2 o h c h 2 c h 2 38 rh o h r h 2 o 39 r o 2 ro o 40 ro o rh rooh r 4 2 5 comparison of different alcohol auxiliaries as mentioned in 4 2 1 4 2 3 the degradation rules and interaction between various alcohols ch3oh ethanol and ipa and nh3 n obtained by different scholars exhibit some differences some researchers pointed out that compared with ch3oh hr 650 kj mol and ethanol hr 1279 kj mol ipa has a higher heat of reaction hr 1908 kj mol which releases more heat energy causing an increase the reaction temperature and leading to the production of more active radicals during the scwo process abelleira et al 2013 chen et al 2014 however most researchers demonstrated that the enhancement of nh3 n degradation is not only related to the exothermic reaction but also to the extra radicals generated from alcohols in the scwo environment qian et al 2019 compared the influences of ch3oh ethanol and ipa on the treatment of toc and nh3 n in sludge under the same reaction conditions 450 600 c 25 mpa 20 min and oxidation coefficient of 1 5 and the results showed that the addition of ch3oh ethanol and ipa to the system could all enhance the degradation efficiency of toc and nh3 n but ethanol showed a greater strengthening effect than ipa and ch3oh which was consistent with the reaction rate of pure alcohols in the scwo process the authors also suggested that ethanol could produce the highest concentration of ho2 in the shortest reaction time followed by ipa and ch3oh and the increase in the alcohol concentration could further shorten the production time of ho2 and oh radicals and increase their amounts they also found that the alcohols could inhibit the formation of persistent aromatic intermediate products such as pyridine and phenol and promote the generation of open chain compounds without nitrogen which are easily degraded however zhang et al 2019a found that the degradation efficiency of nh3 n was 15 3 97 5 with ch3oh but only 6 1 57 3 with ipa at 600 c 25 mpa and an oxidation coefficient of 1 5 they indicated that ch3oh has a more conspicuous effect than ipa on the improvement of nh3 n degradation although the characteristics of heat release for ch3oh and ipa are similar the authors thought that ch3oh could produce more active radicals than ipa in a shorter amount of time clearly to degrade nh3 n effectively with auxiliary fuel a higher reaction temperature above 600 c is still essential therefore further optimization studies about the types of auxiliaries injection mode of additives system parameters and reactor design among others which will also improve the distribution of nitrogen containing products should be researched in detail 4 3 oxidation enhancement with nitrates and nitrites as mentioned in 2 2 3 the intermediate products of nh3 and no3 or no2 produced from nitroaniline during the scwo process could interact to convert the nitrogen to n2 perez et al 2004 studied the scwo reaction between the mixed solution of 2 4 dinitrophenol and nh3 in a pilot scale plant and the results indicated that over 99 996 of 2 4 dinitrophenol could be removed at 469 526 c with excess oxidants while the removal efficiency of nh3 n remained in the range of 42 000 49 000 moreover when there was a higher concentration of 2 4 dinitrophenol in the reactants the degradation of nh3 n was effective but it would decrease with the reduction in the toc nh3 n ratio clearly this further proves the positive oxidation effect of the nitro group or no3 on the treatment of pure nh3 therefore some scholars have directly used no3 or no2 as oxidants to degrade refractory organics bourhis et al 1995 indicated that the addition of hno3 could enhance the oxidation rate of ipa by reducing the induction time used to initiate the scwo reaction by three times dellorco et al 1995 used an no3 and no2 mixture as an oxidant for the treatment of edta in the supercritical water hydrolysis system and found that the removal efficiency of toc increased with the addition of no3 and could be oxidized completely at 450 c 25 mpa and within 40 s when adding no2 and the major nitrogenous products were n2 n2o and nh3 they indicated that no2 has a better oxidation effect than no3 for treating edta and its intermediate products they also confirmed that the oxidation rate of no3 is higher than that of h2o2 when degrading acetic acid lee et al 2006 also explored the oxidation characteristics of 4 dichlorobenzene with nitrates or nitrites as oxidants a maximum of 99 95 of 4 dichlorobenzene was removed at 450 c 30 mpa and 30 min with stoichiometric oxidant and both no3 and no2 were reduced to n2 through the intermediates no and no2 in addition a small amount of h2 was also detected which was mainly generated from the water gas shift reaction compared with the nano3 scwo system the number of types and contents of intermediate organic by products were lower in the nano2 scwo system thereby indicating that the oxidation rate of no2 is higher than that of no3 which was the same as the results obtained by dellorco et al 1995 in addition complete degradation of 4 dichlorobenzene was achieved at 39 mpa thereby indicating that high pressure could accelerate the reaction rate by increasing the solubility of nano3 in the supercritical water it can be seen that both no3 and no2 have stronger oxidation than h2o2 and o2 in the treatment of persistent organics based on this some scholars have utilized various nitrates or nitrites as oxidants to degrade nh3 as shown in table 8 dellorco et al 1997 compared the oxidation characteristics of different nitrates nano3 lino3 and hno3 in the degradation of pure nh3 in a tubular reactor at 450 530 c and 30 mpa h2o2 in the same concentration as no3 was also added into the reaction system as a co oxidant this was because during the reaction process between no3 and nh3 no3 reduction to no2 also occurred as a parallel reaction and no was eventually formed through the corrosion of the reactor wall therefore h2o2 was applied to supply excess oh radicals to react with no2 and make the redox equilibrium change to the oxidation state the results also indicated that the production of no and no2 could be inhibited effectively but the formation of no2 could not be completely avoided and the degradation of nh3 n was enhanced slightly furthermore hno3 has the best degradation effect and nh3 n could be removed completely at 427 c and 25 mpa within a short reaction time of 10 3 s approximately 77 7 80 6 of nitrogen was transformed into n2 and 8 6 9 7 was transformed into n2o and the selectivity of n2 n2o was between 4 5 however the conversion of nh3 n was less than 10 when using nano3 or lino3 under the similar reaction conditions whose conversion efficiency of n2o was in the range of 1 3 and the corresponding selectivity of n2 n2o was 16 for nano3 and 21 for lino3 increasing the reaction temperature and prolonging the reaction time could enhance the treatment of nh3 n and the authors also proposed that the presence of na inhibited the reaction between nox nh3 as only 10 of nox was transformed at 447 c in 11 1 s when adding a certain amount of naoh into the hno3 nh3 system the reaction mechanism of mnox and nh3 under the scwo conditions was suggested by dellorco et al 1997 as shown in eqs 41 48 which takes the gas products into account the hydrolysis process of alkali no3 and production of nitric acid as shown in eqs 41 42 was considered the rate limiting reaction step however it would be replaced by the homolysis of nitric and nitrous acids eqs 43 44 when no substitution reaction occurred in the hno3 nh3 system regardless compared with the o2 h2o or h2o2 h2o systems the formation of oh radicals still consumed less energy at a lower reaction temperature and shorter induction time by hydrolysis homolysis reactions rather than by hydrogen abstraction thereby leading to the faster oxidation rate 41 mn o 2 hx hon o 2 mx 42 mono hx hono mx 43 hono o h no 44 hon o 2 o h n o 2 45 o h n h 3 nh 2 h 2 o 46 n o 2 m no m o 47 nh 2 no n 2 h 2 o

temperature of 350 550 c and time of 0 5 6 0 min meanwhile h2o2 was also added to study the influence of the oxidant coefficient they found that an appropriate amount of h2o2 was significant in the treatment of tn by promoting the conversion from nh4 to n2 which was different from the results obtained by dellorco et al 1997 when the ratio of no3 nh4 was 1 1 the optimal removal efficiency of tn of more than 20 was acquired at 550 c 24 mpa and 1 5 min but low or too high concentrations of no3 all caused lower tn conversion furthermore the addition of transition metal ions would further enhance the removal of tn owing to its different catalytic activities and the order of the removal effect was cu no3 2 co no3 2 fe no3 3 zn no3 2 auxiliary fuels such as ch3oh ethanol and ipa were also introduced into the no3 nh4 system to produce a co reaction and ipa had the greatest effect owing to its high heat release which could realize 40 tn removal efficiency at 450 c and 6 min and accelerate the pyrolysis of no3 compared with those of ethanol and ch3oh moreover compared with that with the addition of metal ions the addition of ipa achieved the highest kinetic rate constant 4 4 oxidation with multi injection oxidants at present tubular reactors are commonly applied in the scwo system and the oxidants are injected once at the inlet of the reactor however when degrading organics with a high concentration abundant heat will be released and cause a local temperature increase in the reactor at the mixing point of organics and the oxidant during the scwo process if the temperature exceeds the design temperature for the reactor then the security and stability of the whole system will be threatened therefore multi injection of oxidants is suggested to control the reaction temperature along the reactor which also enhances the treatment effect of organics to a certain extent 4 4 1 control of temperature distribution in the reactor benjumea et al 2017 controlled the reactor temperature by injecting oxidants in stages the first injection point was at the inlet of the reactor while the second was one third of the way down the reactor inlet the performance and reaction behavior in the reactor were significantly influenced air was considered the oxidant because of the better function of diluting and cooling reactants than pure o2 the results also indicated that the air distribution ratio at the two injection points clearly affected the temperature distribution of the tubular reactor and the degradation effect of organics if a large amount of air is injected into the reactor inlet the mixture of oxidants and feedstock would be diluted and cooled which could lower the reaction temperature to even below the critical temperature thereby inhibiting the scwo reaction therefore they suggested that an insufficient amount of oxidant about 0 5 times the stoichiometric oxygen requirement should be injected into the reactor inlet first to ensure the oxidation of some of the organics and then approximately 1 2 times the stoichiometric oxygen requirement should be added into the second injection point to control the temperature distribution along the reactor and maintain the development of the reaction chkoundali et al 2008 conducted experiments on supercritical hydrothermal oxidation of olive oil wastewater with multi injection of oxidants and recorded the temperature distribution along the reactor their results fit the simulation results by prosim well moreover the cod removal efficiency of olive oil wastewater could be enhanced by increasing the injection temperature of the feedstock inlet portella et al 2007 injected oxidants into three different positions of the reactor 36 m to treat ch3oh by scwo namely the inlet of the reactor and 9 0 m and 17 5 m from the reactor inlet they found that 99 9 removal efficiency of cod could be obtained at 430 c and 25 mpa with the optimal oxidant injection ratio of 6 5 14 they also observed that the temperature of the reactor would rise sharply when injecting the oxidant which would be reduced to the initial temperature in less than 1 min at the injection point of the reactor when the oxygen injection stopped the maximum reaction temperature of 700 c could be obtained by injecting oxygen three times while it was impossible to achieve this temperature by injecting oxidant once at the reactor inlet owing to the limitations of the reactor material vielcazals et al 2006 established a mathematical model to predict the distribution of temperature and substances inside the reactor when injecting the oxidant into the reactor three times with the first point at the reactor inlet and the second and third points 11 6 m and 24 1 m from the inlet respectively the simulation fit the experimental results of ch3oh well they also confirmed that the oxidation of ch3oh was rapid at the oxidant injection points where the temperature also increased sharply and the increase in temperature decreased gradually when injecting the oxidant again later owing to the reduction in the local ch3oh concentration thereby controlling the temperature inside the reactor well 4 4 2 enhancement of the treatment effect of supercritical water oxidation garcia jarana et al 2013 degraded the nitrogen containing organics of dmf by multi injection of oxygen in the scwo environment the key operation parameters such as the second injection point oxidant distribution ratio reaction temperature oxidation coefficient and initial feedstock concentration were also studied to optimize the removal efficiencies of toc and nh3 n the authors proposed that maximum removal efficiencies of 91 8 and 96 2 for toc and dmf could be obtained respectively and the lowest concentration of nh3 n 42 ppm was also obtained in the reaction effluent at 400 c 25 mpa and 6 s with stoichiometric oxygen when the first injection point in the reactor inlet contained 75 of the oxidants and the second injection point was 6 m from the reactor inlet with 25 of the oxidants the removal efficiencies were higher than the 84 9 and 91 6 obtained when the total oxidants were injected once into the reactor inlet respectively they assumed that the improvement of the oxidation effect was due to the change in the reaction pathways for the intermediate products but the specific strengthening mechanisms of segmented oxidation are not clear al duri et al 2015 also proposed that multiple oxidant injection points are beneficial for enhancing the reaction process and promoting the nitrogen transformation into n2 or n2o by changing the reaction pathways of intermediate products when degrading dmf and the location of the second injection point and the distribution ratio of the oxidant depended on the type of organics and both influenced the oxidation behavior of toc and nitrogen in addition garcia jarana et al 2012 also treated the actual cutting fluids with multi injection of oxygen when the rector inlet had 67 of the oxidant and the second injection point was 3 m from the rector inlet with 33 of the oxidant the optimal cod removal efficiency of approximately 55 was achieved at 450 c which was 17 higher than that obtained when injecting the oxidant only at the reactor inlet dellorco et al 1999 studied the hydrothermal oxidation of wastes from the high explosive pbx 9404 and the reactor was optimized by setting multiple points for oxidant injection the first injection point was mainly aimed to treat nh3 n and obtain the minimum tn concentration in the liquid effluent while the second point was used to degrade toc completely with sufficient oxidants approximately 10 the authors proposed that the best second injection point was 45 m from the reactor inlet the total length of the reactor was 229 m and the tn concentration would be increased sharply if the location of the second point moved to the reactor inlet while it increased slightly when the second point moved to the end of the reactor furthermore the flow rate of the feedstock in the reactor inlet also influenced the optimum second injection point it can be seen that the amount and location of oxidant injection points and the ratio of the oxidant distribution all influence the optimal treatment effects for different organics or wastes but detailed research on the removal of nh3 n with multi injection of oxygen is still lacking which is of significance for enhancing the degradation of nitrogen containing compounds at a lower temperature by controlling the injection of oxidants 5 conclusion and future perspectives in this work the treatment effects reaction kinetics migration and transfer pathways of organic nitrogen for different typical nitrogen containing organics amino group nitro group mixed group and nitrogen heteroatom based on scwo technology are discussed scwo which is considered a promising technology for treating organic pollutants could realize the efficient degradation of cod or toc in nitrogen containing organics under typical scwo conditions 500 600 c 24 28 mpa the influences of the reaction temperature oxidant type and concentration residence time and initial concentration of organics on the degradation of organics are also presented the organics with a nitro group were mainly transformed from nitrogen into nox as nitrogen containing intermediate products while nh3 n was the major intermediate product during the oxidation of organics with an amino group or nitrogen heteroatom as for the organics with both amino and nitro groups the produced nox could react via the redox process with nh3 n to produce n2 however nh3 n is a refractory substance and further degradation of nh3 n is the rate limiting step during the scwo of nitrogen containing organics with an amino group and nitrogen heteroatom which requires more severe reaction conditions to achieve effective treatment compared with those required for cod or toc thus different methods were identified to enhance the removal of nh3 n and the corresponding strengthening reaction mechanisms and existing defects were also analyzed in this study including heterogeneous catalytic oxidation with reactor wall and metal oxides co oxidation with auxiliary fuel such as ch3oh ethanol ipa and glycol strong oxidation with no3 or no2 and segmented oxidation by multi injection of oxidants or fuels therefore some suggestions are provided and must be researched in depth in order to overcome the problems in different enhancement processes such as preparing the bimetallic composite catalyst with a high activity and hydrothermal stability in the scwo environment using appropriate methods screening excellent alcohol auxiliaries and optimizing the injection mode applying supercritical hydrothermal flames to enhance the reaction process coupling conventional h2o2 or o2 with no3 or no2 oxidizers and optimizing the system operation parameters and innovation of the mixer and reactor design in order to further improve the synergistic removal efficiency of cod or toc and nh3 n under relatively mild scwo reaction conditions avoid the formation of nox no3 and no2 and convert the organic nitrogen into environmentally friendly products such as n2 and n2o declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

wastewater and sludge has attracted the attention of many scholars nitrogen containing organics are refractory substances that widely exist in industrial waste and their effective degradation is of great significance to the environment in this paper the treatment effects reaction kinetics and migration and transformation pathways of various nitrogen containing organics amino group nitro group mixed group and nitrogen heteroatom under scwo conditions are summarized and the influences of the reaction temperature oxidant type and concentration residence time and initial concentration of organics on the degradation of organics are also discussed nh3 n is the primary intermediate product produced during the oxidation process of the amino group and nitrogen heteroatom organics and the further degradation of nh3 n is the limiting step for the whole reaction this paper focuses on the relevant strengthening technologies used to enhance the degradation of nh3 n including heterogeneous catalytic oxidation with reactor wall or metal oxides co oxidation with auxiliary fuels such as methanol ethanol isopropanol and glycol strong oxidation with no3 or no2 and segmented oxidation by multi injection of oxidants or fuels in addition in order to achieve the complete removal of nh3 n and cod synergistically under relatively mild scwo conditions avoid the formation of nox no3 and no2

supercritical water oxidation nitrogen containing organics ammonia nitrogen reaction mechanism process enhancement 1 introduction the rapid development of industry has caused serious environmental pollution problems and the safety of the ecological environment has become a key issue worldwide although the annual discharge of industrial wastewater and sludge is decreasing gradually the total emissions remain high for example the total discharge of industrial wastewater and sludge is still of the order of tens of billions of tons in china which mainly originates from petrochemical paper printing and dyeing pharmaceutical and other industrial fields most of this wastewater and sludge contains nitrogen containing organics such as sulfonamides and quinolones in pharmaceutical wastewater pyridine and quinoline in pesticide wastewater pyridine indole and amide in coking wastewater and pyridine aniline and nitrobenzene in printing and dyeing wastewater in addition high concentrations of organics nh3 n heavy metals and salinity and poor biodegradability are also the main characteristics of industrial wastewater and sludge these wastes are not only difficult to degrade in the environment but also highly toxic to humans as they can adversely affect the blood and nervous system and cause acute poisoning cancer or even death with long term exposure therefore achieving the efficient degradation of nitrogen containing organics is of great significance to humans and the environment conventional methods used to treat nitrogen containing organics are physicochemical methods such as adsorption extraction and membrane separation hasar 2009 biochemical methods joshiba et al 2019 incineration li 2005 and advanced oxidation technology such as chemical oxidation electrochemical oxidation and wet oxidation gautam et al 2019 oliviero et al 2003 however physicochemical methods are usually applied as a pretreatment technology and are combined with biochemical methods a few hours of operation time or a catalyzer are required for chemical and wet oxidation to effectively degrade nitrogen containing organics although nitrogen containing organics could be treated completely by incineration the secondary pollutant nox transformed from organic nitrogen is generated and must be subsequently treated supercritical water oxidation scwo proposed by professor modell of mit in the 1980s is a promising technology for treating industrial wastewater and sludge modell 1980 that can homogeneously dissolve organics as well as oxygen transform the carbon hydrogen and nitrogen in the organics into harmless co2 h2o and n2 respectively savage 1999 convert the heterocyclic atoms chlorine sulfur and phosphorus into corresponding inorganic acids or salts armellini et al 1994 and mineralize and deposit heavy metals into stable solid residue compared with the conventional methods mentioned above scwo has the advantages of a rapid reaction rate high removal efficiency environmental friendliness and high economic efficiency the scwo system can also realize auto thermal equilibrium when the mass concentration of organics exceeds 3 wt cocero et al 2002 a basic diagram of scwo is shown in fig 1 including feedstock pretreatment oxidant pretreatment scwo reaction cooling and energy recovery of products depressurization and separation and recovery of products in the early development stage of scwo it was mainly used to destroy dangerous military wastes such as chemical weapons nuclear consumables waste ammunition and harmful waste liquid of warships cohen et al 1998 scwo has aroused the wide interest and attention of scholars owing to its advantages including scholars from mit helling and tester 1987 the university of michigan martino and savage 1999b university of texas li et al 1991 tokyo university shimoda et al 2016 tsinghua university xiang et al 2002 zhejiang university zou et al 2013 chinese academy of sciences chen et al

mechanisms reaction kinetics and reaction models of refractory organic compounds such as dioxin zhao et al 2014 polychlorinated biphenyls hatakeda et al 1999 phenol thornton and savage 1992 acetic acid meyer et al 1995 and nitrobenzene zhang and hua 2003 industrial wastewater such as coking wastewater du et al 2013 semi coke wastewater li et al 2020 landfill leachate gong et al 2018 alcohol

et al 2017 municipal sludge qian et al 2016 spoiled food jin et al 2001 and human metabolites wang et al 1997 at present scwo has been commercialized in many countries to treat different types of waste for example ecowaste technologies in the usa built a 3 8 ton d scwo device to treat simple organics such as hydrocarbons and amines in 1994 general atomics in the usa established scwo plants with different scales to degrade industrial wastewater pink water chemical weapons explosives and propellants from 2001 to 2011 marrone 2013 and hanwha chemical in south korea modar in japan and hydrothermal oxidation option in france have set up scwo units to process wastewater from dnt and tpa production melamine wastewater laboratory wastewater and food industry wastewater marrone 2013 as for sludge hydroprocessing supercritical fluids international and superwater solutions in the usa chematur engineering ab in sweden and xi an jiaotong university in china have all built commercial scwo devices with different processing capacities griffith and raymond 2002 schmieder and abeln 2015 stavbar et al 2017 xu et al 2012 in addition innoveox in france chematur engineering in the uk modar and sri international in japan and foster wheeler in the usa have also established plants to degrade hazardous industrial waste spent catalysts semiconductor manufacturing wastes pcbs smokes and dyes marrone 2013 clearly the feasibility of using scwo for the treatment of different organic wastes has been confirmed in experimental and industrial conditions however for the nitrogen containing organics and industrial wastewater and sludge with high concentrations of nh3 n besides the effective degradation of cod or toc in organics the removal of nitrogen should also be of serious concern as it can greatly threaten the function of the water body therefore in this paper the treatment effects and kinetic parameters of different types of nitrogen containing organics and nh3 n in the scwo environment are summarized and the influence of the reaction temperature oxidant type and concentration residence time and initial concentration of organics on the degradation of organics are discussed the migration and transformation pathways of organic nitrogen in different nitrogen containing groups are analyzed to understand the mechanisms of degradation furthermore measures including catalytic supercritical water oxidation cscwo co oxidation with auxiliary fuels strong oxidation with nitrates and nitrites and segmented oxidation are elaborated in detail to enhance the process of treating cod or toc and nh3 n synchronously in one scwo system under relatively mild reaction conditions and the corresponding problems and challenges are introduced 2 degradation of typical nitrogen containing organics by supercritical water oxidation 2 1 treatment effect and reaction kinetics of different nitrogen containing organics the focus of scwo in the treatment of nitrogen containing organics can be divided into four aspects namely 1 amine organics such as methylamine aniline ethylenediamine and isopropylamine 2 nitro organics such as nitrobenzene nitrophenol and aliphatic nitro compounds 3 mixed group amine and nitro organics such as nitroaniline and 4 heteroatom organics such as pyridine quinoline and acrylonitrile which are abundant in industrial organic waste therefore we summarized the treatment effects and reaction kinetic parameters calculated by different models such as the pseudo first order non linear regression and multi variable non linear least squares models of various nitrogen containing organics under scwo or cscwo conditions in the past few years as shown in tables 1 and 2 the reaction rates of organics are described by the global power law reaction rate expression as shown in eq 1 the reaction order of water is approximately equal to 0 owing to the large quantities of water in the scwo system mateos et al 2005 1 d c d t k 0 c a o b h 2 o c a exp

initial concentration of organics mol l o initial concentration of oxidants mol l h2o concentration of water mol l a reaction order of organics b reaction order of oxidants c reaction order of water as concluded from table 1 more than 90 removal efficiency of most of the nitrogen containing organics or their concentrations of cod or toc could be obtained under typical scwo conditions 500 600 c 24 28 mpa with o2 or h2o2 oxidants it is known that scwo follows the free radical reaction mechanism which mainly includes initiation propagation and termination stages and the major reaction pathways are described in table 3 boock and klein 1993 croiset et al 1997 li et al 1991 more concretely the scwo reaction is initiated by the hydrogen abstraction between organics and oxidants furthermore the steps of chain propagation between radicals and molecules including oxygen addition to a radical to form peroxy radicals ro2 which could react with initial organics to produce hydroperoxides rooh by hydrogen abstraction and isomerization intramolecular hydrogen abstraction reactions increase the stability of free radicals with no change in the concentration the β scission reaction breaks the weak β bond in the radical center and generates some smaller radicals and molecules with double bonds the reactions in the propagation stage maintain balance in the consumption and formation of radicals furthermore the disproportionation reaction non terminating radical recombination between ro2 results in the formation of ro which also transfers the reaction chain in addition the generated rooh will decompose to produce ro and hydroxyl radicals oh finally radicals such as r ro and roo will collide to form stable molecules by recombination and or disproportionation reactions in the termination step the total concentration of radicals is determined by the initiation branching and termination stages clearly oh is the primary active component which could react with almost all of the organics furthermore the operation parameters such as reaction temperature the type and concentration of oxidant residence time and initial concentration of organics could all influence the production of oh to a certain extent but the reaction pressure has an insignificant effect when it reaches the supercritical pressure chang and liu 2007 liu et al 2009 oshima et al 1998 2 1 1 influence of reaction temperature the reaction temperature has a positive influence on the treatment of nitrogen containing organics regardless of whether they have amino nitro or nitrogen heteroatoms and the degradation efficiency of cod or toc significantly increases with the increase in the reaction temperature dong et al 2015a gong et al 2016 ma et al 2012 yang et al 2018a gong et al 2016 found that the toc removal efficiency of quinazoline increased from 91 4 to 96 2 when the reaction temperature increased from 400 c to 600 c and a higher temperature was favored to produce less co and more co2 the maximum yield of co2 8 55 mol mol which seemed to approach a constant value was obtained at 600 c similar results were also obtained by zhou et al 2013 who explored the scwo of copper complex ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid cu ii edta and found that a higher temperature improved the conversion of toc 77 4 at 420 c and 99 0 at 500 c and decreased the production of co by increasing the oxidation rate of co and changing the reaction pathways furthermore ren et al 2019 displayed that the scwo reaction could be initiated earlier at a higher temperature because the co2 yield was high at 480 c and 510 c while it was less than 10 at 420 c and 450 c within 2 min yang et al 2018c studied the influence of temperature on the treatment of 44 nitrogen containing compounds including amino nitro nitrogen heteroatom diazo and mixed group organics and found that the toc removal efficiency increased sharply as the temperature increased from 350 c to 500 c which was in the range of 80 to 100 and then remained stable after 500 c furthermore diazo organics obtained the highest toc removal efficiency because it was easily attacked by oh the reasons for these results could be divided into three aspects first the increasing temperature could increase the percentage of activated molecules such as oh and enhance the effective collision between activated molecules such as oh and r thereby improving the reaction rate second for the refractory organics or intermediate products with higher activation energies increasing the reaction temperature could even exceed the activation energy barrier of these substances thereby leading to an active reaction and effective removal chang and liu 2007 chen et al 2001 indicated that more than 90 removal efficiency could be achieved only when the reaction temperature reached 600 c and 650 c for aniline and nitrobenzene respectively third the increase in the reaction temperature also has a negative effect on the reaction rate because the density of water will decrease under the fixed reaction pressure which will decrease the concentration of reactants and result in a lower reaction rate dong et al 2015a nevertheless the positive effect of the reaction temperature still plays a more dominant role than the negative effect and a higher temperature contributes to the degradation of organics 2 1 2 influence of oxidants the oxidants commonly utilized to treat nitrogen containing organics in the scwo environment are mainly o2 and h2o2 which will produce oh by different hydrogen abstraction steps as shown in table 3 o2 first reacts with organics to produce ho2 which reacts with organics in return to form h2o2 and then produce oh while h2o2 could generate oh directly by thermal decomposition lee et al 1990 li et al 1991 nevertheless the effects of o2 and h2o2 on organic degradation and the reaction rate are related to the pretreatment method which means that h2o2 should be distinguished as the resource of o2 or as the major oxidant under scwo conditions phenix et al 2002 for instance h2o2 has more active oxidation characteristics and could obtain a higher removal efficiency of organics than o2 when h2o2 or o2 mix with organics directly at ambient temperature and the mixed solution is preheated to supercritical state together this is because h2o2 can more easily initiate the hydrogen abstraction reaction that is considered the rate limiting step and consume less energy than o2 to generate oh by decomposition which bypasses the reaction with a relatively low reaction rate between organics and o2 and ho2 meanwhile the mass transfer resistance between o2 and organics also exists and means that h2o2 solution is easier to mix homogeneously with the reactants than gaseous oxygen at the initial state before reaching the supercritical temperature li et al 1991 ren et al 2019 in addition 99 95 removal efficiency of 2 4 dichlorophenol could be obtained at 450 c with h2o2 while only 62 50 was removed with o2 under the same conditions the same results were also obtained when oxidizing acetic acid lee et al 1990 moreover ren et al 2019 also indicated that compared with o2 h2o2 can strongly enhance the formation of co2 during the scwo of quinoline however the h2o2 would be decomposed into o2 and h2o if it is preheated before entering the reactor and a similar oxidation effect was achieved compared with that of o2 phenix et al 2002 bourhis et al 1995 found that h2o2 has a more significant influence on the treatment of organics in the initial stage of scwo while the effect of o2 dominated the reaction rate when the medium environment became homogeneous furthermore li et al 1993 also found that h2o2 is more reactive at 200 300 c while o2 obtains better removal results at 400 500 c when degrading dnt wastewater because oh produced by h2o2 would cause side reactions under supercritical conditions furthermore gong et al 2016 showed that increasing the oxidation coefficient strongly affects the degradation of quinazoline even at a lower oxidant concentration a 97 2 toc removal efficiency was obtained with an oxidation coefficient of 4 while a removal efficiency of only approximately 80 0 was obtained with stoichiometric oxygen the increase started to stabilize when the oxidation coefficient was greater than 2 moreover a higher oxidant concentration could also inhibit the formation of coke liu et al 2009 also indicated that a higher h2o2 concentration could strongly enhance the treatment of sodium 3 5 6 trichloropyridin 2 ol and a removal efficiency of almost 100 was achieved with 1 wt h2o2 moreover ma et al 2012 expressed that the degradation of aniline greatly depends on the oxidation coefficient when the oxidation coefficient increased from 1 1 to 2 3 the toc removal efficiency could increase by approximately 6 and the yield of co2 was greatly enhanced similar results were also achieved by ren et al 2019 who found that increasing the concentration of h2o2 significantly enhances the conversion of quinoline furthermore al duri et al 2016 found that the toc removal could be enhanced steadily by increasing the oxidation coefficient even if it was 2 but the improvement was not as remarkable as that when the reaction temperature was increased shin et al 2009 found that the oxidant concentration has an insignificant influence on the treatment of toc removal when it is excessive clearly increasing the oxidation coefficient appropriately could greatly enhance the treatment of organics but different from the reaction temperature an excess oxidant concentration will not promote further degradation and only keep it stable therefore there is an optimal oxidant concentration value to degrade organics chang and liu 2007 dong et al 2015a gong et al 2016 this is because the quantity of oh will increase with the increase in the oxidant concentration thereby accelerating the reaction rate however a higher concentration of oh will consume h2o2 and produce ho2 with relatively low activity which is regarded as a competitive reaction with organics moreover excess oxidants will also greatly increase the energy consumption of the pump or compressor chang and liu 2007 suggested that an oxidation coefficient of 3 is suitable for treating 2 4 6 trinitrotoluene tnt and 2 3 times stoichiometric oxygen is required to better remove aniline ma et al 2012 in addition the mixed mode between oxidants and organics also influences the reaction rate of scwo choosing an appropriate mixer could improve the mixing intensity and rate to reduce the induction time for initiating free radical reactions phenix et al 2002 proved that the oxidation kinetics are related to the mixing efficiency and the induction time could be decreased from 3 2 s to 0 7 s when the mixture of oxidants and organics in the fully developed turbulent region is mixed using the mixing crosses installed in small inserts 2 1 3 influence of residence time residence time is another key operation parameter during the scwo process it determines the length of the tubular reactor in the continuous experimental system as with the oxidation coefficient an optimal value exists for residence time the removal efficiency of toc or cod can increase significantly with the extension of the residence time but it will remain almost constant when the residence time reaches a definite value this phenomenon was observed in the cases of tnt aniline nitrobenzene p nitrophenol or quinazoline treatments chang and liu 2007 chen et al 2001 dong et al 2015a gong et al 2016 this is because most organics can be removed and the concentration of reactants can be reduced gradually as the reaction progresses leading to the termination steps with a lower conversion rate mentioned in table 3 becoming dominant vogel et al 2005 gong et al 2016 found that the removal of toc in quinazoline increased significantly in the first 60 s and then remained constant as the residence time increased the degradation of sodium 3 5 6 trichloropyridin 2 ol would not be affected by the residence time when it was greater than 6 5 min and 99 14 of organics could be decomposed liu et al 2009 furthermore the toc removal efficiency increased by approximately 35 when the residence time increased from 1 min to 3 min during the scwo process of 2 nitroaniline and 100 degradation could be achieved at 6 min the change tended to be stable after 4 5 min yang et al 2018a and a residence time of 6 s was suggested for p nitrophenol at 400 c dong et al 2015a 2 1 4 influence of initial concentration of organics the initial concentration of organics positively influences the oxidation efficiency to some extent qi et al 2002 ma et al 2012 indicated that the destruction efficiency of toc could increase by 7 4 when the concentration of aniline increased from 0 5 wt to 1 0 wt but if the concentration increased further then the removal efficiency changed slightly and was negligible a similar conclusion was obtained by shin et al 2009 who suggested that the toc removal efficiency remained almost unchanged when the initial concentration of toc in acrylonitrile wastewater increased from 0 26 mol l to 2 10 mol l ren et al 2019 expressed that the temperature rise in the reactor would become much steeper with the increase in the quinoline concentration and a temperature peak occurred when the concentration reached 8 wt a greater than 100 c temperature rise was obtained with 10 wt quinoline thereby resulting in the improvement in conversion of quinoline and production of co2 the authors suggested that the higher concentration of organics could cause a clear temperature rise in the reactor by releasing more heat thereby enhancing the formation of oh to accelerate the reaction rate even so compared with the significant effects of the reaction temperature oxidation coefficient and residence time on the degradation of organics the change in the initial concentration of organics has an inconspicuous influence perez et al 2004 2 2 transformation pathway of organic nitrogen in different nitrogen containing organics 2 2 1 amine group organics as for organics with an amine group organic nitrogen is mainly transformed into nh3 n through simple intermediate products containing nitrogen the primary reaction pathways for methylamine and aniline are shown in fig 2 and other substances such as nox and n2o are trace benjamin and savage 2005a established a detailed chemical kinetic model of methylamine and found that the main products are formamide nh3 n co2 and formic acid in the scwo process and nh3 n mainly originates from the hydrolysis of formamide the other experimental results of benjamin and savage 2005b and li and oshima 2005 showed that nh3 n is the main intermediate product of methylamine and could be further oxidized to n2o and n2 under suitable conditions in addition li and oshima 2005 also found the existence of hcn and nox and indicated that the selectivity of nh3 n is not affected by the amount of oxidant but by the reaction temperature that is the yield of nh3 n will be increased with the increase in temperature when dimethylamine and trimethylamine are regarded as reactants nh3 n mainly originates from the intermediate product dimethylamine and the concentrations of nox n2o and n2 are small li and oshima 2006 a similar conclusion could be applied to aromatic organics with an amino group ma et al 2012 showed that aniline can be attacked by oh to produce the intermediate products phenol and nh3 n which will be further converted into the final products of n2 n2o and no3 with the increase in the reaction temperature oxidation coefficient and residence time under the action of metal catalysts furthermore nh3 n also exists in large quantities during the scwo process of other relatively complex organics with an amine group such as 2 aminoethanol funazukuri and takahashi 1999 ethylenediamine zhang and ma 2011 and cu ii edta zhou et al 2013 2 2 2 nitro group organics transformation of organics with a nitro group differs from that of organics with an amine group in the former nox no2 and no3 is considered the main intermediate product during the scwo process lee and park 1996 investigated the pyrolysis of nitrobenzene and found that the c n bond on nitrobenzene was first attacked by oh to produce benzene and no2 which could be further reduced to n2 owing to its oxidation and little nh3 n and no3 were also detected abundant n2 is formed when o2 is added while the total yield of nh3 n no2 and no3 is less than 10 furthermore zhang and hua 2003 also examined the scwo of nitrobenzene under the conditions of 378 600 c 25 0 34 6 mpa and 80 160 s and it was suggested that more than 85 of nitrobenzene was converted into n2 no2 and no3 but the yield of nox was always less than 10 under all the conditions and the concentration of no2 was higher than that of no3 the authors explained that the weak bond of c n would be directly attacked by oh resulting in the formation of no2 radicals which could react with oh again to produce n2 and no2 in addition dong et al 2015a studied the scwo of p nitrophenol and the corresponding migration and transformation pathways are shown in fig 3 clearly the nitro group will be destroyed first and experiments on other organics such as 2 nitrophenol 2 nitrotoluene 4 nitrophenol and 3 nitrobenzoic acid were also conducted at 350 500 c 24 mpa and 500 excess oxygen within 150 s no3 was proved to be the major nitrogen containing product while nh3 n was produced only in trace amounts yang et al 2018b yang et al 2018c yang et al 2017 in addition the amount of no3 generated from 2 nitrophenol was higher than that generated from 4 nitrophenol thereby implying that the ortho nitro group more easily produces no3 than that at the para position yang et al 2018c chang and liu 2007 also proposed that the ortho nitro group is attacked by oh first followed by the para nitro group when tnt is degraded via scwo 2 2 3 mixed group amino and nitro organics different from organics with a single nitrogen containing group such as amine and nitro here the mixed group organics are the compounds that contain both lee et al 1997 conducted an experiment on the hydrothermal decomposition of p nitroaniline without oxidants at 385 440 c and 25 mpa within 5 30 s but the oxidation reaction was also observed in the same process the p nitroaniline was decomposed to form o2 co co2 and n2 which was due to the oxidation of no2 produced from the hydrothermal reaction when injecting o2 into the reactant the removal efficiency of p nitroaniline could be further improved in addition yang et al 2017 degraded 2 nitroaniline and the results indicated that n2 was the predominant nitrogen containing product fig 4 indicates the simplified transformation pathway of organic nitrogen in 2 nitroaniline including the denitrification ring opening and mineralization stages the author believed that oh would attack nh2 to form nh4 first and then break the no2 to produce no2 and the oxidative no2 would react with nh4 to finally generate n2 under the scwo environment furthermore they also compared the reaction of the mixed solution aniline and nitrobenzene with a single solution 2 nitroaniline 3 nitroaniline and 4 nitroaniline yang et al 2018a and the conclusion showed that the removal efficiency of total nitrogen tn in single solutions was higher than that in the mixed solution under the same conditions thereby suggesting that the reaction between no2 and nh4 occurred more easily within the molecule rather than between the molecules furthermore lee et al 1997 also proposed that the nitro group can be utilized as an oxidant together with o2 or h2o2 to create a synergistic effect in the treatment of nitrogen containing organics and the nitro group mainly contributes to the treatment of inorganic nitrogen such as nh3 n and nox while o2 or h2o2 focus on the degradation of organics and its intermediate organic products 2 2 4 nitrogen heteroatom organics the transformation pathway of organic nitrogen in nitrogen heteroatom compounds is also discussed here pinto et al 2006a studied the scwo treatment of quinoline and concluded that the organic nitrogen was mainly converted into n2 and nh3 n when the temperature was higher than 525 c trace no2 and no3 were also detected which could be neglected a similar result was obtained by gong et al 2016 who explained that nh3 n was the major product when the temperature ranged from 400 c to 525 c crain et al 1993 researched the reaction pathways of pyridine as shown in fig 5 nh3 n was also found as the major product in liquid effluent while little no2 existed but no n2 was detected in the gaseous state which meant that nh3 n could not be decomposed effectively under 522 c and 25 mpa within 6 59 s in addition complex nitrogen containing organics have also been studied by some scholars the scwo of 1 8 diazabicyclo 5 4 0 undec 7 ene dbu was explored and the organic nitrogen was primarily transformed into nh3 n and an insignificant amount of no2 and no3 furthermore n2 was formed when the temperature exceeded 550 c but 60 of nh3 n still remained in the liquid effluent even at 650 c in addition nh3 n tends to be converted into n2o rather than n2 when the concentration of the oxidant is increased al duri et al 2016 al duri et al 2008 aymonier et al 2000 reported the fate of nitrogen in hydrothermal oxidation of fenuron and found that fenuron first transformed into nitrobenzene nh3 n and a small amount of no3 and then the nitrobenzene could be further oxidized into nh3 n and no3 in the liquid effluent no n2o or nox were detected in the gaseous effluents and the nitrogen could be completely converted into n2 at 540 c within 39 s thereby indicating that a redox reaction occurred between no3 and nh3 n which was considered the limiting step throughout the transformation process of nitrogen in fenuron 2 2 5 comparison of different transformation pathways for nitrogen containing organics as mentioned in 2 2 1 2 2 4 we concluded that the transformation pathways of organic nitrogen are significantly affected by the types of nitrogenous groups as for amine group organics oh would attack the amine groups directly to produce nh3 n and then the nh3 n could be oxidized by oh further into n2 and trace n2o and no3 under suitable reaction conditions even with catalysts however the organic nitrogen in nitro group organics behaves differently where nox no2 and no3 is the dominant intermediate product owing to the weak bond of c n which could be easily attacked by oh furthermore the oxidizing nox would react with hydrocarbon compounds and a certain amount of n2 would be generated when treating organics containing both an amine group and a nitro group the oh would attack the amine and nitro groups to produce nh4 and nox as intermediate products step by step and then the oxidative nox could react with the reductive nh4 to produce n2 compared with the organics with a single amine group or nitro group the transformation of organic nitrogen into n2 is much easier even under relatively mild reaction conditions as for nitrogen heteroatom organics nh4 is the major intermediate product and trace nox would also be generated moreover the transformation of nitrogen to n2 in this system is dependent on the reaction conditions to some extent 3 degradation of ammonia by supercritical water oxidation compared with nox the further degradation of refractory nh3 n is the key rate limiting step throughout the treatment of nitrogen containing compounds al duri et al 2008 therefore the removal of nh3 n during the scwo process has aroused wide interest of scholars owing to its refractory characteristics even though the structure of nh3 n is simple studies on the degradation effects are shown in table 4 the parameters of the reaction kinetics based on eq 1 are shown in table 5 and the different process enhancement methods are described in detail in the following section concluding from tables 4 and 5 there are some differences in the treatment efficiency and kinetic parameters of nh3 n between the results obtained from different scholars which are mainly due to the various reaction systems such as the type size and material of the reactor reaction conditions such as the temperature pressure residence time and oxidant and sources of nh3 n such as pure aqueous nh3 industrial wastewater sludge or wastes utilized in the experiments nevertheless helling and tester 1988 pointed out that nh3 n cannot be degraded by scwo when the temperature is below 525 c and an nh3 n removal efficiency of only 5 can be obtained at 540 c which is similar to the results obtained by ding et al 1998 when treating nh3 n without a catalyst even at 680 c with a 10 9 s residence time only 10 9 of nh3 n was degraded effectively webley et al 1991 furthermore as shown in table 5 the reaction order of nh3 n was higher than that of the oxidant when the scwo reaction occurred without catalysts thereby indicating that changing the concentration of nh3 n influences the treatment of nh3 n more than changing the oxidant concentration clearly the effective removal of nh3 n is more difficult than that of cod or toc when compared with table 1 which requires harsh reaction conditions such as a higher reaction temperature 650 c higher reaction pressure 28 30 mpa longer residence time 10 min and more oxidants excess of 300 1000 however these severe conditions will undoubtedly enlarge the size of the reactor and increase the requirements for material properties with high temperature and corrosion resistance in addition the supplementation of oxidants will also be doubled and additional heat sources will be required thereby resulting in high investment and operation costs and reducing the economic efficiency of the system to a large extent therefore realizing the collaborative removal of cod and nh3 n under a relatively mild reaction environment is important to optimize the process of scwo 4 enhancement of the supercritical water oxidation process for ammonia 4 1 catalytic supercritical water oxidation based on the catalytic wet oxidation of nh3 n the catalysts commonly used to enhance the reaction process are mainly divided into the following categories metal oxide catalysts coo cr2o3 mno2 nio n2o3 v2o5 zno co2o3 and fe2o3 composite metal oxide catalysts mn ce 7 3 and co bi mixed oxides transition metals and precious metals iridium platinum gold palladium rhodium iron nickel tungsten copper and cobalt these all have significant effects on the degradation of nh3 n and the selectivity of gaseous products oliviero et al 2003 therefore cscwo of nh3 n has aroused the extensive interest of scholars including reactor surface catalysts such as inconel 625 sus316 and hastelloy c 276 and metal oxide catalysts such as mno2 mno2 ceo2 mno2 γ al2o3 mn cu o ta 55 and ceo2 mnox tio2 table 6 summarizes the treatment effect of cscwo on nh3 n 4 1 1 heterogeneous catalysis of the reactor surface as the core equipment of the scwo system several scholars found that the reactor surface has a catalytic effect during the nh3 n degradation process webley et al 1991 compared the treatment of nh3 n in the tubular reactor and packed bed reactor filled with some inconel 625 beads and the results showed that only 1 1 of nh3 n could be removed at 700 c within 10 5 s and no no no2 or n2o was detected in the tubular reactor the activation energy of nh3 n was 38 kcal mol in the temperature range of 640 700 c while the removal efficiency of nh3 n could reach up to 13 9 at 531 c and 9 5 s and a trace amount of n2o was found in the packed reactor the corresponding activation energy was 7 1 kcal mol within 530 680 c which was lower than that in the tubular reactor and the reaction rate in the packed reactor was over four times greater than that in the tubular reactor owing to the catalysis of the inconel 625 reactor surface segond et al 2002 conducted experiments on the scwo reaction of nh3 n in two isothermal and isobaric plug flow reactors made of stainless steel 316 with different surface to volume ratios s v and found that when the s v increased from 1 85 to 4 00 the nh3 n removal efficiency increased from 51 to 93 at 603 c and the yields of n2 and n2o also increased moreover the corresponding reaction rate constant also increased positively with the s v the authors suggested that the metal in the reactor surface mainly enhanced the reactions given in eqs 2 and 3 and homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions both occurred while the heterogeneous reaction on the reactor wall was dominant in addition akizuki et al 2016 studied the hydrolysis of benzamide in sub supercritical water and proved that the metal oxides fe2o3 fe3o4 cr2o3 and fecr2o4 on the surface of the sus316 reactor have the catalytic activity to accelerate the reaction rate rather than the metal ions dissolved in the supercritical water the catalytic activity was in the order of fe2o3 fe3o4 cr2o3 fecr2o4 while fe2o3 was the main contributor to the heterogeneous catalytic reaction in addition benjamin and savage 2005b and ma et al 2012 also investigated the catalytic effect of the hastelloy c 276 reactor on the degradation of methylamine and nh3 n and proposed that the catalytic activity of hastelloy c 276 is even faster than that of stainless steel and inconel and the main gas product is n2o rather than n2 under the action of the hastelloy c 276 therefore choosing a reactor with a suitable type size and material contributed to reducing the reaction conditions and enhancing the reaction rate of nh3 n degradation 2 2 nh 3 1 5 o 2 metal n 2 3 h 2 o 3 2 nh 3 2 o 2 metal n 2 o 3 h 2 o 4 1 2 heterogeneous catalysis of metal oxides oshima et al 2001 showed that mno2 can increase the degradation efficiency of nh3 n and promote the conversion of nh3 n to n2 in the scwo environment nh3 n was degraded completely at 510 c and the gas product selectivity for n2 was 90 at 470 c under the catalysis of mno2 although a small amount of n2o was also generated through a parallel reaction path ding et al 1998 studied the cscwo of nh3 n in a continuous flow packed bed reactor and observed that the removal efficiency of nh3 n could reach 96 at 450 c and 1 s with an mno2 ceo2 catalyst nh3 n was primarily transformed into n2 and trace n2o in the gas product while a small amount of no3 was detected in the liquid product but the conversion of nh3 n could be neglected under similar reaction conditions without a catalyst even with excess oxidant the authors proposed that the activity of oxygen molecules adsorbed on the mno2 ceo2 catalyst was much higher than that of oh and ho2 radicals produced by the oxidant and thus accelerated the oxidation rate moreover the mechanism of the nh3 n catalytic reaction could be described as follows where represents the active site on the catalyst surface 4 o 2 k 1 o 2 2 o 5 n h 3 o k 2 n h h 2 o 6 n h o k 3 hn o 7 n h hn o k 4 n 2 h 2 o 3 8 hn o hn o k 5 n 2 o h 2 o 4 furthermore ding et al 1998 also tested the physical and chemical performance of the mno2 ceo2 catalyst in the harsh environment of scwo although the removal efficiency of nh3 n changed less when the catalyst was exposed to scwo conditions for 30 min clear physical inactivation also occurred for example the surface area of the catalyst decreased from 198 0 m2 g to 13 5 m2 g and the oxidation state of mno2 ceo2 also changed and mn2o3 was formed moreover the catalyst changed from an amorphous structure to partial crystallization and the strength of the catalyst was greatly reduced therefore improving the thermal stability and activity of the catalyst in scwo is another important goal that also influences the removal effect and system stability the physical performance of the catalyst such as the mechanical strength specific surface area pore volume crystal structure dispersion of active components and particle size mainly depends on the preparation method and process of the catalyst ding et al 1996 guan et al 2018 the key parameters include the ph value temperature pressure drying method baking temperature and baking time furthermore the methods applied to prepare metal oxide catalysts include impregnation sol gel co precipitation precipitation adsorption and ion exchange while the impregnation method is generally used in the scwo reaction tang et al 2006 prepared a mnox ceo2 catalyst using different methods such as the sol gel method co precipitation method and modified co precipitation method to improve the oxidation of formaldehyde and indicated that the catalyst created using the modified co precipitation method possessed both a high catalytic activity and great physical properties for example the surface areas for the sol gel method co precipitation method and modified co precipitation method were 22 2 m2 g 126 3 m2 g and 124 0 m2 g respectively and richer lattice oxygen as well as more manganese oxide species with higher oxidation states existed in the catalyst created by the modified co precipitation method moreover guan et al 2018 compared the preparation methods of mno2 composite catalyst including the sol gel method rheological phase reaction method micro emulsion method chemical co precipitation method solid phase synthesis and template method during the oxidation of formaldehyde in detail and found that different methods influence the catalytic performance to some extent therefore selecting an appropriate preparation method and optimizing the preparation conditions might greatly improve the hydrothermal stability and activity of the catalyst in the scwo environment however we noted that the catalysts utilized to treat nh3 n are mostly single metal oxides such as mno2 or single metal oxide supported catalysts such as mno2 ceo2 but some researchers have proved that the interaction between composite metals can enhance the activity stability and selectivity of catalysts such as modifying the surface properties of catalysts reducing the hydrogen spillover effect of basic active metal components or producing the group effect ligand effect stability effect synergistic effect and dual function effect among others alonso et al 2012 for example the addition of copper oxide was confirmed to increase the content of defective oxygen on the surface of the catalyst promote the dispersion of manganese and increase its oxidation state and reduce the corresponding reduction temperature of catalysts thereby eventually resulting in the enhancement of the interaction between manganese and copper oxide in addition benzene can be degraded completely at 285 c by combustion under the catalysis of 8 mno2 2 cuo al2o3 ce0 45zr0 45y0 05la0 05o1 95 cao et al 2012 in addition in the combustion process of propane and ethanol the catalytic activity of the mn cu composite oxide mncux is superior to that of pure mn2o3 or cuo and the excellent catalytic performance might result from the presence of cu1 5mn1 5o4 where mno2 has the ability to adsorb and activate o2 and the active phase can also be improved and stabilized by cuo morales et al 2006 furthermore vu et al 2009 also found that the composite catalyst mncuox tio2 has significant catalytic activity when degrading chlorobenzene through wet oxidation owing to the formation of mn1 6cu1 4o4 spinel supported on anatase tio2 on the basis of catalytic combustion and wet catalytic oxidation some studies have been conducted to degrade nh3 n using composite catalysts under the scwo environment gong et al 2018 prepared a cemnox tio2 catalyst to treat landfill leachate by scwo the removal efficiency of nh3 n could increase from 92 43 to 98 99 when the catalyst addition increased from 0 5 wt to 2 0 wt and the ratio of ce mn was 1 2 at 600 c 25 mpa and 600 s with an oxidation coefficient of 1 67 in addition the activity and thermal stability could still be maintained even if the catalyst was used repeatedly five times an nh3 n removal efficiency of 97 09 was obtained and the specific surface area pore diameter distribution crystal phase composition and structure did not change significantly the authors suggested that mnox was treated as the major active component while ceo2 was mainly regarded as the additive and o2 provider hu et al 2014 compared the performance of mn o tio2 al2o3 mn cu o tio2 al2o3 mn ce o tio2 al2o3 and mn co o tio2 al2o3 catalysts during the scwo of nh3 n and found that although the addition of active components of cu ce or co had no clear effect on the specific surface area of the catalyst it was highly doped and dispersed on the support surface the results also showed that mn cu o tio2 al2o3 had a higher catalyst activity and could degrade 55 8 of nh3 n at 460 c 26 mpa and 4 5 s residence time with an oxidation coefficient of 1 67 when the ratio of mn cu was 5 5 the authors assumed that the reduction of manganese oxide was catalyzed by the reduced copper due to the hydrogen overflow effect which greatly improved the oxidation performance of the catalyst in addition peng et al 2007 also indicated that the degradation efficiency of nh3 n was 99 7 at 450 c 25 mpa and 1 s with an oxidation coefficient of 2 94 under the action of an mn ce o composite metal oxide catalyst when the mn ce ratio was 5 5 which was attributed to the strong synergistic effect between manganese and cerium promoting the mobility of oxygen 4 2 co oxidation with auxiliary alcohols co oxidation refers to the rapid oxidation of active organics to produce active radicals which can promote the decomposition of refractory compounds further in one oxidation reaction system moreover active organics such as alcohols usually have a high calorific value thus a significant amount of heat will be released during the scwo process leading to the rise in the actual reaction temperature thus the system operation temperature required for degradation of refractory substances could be minimized hayashi et al 2007 savage et al 2000 cabeza et al 2011 found that when the initial concentration of isopropanol ipa increases from 1 wt to 5 wt the reaction temperature can be increased from 440 c to 708 c during the scwo process of methylamine at 450 c and 24 9 mpa benjamin and savage 2005b observed that the oxidation rate of nh3 n 1 58 10 4 mol l s was higher than that of pure nh3 was 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than that found by other scholars such as 4 81 10 8 mol l s for webley et al 1991 and 9 38 10 7 mol l s for segond et al 2002 in the tubular reactor and five times higher than that in the packed bed reactor with a high surface area it is believed that the existence of methylamine or its related intermediate active radicals enhance the oxidation of nh3 n and promote the conversion of gaseous products to n2o rather than n2 at present some scholars have confirmed that alcohol auxiliaries such as methanol ethanol and ipa have a significant impact on the degradation characteristics of nh3 n in the scwo environment as shown in table 7 but there are still some differences in the interaction rules and enhancement mechanisms 4 2 1 methanol webley et al 1991 indicated that the degradation of ch3oh and nh3 n do not influence each other and their reaction paths are mutually independent in the tubular reactor the removal efficiency of ch3oh could reach 100 while only 7 nh3 n was degraded at 530 c 24 5 mpa and 8 s when the experiments were conducted in the packed bed reactor the presence of ch3oh was found to inhibit the oxidation of nh3 n to some extent whose reaction rate was approximately 33 3 of that for pure nh3 n this was because the heterogeneous catalysis by the reactor surface was dominant in the packed reactor and the addition of ch3oh would increase the competitive adsorption between ch3oh and nh3 n on the catalytic surface thereby reducing the oxidation rate of nh3 n oe et al 2007 found that the addition of ch3oh could strongly affect the oxidation behavior of nh3 n nh3 n could be degraded completely at 590 c 25 mpa and 65 s when the concentration ratio of ch3oh and nh3 was 1 1 but the yield of n2o in the gas product was increased greatly and could be four times greater than that without ch3oh when the concentration of ch3oh was twice that of nh3 the concentration of no3 in the liquid product also increased significantly meanwhile trace amounts of no2 no and no2 were also detected which was due to the presence of co produced from ch3oh the catalytic reaction is suggested to reduce n2o while continuous stirred tank reactors with noble metal material a longer heating time and two step reactions are expected to inhibit the formation of no3 under scwo conditions zhang et al 2019a showed that nh3 started to decompose when the concentration of ch3oh was higher than 10 mmol l and 97 5 nh3 n removal efficiency could be obtained at 600 c 25 mpa and an oxidation coefficient of 1 5 with 800 mmol l of ch3oh meanwhile 9 mg l of no3 was also detected which was more easily produced at a higher reaction temperature and oxidation coefficient the authors indicated that the kinetics and thermal effect produced from ch3oh improves the degradation of nh3 synergistically under a relatively low reaction temperature on one hand the enhancement effect of ch3oh on the degradation of nh3 mainly occurs in the initial stage of the co oxidation reaction as shown in eqs 9 12 which could promote the production of ho2 and h2o2 the further decomposition of h2o2 could form active oh radicals to accelerate the initial hydrogen extraction step of nh3 on the other hand the heat released during the scwo of ch3oh could cause an increase in the reaction temperature to increase the reaction rate constant of the chain initiated reaction between nh3 and oh furthermore the authors also pointed out that the concentration of nh3 has a positive relationship with the degradation of ch3oh owing to the oxidation exotherm of the high concentration of nh3 n and extra oh radicals generated from the reaction between nh and no2 radicals as shown in eq 14 9 h c h 2 oh o 2 c h 2 oh ho 2 10 c h 2 oh ho 2 c h 2 o h 2 o 2 11 h c h 2 oh h o c h 2 oh h 2 o 2 12 h 2 o 2 2 o h 13 n h 3 oh nh 2 h 2 o 14 nh n o 2 n 2 o o h the kinetic analysis and reaction mechanism of the ch3oh and nh3 mixture were also studied by shimoda et al 2016 they showed that the removal efficiency of nh3 n could reach 19 and n2o was the major gas product at 530 c 25 mpa and 90 s when the initial concentration ratio of ch3oh and nh3 was 3 1 1 the removal effect of nh3 n increased with the initial ch3oh concentration when the ch3oh was oxidized completely the decomposition of nh3 n became slight in return the treatment of ch3oh and selectivity of gas products to co2 were also enhanced by the existence of nh3 n the authors indicated that the radicals produced from ch3oh and nh3 were shared and eventually promoted mutual oxidation moreover the reaction mechanism between ch3oh and nh3 proposed by shimoda et al 2016 is displayed in fig 6 which is mainly divided into two stages first when the concentration of ch3oh is high it means that the conditions for the oxidation of both ch3oh and nh3 exist in the system the oh produced from ch3oh and its corresponding intermediate products such as ch2oh and hoco first attack nh3 n and form nh2 radicals which react with ho2 to increase the generation of oh thereby leading to the higher concentration of oh in the nh3 ch3oh system compared with that in the single ch3oh system and enhancing the co degradation of nh3 n and ch3oh the generation of n2o is due to the presence of ch3oh which would promote the formation of nh radicals and the reaction between nh and no2 radicals would produce n2o when the ch3oh is completely oxidized into co2 the oxidation of nh3 is maintained by nitrogenous radicals such as nh2 and active ho2 and oh radicals as shown in fig 6 b to maintain the continuous supply of oh radicals during the scwo of nh3 n shimoda and oshima 2017 also conducted experiments by injecting ch3oh in two stages a higher nh3 n removal efficiency was obtained compared with that when injecting ch3oh once at the inlet of the reactor and the second injection time for ch3oh also influenced the decomposition of nh3 n the authors indicated that there is an optimal value for the secondary ch3oh injection time which could guarantee the optimal removal efficiency of nh3 n with the shortest total reaction time for example to acquire an nh3 n removal efficiency of 15 if injecting the secondary ch3oh in 10 s then the total residence time must be 20 s if the second injection time is reduced to 3 s then the total residence time would be 25 s and if the second injection time is increased to 20 s then 27 s would be required to achieve the target removal efficiency which provides a design basis for the optimization of the reactor structure as well as the regulation and control of the co oxidation system 4 2 2 ethanol ethanol has also been considered an auxiliary fuel to improve the treatment of nh3 n owing to its rapid degradation to produce ho2 and oh radicals in the scwo environment however helling and tester 1988 showed that the presence of ethanol or nh3 has no significant effect on their treatment owing to the limitation of the reaction temperature the highest operation temperature was 550 c and they suggested that the co oxidation of ethanol and nh3 should be studied at higher reaction temperatures above 600 c and a longer residence time killilea et al 1992 reported that nh3 n could be degraded completely at 690 c when adding ethanol in the reaction system while only 41 of nh3 n was removed without ethanol the primary gas product was n2 at a higher temperature approximately 621 693 c while more n2o was produced than n2 at a relatively low temperature approximately 525 608 c and small amounts of no2 and no3 were also detected in the liquid product the degradation rules product distribution and co oxidation model between nh3 and ethanol in the scwo environment were investigated by ploeger et al 2007 compared with the scwo of pure nh3 the co oxidation experiment results indicated that the conversion of nh3 n could be increased from 20 to 64 while the yield of n2o was also increased from 4 to approximately 40 at 700 c 24 1 mpa and 2 s when adding stoichiometric oxygen they also proposed that the formation of n2o mainly depends on the existence of ethanol and co oxidation primarily occurs in the first 2 s after the ethanol was degraded completely the nh3 n was treated and slowly transformed into n2 ploeger et al 2006a indicated the reaction pathways of ethanol during the co oxidation system with refractory substances as shown in eqs 15 21 ethanol will consume oh or ho2 first eq 15 eq 16 and then form the major substance of ho2 eq 17 which determines the amount of oh radicals to some extent on one hand the concentration of ho2 produced during the co oxidation system is three orders of magnitude greater than that of oh radicals on the other hand ho2 could react with ho2 or h2o to produce h2o2 which could decompose directly to form oh radicals as shown in eqs 18 20 furthermore the reaction of eq 21 is the chain termination reaction in the process of co oxidation and the relative reaction rate between eq 20 and eq 21 determines the amount of active free radicals and the enhancement of co oxidation 15 r h 2 o h r h h 2 o 16 r h 2 ho 2 r h h 2 o 2 17 r h o 2 r ho 2 18 ho 2 ho 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 19 ho 2 h 2 o h 2 o 2 o h 20 h 2 o 2 2 o h 21 h 2 o 2 o h h 2 o ho 2 meanwhile the authors updated the co oxidation model between nh3 and ethanol as shown in fig 7 ploeger et al 2008 specifically the main nitrogen containing gaseous products are n2 and n2o the oxidation of nh3 is caused by the gradual hydrogen abstraction reaction of nitrogen containing species such as nh3 and nh2 and the generated n2h3 from the mutual reaction between nhx could lose three hydrogen atoms through hydrogen abstraction or direct decomposition into n2 as shown in eqs 22 24 as for the production of n2o the authors established a model to accurately predict the yield of n2o with the change in the reaction temperature by improving the sub mechanism of nh2 nox under the low pressure condition as shown in eqs 25 28 which introduces the intermediate adduct species hxnnoy that could be collision stabilized under the high pressure system and undergo rearrangement decomposition hydrogen abstraction and other reactions at a relatively low temperature 655 c the net flux of h2nno2 which is the only source of n2o is higher than that of h2nono thereby resulting in a higher yield of n2o the n2o would decrease with the increase in the reaction temperature meanwhile the authors also found that the addition of ethanol has little influence on the formation of oh radicals at 700 c but the concentration of ho2 radicals will increase by three orders of magnitude and the concentration of ho2 radicals will decrease rapidly owing to the fast recombination reaction between ho2 to generate h2o2 and o2 however this mechanism model could not predict the conversion rate of nh3 with the change in temperature well because the generation of h2nnox and h2nono adducts strongly influences the conversion of nh3 and it must be improved further in the aspect of transient species such as ammonia oxide h3no hydrocarbons abstracted by nh2 and the adducts of nh2 and carbon radicals such as ch3 22 n h 3 o h nh 2 h 2 o 23 nh 2 n h 3 n 2 h 3 h 2 24 nh 2 n h n 2 h 2 25 n o nh 2 n 2 h 2 o 26 n o nh 2 nn h o h 27 no 2 nh 2 h 2 n o n o 28 no 2 nh 2 n 2 o h 2 o 4 2 3 isopropanol in addition to ch3oh and ethanol ipa has also been widely utilized in the co oxidation of nh3 cabeza et al 2014 proposed that when the concentration ratio of ipa nh4 increased from 0 to 0 125 the removal efficiency of tn could reach up to 35 at 450 c 25 mpa and 6 s with stoichiometric oxygen but the further increase in the amount of ipa had a negative effect on the degradation of tn that is a lower tn removal efficiency than that without ipa was obtained when the ratio was greater than 0 5 they suggested that this was because the low concentration of ipa could promote the conversion of nh3 to n2 while the high concentration of ipa enhanced other reaction pathways in addition the positive influences of treating nh3 n with ipa are shown in eqs 29 32 as an active auxiliary fuel ipa will react with o2 first to generate ho2 radicals and then the ho2 could react with ipa and its intermediate again to produce extra oh radicals which could attack nh3 n effectively and eventually enhance the degradation of nh3 n furthermore oh and ho2 radicals could also be produced from o2 and h2o as shown in eqs 33 36 additionally no3 was also detected in the liquid product which would increase with the addition of ipa the removal of ipa was proved to have no relationship with nh3 n however zhang et al 2019b thought that the inhibitory effect of high concentrations of ipa on the treatment of nh3 n due to the limitation of stoichiometric oxidation which will first react with active ipa and leave insufficient radicals for persistent nh3 n 29 h c 3 h 6 oh o 2 c 3 h 6 oh ho 2 30 c 3 h 6 oh ho 2 c 3 h 6 o h 2

concentrations of nh3 1 7 wt in the presence of ipa in a cold wall reactor and found that the concentration of nh3 influences the required temperature to completely degrade toc and nh3 n and obtain the lowest concentration of no3 and acetic acid in the liquid effluent for example when the concentration of nh3 increased from 1 wt to 7 wt the corresponding temperature needed to rise from 710 c to 780 c at 23 mpa 35 45 s and with excess oxidant thereby indicating that the ipa could accelerate the oxidation of nh3 n by itself or with its related radicals but nh3 inhibited the oxidation rate of ipa cocero et al 2000 conducted experiments on the co oxidation between ipa and nh3 n in a pilot scale plant to study the oxidation behavior under different operation parameters such as the oxidation coefficient reaction temperature and initial nh3 concentration and 98 4 of nh3 n could be removed at 645 c 25 mpa 40 s and with stoichiometric oxidants with 6 wt ipa but the distribution of nitrogen products was related to the oxidation coefficient and temperature the concentrations of no2 and no3 in the liquid product and nox in the gas products will increase with the increase in the number of oxidants and excess oxidants will cause higher no3 and nox thus 1 1 times of stoichiometric oxidant requirement is suggested furthermore when the temperature was greater than 670 c nox was also detected similar reaction rules were also obtained when treating aniline acetonitrile and pyridine with ipa complex nitrogenous organics such as dbu and dimethylformamide dmf were also chosen as reactants to react with h2o2 under the action of ipa and the results were compared with the co oxidation of pure nh3 al duri and alsoqyani 2017 al duri et al 2015 al duri et al 2016 the addition of ipa had a significant positive effect on the reaction rate constant the removal efficiency of nh3 n could reach 98 under the conditions of 450 c 25 mpa and 6 s with stoichiometric oxidants when the ratio of ipa nh3 n was 4 1 they also proposed that additional oh and ho2 radicals could be generated from ipa as shown in eqs 29 32 thereby promoting the transformation of nh3 n to n2 and n2o furthermore the reaction kinetics of dmf were also analyzed by the global rate expression and the activation energy was reduced by at least 50 when adding ipa to the reaction system however compared with dbu whose tn removal efficiency was less than 80 the enhancement of co oxidation with ipa on pure nh3 was more effective under the same conditions they assumed that this was because the nitrogen containing organics underwent more reaction pathways to convert organic nitrogen into nh3 n which also consumed ipa therefore injecting ipa in stages into more than one reactor port to maintain the concentration of active radicals is suggested a phenomenon was discovered where a supercritical hydrothermal combustion reaction occurs which means that the organics could be ignited and produce hydrothermal flames in the supercritical water when the concentration of organics is high enough and the reaction temperature reaches the autoignition temperature where auxiliary fuel is usually used to supply the required heat to ignite the organics for combustion augustine and tester 2009 wellig et al 2005 cabeza et al 2011 studied the hydrothermal combustion characteristics of ipa and nh3 in a tubular reactor and observed that the maximum toc degradation efficiency could reach up to 99 while 94 of tn could be removed at the moment of ignition under 700 750 c 25 mpa and 0 7 s the removal of tn changed slightly as the temperature surpassed 710 c and the primary gas products were n2 with a small amount of nh3 while no3 and no2 were detected in the liquid effluent and the concentration of no3 increased with the temperature and the amount of oxidant furthermore at least 2 wt ipa is required to achieve more than 90 removal of nh3 which is also the minimum concentration to ignite nh3 to obtain the complete degradation of nh3 and simultaneously eliminate the formation of no3 the design of the reactor is recommended to be optimized to match the operation parameters such as the temperature oxidant concentration and residence time based on this research they also conducted other studies to optimize the treatment of nh3 under the hydrothermal combustion conditions in a new vessel reactor instead of the tubular reactor which uses an empty reactor chamber to realize the stabilization of the hydrothermal flame and injects the feedstock at ambient temperature to avoid material corrosion and salt deposition the highest toc and nh3 n removal efficiencies were more than 99 99 and 99 90 respectively and the lowest nox and no3 concentrations below the limit of detection were acquired when the temperature was less than 650 c excess oxidant was below 2 5 and residence time was in the range of 20 30 s cabeza et al 2013 4 2 4 glycol similarly as a type of active alcohol the oxidation characteristics of glycol by scwo have also attracted the attention of some scholars bong gean et al 2003 showed that the decomposition of glycol was greatly accelerated above 400 c and could be completely degraded at approximately 425 c and a high concentration of glycol promoted its decomposition further in addition glycol has also been applied as an auxiliary fuel to enhance the treatment of organics owing to its activity ma 2014 indicated that adding 150 mg l of glycol could increase the cod removal efficiency of drilling fluid from 82 50 without glycol to 99 85 at 580 c 25 mpa and 10 min which was due to the enhancement of oh and ho2 produced from glycol as shown in eqs 37 40 the cod removal efficiency was directly proportional to the concentration of glycol added furthermore yu 2015 also found that the addition of trace glycol 25 mg l could improve the cod removal efficiency in phenolic wastewater from 90 0 to 97 8 at 400 c and 25 mpa compared with ch3oh ethanol and ipa glycol has a higher flash point which will ensure greater safety in engineering applications however the effect of the addition of glycol on the degradation of nh3 n has not been studied which is of great significance and should be explored in depth 37 hoc h 2 c h 2 oh 2 o h c h 2 c h 2 38 rh o h r h 2 o 39 r o 2 ro o 40 ro o rh rooh r 4 2 5 comparison of different alcohol auxiliaries as mentioned in 4 2 1 4 2 3 the degradation rules and interaction between various alcohols ch3oh ethanol and ipa and nh3 n obtained by different scholars exhibit some differences some researchers pointed out that compared with ch3oh hr 650 kj mol and ethanol hr 1279 kj mol ipa has a higher heat of reaction hr 1908 kj mol which releases more heat energy causing an increase the reaction temperature and leading to the production of more active radicals during the scwo process abelleira et al 2013 chen et al 2014 however most researchers demonstrated that the enhancement of nh3 n degradation is not only related to the exothermic reaction but also to the extra radicals generated from alcohols in the scwo environment qian et al 2019 compared the influences of ch3oh ethanol and ipa on the treatment of toc and nh3 n in sludge under the same reaction conditions 450 600 c 25 mpa 20 min and oxidation coefficient of 1 5 and the results showed that the addition of ch3oh ethanol and ipa to the system could all enhance the degradation efficiency of toc and nh3 n but ethanol showed a greater strengthening effect than ipa and ch3oh which was consistent with the reaction rate of pure alcohols in the scwo process the authors also suggested that ethanol could produce the highest concentration of ho2 in the shortest reaction time followed by ipa and ch3oh and the increase in the alcohol concentration could further shorten the production time of ho2 and oh radicals and increase their amounts they also found that the alcohols could inhibit the formation of persistent aromatic intermediate products such as pyridine and phenol and promote the generation of open chain compounds without nitrogen which are easily degraded however zhang et al 2019a found that the degradation efficiency of nh3 n was 15 3 97 5 with ch3oh but only 6 1 57 3 with ipa at 600 c 25 mpa and an oxidation coefficient of 1 5 they indicated that ch3oh has a more conspicuous effect than ipa on the improvement of nh3 n degradation although the characteristics of heat release for ch3oh and ipa are similar the authors thought that ch3oh could produce more active radicals than ipa in a shorter amount of time clearly to degrade nh3 n effectively with auxiliary fuel a higher reaction temperature above 600 c is still essential therefore further optimization studies about the types of auxiliaries injection mode of additives system parameters and reactor design among others which will also improve the distribution of nitrogen containing products should be researched in detail 4 3 oxidation enhancement with nitrates and nitrites as mentioned in 2 2 3 the intermediate products of nh3 and no3 or no2 produced from nitroaniline during the scwo process could interact to convert the nitrogen to n2 perez et al 2004 studied the scwo reaction between the mixed solution of 2 4 dinitrophenol and nh3 in a pilot scale plant and the results indicated that over 99 996 of 2 4 dinitrophenol could be removed at 469 526 c with excess oxidants while the removal efficiency of nh3 n remained in the range of 42 000 49 000 moreover when there was a higher concentration of 2 4 dinitrophenol in the reactants the degradation of nh3 n was effective but it would decrease with the reduction in the toc nh3 n ratio clearly this further proves the positive oxidation effect of the nitro group or no3 on the treatment of pure nh3 therefore some scholars have directly used no3 or no2 as oxidants to degrade refractory organics bourhis et al 1995 indicated that the addition of hno3 could enhance the oxidation rate of ipa by reducing the induction time used to initiate the scwo reaction by three times dellorco et al 1995 used an no3 and no2 mixture as an oxidant for the treatment of edta in the supercritical water hydrolysis system and found that the removal efficiency of toc increased with the addition of no3 and could be oxidized completely at 450 c 25 mpa and within 40 s when adding no2 and the major nitrogenous products were n2 n2o and nh3 they indicated that no2 has a better oxidation effect than no3 for treating edta and its intermediate products they also confirmed that the oxidation rate of no3 is higher than that of h2o2 when degrading acetic acid lee et al 2006 also explored the oxidation characteristics of 4 dichlorobenzene with nitrates or nitrites as oxidants a maximum of 99 95 of 4 dichlorobenzene was removed at 450 c 30 mpa and 30 min with stoichiometric oxidant and both no3 and no2 were reduced to n2 through the intermediates no and no2 in addition a small amount of h2 was also detected which was mainly generated from the water gas shift reaction compared with the nano3 scwo system the number of types and contents of intermediate organic by products were lower in the nano2 scwo system thereby indicating that the oxidation rate of no2 is higher than that of no3 which was the same as the results obtained by dellorco et al 1995 in addition complete degradation of 4 dichlorobenzene was achieved at 39 mpa thereby indicating that high pressure could accelerate the reaction rate by increasing the solubility of nano3 in the supercritical water it can be seen that both no3 and no2 have stronger oxidation than h2o2 and o2 in the treatment of persistent organics based on this some scholars have utilized various nitrates or nitrites as oxidants to degrade nh3 as shown in table 8 dellorco et al 1997 compared the oxidation characteristics of different nitrates nano3 lino3 and hno3 in the degradation of pure nh3 in a tubular reactor at 450 530 c and 30 mpa h2o2 in the same concentration as no3 was also added into the reaction system as a co oxidant this was because during the reaction process between no3 and nh3 no3 reduction to no2 also occurred as a parallel reaction and no was eventually formed through the corrosion of the reactor wall therefore h2o2 was applied to supply excess oh radicals to react with no2 and make the redox equilibrium change to the oxidation state the results also indicated that the production of no and no2 could be inhibited effectively but the formation of no2 could not be completely avoided and the degradation of nh3 n was enhanced slightly furthermore hno3 has the best degradation effect and nh3 n could be removed completely at 427 c and 25 mpa within a short reaction time of 10 3 s approximately 77 7 80 6 of nitrogen was transformed into n2 and 8 6 9 7 was transformed into n2o and the selectivity of n2 n2o was between 4 5 however the conversion of nh3 n was less than 10 when using nano3 or lino3 under the similar reaction conditions whose conversion efficiency of n2o was in the range of 1 3 and the corresponding selectivity of n2 n2o was 16 for nano3 and 21 for lino3 increasing the reaction temperature and prolonging the reaction time could enhance the treatment of nh3 n and the authors also proposed that the presence of na inhibited the reaction between nox nh3 as only 10 of nox was transformed at 447 c in 11 1 s when adding a certain amount of naoh into the hno3 nh3 system the reaction mechanism of mnox and nh3 under the scwo conditions was suggested by dellorco et al 1997 as shown in eqs 41 48 which takes the gas products into account the hydrolysis process of alkali no3 and production of nitric acid as shown in eqs 41 42 was considered the rate limiting reaction step however it would be replaced by the homolysis of nitric and nitrous acids eqs 43 44 when no substitution reaction occurred in the hno3 nh3 system regardless compared with the o2 h2o or h2o2 h2o systems the formation of oh radicals still consumed less energy at a lower reaction temperature and shorter induction time by hydrolysis homolysis reactions rather than by hydrogen abstraction thereby leading to the faster oxidation rate 41 mn o 2 hx hon o 2 mx 42 mono hx hono mx 43 hono o h no 44 hon o 2 o h n o 2 45 o h n h 3 nh 2 h 2 o 46 n o 2 m no m o 47 nh 2 no n 2 h 2 o 48 nh 2 n o 2 n 2 o h 2 o in addition yang et al 2018d also investigated the degradation of the no3 nh4 mixed solution under the action of different types of nitrates at a fixed pressure of 24 mpa temperature of 350 550 c and time of 0 5 6 0 min meanwhile h2o2 was also added to study the influence of the oxidant coefficient they found that an appropriate amount of h2o2 was significant in the treatment of tn by promoting the conversion from nh4 to n2 which was different from the results obtained by dellorco et al 1997 when the ratio of no3 nh4 was 1 1 the optimal removal efficiency of tn of more than 20 was acquired at 550 c 24 mpa and 1 5 min but low or too high concentrations of no3 all caused lower tn conversion furthermore the addition of transition metal ions would further enhance the removal of tn owing to its different catalytic activities and the order of the removal effect was cu no3 2 co no3 2 fe no3 3 zn no3 2 auxiliary fuels such as ch3oh ethanol and ipa were also introduced into the no3 nh4 system to produce a co reaction and ipa had the greatest effect owing to its high heat release which could realize 40 tn removal efficiency at 450 c and 6 min and accelerate the pyrolysis of no3 compared with those of ethanol and ch3oh moreover compared with that with the addition of metal ions the addition of ipa achieved the highest kinetic rate constant 4 4 oxidation with multi injection oxidants at present tubular reactors are commonly applied in the scwo system and the oxidants are injected once at the inlet of the reactor however when degrading organics with a high concentration abundant heat will be released and cause a local temperature increase in the reactor at the mixing point of organics and the oxidant during the scwo process if the temperature exceeds the design temperature for the reactor then the security and stability of the whole system will be threatened therefore multi injection of oxidants is suggested to control the reaction temperature along the reactor which also enhances the treatment effect of organics to a certain extent 4 4 1 control of temperature distribution in the reactor benjumea et al 2017 controlled the reactor temperature by injecting oxidants in stages the first injection point was at the inlet of the reactor while the second was one third of the way down the reactor inlet the performance and reaction behavior in the reactor were significantly influenced air was considered the oxidant because of the better function of diluting and cooling reactants than pure o2 the results also indicated that the air distribution ratio at the two injection points clearly affected the temperature distribution of the tubular reactor and the degradation effect of organics if a large amount of air is injected into the reactor inlet the mixture of oxidants and feedstock would be diluted and cooled which could lower the reaction temperature to even below the critical temperature thereby inhibiting the scwo reaction therefore they suggested that an insufficient amount of oxidant about 0 5 times the stoichiometric oxygen requirement should be injected into the reactor inlet first to ensure the oxidation of some of the organics and then approximately 1 2 times the stoichiometric oxygen requirement should be added into the second injection point to control the temperature distribution along the reactor and maintain the development of the reaction chkoundali et al 2008 conducted experiments on supercritical hydrothermal oxidation of olive oil wastewater with multi injection of oxidants and recorded the temperature distribution along the reactor their results fit the simulation results by prosim well moreover the cod removal efficiency of olive oil wastewater could be enhanced by increasing the injection temperature of the feedstock inlet portella et al 2007 injected oxidants into three different positions of the reactor 36 m to treat ch3oh by scwo namely the inlet of the reactor and 9 0 m and 17 5 m from the reactor inlet they found that 99 9 removal efficiency of cod could be obtained at 430 c and 25 mpa with the optimal oxidant injection ratio of 6 5 14 they also observed that the temperature of the reactor would rise sharply when injecting the oxidant which would be reduced to the initial temperature in less than 1 min at the injection point of the reactor when the oxygen injection stopped the maximum reaction temperature of 700 c could be obtained by injecting oxygen three times while it was impossible to achieve this temperature by injecting oxidant once at the reactor inlet owing to the limitations of the reactor material vielcazals et al 2006 established a mathematical model to predict the distribution of temperature and substances inside the reactor when injecting the oxidant into the reactor three times with the first point at the reactor inlet and the second and third points 11 6 m and 24 1 m from the inlet respectively the simulation fit the experimental results of ch3oh well they also confirmed that the oxidation of ch3oh was rapid at the oxidant injection points where the temperature also increased sharply and the increase in temperature decreased gradually when injecting the oxidant again later owing to the reduction in the local ch3oh concentration thereby controlling the temperature inside the reactor well 4 4 2 enhancement of the treatment effect of supercritical water oxidation garcia jarana et al 2013 degraded the nitrogen containing organics of dmf by multi injection of oxygen in the scwo environment the key operation parameters such as the second injection point oxidant distribution ratio reaction temperature oxidation coefficient and initial feedstock concentration were also studied to optimize the removal efficiencies of toc and nh3 n the authors proposed that maximum removal efficiencies of 91 8 and 96 2 for toc and dmf could be obtained respectively and the lowest concentration of nh3 n 42 ppm was also obtained in the reaction effluent at 400 c 25 mpa and 6 s with stoichiometric oxygen when the first injection point in the reactor inlet contained 75 of the oxidants and the second injection point was 6 m from the reactor inlet with 25 of the oxidants the removal efficiencies were higher than the 84 9 and 91 6 obtained when the total oxidants were injected once into the reactor inlet respectively they assumed that the improvement of the oxidation effect was due to the change in the reaction pathways for the intermediate products but the specific strengthening mechanisms of segmented oxidation are not clear al duri et al 2015 also proposed that multiple oxidant injection points are beneficial for enhancing the reaction process and promoting the nitrogen transformation into n2 or n2o by changing the reaction pathways of intermediate products when degrading dmf and the location of the second injection point and the distribution ratio of the oxidant depended on the type of organics and both influenced the oxidation behavior of toc and nitrogen in addition garcia jarana et al 2012 also treated the actual cutting fluids with multi injection of oxygen when the rector inlet had 67 of the oxidant and the second injection point was 3 m from the rector inlet with 33 of the oxidant the optimal cod removal efficiency of approximately 55 was achieved at 450 c which was 17 higher than that obtained when injecting the oxidant only at the reactor inlet dellorco et al 1999 studied the hydrothermal oxidation of wastes from the high explosive pbx 9404 and the reactor was optimized by setting multiple points for oxidant injection the first injection point was mainly aimed to treat nh3 n and obtain the minimum tn concentration in the liquid effluent while the second point was used to degrade toc completely with sufficient oxidants approximately 10 the authors proposed that the best second injection point was 45 m from the reactor inlet the total length of the reactor was 229 m and the tn concentration would be increased sharply if the location of the second point moved to the reactor inlet while it increased slightly when the second point moved to the end of the reactor furthermore the flow rate of the feedstock in the reactor inlet also influenced the optimum second injection point it can be seen that the amount and location of oxidant injection points and the ratio of the oxidant distribution all influence the optimal treatment effects for different organics or wastes but detailed research on the removal of nh3 n with multi injection of oxygen is still lacking which is of significance for enhancing the degradation of nitrogen containing compounds at a lower temperature by controlling the injection of oxidants 5 conclusion and future perspectives in this work the treatment effects reaction kinetics migration and transfer pathways of organic nitrogen for different typical nitrogen containing organics amino group nitro group mixed group and nitrogen heteroatom based on scwo technology are discussed scwo which is considered a promising technology for treating organic pollutants could realize the efficient degradation of cod or toc in nitrogen containing organics under typical scwo conditions 500 600 c 24 28 mpa the influences of the reaction temperature oxidant type and concentration residence time and initial concentration of organics on the degradation of organics are also presented the organics with a nitro group were mainly transformed from nitrogen into nox as nitrogen containing intermediate products while nh3 n was the major intermediate product during the oxidation of organics with an amino group or nitrogen heteroatom as for the organics with both amino and nitro groups the produced nox could react via the redox process with nh3 n to produce n2 however nh3 n is a refractory substance and further degradation of nh3 n is the rate limiting step during the scwo of nitrogen containing organics with an amino group and nitrogen heteroatom which requires more severe reaction conditions to achieve effective treatment compared with those required for cod or toc thus different methods were identified to enhance the removal of nh3 n and the corresponding strengthening reaction mechanisms and existing defects were also analyzed in this study including heterogeneous catalytic oxidation with reactor wall and metal oxides co oxidation with auxiliary fuel such as ch3oh ethanol ipa and glycol strong oxidation with no3 or no2 and segmented oxidation by multi injection of oxidants or fuels therefore some suggestions are provided and must be researched in depth in order to overcome the problems in different enhancement processes such as preparing the bimetallic composite catalyst with a high activity and hydrothermal stability in the scwo environment using appropriate methods screening excellent alcohol auxiliaries and optimizing the injection mode applying supercritical hydrothermal flames to enhance the reaction process coupling conventional h2o2 or o2 with no3 or no2 oxidizers and optimizing the system operation parameters and innovation of the mixer and reactor design in order to further improve the synergistic removal efficiency of cod or toc and nh3 n under relatively mild scwo reaction conditions avoid the formation of nox no3 and no2 and convert the organic nitrogen into environmentally friendly products such as n2 and n2o declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

total adsorbable organic halogens aox in water especially adsorbable organic iodine aoi putschew et al 2000 found that 25 of extractable aoi detected in surface water after bank filtration could be identified as icm kümmerer et al 1998 pointed out that the discharge of icm might explain the significant differences 90 between measured and computed aox concentrations in six german hospital

oxidation processes is among the most widely used technologies in water treatment and its performance on icm removal has also attracted plentiful scientific attention conventional oxidants and disinfectants including chlorine hocl and chloramine nh2cl have low reactivities towards icm with formation of i bps wendel et al 2014 tian et al 2017 duirk et al 2011 ye et al 2014 uv photolysis and

reactivities towards icm ning and graham 2008 anquandah et al 2011 velo gala et al 2014 dong et al 2018b comparatively icm can be efficiently removed by catalyzed aops mainly due to contributions of the highly reactive and less selective radicals i e ho so4 cl cl2 and ocl generated therein jeong et al 2010 wang et al 2019 hu et al 2019a wang et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 mao et al 2020 oxidative treatment of icm generates various oxidation intermediates and they can be finally transformed into i bps by further reactions with oxidants in addition pre oxidation of icm also have significant impact on i bps formation in following post disinfection process the objective of this work focuses mainly on the latest research findings relating to treatment of icm by conventional and advanced oxidation processes reactivities of different oxidation species towards icm are summarized following by discussions on formation of oxidation intermediates as well as specific small molecular i bps during oxidation processes finally impact of pre oxidation of icm by aops on formation of i bps during post disinfection process was discussed 2 occurrence of icm in aqueous environment it is reported that icm are the most frequently used intravascular pharmaceuticals an annual consumption of approximately 3500 tons of icm was reported worldwide daughton and ternes 1999 a total amount of 500 tons of all approved icm was used in germany per year steger hartmann et al 1999 high dosage of icm up to 100 g application is usually adopted in order to achieve adequate contrast putschew et al 2001 and they are always excreted non metabolized in urine within the first 24 h kümmerer et al 1998 consequently icm are detected in various water compartments including surface water wastewater treatment influents and effluents and even groundwater with concentration ranging from ng l to few µg l a summary of concentration of icm reported in the literature is shown in table 1 3 transformation of icm by conventional oxidants and disinfectants hocl and nh2cl 3 1 reactivities of hocl and nh2cl with icm hocl is the most widely used disinfectant in water treatment plant and it shows high reactivities towards a variety of organic compounds such as endocrine disruptor compounds edcs pharmaceuticals herbicides and antibacterials dodd and huang 2004 acero et al 2005 deborde and von gunten 2008 criquet et al 2015 however formation of undesirable bps with high toxicity during chlorination has caused significant public concerns gallard and von gunten 2002 krasner et al 2006 richardson et al 2008 allard et al 2015 therefore nh2cl is used as an alternative disinfectant to reduce bps formation though nh2cl is less reactive than hocl it also displays considerable reactivities towards some organic compounds such as nitrogenous organic compounds algal organic matters and phenolic compounds choi and valentine 2002 chamberlain and adams 2006 rodríguez et al 2007 gong et al 2017 the reactivities of hocl and nh2cl with icm have been studied by several groups ipm is the most reactive one towards hocl and nh2cl among all the icm investigated e g ipm dtz iop iom and iox wendel et al 2014 reported that the apparent second order rate constants k app for the reaction of hocl with ipm increased with increasing ph the species specific rate constants for hocl and ocl with ipm were around 0 9 and 0 02 m 1s 1 respectively similar observation was also obtained by tian et al 2017 but with much lower rate constants i e 0 4 m 1s 1 for hocl and 0 002 m 1s 1 for ocl the discrepancy might be a result of different ph ranges studied by these two groups i e ph range of 6 5 to 8 5 for wendel et al and 5 9 for tian et al tian et al 2017 also found that the reaction of nh2cl with ipm followed a third order kinetic law i e second order in ipm and first order in nh2cl with the maximum rate constant obtaining at ph 7 free chlorine i e hocl and ocl generated from hydrolysis of nh2cl instead of nh2cl itself was suggested to play the dominant role 3 2 transformation intermediates and pathways for hocl and nh2cl reactions with ipm the primary transformation products were identified for chlorination and chloramination of ipm table s1 mainly resulting from the following pathways i e i cleavage of the side chain ii hydrolysis and oxidation of the amide moiety iii exchange of i by cl or oh iv deiodination v addition of oh and cl on the benzene ring and vi oxidative coupling between the primary amine intermediates tian et al 2017 reported that similar intermediates were formed for chlorination and chloramination of ipm with a longer formation time for the latter one wendel et al 2014 found that the majority of iodide i released during chlorination of ipm was oxidized to hypoiodous acid hoi and finally to stable iodate io3 due to the high reactivities between hocl and iodine species bichsel and von gunten 1999 li et al 2020 moreover a good mass balance on total organic iodine toi and inorganic iodine i e i and io3 was obtained regardless of ph formation of high molecular iodinated intermediates accounts for 90 of the remaining toi 34 4 of the original toi after chlorination of ipm for 72 h at ph 8 5 3 3 formation of specific small molecular i bps further transformation of primary intermediates of icm by hocl and nh2cl can generate specific small molecular i bps moreover i released via deiodination of icm can be oxidized by hocl and nh2cl forming hoi reactions of hoi with icm or its intermediates or natural organic matter nom co present can also lead to the formation of i bps carbonous i bps e g iodinated trihalomethanes i thms iodoacetic acid iaas and iodoacetaldehyde ial are most frequently detected during chlor am ination of icm while nitrogenous i bps e g iodoacetonitriles ians are also reported during chlorination of ipm postigo et al 2018 table 2 for reported i bps and their abbreviations formation of i bps depends not only on the types of disinfectant i e hocl vs nh2cl or icm e g ipm iom iox dtz and iop but also on the solution conditions e g the presence of nom and bromide br 3 3 1 impact of the type of disinfectant different formation patterns of i bps from hocl and nh2cl reactions with icm are obtained due to their varied reactivities with icm and inorganic iodine species i e i and hoi duirk et al 2011 found that considerable amounts of i thms i e dclim brclim and if table 2 for abbreviations and miaa table 2 for abbreviation were generated from reactions of hocl and nh2cl with ipm in source water with the maximum concentrations obtaining at ph 8 5 for hocl but ph 6 5 for nh2cl moreover higher i thms concentrations were obtained in chlorination than chloramination process about 211 8 nm dclim and 3 0 nm miaa was formed during chlorination of ipm in source water at ph 8 5 while only around 11 0 nm dclim and 4 0 nm miaa was generated during chloramination of ipm in source water at ph 6 5 ye et al 2014 reported that formation of i thms during chlorination of ipm in the presence of nom was favored at low hocl dosage 25 100 µm but was significantly inhibited as hocl dosage further increased 100 250 µm these results were explained by the oxidation of i released from ipm to hoi and further to io3 by excess hocl which reduced the amounts of i thms derived from hoi involved reactions comparatively formation of i thms increased with increasing nh2cl dosage 25 200 µm under similar conditions probably due to the higher hoi exposures resulting from the inability of nh2cl to oxidize hoi bichsel and von gunten 1999 dichloramine nhcl2 and hocl generated from nh2cl auto decomposition and hydrolysis as well as hoi generated from i oxidation played significant roles in the formation of i thms during chloramination of ipm ye et al 2014 tian et al 2017 showed that iodine conversion of ipm to i bps during nh2cl disinfection 4 6 was 40 higher than that of hocl disinfection 3 2 despite the lower reactivity of nh2cl towards ipm 3 3 2 impact of the type of icm ipm is the most reactive one towards hocl and nh2cl among all the icm investigated yet i bps can also be formed from other icm with scenarios different from ipm ye et al 2014 demonstrated that the maximum yield of i thms obtained during chlorination and chloramination of icm in the presence of nom followed the order of ipm dtz iop for instance the maximum i thms formed during chlorination 25 250 µm of ipm dtz and iop 10 µm at ph 7 0 was about 276 1 63 8 and 47 1 nm respectively moreover ipm was prone to form i thms containing more than one iodine atom e g cldim brdim and if table 2 for abbreviations compared to iop and dtz during chlorination a maximum of 45 8 nm cldim was formed during chlorination of ipm in the presence of nom at ph 7 0 while merely small amounts 10 nm were generated in cases of iop and dtz under similar conditions pantelaki and voutsa 2018 showed that formation of i thms during chlorination of 3 different organic precursors i e humic acid ha river water and wastewater was favored in the presence of ipm than dtz xu et al 2017 found that the concentrations of iox in taihu lake and ipm in huangpu river china were positively related to the formation potentials of cldim and dbrim respectively 3 3 3 impact of nom the properties of nom often display important impact on the species and concentrations of bps formed during chlor am ination of icm wang et al 2014 showed that formation of i thms during chloramination of ipm was favored in the presence of algae organic matter aom than ha and fulvic acid fa around 36 4 µg l i thms was formed from chloramination of ipm in the presence of aom with if accounting for 68 to total i thms while only 0 9 µg l i thms was generated from chloramination of ipm in the presence of ha or fa with dclim dominant this discrepancy was ascribed to the lower hydrophilic fraction of aom than ha and fa since a negative correlation between i thms formed per unit of doc i thms doc and suva was observed during chloramination of ipm containing raw waters pantelaki and voutsa 2018 reported that formation of i thms presented a rapid formation pattern upon chlorination of river water and ha in the presence of ipm while wastewater derived nom showed a rapid i thms formation rate in the first stage followed by a much lower rate under similar conditions ackerson et al 2018 found that similar loss of toi was obtained during chlorination of 3 different source waters in the presence of ipm while higher total organic chlorine tocl was formed from source water with higher suva 3 3 4 impacts of br br can be rapidly oxidized by hocl and nh2cl forming reactive bromine species e g hobr nhclbr and nh2br trofe et al 1980 bousher et al 1989 hua et al 2006 yoom et al 2018 further reactions of these bromine species with organic compounds co present may form brominated bps zhang et al 2008 ding et al 2013 zhai et al 2014 several studies have shown that br not only affects the concentration but also the speciation of i bps formed during chlorination and chloramination of icm pantelaki and voutsa 2018 reported that the presence of br obviously enhanced i thms yields during chlorination of ha river water and wastewater in the presence of dtz with bromine containing i thms such as brclim and dbrim table 2 for abbreviations being dominant wang et al 2014 showed that formation of i thms during chloramination of aom ha and fa in the presence of ipm increased by 3 13 and 15 fold respectively after addition of 5 µm br about 0 2 µm brclim was predominantly formed in the case of aom accounting for 46 6 of total i thms while if 0 04 µm was the major product in the absence of br under similar conditions ye et al 2014 pointed out that the presence of br elevated the yield of i thms and increased the formation of bromine containing i bps such as brclim and dbrim during chlorination and chloramination of dtz especially during chloramination process the concentrations of i thms during chlorination of dtz in the presence of nom increased from 57 6 µg l without br to 69 3 µg l at 15 µm br 3 4 toxicity of chlor am inated icm solution in general the presence of icm tends to elevate the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of aqueous solutions by chlor am ination treatment though icm per se has no or slightly enhancing effect on solution toxicity under similar condition allard et al 2016 duirk et al 2011 jeong et al 2017 postigo et al 2018 matsushita et al 2015 wendel et al 2014 2016 the enhancing extent of icm to solution toxicity for chlorination sometimes differs from chloramination process relating to the composition of water sources jeong et al 2017 found that ipm generated an elevated level of mammalian cell cytotoxicity and genotoxicity after both hocl and nh2cl disinfection of akron oh source water with stronger enhancing extent for nh2cl disinfection comparatively duirk et al 2011 et al reported that the presence of ipm increased the cytotoxicity over chlorinated athens ga source water by 49 while slight differences in cytotoxicity was observed for chloraminated source water with or without ipm in addition duirk et al 2011 also found that ipm elevated the genotoxicity of both chlorinated and chloraminated athens ga source water by 1 7 and 1 3 folds respectively matsushita et al 2015 suggested that the increased mutagenicity of chlorinated solution in the presence of ipm was likely induced by three high molecular weight transformation products generated from ipm reaction with hocl in contrast wendel et al 2016 confirmed that four of the five isolated high molecular weight ipm chlorination products exhibited low levels of cytotoxicity while none of them were genotoxic these different experimental data suggest that different transformation products of icm reaction with hocl or nh2cl may have varied effects on solution toxicity 4 transformation of icm by uv photolysis and advanced oxidation processes 4 1 uv photolysis 4 1 1 reactivity and efficiency uv photolysis has been widely adopted since it is efficient in inactivating waterborne pathogens without generation of regulated bps boreen et al 2003 hijnen et al 2006 it is reported that icm can be gradually transformed under solar or uv radiation due to their capacity to absorb photons doll and frimmel 2003 pérez et al 2009 tian et al 2014 allard et al 2016 fabbri et al 2016 hu et al 2019b canonica et al 2008 the degradation of icm by uv photolysis generally follows a pseudo first order rate law with their transformation efficiency independent of solution ph tian et al 2014 hu et al 2019b generally the degradation efficiency of a target compound by direct photolysis is governed by two factors i e the molar absorption coefficient and the quantum yield of this compound these two parameters for icm are compiled in table 3 as can be seen dtz has a higher quantum yield but a lower molar absorption coefficient compared to the rest of icm the combination of these two factors explains the observed comparable transformation rates of ipm and dtz under uv radiation as studied by kong et al 2018 where the pseudo first order rate constants for ipm and dtz were about 0 0336 and 0 0333 min 1 respectively under 0 13 mwcm 2 uv radiation 4 1 2 oxidation intermediates the phototransformation intermediates of iop by simulated solar radiation has been systematically studied by pérez et al 2009 where 8 prominent products including deiodinated hydroxylated and ketone products were identified table s3 tian et al 2014 reported that totally 15 photodegradation intermediates were formed during uv irradiation of ipm table s1 fabbri et al 2016 showed that a total of 24 10 and 10 transformation products were identified respectively during ipm table s1 iop table s3 and dtz table s5 transformation by tio2 catalyzed photolysis despite a lack of mineralization for all these three icm generally similar reaction pathways are followed for phototransformation of different icm namely i part or complete deiodination ii substitution of i by oh group iii h abstraction from side chain or oxidation of a methylene group in the hydroxylated side chain generating ketone products and iv n dealkylation of the amide in the hydroxylated side chain 4 2 o3 4 2 1 reactivity and efficiency o3 has been widely applied and studied due to its ability to oxidize various organic compounds and to deactivate microorganisms in drinking water and wastewater acero et al 2000 von gunten 2003a b deborde et al 2005 dodd et al 2006 2009 liu et al 2015 the reaction of o3 with icm has been extensively studied where o3 generally shows much lower reactivities towards icm compared to its reactivities with other organic compounds such as phenols and amines for instance huber et al 2005 found that nearly 90 99 of macrolide sulfonamide antibiotics and estrogens in wastewater effluents could be degraded at o3 dosage of 3 mg l while 60 icm i e ipm iop iom and dtz was oxidized even at o3 dosage of 5 mg l ning and graham 2008 investigated the rate constants of o3 reactions with four icm including dtz iop ipm and iom at ph 7 5 with k app ranging from 1 0 to 20 0 m 1s 1 table 4 ipm is the most reactive one towards o3 followed by iom and iop while dtz shows the slowest reactivity towards o3 similar result was also reported by ternes et al 2003 where non ionic icm including ipm iop and iom could be degraded to degrees of 80 with o3 dosage of 15 mg l while ionic icm i e dtz could only be degraded to 14 under similar conditions 4 2 2 oxidation intermediates seitz et al 2008 confirmed aldehyde and carbonyl compounds as the major stable products generated from ozonation of iom table s2 putschew et al 2007 found that iop was quickly degraded by 30 mg l o3 along with a slower abatement of toi io3 was detected therein with its concentration increasing with reaction time suggesting a deiodination pathway for o3 reaction with iop ning and graham 2008 found that i was almost completely released after depletion of dtz by ozone within 10 min while only 40 i in molar terms was released from iom and iop under similar conditions these results indicate that formation of iodine containing oxidation intermediates may be favored during ozonation of non ionic icm e g iop and iom while the cleavage of c i bond is preferred during ozonation of ionic icm such as dtz yet there is limited information on the exact structures of oxidation intermediates formed during ozonation of icm 4 3 fe vi 4 3 1 reactivity and efficiency fe vi is regarded as one of the green oxidants in drinking water and wastewater treatment sharma 2010 2013 lee et al 2014 han et al 2015 ye et al 2017 fe vi shows appreciable reactivities towards various organic compounds such as amines anilines and phenols with little formation of halogenated bps lee et al 2005 sharma et al 2016 sun et al 2018 2019a yang et al 2019 however recent studies show that fe vi is capable of oxidizing i forming hoi which can further react with nom leading to formation of i bps shin et al 2018 wang et al 2018 2019a given that icm contain three iodine atoms in their molecules their transformation during fe vi oxidation has been examined by several studies anquandah et al 2011 reported that the reaction of fe vi with dtz was first order in both fe vi and dtz with higher reaction rates at lower ph the reaction between monoprotonated fe vi i e hfeo4 and dtz contributed to the overall reactivity with species specific rate constant about 9 3 m 1s 1 table 4 the half life of dtz was estimated around 41 8 and 8 3 min with fe vi dosage of 10 and 50 mg l respectively velo gala et al 2014 reported that fe vi displayed high reactivity towards dtz under acidic condition with k app about 104 0 m 1s 1 at ph 5 dong et al 2018b found that fe vi exhibited considerable reactivity towards ipm with species specific rate constant for hfeo4 with ipm about 86 5 m 1s 1 table 4 nearly 10 times higher than that of dtz reported by anquandah et al al 2011 similar to the cases of hocl nh2cl and o3 fe vi is more reactive towards ipm than dtz 4 3 2 oxidation intermediates limited information is available on oxidation intermediates of fe vi reaction with icm at present dong et al 2018b identified 10 high molecular oxidation products from fe vi reaction with ipm table s1 and their formation mainly involved three pathways i e i deiodination ii amide hydrolysis and iii amine oxidation similar to the pathways reported during hocl or nh2cl disinfection processes 4 4 ho and so4 based aops 4 4 1 reactivity and efficiency ho and so4 possess high redox potential 2 5 3 1 v for so4 and 1 8 2 7 v for oh and they are widely studied for removal of recalcitrant organic contaminants guan et al 2011 wols et al 2013 yao et al 2013 yang et al 2014 2015 2017 zhang et al 2015 icm can be effectively degraded by these two radicals in various aops including uv activated peroxides processes e g uv hydrogen peroxide h2o2 uv peroxymonosulfate pms uv persulfate pds and uv h2o2 pds chan et al 2010 chu et al 2011 duan et al 2017 giannakis et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 hu et al 2019a b c zhao et al 2019b metal catalyzed peroxides processes e g co2 pms cuo pms and δ mno2 pms arslan alaton et al 2017 dong et al 2017 hu et al 2017 wang et al 2019b zhao et al 2019a and o3 pms process mao et al 2020 k app for icm reactions with ho and so4 are summarized in table 3 dtz is more reluctant to be oxidized by ho and so4 compared to the other four icm similar to its much lower reactivity towards o3 and fe vi table 4 moreover so4 seems more reactive towards icm than ho in line with the higher removal efficiency of icm oxidation by so4 dominated aops e g uv pds and zero valent aluminum zva activated pds than oh dominated aops e g uv h2o2 and zva activated h2o2 under similar conditions arslan alaton et al 2017 hu et al 2019a 4 4 2 oxidation intermediates similar intermediates are shared during icm oxidation by ho and so4 based aops table s1 s5 for instance zhao et al 2019b reported that 19 transformation products were identified during ipm oxidation by uv pds among which 11 products were also observed in uv h2o2 system table s1 several reaction pathways are reported for ho and so4 reactions with icm including four aforementioned in uv photolysis process additionally the following reaction pathways are also reported i e i amide hydrolysis and or subsequent amino oxidation ii oxidation of hydroxyl group yielding carboxylic products iii oxidation of aliphatic alcohol into aldehyde products and iv cleavage of co bond deiodination and hydroxylation are two dominant degradation pathways for icm oxidation by ho while so4 seems more efficient in reacting with amide group zhao et al 2019b 4 5 rcs involved aops 4 5 1 reactivity and efficiency uv hocl process has attracted increasing attention recently for water treatment shah et al 2011 deng et al 2014 shu et al 2014 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2016 it is considered as a superior alternative to uv h2o2 process since i the oxidant required i e hocl for uv hocl process is usually present in treated water for primary or secondary disinfection purposes and ii it has a higher radical yield than h2o2 due to its higher combined molar absorption coefficient and quantum yield kim et al 2002 sichel et al 2011 kong et al 2016 uv hocl is efficient in degrading various contaminants such as nitrobenzene ronidazole diclofenac and nitroimidazoles under various conditions qin et al 2014 guo et al 2016 yang et al 2016a both ho and cl are generated from uv photolysis of hocl under wavelength 400 nm eqs s1 s2 table s6 which can induce a series of reactions forming secondary rcs such as cl2 and ocl eqs s3 s9 table s6 fang et al 2014 xiang et al 2016 kong et al 2018 lei et al 2019 in addition o3 is also generated during photolysis of chlorine by solar or artificial uv light at varied wavelengths e g 254 311 and 365 nm with its formation increasing with increasing ph as it is generated by photolysis of ocl rather than hocl eqs s10 s11 bulman et al 2019 kishimoto 2019 though o3 is often formed at lower concentrations than these typically used in drinking water treatment 1 mg l it can play an important role in oxidation of some organic compounds e g carbamazepine and mecoprop kong et al 2020 yang et al 2016b hua et al 2019 as well as deactivation of spores or oocysts zhou et al 2014 forsyth et al 2013 under certain condition similar to uv hocl uv nh2cl process has also received increasing interest in the last few years for treatment of organic contaminants oh and rcs including cl cl2 and nhcl are generated therein eqs s12 s15 chuang et al 2017 li et al 2018 sun et al 2019b wu et al 2019a patton et al 2017 transformation efficiency of icm by rcs involved aops has been frequently studied however the rate constants for icm reaction with rcs remain unclear at present secondary rcs mainly cl2 and clo and ho are usually identified as the major reactive oxidants in uv hocl or uv nh2cl processes wang et al 2016 found that though iox could be efficiently degraded by uv photolysis the presence of hocl obviously accelerated this process the oxidation rate of iox by uv photolysis was 0 0095 s 1 with uv intensity of 3 02 mwcm 2 at ph 7 while it increased to 0 013 s 1 after addition of 100 µm hocl ho generated from photolysis of hocl was indicated as the major contributor kong et al 2018 reported that both ipm and dtz could be efficiently degraded by uv hocl with efficiency higher than by uv h2o2 secondary rcs such as cl2 and clo rather than primary radicals i e ho and cl were verified to be the dominant oxidants contributing to the degradation of dtz and ipm similar result was also reported by hu et al 2019b where the relative contributions of uv photolysis ho and rcs mainly clo to dtz degradation were around 12 8 1 2 and 85 9 respectively zhao et al 2019b comparatively investigated the degradation efficiency of ipm by uv h2o2 uv pds and uv hocl and found that uv hocl was the most efficient one in degrading ipm followed by uv pds and uv h2o2 wu et al 2019b showed that both uv hocl and uv nh2cl could effectively degrade dtz in synthetic water with rcs and ho being the dominant contributors but the oxidation efficiency decreased in natural waters river water tap water and rainwater especially for uv nh2cl 4 5 2 oxidation intermediates oxidation intermediates of dtz table s5 ipm table s1 and iox table s4 treated by uv hocl have been well documented they are mainly generated from reactions between icm and cl2 clo and ho via the following pathways i h abstraction at the coh site of icm forming ketone products ii substantial deiodination iii oh addition at c i site of icm intermediates or oh substitution at one side chain forming hydroxylated product iv cl addition at the c i site forming chlorinated products and v oxidation of amino group forming nitro products kong et al 2018 reported similar reaction pathways for dtz table s5 and ipm table s1 degradation by uv hocl with generation of several chlorinated products zhao et al 2019b identified 16 transformation products during ipm oxidation by uv hocl including 4 chlorinated products and 2 nitro products table s1 moreover the authors found that 9 transformation products including nitro products were detected from ipm oxidation by both uv hocl and uv pds suggesting a similar oxidation pattern for rcs and so4 5 impacts of components of water matrix on the transformation efficiency of icm by catalyzed aops 5 1 cl br generally cl shows either negligible or inhibitive impact on the degradation efficiency of icm by different aops zhao et al 2019b found that cl 0 10 mm showed a slight influence on ipm degradation by uv h2o2 and uv hocl at ph 7 under a uv intensity of 130 µwcm 2 zhou et al 2017 found that cl at concentration 100 mm did not affect dtz degradation by sunlight activated pds while it suppressed dtz degradation as its concentration increased to 500 mm similar inhibitive effects of cl 0 25 mm on the degradation of iox by uv hu et al 2019a or heat activated pds hu et al 2019c as well as ipm by cuo or δ mno2 activated pms hu et al 2017 under neutral conditions were also reported the negative impact of cl with high concentration on transformation of icm by different aops is often attributed to its competitive consumption of reactive species i e ho so4 and rcs with formation of less reactive secondary radicals e g cl cl2 and cloh zhou et al 2017 hu et al 2019a c in addition to cl impact of br on transformation of icm during aops are also recorded in the literature hu et al 2019b found that the presence of br 5 50 µm showed slight impact on dtz degradation by uv photolysis alone while it remarkably decreased dtz degradation during uv photolysis in the presence of 100 µm hocl under similar conditions dtz degradation rate decreased from 3 01 10 2 to 8 82 10 3 s 1 as br concentration increased from 5 to 50 µm in uv hocl process the negative effect of br on the degradation of iox by uv hocl was also observed by wang et al 2016 these results were explained by the competitive consumption of hocl and ho by br vs icm forming less reactive secondary radicals such as br and o eqs s16 s19 table s6 lyon et al 2012 wu et al 2017 5 2 hco3 in general hco3 at low concentrations shows slight impact on icm degradation by catalyzed aops while it negatively affects icm transformation at high concentration zhao et al 2019b found that hco3 at concentration 1 mm negligibly affected ipm transformation during uv photolysis of h2o2 pds and hocl while the presence of 5 mm hco3 significantly inhibited ipm degradation by uv pds hu et al 2019a reported that the presence of 2 mm hco3 decreased iox degradation efficiency by uv pds while the inhibition effect was negligible at hco3 concentration 1 mm similar observations were also obtained during iox degradation by heat activated pds hu et al 2019c hu et al 2017 reported that hco3 at concentration 2 mm hardly affected ipm degradation by cuo or δ mno2 activated pms while it suppressed ipm degradation as its concentration further increased the competitive consumption of ho and or so4 by high concentrations of hco3 vs icm leads to formation of less reactive carbonate radicals eqs s20 s21 table s6 buxton et al 1988 yang et al 2014 therefore decreased the transformation efficiency of icm therein 5 3 nom nom is ubiquitously present in various water compartments and it shows significant impact on efficiency of catalyzed aops the presence of nom generally inhibits the degradation of icm by different aops zhao et al 2019b reported that the presence of 1 5 mgc l nom obviously inhibited ipm degradation during uv photolysis of h2o2 pds and hocl especially for uv pds the degradation rate of ipm decreased from 2 0 10 3 to 2 0 10 4s 1 as nom concentration increased from 0 to 5 mgc l in uv pds process similar inhibitive impact of nom on the degradation of ipm by zero valent aluminum activated h2o2 and pds or cuo δ mno2 activated pms was also reported hu et al 2017 zhao et al 2019a showed that the inhibitory effect of nom on degradation of iox by co ii activated pms increased with increasing nom concentration about 82 iox was degraded in 30 min without nom while only 18 iox was removed under similar condition in the presence of 8 mgc l humic acid ha hu et al 2019c reported that the degradation rate of iox by heat activated pds decreased 50 as ha concentrations increased from 0 to 5 mgc l nom can competitively consume reactive species such as ho so4 and rcs with target compounds thus decreasing their removal efficiency westerhoff et al 1999 lutze et al 2015 specifically nom can also act as inner filter during uv photolysis fang et al 2014 luo et al 2015 lutze et al 2015 or complex with metal catalyst during heterogeneous catalysis guan et al 2017 hu et al 2017 which affects the generation of reactive species overall icm could be effectively removed by aops especially catalyzed aops compared to conventional hocl and nh2cl oxidation disinfection processes table s7 summarized the advantages and disadvantages of aops reported for icm removal each technology has its unique advantages but also disadvantages and selection of the suitable technology for icm removal heavily depends on both efficiency of aops and water constituents 6 impacts of peroxidation of icm by aops on formation of i bps in post disinfection process 6 1 formation of i bps during aops and the following disinfection processes 6 1 1 aops specific small molecular i bps such as i thms and iaas can be directly generated from icm treated by aops for instance xu et al 2017 showed that i thms were formed from o3 reaction with icm dong et al 2018b reported that if miaa and triiodoacetic acid tiaa were generated from fe vi oxidation of ipm in the presence of nom with if dominant about 0 2 µm if was formed in the presence of 0 5 mgc l nom after 72 h with the complete transformation of ipm 50 µm by fe vi 500 µm at ph 9 while only 0 01 and 0 02 µm miaa and tiaa was generated formation of i bps during fe vi oxidation of ipm in the presence of nom also showed strong ph dependence with highest concentration obtaining at ph 9 0 likely due to higher hoi exposures resulting from the lower reaction rates of fe vi with hoi at higher ph wang et al 2018 shin et al 2018 similar i bps were also detected during fe vi 500 µm oxidation of three other icm 50 µm i e dtz iop and iox in the presence of 0 5 mgc l nom at ph 9 0 with total concentrations 10 µg l lower than those formed in the case of ipm 75 6 µg l zhao et al 2019a found that if and tiaa were generated during iox oxidation by co ii activated pms with their concentrations increasing with increasing co ii dosage about 0 1 µm if and 3 1 µm tiaa was formed from iox 50 µm oxidation by pms 1 mm in the presence of 1 µm co ii hu et al 2019b reported that the concentrations of if formed from iox oxidation by uv pds at ph 7 0 increased with increasing initial pds dosage 0 500 µm wu et al 2019b reported the formation of if from dtz treated by uv hocl and uv nh2cl with higher concentrations in the former process increasing hocl dosage 25 75 µm increased if formation during uv hocl process while if concentrations were relatively stable with increasing nh2cl dosage 25 75 µm in uv nh2cl process 6 1 2 post disinfection process in addition to focusing on direct formation of i bps during aops some researchers pay more attention to formation of i bps during subsequent disinfection processes wang et al 2016 found the i thms i e if cldim and dclim table 2 for abbreviations were generated after post chlorination of uv hocl treated iox solutions at ph 7 with higher concentrations at lower hocl dosage the concentrations of if cldim and dclim decreased from 45 7 60 9 and 320 2 nm to 9 1 18 8 and 49 8 nm respectively as hocl dosage increased from 12 5 to 200 0 µm this result was explained by lower hoi exposures at higher hocl dosage due to the oxidation of hoi to io3 by hocl moreover they showed that formation of i thms during post chlorination showed strong ph dependence with higher concentrations obtaining under circum neutral conditions formation of i thms during post chlorination firstly increased with increasing br concentration 0 50 µm in uv hocl process and then remained stable as br concentration further increased 50 200 µm while the iodine substitution factor kept increasing with elevating br concentration 0 200 µm hu et al 2019a reported that formation of i thms during post chlorination of uv pds treated iox solutions increased with increasing pds 0 500 dosage with dclim dominant they further showed that i thms was also generated from chlorination of uv hocl or uv treated dtz effluent with concentration much lower in the former process likely due to the oxidation of i by hocl therein hu et al 2019b wu et al 2019b showed that if concentration increased by three order of magnitude and exceeded 0 02 um 10 µg l after storing uv nh2cl treated dtz solutions for 24 h while decreased if concentrations were obtained after storing uv hocl treated dtz solutions at higher hocl dosages 6 2 impacts of pre oxidation of icm by aops on formation of specific small molecular i bps during post disinfection process mao et al 2020 showed that pre oxidation of ipm by o3 increased the formation of i thms in the following chlorination process compared with chlorination alone the formation of total i thms during chlorination of o3 pre treated ipm solutions increased by 2 8 fold for both synthetic and raw waters substantial studies show that pre oxidation of icm by catalyzed aops has significant impacts on formation of i bps in the post disinfection process tian et al 2014 reported that increasing uv irradiation fluence of ipm significantly increased the formation of i bps e g if dcim cldim and tiaa table 2 for abbreviations during subsequent disinfection processes by hocl nh2cl and chlorine dioxide clo2 despite the decreased formation of classical bps e g chloroform cf dichloroacetonitrile dcan trichloroacetic acid tcaa and dichloroacetic acid dcaa for instance the total concentration of classical bps decreased from 4 5 µm without photolysis to 1 2 µm with uv fluence of 1788 mjcm 2 during post chlorination processes about 0 5 µm i bps was generated in control experiments of chloramination of ipm while it increased to 1 7 µm when uv fluence of 1788 mj cm 2 was applied before chloramination under similar conditions hu et al 2019c found that cldim and dclim were generated from chlorination of iox solution pre treated by heat activated pds with lower concentrations at higher pds dosage 0 50 µm while they were not detected from chlorination of iox under similar conditions zhao et al 2019b found that pre oxidation of ipm by uv uv pds and uv hocl slightly suppressed the formation of if during post chlorination while pre oxidation by uv h2o2 obviously increased the formation of if under similar conditions conversely formation of miaa was promoted when ipm was pre oxidized by uv uv pds and uv hocl while negligible miaa was formed in the case of uv h2o2 this discrepancy probably resulted from the higher if formation potentials of intermediates generated during uv h2o2 pre oxidation mainly hydroxylated and deiodinated intermediates section 4 4 mao et al 2020 found that peroxidation of ipm by o3 pms obviously decreased the formation of total i thms in the post chlorination process with lower concentration at lower o3 to pms molar ratios the formation of total i thms during post chlorination decreased by 90 with pre oxidation of ipm by o3 pms at o3 to pms molar ratio of 0 4 7 conclusion and future prospects i bps have gained more and more scientific and technological attention due to their high toxicity compared to chlorinated and brominated analogues icm as an important iodine source in aquatic environment play a non negligible role in formation of i bps during water treatment especially considering their large consumption amounts worldwide conventional oxidation processes are not ideal options for treatment of icm containing waters due to the low reactivities aops especially catalyzed aops show high potentials in elimination of icm however several issues needed to be addressed before putting into practice i e i the quality of the water bodies catalyzed aops are sensitive to water matrix components such as cl br hco3 and nom which will significantly affect the efficiency of the oxidation processes ii the

the frequent detection of emerging environmental contaminants as pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps in aqueous environments has gained continuous research interest mainly due to i the potential hazardous impact of ppcps themselves on aquatic ecosystems and ii the possible adverse effect of their metabolites and transformation products during biotic and or abiotic processes daughton and ternes 1999 snyder et al 2004 nikolaou et al 2007 weng et al 2014 qin et al 2015 numerous ppcps e g antibiotics anti inflamatorics fragrances uv screens and etc have been detected in water compartments such as surface water ground water drinking water and wastewater liao and kannan 2014 cizmas et al 2015 jones et al 2015 ebele et al 2017 among these ppcps iodinated x ray contrast media icm as a group of pharmaceuticals that are widely used for intravascular administration e g enhancing imaging of soft tissues such as organs lacunae and blood vessels have always been a focus of environmental concerns most of icm share a similar structure which can be regarded as derivatives of 2 4 6 triiodobenzoic acid with hydroxyl and carboxylic moieties evenly distributed in their side chains fig 1 generally they can be divided into two groups ternes and hirsch 2000 i e i ionic icm such as diatrizoate dtz possessing a free carboxylic moiety and ii non ionic icm including iopromide iop iomeprol iom iopamidol ipm and iohexol iox where the carboxylic moieties are amide derivatives icm are designed to be inert with high hydrophilicity to alleviate their adverse impact on human health consequently they are discharged integrally into various aquatic environments e g surface water sediments and biota ternes and hirsch 2000 putschew et al 2000 seitz et al 2006 kormos et al 2011 zemann et al 2014 due to the strong biochemical stability and recalcitrance to conventional water treatment echeverria et al 2013 moreover icm are regarded as the major contributor to the burden of total adsorbable organic halogens aox in water especially adsorbable organic iodine aoi putschew et al 2000 found that 25 of extractable aoi detected in surface water after bank filtration could be identified as icm kümmerer et al 1998 pointed out that the discharge of icm might explain the significant differences 90 between measured and computed aox concentrations in six german hospital effluents aox or halogenated byproducts bps have raised great public concerns due to their high cytotoxicity and genotoxicity richardson et al 2007 michael et al 2008 kristiana et al 2009 xiao et al 2012 yang and zhang 2013 szczuka et al 2017 specially iodinated bps i bps are several to hundreds of times more toxic than their chlorinated and brominated analogues plewa et al 2004 richardson et al 2008 pan et al 2016 liberatore et al 2017 liu et al 2017 various physical and or biological methods have been explored for treatment of icm so far activated carbon or soil and bank filtration displays certain removal capacity for icm but is sometimes limited by the low sorption affinity of icm oppel et al 2004 schittko et al 2004 schulz et al 2008 ahn et al 2015 biodegradation under anaerobic and or aerobic conditions provides an alternative strategy for treatment of icm in wastewater sludge and sediments haiß and kümmerer 2006 kormos et al 2010 gros et al 2014 redeker et al 2014 casas et al 2015 feng et al 2018 pérez and barceló 2007 moreover reductive dehalogenation of icm by zerovalent iron or fe iii oxalate e aq bio and or chemical electronic processes also shows potentials for icm remediation putschew et al 2007 mu et al 2011 radjenovic et al 2013 lütke eversloh et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 dong et al 2018a jeong et al 2010 chemical oxidation including conventional and advanced oxidation processes is among the most widely used technologies in water treatment and its performance on icm removal has also attracted plentiful scientific attention conventional oxidants and disinfectants including chlorine hocl and chloramine nh2cl have low reactivities towards icm with formation of i bps wendel et al 2014 tian et al 2017 duirk et al 2011 ye et al 2014 uv photolysis and advanced oxidation process aop e g ozone o3 ferrate fe vi hydroxyl radical ho and or sulfate radical so4 based aops and reactive chlorine species rcs involved aops show high potentials in treatment of icm compared to conventional processes studies show that uv photolysis plays an important role in remediation of icm not only in natural environmental i e sunlight photolysis but also in water treatment processes boreen et al 2003 doll and frimmel 2003 fabbri et al 2016 pérez et al 2009 uncatalyzed advanced oxidants including o3 and fe vi are selective oxidants and they have moderate reactivities towards icm ning and graham 2008 anquandah et al 2011 velo gala et al 2014 dong et al 2018b comparatively icm can be efficiently removed by catalyzed aops mainly due to contributions of the highly reactive and less selective radicals i e ho so4 cl cl2 and ocl generated therein jeong et al 2010 wang et al 2019 hu et al 2019a wang et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 mao et al 2020 oxidative treatment of icm generates various oxidation intermediates and they can be finally transformed into i bps by further reactions with oxidants in addition pre oxidation of icm also have significant impact on i bps formation in following post disinfection process the objective of this work focuses mainly on the latest research findings relating to treatment of icm by conventional and advanced oxidation processes reactivities of different oxidation species towards icm are summarized following by discussions on formation of oxidation intermediates as well as specific small molecular i bps during oxidation processes finally impact of pre oxidation of icm by aops on formation of i bps during post disinfection process was discussed 2 occurrence of icm in aqueous environment it is reported that icm are the most frequently used intravascular pharmaceuticals an annual consumption of approximately 3500 tons of icm was reported worldwide daughton and ternes 1999 a total amount of 500 tons of all approved icm was used in germany per year steger hartmann et al 1999 high dosage of icm up to 100 g application is usually adopted in order to achieve adequate contrast putschew et al 2001 and they are always excreted non metabolized in urine within the first 24 h kümmerer et al 1998 consequently icm are detected in various water compartments including surface water wastewater treatment influents and effluents and even groundwater with concentration ranging from ng l to few µg l a summary of concentration of icm reported in the literature is shown in table 1 3 transformation of icm by conventional oxidants and disinfectants hocl and nh2cl 3 1 reactivities of hocl and nh2cl with icm hocl is the most widely used disinfectant in water treatment plant and it shows high reactivities towards a variety of organic compounds such as endocrine disruptor compounds edcs pharmaceuticals herbicides and antibacterials dodd and huang 2004 acero et al 2005 deborde and von gunten 2008 criquet et al 2015 however formation of undesirable bps with high toxicity during chlorination has caused significant public concerns gallard and von gunten 2002 krasner et al 2006 richardson et al 2008 allard et al 2015 therefore nh2cl is used as an alternative disinfectant to reduce bps formation though nh2cl is less reactive than hocl it also displays considerable reactivities towards some organic compounds such as nitrogenous organic compounds algal organic matters and phenolic compounds choi and valentine 2002 chamberlain and adams 2006 rodríguez et al 2007 gong et al 2017 the reactivities of hocl and nh2cl with icm have been studied by several groups ipm is the most reactive one towards hocl and nh2cl among all the icm investigated e g ipm dtz iop iom and iox wendel et al 2014 reported that the apparent second order rate constants k app for the reaction of hocl with ipm increased with increasing ph the species specific rate constants for hocl and ocl with ipm were around 0 9 and 0 02 m 1s 1 respectively similar observation was also obtained by tian et al 2017 but with much lower rate constants i e 0 4 m 1s 1 for hocl and 0 002 m 1s 1 for ocl the discrepancy might be a result of different ph ranges studied by these two groups i e ph range of 6 5 to 8 5 for wendel et al and 5 9 for tian et al tian et al 2017 also found that the reaction of nh2cl with ipm followed a third order kinetic law i e second order in ipm and first order in nh2cl with the maximum rate constant obtaining at ph 7 free chlorine i e hocl and ocl generated from hydrolysis of nh2cl instead of nh2cl itself was suggested to play the dominant role 3 2 transformation intermediates and pathways for hocl and nh2cl reactions with ipm the primary transformation products were identified for chlorination and chloramination of ipm table s1 mainly resulting from the following pathways i e i cleavage of the side chain ii hydrolysis and oxidation of the amide moiety iii exchange of i by cl or oh iv deiodination v addition of oh and cl on the benzene ring and vi oxidative coupling between the primary amine intermediates tian et al 2017 reported that similar intermediates were formed for chlorination and chloramination of ipm with a longer formation time for the latter one wendel et al 2014 found that the majority of iodide i released during chlorination of ipm was oxidized to hypoiodous acid hoi and finally to stable iodate io3 due to the high reactivities between hocl and iodine species bichsel and von gunten 1999 li et al 2020 moreover a good mass balance on total organic iodine toi and inorganic iodine i e i and io3 was obtained regardless of ph formation of high molecular iodinated intermediates accounts for 90 of the remaining toi 34 4 of the original toi after chlorination of ipm for 72 h at ph 8 5 3 3 formation of specific small molecular i bps further transformation of primary intermediates of icm by hocl and nh2cl can generate specific small molecular i bps moreover i released via deiodination of icm can be oxidized by hocl and nh2cl forming hoi reactions of hoi with icm or its intermediates or natural organic matter nom co present can also lead to the formation of i bps carbonous i bps e g iodinated trihalomethanes i thms iodoacetic acid iaas and iodoacetaldehyde ial are most frequently detected during chlor am ination of icm while nitrogenous i bps e g iodoacetonitriles ians are also reported during chlorination of ipm postigo et al 2018 table 2 for reported i bps and their abbreviations formation of i bps depends not only on the types of disinfectant i e hocl vs nh2cl or icm e g ipm iom iox dtz and iop but also on the solution conditions e g the presence of nom and bromide br 3 3 1 impact of the type of disinfectant different formation patterns of i bps from hocl and nh2cl reactions with icm are obtained due to their varied reactivities with icm and inorganic iodine species i e i and hoi duirk et al 2011 found that considerable amounts of i thms i e dclim brclim and if table 2 for abbreviations and miaa table 2 for abbreviation were generated from reactions of hocl and nh2cl with ipm in source water with the maximum concentrations obtaining at ph 8 5 for hocl but ph 6 5 for nh2cl moreover higher i thms concentrations were obtained in chlorination than chloramination process about 211 8 nm dclim and 3 0 nm miaa was formed during chlorination of ipm in source water at ph 8 5 while only around 11 0 nm dclim and 4 0 nm miaa was generated during chloramination of ipm in source water at ph 6 5 ye et al 2014 reported that formation of i thms during chlorination of ipm in the presence of nom was favored at low hocl dosage 25 100 µm but was significantly inhibited as hocl dosage further increased 100 250 µm these results were explained by the oxidation of i released from ipm to hoi and further to io3 by excess hocl which reduced the amounts of i thms derived from hoi involved reactions comparatively formation of i thms increased with increasing nh2cl dosage 25 200 µm under similar conditions probably due to the higher hoi exposures resulting from the inability of nh2cl to oxidize hoi bichsel and von gunten 1999 dichloramine nhcl2 and hocl generated from nh2cl auto decomposition and hydrolysis as well as hoi generated from i oxidation played significant roles in the formation of i thms during chloramination of ipm ye et al 2014 tian et al 2017 showed that iodine conversion of ipm to i bps during nh2cl disinfection 4 6 was 40 higher than that of hocl disinfection 3 2 despite the lower reactivity of nh2cl towards ipm 3 3 2 impact of the type of icm ipm is the most reactive one towards hocl and nh2cl among all the icm investigated yet i bps can also be formed from other icm with scenarios different from ipm ye et al 2014 demonstrated that the maximum yield of i thms obtained during chlorination and chloramination of icm in the presence of nom followed the order of ipm dtz iop for instance the maximum i thms formed during chlorination 25 250 µm of ipm dtz and iop 10 µm at ph 7 0 was about 276 1 63 8 and 47 1 nm respectively moreover ipm was prone to form i thms containing more than one iodine atom e g cldim brdim and if table 2 for abbreviations compared to iop and dtz during chlorination a maximum of 45 8 nm cldim was formed during chlorination of ipm in the presence of nom at ph 7 0 while merely small amounts 10 nm were generated in cases of iop and dtz under similar conditions pantelaki and voutsa 2018 showed that formation of i thms during chlorination of 3 different organic precursors i e humic acid ha river water and wastewater was favored in the presence of ipm than dtz xu et al 2017 found that the concentrations of iox in taihu lake and ipm in huangpu river china were positively related to the formation potentials of cldim and dbrim respectively 3 3 3 impact of nom the properties of nom often display important impact on the species and concentrations of bps formed during chlor am ination of icm wang et al 2014 showed that formation of i thms during chloramination of ipm was favored in the presence of algae organic matter aom than ha and fulvic acid fa around 36 4 µg l i thms was formed from chloramination of ipm in the presence of aom with if accounting for 68 to total i thms while only 0 9 µg l i thms was generated from chloramination of ipm in the presence of ha or fa with dclim dominant this discrepancy was ascribed to the lower hydrophilic fraction of aom than ha and fa since a negative correlation between i thms formed per unit of doc i thms doc and suva was observed during chloramination of ipm containing raw waters pantelaki and voutsa 2018 reported that formation of i thms presented a rapid formation pattern upon chlorination of river water and ha in the presence of ipm while wastewater derived nom showed a rapid i thms formation rate in the first stage followed by a much lower rate under similar conditions ackerson et al 2018 found that similar loss of toi was obtained during chlorination of 3 different source waters in the presence of ipm while higher total organic chlorine tocl was formed from source water with higher suva 3 3 4 impacts of br br can be rapidly oxidized by hocl and nh2cl forming reactive bromine species e g hobr nhclbr and nh2br trofe et al 1980 bousher et al 1989 hua et al 2006 yoom et al 2018 further reactions of these bromine species with organic compounds co present may form brominated bps zhang et al 2008 ding et al 2013 zhai et al 2014 several studies have shown that br not only affects the concentration but also the speciation of i bps formed during chlorination and chloramination of icm pantelaki and voutsa 2018 reported that the presence of br obviously enhanced i thms yields during chlorination of ha river water and wastewater in the presence of dtz with bromine containing i thms such as brclim and dbrim table 2 for abbreviations being dominant wang et al 2014 showed that formation of i thms during chloramination of aom ha and fa in the presence of ipm increased by 3 13 and 15 fold respectively after addition of 5 µm br about 0 2 µm brclim was predominantly formed in the case of aom accounting for 46 6 of total i thms while if 0 04 µm was the major product in the absence of br under similar conditions ye et al 2014 pointed out that the presence of br elevated the yield of i thms and increased the formation of bromine containing i bps such as brclim and dbrim during chlorination and chloramination of dtz especially during chloramination process the concentrations of i thms during chlorination of dtz in the presence of nom increased from 57 6 µg l without br to 69 3 µg l at 15 µm br 3 4 toxicity of chlor am inated icm solution in general the presence of icm tends to elevate the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of aqueous solutions by chlor am ination treatment though icm per se has no or slightly enhancing effect on solution toxicity under similar condition allard et al 2016 duirk et al 2011 jeong et al 2017 postigo et al 2018 matsushita et al 2015 wendel et al 2014 2016 the enhancing extent of icm to solution toxicity for chlorination sometimes differs from chloramination process relating to the composition of water sources jeong et al 2017 found that ipm generated an elevated level of mammalian cell cytotoxicity and genotoxicity after both hocl and nh2cl disinfection of akron oh source water with stronger enhancing extent for nh2cl disinfection comparatively duirk et al 2011 et al reported that the presence of ipm increased the cytotoxicity over chlorinated athens ga source water by 49 while slight differences in cytotoxicity was observed for chloraminated source water with or without ipm in addition duirk et al 2011 also found that ipm elevated the genotoxicity of both chlorinated and chloraminated athens ga source water by 1 7 and 1 3 folds respectively matsushita et al 2015 suggested that the increased mutagenicity of chlorinated solution in the presence of ipm was likely induced by three high molecular weight transformation products generated from ipm reaction with hocl in contrast wendel et al 2016 confirmed that four of the five isolated high molecular weight ipm chlorination products exhibited low levels of cytotoxicity while none of them were genotoxic these different experimental data suggest that different transformation products of icm reaction with hocl or nh2cl may have varied effects on solution toxicity 4 transformation of icm by uv photolysis and advanced oxidation processes 4 1 uv photolysis 4 1 1 reactivity and efficiency uv photolysis has been widely adopted since it is efficient in inactivating waterborne pathogens without generation of regulated bps boreen et al 2003 hijnen et al 2006 it is reported that icm can be gradually transformed under solar or uv radiation due to their capacity to absorb photons doll and frimmel 2003 pérez et al 2009 tian et al 2014 allard et al 2016 fabbri et al 2016 hu et al 2019b canonica et al 2008 the degradation of icm by uv photolysis generally follows a pseudo first order rate law with their transformation efficiency independent of solution ph tian et al 2014 hu et al 2019b generally the degradation efficiency of a target compound by direct photolysis is governed by two factors i e the molar absorption coefficient and the quantum yield of this compound these two parameters for icm are compiled in table 3 as can be seen dtz has a higher quantum yield but a lower molar absorption coefficient compared to the rest of icm the combination of these two factors explains the observed comparable transformation rates of ipm and dtz under uv radiation as studied by kong et al 2018 where the pseudo first order rate constants for ipm and dtz were about 0 0336 and 0 0333 min 1 respectively under 0 13 mwcm 2 uv radiation 4 1 2 oxidation intermediates the phototransformation intermediates of iop by simulated solar radiation has been systematically studied by pérez et al 2009 where 8 prominent products including deiodinated hydroxylated and ketone products were identified table s3 tian et al 2014 reported that totally 15 photodegradation intermediates were formed during uv irradiation of ipm table s1 fabbri et al 2016 showed that a total of 24 10 and 10 transformation products were identified respectively during ipm table s1 iop table s3 and dtz table s5 transformation by tio2 catalyzed photolysis despite a lack of mineralization for all these three icm generally similar reaction pathways are followed for phototransformation of different icm namely i part or complete deiodination ii substitution of i by oh group iii h abstraction from side chain or oxidation of a methylene group in the hydroxylated side chain generating ketone products and iv n dealkylation of the amide in the hydroxylated side chain 4 2 o3 4 2 1 reactivity and efficiency o3 has been widely applied and studied due to its ability to oxidize various organic compounds and to deactivate microorganisms in drinking water and wastewater acero et al 2000 von gunten 2003a b deborde et al 2005 dodd et al 2006 2009 liu et al 2015 the reaction of o3 with icm has been extensively studied where o3 generally shows much lower reactivities towards icm compared to its reactivities with other organic compounds such as phenols and amines for instance huber et al 2005 found that nearly 90 99 of macrolide sulfonamide antibiotics and estrogens in wastewater effluents could be degraded at o3 dosage of 3 mg l while 60 icm i e ipm iop iom and dtz was oxidized even at o3 dosage of 5 mg l ning and graham 2008 investigated the rate constants of o3 reactions with four icm including dtz iop ipm and iom at ph 7 5 with k app ranging from 1 0 to 20 0 m 1s 1 table 4 ipm is the most reactive one towards o3 followed by iom and iop while dtz shows the slowest reactivity towards o3 similar result was also reported by ternes et al 2003 where non ionic icm including ipm iop and iom could be degraded to degrees of 80 with o3 dosage of 15 mg l while ionic icm i e dtz could only be degraded to 14 under similar conditions 4 2 2 oxidation intermediates seitz et al 2008 confirmed aldehyde and carbonyl compounds as the major stable products generated from ozonation of iom table s2 putschew et al 2007 found that iop was quickly degraded by 30 mg l o3 along with a slower abatement of toi io3 was detected therein with its concentration increasing with reaction time suggesting a deiodination pathway for o3 reaction with iop ning and graham 2008 found that i was almost completely released after depletion of dtz by ozone within 10 min while only 40 i in molar terms was released from iom and iop under similar conditions these results indicate that formation of iodine containing oxidation intermediates may be favored during ozonation of non ionic icm e g iop and iom while the cleavage of c i bond is preferred during ozonation of ionic icm such as dtz yet there is limited information on the exact structures of oxidation intermediates formed during ozonation of icm 4 3 fe vi 4 3 1 reactivity and efficiency fe vi is regarded as one of the green oxidants in drinking water and wastewater treatment sharma 2010 2013 lee et al 2014 han et al 2015 ye et al 2017 fe vi shows appreciable reactivities towards various organic compounds such as amines anilines and phenols with little formation of halogenated bps lee et al 2005 sharma et al 2016 sun et al 2018 2019a yang et al 2019 however recent studies show that fe vi is capable of oxidizing i forming hoi which can further react with nom leading to formation of i bps shin et al 2018 wang et al 2018 2019a given that icm contain three iodine atoms in their molecules their transformation during fe vi oxidation has been examined by several studies anquandah et al 2011 reported that the reaction of fe vi with dtz was first order in both fe vi and dtz with higher reaction rates at lower ph the reaction between monoprotonated fe vi i e hfeo4 and dtz contributed to the overall reactivity with species specific rate constant about 9 3 m 1s 1 table 4 the half life of dtz was estimated around 41 8 and 8 3 min with fe vi dosage of 10 and 50 mg l respectively velo gala et al 2014 reported that fe vi displayed high reactivity towards dtz under acidic condition with k app about 104 0 m 1s 1 at ph 5 dong et al 2018b found that fe vi exhibited considerable reactivity towards ipm with species specific rate constant for hfeo4 with ipm about 86 5 m 1s 1 table 4 nearly 10 times higher than that of dtz reported by anquandah et al al 2011 similar to the cases of hocl nh2cl and o3 fe vi is more reactive towards ipm than dtz 4 3 2 oxidation intermediates limited information is available on oxidation intermediates of fe vi reaction with icm at present dong et al 2018b identified 10 high molecular oxidation products from fe vi reaction with ipm table s1 and their formation mainly involved three pathways i e i deiodination ii amide hydrolysis and iii amine oxidation similar to the pathways reported during hocl or nh2cl disinfection processes 4 4 ho and so4 based aops 4 4 1 reactivity and efficiency ho and so4 possess high redox potential 2 5 3 1 v for so4 and 1 8 2 7 v for oh and they are widely studied for removal of recalcitrant organic contaminants guan et al 2011 wols et al 2013 yao et al 2013 yang et al 2014 2015 2017 zhang et al 2015 icm can be effectively degraded by these two radicals in various aops including uv activated peroxides processes e g uv hydrogen peroxide h2o2 uv peroxymonosulfate pms uv persulfate pds and uv h2o2 pds chan et al 2010 chu et al 2011 duan et al 2017 giannakis et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 hu et al 2019a b c zhao et al 2019b metal catalyzed peroxides processes e g co2 pms cuo pms and δ mno2 pms arslan alaton et al 2017 dong et al 2017 hu et al 2017 wang et al 2019b zhao et al 2019a and o3 pms process mao et al 2020 k app for icm reactions with ho and so4 are summarized in table 3 dtz is more reluctant to be oxidized by ho and so4 compared to the other four icm similar to its much lower reactivity towards o3 and fe vi table 4 moreover so4 seems more reactive towards icm than ho in line with the higher removal efficiency of icm oxidation by so4 dominated aops e g uv pds and zero valent aluminum zva activated pds than oh dominated aops e g uv h2o2 and zva activated h2o2 under similar conditions arslan alaton et al 2017 hu et al 2019a 4 4 2 oxidation intermediates similar intermediates are shared during icm oxidation by ho and so4 based aops table s1 s5 for instance zhao et al 2019b reported that 19 transformation products were identified during ipm oxidation by uv pds among which 11 products were also observed in uv h2o2 system table s1 several reaction pathways are reported for ho and so4 reactions with icm including four aforementioned in uv photolysis process additionally the following reaction pathways are also reported i e i amide hydrolysis and or subsequent amino oxidation ii oxidation of hydroxyl group yielding carboxylic products iii oxidation of aliphatic alcohol into aldehyde products and iv cleavage of co bond deiodination and hydroxylation are two dominant degradation pathways for icm oxidation by ho while so4 seems more efficient in reacting with amide group zhao et al 2019b 4 5 rcs involved aops 4 5 1 reactivity and efficiency uv hocl process has attracted increasing attention recently for water treatment shah et al 2011 deng et al 2014 shu et al 2014 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2016 it is considered as a superior alternative to uv h2o2 process since i the oxidant required i e hocl for uv hocl process is usually present in treated water for primary or secondary disinfection purposes and ii it has a higher radical yield than h2o2 due to its higher combined molar absorption coefficient and quantum yield kim et al 2002 sichel et al 2011 kong et al 2016 uv hocl is efficient in degrading various contaminants such as nitrobenzene ronidazole diclofenac and nitroimidazoles under various conditions qin et al 2014 guo et al 2016 yang et al 2016a both ho and cl are generated from uv photolysis of hocl under wavelength 400 nm eqs s1 s2 table s6 which can induce a series of reactions forming secondary rcs such as cl2 and ocl eqs s3 s9 table s6 fang et al 2014 xiang et al 2016 kong et al 2018 lei et al 2019 in addition o3 is also generated during photolysis of chlorine by solar or artificial uv light at varied wavelengths e g 254 311 and 365 nm with its formation increasing with increasing ph as it is generated by photolysis of ocl rather than hocl eqs s10 s11 bulman et al 2019 kishimoto 2019 though o3 is often formed at lower concentrations than these typically used in drinking water treatment 1 mg l it can play an important role in oxidation of some organic compounds e g carbamazepine and mecoprop kong et al 2020 yang et al 2016b hua et al 2019 as well as deactivation of spores or oocysts zhou et al 2014 forsyth et al 2013 under certain condition similar to uv hocl uv nh2cl process has also received increasing interest in the last few years for treatment of organic contaminants oh and rcs including cl cl2 and nhcl are generated therein eqs s12 s15 chuang et al 2017 li et al 2018 sun et al 2019b wu et al 2019a patton et al 2017 transformation efficiency of icm by rcs involved aops has been frequently studied however the rate constants for icm reaction with rcs remain unclear at present secondary rcs mainly cl2 and clo and ho are usually identified as the major reactive oxidants in uv hocl or uv nh2cl processes wang et al 2016 found that though iox could be efficiently degraded by uv photolysis the presence of hocl obviously accelerated this process the oxidation rate of iox by uv photolysis was 0 0095 s 1 with uv intensity of 3 02 mwcm 2 at ph 7 while it increased to 0 013 s 1 after addition of 100 µm hocl ho generated from photolysis of hocl was indicated as the major contributor kong et al 2018 reported that both ipm and dtz could be efficiently degraded by uv hocl with efficiency higher than by uv h2o2 secondary rcs such as cl2 and clo rather than primary radicals i e ho and cl were verified to be the dominant oxidants contributing to the degradation of dtz and ipm similar result was also reported by hu et al 2019b where the relative contributions of uv photolysis ho and rcs mainly clo to dtz degradation were around 12 8 1 2 and 85 9 respectively zhao et al 2019b comparatively investigated the degradation efficiency of ipm by uv h2o2 uv pds and uv hocl and found that uv hocl was the most efficient one in degrading ipm followed by uv pds and uv h2o2 wu et al 2019b showed that both uv hocl and uv nh2cl could effectively degrade dtz in synthetic water with rcs and ho being the dominant contributors but the oxidation efficiency decreased in natural waters river water tap water and rainwater especially for uv nh2cl 4 5 2 oxidation intermediates oxidation intermediates of dtz table s5 ipm table s1 and iox table s4 treated by uv hocl have been well documented they are mainly generated from reactions between icm and cl2 clo and ho via the following pathways i h abstraction at the coh site of icm forming ketone products ii substantial deiodination iii oh addition at c i site of icm intermediates or oh substitution at one side chain forming hydroxylated product iv cl addition at the c i site forming chlorinated products and v oxidation of amino group forming nitro products kong et al 2018 reported similar reaction pathways for dtz table s5 and ipm table s1 degradation by uv hocl with generation of several chlorinated products zhao et al 2019b identified 16 transformation products during ipm oxidation by uv hocl including 4 chlorinated products and 2 nitro products table s1 moreover the authors found that 9 transformation products including nitro products were detected from ipm oxidation by both uv hocl and uv pds suggesting a similar oxidation pattern for rcs and so4 5 impacts of components of water matrix on the transformation efficiency of icm by catalyzed aops 5 1 cl br generally cl shows either negligible or inhibitive impact on the degradation efficiency of icm by different aops zhao et al 2019b found that cl 0 10 mm showed a slight influence on ipm degradation by uv h2o2 and uv hocl at ph 7 under a uv intensity of 130 µwcm 2 zhou et al 2017 found that cl at concentration 100 mm did not affect dtz degradation by sunlight activated pds while it suppressed dtz degradation as its concentration increased to 500 mm similar inhibitive effects of cl 0 25 mm on the degradation of iox by uv hu et al 2019a or heat activated pds hu et al 2019c as well as ipm by cuo or δ mno2 activated pms hu et al 2017 under neutral conditions were also reported the negative impact of cl with high concentration on transformation of icm by different aops is often attributed to its competitive consumption of reactive species i e ho so4 and rcs with formation of less reactive secondary radicals e g cl cl2 and cloh zhou et al 2017 hu et al 2019a c in addition to cl impact of br on transformation of icm during aops are also recorded in the literature hu et al 2019b found that the presence of br 5 50 µm showed slight impact on dtz degradation by uv photolysis alone while it remarkably decreased dtz degradation during uv photolysis in the presence of 100 µm hocl under similar conditions dtz degradation rate decreased from 3 01 10 2 to 8 82 10 3 s 1 as br concentration increased from 5 to 50 µm in uv hocl process the negative effect of br on the degradation of iox by uv hocl was also observed by wang et al 2016 these results were explained by the competitive consumption of hocl and ho by br vs icm forming less reactive secondary radicals such as br and o eqs s16 s19 table s6 lyon et al 2012 wu et al 2017 5 2 hco3 in general hco3 at low concentrations shows slight impact on icm degradation by catalyzed aops while it negatively affects icm transformation at high concentration zhao et al 2019b found that hco3 at concentration 1 mm negligibly affected ipm transformation during uv photolysis of h2o2 pds and hocl while the presence of 5 mm hco3 significantly inhibited ipm degradation by uv pds hu et al 2019a reported that the presence of 2 mm hco3 decreased iox degradation efficiency by uv pds while the inhibition effect was negligible at hco3 concentration 1 mm similar observations were also obtained during iox degradation by heat activated pds hu et al 2019c hu et al 2017 reported that hco3 at concentration 2 mm hardly affected ipm degradation by cuo or δ mno2 activated pms while it suppressed ipm degradation as its concentration further increased the competitive consumption of ho and or so4 by high concentrations of hco3 vs icm leads to formation of less reactive carbonate radicals eqs s20 s21 table s6 buxton et al 1988 yang et al 2014 therefore decreased the transformation efficiency of icm therein 5 3 nom nom is ubiquitously present in various water compartments and it shows significant impact on efficiency of catalyzed aops the presence of nom generally inhibits the degradation of icm by different aops zhao et al 2019b reported that the presence of 1 5 mgc l nom obviously inhibited ipm degradation during uv photolysis of h2o2 pds and hocl especially for uv pds the degradation rate of ipm decreased from 2 0 10 3 to 2 0 10 4s 1 as nom concentration increased from 0 to 5 mgc l in uv pds process similar inhibitive impact of nom on the degradation of ipm by zero valent aluminum activated h2o2 and pds or cuo δ mno2 activated pms was also reported hu et al 2017 zhao et al 2019a showed that the inhibitory effect of nom on degradation of iox by co ii activated pms increased with increasing nom concentration about 82 iox was degraded in 30 min without nom while only 18 iox was removed under similar condition in the presence of 8 mgc l humic acid ha hu et al 2019c reported that the degradation rate of iox by heat activated pds decreased 50 as ha concentrations increased from 0 to 5 mgc l nom can competitively consume reactive species such as ho so4 and rcs with target compounds thus decreasing their removal efficiency westerhoff et al 1999 lutze et al 2015 specifically nom can also act as inner filter during uv photolysis fang et al 2014 luo et al 2015 lutze et al 2015 or complex with metal catalyst during heterogeneous catalysis guan et al 2017 hu et al 2017 which affects the generation of reactive species overall icm could be effectively removed by aops especially catalyzed aops compared to conventional hocl and nh2cl oxidation disinfection processes table s7 summarized the advantages and disadvantages of aops reported for icm removal each technology has its unique advantages but also disadvantages and selection of the suitable technology for icm removal heavily depends on both efficiency of aops and water constituents 6 impacts of peroxidation of icm by aops on formation of i bps in post disinfection process 6 1 formation of i bps during aops and the following disinfection processes 6 1 1 aops specific small molecular i bps such as i thms and iaas can be directly generated from icm treated by aops for instance xu et al 2017 showed that i thms were formed from o3 reaction with icm dong et al 2018b reported that if miaa and triiodoacetic acid tiaa were generated from fe vi oxidation of ipm in the presence of nom with if dominant about 0 2 µm if was formed in the presence of 0 5 mgc l nom after 72 h with the complete transformation of ipm 50 µm by fe vi 500 µm at ph 9 while only 0 01 and 0 02 µm miaa and tiaa was generated formation of i bps during fe vi oxidation of ipm in the presence of nom also showed strong ph dependence with highest concentration obtaining at ph 9 0 likely due to higher hoi exposures resulting from the lower reaction rates of fe vi with hoi at higher ph wang et al 2018 shin et al 2018 similar i bps were also detected during fe vi 500 µm oxidation of three other icm 50 µm i e dtz iop and iox in the presence of 0 5 mgc l nom at ph 9 0 with total concentrations 10 µg l lower than those formed in the case of ipm 75 6 µg l zhao et al 2019a found that if and tiaa were generated during iox oxidation by co ii activated pms with their concentrations increasing with increasing co ii dosage about 0 1 µm if and 3 1 µm tiaa was formed from iox 50 µm oxidation by pms 1 mm in the presence of 1 µm co ii hu et al 2019b reported that the concentrations of if formed from iox oxidation by uv pds at ph 7 0 increased with increasing initial pds dosage 0 500 µm wu et al 2019b reported the formation of if from dtz treated by uv hocl and uv nh2cl with higher concentrations in the former process increasing hocl dosage 25 75 µm increased if formation during uv hocl process while if concentrations were relatively stable with increasing nh2cl dosage 25 75 µm in uv nh2cl process 6 1 2 post disinfection process in addition to focusing on direct formation of i bps during aops some researchers pay more attention to formation of i bps during subsequent disinfection processes wang et al 2016 found the i thms i e if cldim and dclim table 2 for abbreviations were generated after post chlorination of uv hocl treated iox solutions at ph 7 with higher concentrations at lower hocl dosage the concentrations of if cldim and dclim decreased from 45 7 60 9 and 320 2 nm to 9 1 18 8 and 49 8 nm respectively as hocl dosage increased from 12 5 to 200 0 µm this result was explained by lower hoi exposures at higher hocl dosage due to the oxidation of hoi to io3 by hocl moreover they showed that formation of i thms during post chlorination showed strong ph dependence with higher concentrations obtaining under circum neutral conditions formation of i thms during post chlorination firstly increased with increasing br concentration 0 50 µm in uv hocl process and then remained stable as br concentration further increased 50 200 µm while the iodine substitution factor kept increasing with elevating br concentration 0 200 µm hu et al 2019a reported that formation of i thms during post chlorination of uv pds treated iox solutions increased with increasing pds 0 500 dosage with dclim dominant they further showed that i thms was also generated from chlorination of uv hocl or uv treated dtz effluent with concentration much lower in the former process likely due to the oxidation of i by hocl therein hu et al 2019b wu et al 2019b showed that if concentration increased by three order of magnitude and exceeded 0 02 um 10 µg l after storing uv nh2cl treated dtz solutions for 24 h while decreased if concentrations were obtained after storing uv hocl treated dtz solutions at higher hocl dosages 6 2 impacts of pre oxidation of icm by aops on formation of specific small molecular i bps during post disinfection process mao et al 2020 showed that pre oxidation of ipm by o3 increased the formation of i thms in the following chlorination process compared with chlorination alone the formation of total i thms during chlorination of o3 pre treated ipm solutions increased by 2 8 fold for both synthetic and raw waters substantial studies show that pre oxidation of icm by catalyzed aops has significant impacts on formation of i bps in the post disinfection process tian et al 2014 reported that increasing uv irradiation fluence of ipm significantly increased the formation of i bps e g if dcim cldim and tiaa table 2 for abbreviations during subsequent disinfection processes by hocl nh2cl and chlorine dioxide clo2 despite the decreased formation of classical bps e g chloroform cf dichloroacetonitrile dcan trichloroacetic acid tcaa and dichloroacetic acid dcaa for instance the total concentration of classical bps decreased from 4 5 µm without photolysis to 1 2 µm with uv fluence of 1788 mjcm 2 during post chlorination processes about 0 5 µm i bps was generated in control experiments of chloramination of ipm while it increased to 1 7 µm when uv fluence of 1788 mj cm 2 was applied before chloramination under similar conditions hu et al 2019c found that cldim and dclim were generated from chlorination of iox solution pre treated by heat activated pds with lower concentrations at higher pds dosage 0 50 µm while they were not detected from chlorination of iox under similar conditions zhao et al 2019b found that pre oxidation of ipm by uv uv pds and uv hocl slightly suppressed the formation of if during post chlorination while pre oxidation by uv h2o2 obviously increased the formation of if under similar conditions conversely formation of miaa was promoted when ipm was pre oxidized by uv uv pds and uv hocl while negligible miaa was formed in the case of uv h2o2 this discrepancy probably resulted from the higher if formation potentials of intermediates generated during uv h2o2 pre oxidation mainly hydroxylated and deiodinated intermediates section 4 4 mao et al 2020 found that peroxidation of ipm by o3 pms obviously decreased the formation of total i thms in the post chlorination process with lower concentration at lower o3 to pms molar ratios the formation of total i thms during post chlorination decreased by 90 with pre oxidation of ipm by o3 pms at o3 to pms molar ratio of 0 4 7 conclusion and future prospects i bps have gained more and more scientific and technological attention due to their high toxicity compared to chlorinated and brominated analogues icm as an important iodine source in aquatic environment play a non negligible role in formation of i bps during water treatment especially considering their large consumption amounts worldwide conventional oxidation processes are not ideal options for treatment of icm containing waters due to the low reactivities aops especially catalyzed aops show high potentials in elimination of icm however several issues needed to be addressed before putting into practice i e i the quality of the water bodies catalyzed aops are sensitive to water matrix components such as cl br hco3 and nom which will significantly affect the efficiency of the oxidation processes ii the selection of aops different aops may have varied efficiency in treatment of icm especially considering their diverse sensitivities to water matrix components moreover the impact of pre oxidation on formation of bps during subsequent disinfection process may be varied among different aops iii the optimal working conditions for aops parameters such as dosage of the oxidants and or catalysts the optimum ph the intensity of the wavelength etc significantly affect the overall performance of the technology iv formation of i bps during post disinfection processes and the toxicity of treated waters and v the performance of aops under full scale water treatment conditions which will help us better evaluate their feasibility and effectiveness declaration of competing interest the authors

17573,in tropical to temperate environments fecal indicator bacteria fib such as enterococci and escherichia coli can persist and potentially multiply far removed from their natural reservoir of the animal gut fib isolated from environmental reservoirs such as stream sediments beach sand and vegetation have been termed naturalized fib in addition recent research suggests that the intestines of poikilothermic animals such as fish may be colonized by enterococci and e coli and therefore these animals may contribute to fib concentrations in the aquatic environment naturalized fib that are derived from fecal inputs into the environment and subsequently adapted to maintain their population within the non host environment are termed naturalized enteric fib in contrast an additional theory suggests that some naturalized fib diverged from enteric fib many millions of years ago and are now normal inhabitants of the environment where they are referred to as naturalized non enteric fib in the case of the escherichia genus the naturalized non enteric members are identified as e coli during routine water quality monitoring an over estimation of the health risk could result when these naturalized non enteric fib that is not derived from avian or mammalian fecal contamination contribute to water quality monitoring results it has been postulated that these environmental fib belonging to the genera escherichia and enterococcus can be differentiated from enteric fib by genetic methods because they lack some of the genes required for colonization of the host intestine and have acquired genes that aid survival in the environment advances in molecular tools such as next generation sequencing will aid the identification of genes peculiar or enriched in particular habitats to discriminate between enteric and environmental fib in this appraisal we have reviewed the research studying naturalized fib and discussed the techniques for their differentiation from enteric fib this differentiation includes the important distinction between enteric fib derived from fresh and non recent fecal inputs and those truly non enteric environmental microbes which are currently identified as fib during routine water quality monitoring the inclusion of tools for the identification of naturalized fib enteric or environmental would be a valuable resource for future studies assessing water

such as swimming and boating are an important part of the lifestyle in western countries with over 60 of the united states population engaging in water sports deflorio barker et al 2018 these activities however come with a substantial economic cost due to the burden of associated waterborne illnesses caused by pathogenic microorganisms deflorio barker et al 2017 deflorio barker et al 2018 fecal contamination of recreational waters is a major source of pathogens that cause waterborne disease korajkic et al 2018 there are however many constraints associated with the detection of pathogens in water contaminated by feces these constraints include the high cost of pathogen testing intermittent carriage of pathogens by an animal community and the technical difficulties of detecting the low concentration of pathogens usually present in water soller et al 2010 wu et al 2011 as a result most water monitoring schemes use the identification of indicators of fecal inputs as a surrogate to pathogen detection in fresh untreated sewage e coli and enterococci are considered good indicators of potential risk to human health from fecal pathogens because they are present in high concentrations in the feces of mammals sadowsky and whitman 2011 usepa 1996 after discharge of sewage into the aquatic environment however the relationship between these fecal indicator bacteria fib and the pathogens of concern may change due to a range of factors such as dilution water flow characteristics and survival of the pathogens in the environment ahmed et al 2018 boehm et al 2018 boehm et al 2015 devane et al 2014 nelson et al 2018 the ability to determine the presence of pathogens in aquatic environments using fecal microbial indicators has been investigated by researchers with mixed results for indicator pathogen correlations using both traditional fib and microbial source tracking mst markers korajkic et al 2018 examined over 73 studies conducted within a 40 year time span and corroborated the views of many researchers and reviewers who have noted that no single indicator is sufficient to predict all pathogens bacteria viruses and protozoa most recreational water quality criteria rwqc are based on scientific conclusions drawn from the relationship between concentrations of culturable fecal indicator bacteria and rates of gastrointestinal illness gi attributed to recreational water activities strachan et al 2012 thoe et al 2018 wade et al 2003 in international epidemiological studies enterococci have been recognized as better predictors of gi illness in marine waters than e coli wade et al 2008 wade et al 2006 wade et al 2010 and more recently also recognized as suitable predictors for freshwaters usepa 2012 in many situations however the efficacy of fib as indicators of health risk from fecal contamination has been questioned particularly where the dominant sources of fecal microbes in water has changed from high levels of contamination related to human fecal inputs to lower levels of diffuse pollution from a range of non human and human sources evans et al 2019 fujioka et al 2015 point sources of fecal contamination such as wastewater from municipal sewage treatment plants generally result in very high levels of fib which are more readily identified compared with diffuse pollution sources devane et al 2014 non point sources of diffuse pollution such as leaking sewer pipes or septic tanks wildlife sources and agricultural land runoff may represent lower but persistent concentrations of fib elevated above guideline concentrations these diffuse sources may be a mixture of recent and aged fecal inputs which are difficult to trace and require more sophisticated genetic and chemical tools for tracking the source of fecal contamination devane et al 2018 hagedorn et al 2011 teixeira et al 2020 tran et al 2015 in addition to the above factors the role of fib as indicators of water quality has been debated due to research revealing their growth and or persistence in the environment jang et al 2017 mulugeta et al 2012 teixeira et al 2020 walk 2015 whitman et al 2014 whitman et al 2006 fib are no longer considered to be exclusively found in the gut of warm blooded animal hosts with a short survival time once excreted into the environment frick et al 2018 when fecal coliforms including e coli were first proposed as a method of assessing water quality it was thought that fecal coliforms were only able to survive and replicate in the homeostatic intestinal environment of their animal host geldreich 1966 replication of fib in water environments was considered unlikely because ambient temperatures ranged from 4 to 25 c and nutrient status was in continual flux geldreich 1966 when the survival of fib in the environment was first reported studies were limited to tropical areas where higher temperatures were suggested as aiding their survival and growth byappanahalli and fujioka 1998 jimenez et al 1989 however further work established the same trend for the persistence of indicator bacteria in subtropical environments anderson et al 2005 desmarais et al 2002 solo gabriele et al 2000 and temperate environments byappanahalli et al 2003a ishii et al 2006a mclellan 2004 whitman and nevers 2003 table 1 these ground breaking studies showed the ability of fib to persist and replicate in the environment under nutrient regimes and temperatures not previously thought credible by scientists and led to the terms naturalized e coli and enterococci it was recognized that identification of these environmentally adapted fib as part of a water quality monitoring program could overestimate the health risk from fecal pathogens which are usually associated with fresh fecal sources however identification of naturalized fecal fib associated with non recent fecal inputs may still indicate a health risk from pathogens persisting in the aquatic environment this circumstance was noted in the study of an urban river receiving major raw sewage discharges over six months where the concentrations of cryptosporidium and giardia were found to be higher in the sediments after the discharges ceased devane et al 2014 in this scenario no cryptosporidium and reduced concentrations of giardia were found in the overlying water post discharge illustrating that there can be a potential risk from pathogens persisting in sediments which are disconnected from recent fecal inputs in the last decades with the advent of whole genome analysis of bacteria other sources of naturalized fib have been proposed that are not derived from fecal sources non fecal fib these true environmental strains may only now be recognized as different to enteric enterococcus and e coli due to new sequencing technologies which allow a greater understanding of the thousands of genes present in each of these microorganisms he et al 2018 walk 2015 it is postulated that some naturalized fib diverged from enteric fib many millions of years ago and are currently natural inhabitants of the environment jang et al 2017 staley et al 2014 walk 2015 walk et al 2009 weigand et al 2014 this latter group containing non e coli members of the escherichia genus and the environmental enterococci are still identified as belonging to the fib by conventional biochemical testing and water quality monitoring methods byappanahalli et al 2012a he et al 2018 jang et al 2017 walk 2015 walk et al 2009 in the case of the escherichia genus many conventional water quality testing methods enumerate e coli by targeting its ß d glucuronidase activity bej et al 1991 maheux et al 2015 shadix and rice 1991 other species in the escherichia genus however have been identified that also possess this enzyme activity and test positive using conventional methods thereby potentially confounding interpretations of water quality by overestimating the risk to recreational users deng et al 2014 genetic technologies are being developed that enable discrimination of the enteric fib from naturalized non enteric escherichia and enterococcus species discrimination of these naturalized species has been proposed based on the absence of genes required for colonization of the host intestine and the acquisition of genes that aid survival in the post excretion environment luo et al 2011 weigand et al 2014 in this review research investigating naturalized sources of fib and their identification as fecal indicators is discussed examining whether overestimates of health risk occur during routine water quality monitoring the review describes the important distinction between those enteric fib derived from fresh and non recent fecal inputs and those truly non fecal non enteric environmental microbes which are currently identified as fib using conventional water quality monitoring tests it discusses environmental non fecal reservoirs sources of fib and highlights research into genetic techniques for discriminating between fecal fib and naturalized fib both enteric and environmental and suggests the areas where research is required to advance the development and understanding of these genetic tools for future environmental studies 1 1 search engines and keywords for this literature review the following search engines were used to search for keywords relevant to this review on

indicator bacteria 2 1 the escherichia genus escherichia have previously been characterized as containing the six different species e coli e albertii e fergusonii e blattae e hermannii and e vulneris alm et al 2011 as reviewed by alm et al 2011 and chaudhuri and henderson 2012 this classification was based on dna dna hybridization studies and phenotypic analyses subsequent analyses of nucleotide sequences of 16s ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid rdna and housekeeping genes has suggested that the escherichia genus should only contain the three species e coli e albertii e fergusonii which form a monophyletic lineage recently in china an escherichia strain was isolated from the feces of a marmot and showed 99 2 homology to e coli 16s rrna sharing 70 dna dna hybridization with other species of escherichia these findings led to the proposal that it is a novel species e marmotae within the escherichia genus liu et al 2019 liu et al 2015 it is recognized that the species e coli has extensive genetic diversity chaudhuri and henderson 2012 touchon et al 2020 the average e coli genome contains approximately 4700 genes but only 2000 of these genes are conserved between members of the e coli species and represent the core genome tenaillon et al 2010 the additional genes represent a genome of high plasticity allowing for environmental adaptations through the acquisition and loss of multiple genes whole genome analysis has revealed that this turnover of genes is largely driven by the transfer of mobile genetic elements touchon et al 2020 clermont et al 2000 designed a triplex polymerase chain reaction pcr method for assigning e coli to four phylogenetic groups a b1 b2 and d this pcr system was subsequently updated to include three new phylogenetic groups identified by genomic data and to recognize the novel escherichia cryptic clades i v clermont et al 2013 the escherichia cryptic clades are discussed in detail in the next section recently an additional phylogroup g has been proposed clermont et al 2019 lu et al 2016 therefore the species members of e coli sensu stricto strictly belonging to the species escherichia coli are currently recognized as forming eight main phylogenetic groups a b1 b2 c d e f and g clermont et al 2015 clermont et al 2019 touchon et al 2020 these eight phylogroups are known to reside primarily in the gut of animals and there is evidence to suggest they are involved in distinct ecological roles smati et al 2015 tenaillon et al 2010 for example in the developed world b2 has been recognized as the dominant phylogroup in human feces whereas in general e coli in the animal microbiota are dominated by phylogroup b1 ambrosi et al 2019 vadnov et al 2017 subsequently the focus is changing from pcr characterization to using whole genome sequencing wgs to identify microbial species and strains clermont et al 2015 beghain et al 2018 have developed an in silico method for phylotyping the escherichia genus called the clermontyper and they have made this free web resource accessible to the scientific community current identification of e coli strains present in a sample requires isolation of the colony before wgs which is labor intensive and costly future studies will incorporate culture independent techniques which target genes that can investigate the inherent diversity of e coli and provide greater resolution of the fecal e coli microbiota cookson et al 2017 2 1 1 cryptic clades of escherichia in addition to the known eight phylogenetic groups for e coli strains a study using multilocus sequence typing mlst identified five novel clades designated clades i to v of escherichia walk et al 2009 clades are a phylogenetically distinct group derived from a common ancestor the original escherichia cryptic clades were isolated from freshwater beaches by standard methods used by the u s environmental protection agency for fib in recreational waters usepa 2000 walk 2015 walk et al 2007 initially the escherichia clades were thought to be encompassed by the e coli species criterion due to their lack of phenotypic differentiation from e coli using traditional biochemical testing methods alm et al 2011 walk et al 2007 the putative environmental clades of escherichia have been shown to be phenotypically and taxonomically indistinguishable to the enteric e coli isolates using the standardized api20e identification system biomerieux inc and the bbl crystal identification system becton dickinson and company walk et al 2009 the β d glucuronidase gene used to confirm e coli in many culture and genetic based water quality tests was also found to be 92 to 100 positive in all of the cryptic clade isolates n 24 deng et al 2014 comparison of the cryptic clade 16s rdna profiles with those of e coli sensu stricto confirmed their identity as e coli walk et al 2009 in addition walk et al 2009 identified that only the phenotypic profile of clade iii was statistically different from the e coli phenotype due to the inability of clade iii isolates to ferment sucrose and sorbitol and utilize lysine the term escherichia cryptic clades was used to re classify the clades i to v because of their lack of phenotypic differentiation from e coli using traditional biochemical profiles but their divergence from e coli when applying genetic techniques walk et al 2009 analysis of sequence databases of e coli strains has infrequently turned up members of the clades i v walk et al 2009 these databases have a major focus on strains isolated from human fecal samples and therefore are representative of clinically relevant e coli to the exclusion of other habitats which remain under sampled walk 2015 walk et al 2009 for example in a multi center study of patients n 1081 with e coli bacteremia two clade v and one clade iii strains were isolated corroborating their low pathogen potential 0 3 of e coli isolates clermont et al 2011 lefort et al 2011 the low prevalence of cryptic clades in current databases of e coli suggests they may not be indicative of fecal contamination when identified in waterways genomic sequencing of a range of enteric and environmental escherichia isolates revealed that while they all shared a core set of approximately 2000 genes there were genes that were either specific to or highly represented in either the escherichia cryptic clades or enteric e coli groups luo et al 2011 for example enteric e coli had specific functional genes related to the transport and acquisition of nutrients abundant in the gut e g gluconate in contrast the functions of genes specific to the escherichia cryptic clades were related to survival in a non enteric environment such as enzymes that aid the hydrolysis of bacterial cell walls these findings have been supported by a comparative microarray dna dna hybridization study which identified bacterial adhesion genes in enteric e coli important for host colonization by both pathogenic and commensal intestinal isolates oh et al 2012 the phenotypes of the majority of enteric e coli are positive for the catabolism of lysine and ornithine clermont et al 2011 in the case of the escherichia cryptic clades the isolates were identified as being negative for lysine and or ornithine catabolism providing phenotypic traits that distinguished them from the enteric e coli clermont et al 2011 the exception to this is clade i where the majority of isolates were positive for catabolism of both ornithine and lysine strains of clade i were also shown to be genotypically very close to enteric e coli and therefore could be classified as enteric bacteria deng et al 2014 luo et al 2011 further work identified a heat labile toxin from members of clade i isolated from clinical cases of diarrhea with carriage of this virulence factor distinguishing them as enterotoxigenic e coli etec and confirming their status as enteric escherichia isolates with pathogenic potential steinsland et al 2010 walk 2015 the review of walk 2015 outlines other studies where escherichia clade i isolates have been identified in human cases of gastroenteritis and provides further discussion regarding whether clade i should be recognized as a subspecies of e coli comparison of the dna dna hybridization and average nucleotide identity scores used to designate species determination provides evidence that clades iii and iv are subspecies of a novel escherichia species while clade v is a separate novel member of the escherichia genus walk 2015 in the case of clade ii more in depth sequence analysis is required before any such species designations can be postulated for this rarely isolated strain walk 2015 classification however is dynamic and with regards to clade v two isolates of the avirulent clade v from the study of luo et al 2011 clustered with the novel escherichia species e marmotae isolated from the feces of the marmot liu et al 2019 in comparison as discussed in walk 2015 clades iii and iv were well differentiated from the other escherichia species liu et al 2019 recent phylogenetic and phenotypic analysis provides evidence for the incorporation of clades iii and iv as the two subspecies in a novel escherichia species e ruysiae which was originally isolated from the feces of a person who had travelled to asia van der putten et al 2020 interestingly despite subsequent attempts to re isolate the e ruysiae from the human case it was only recovered on a single occasion hinting that carriage and excretion from the human gut was transient van der putten et al 2020 a study investigating the virulence potential of the putative escherichia cryptic clades observed that they were poor competitors in gut colonization compared with the enteric e coli strains ingle et al 2011 furthermore although these escherichia cryptic clades carried a varied range of virulence factors they including five clade v isolates were not found to be virulent in mouse models of extraintestinal infection and were reported to be uncommon isolates from vertebrate hosts all of these factors suggested they could be opportunistic pathogens rather than true inhabitants of the intestine ingle et al 2011 other important characteristics differentiating the cryptic clades from enteric e coli isolates include enhanced ability to form biofilms and low levels of antibiotic resistance ingle et al 2011 they also have a lower temperature growth tolerance of 5 c compared with 11 c for the majority of e coli whilst maintaining optimal growth temperatures of 41 42 c similar to other members of the escherichia genus ingle et al 2011 moreira et al 2012 their low occurrence in clinical settings and in vertebrate hosts and low level of antibiotic resistance and virulence factors supports the hypothesis that the cryptic clades ii v are not highly pathogenic but rather opportunistic pathogens as reviewed by walk 2015 gene expression studies of growth and starvation conditions by vital et al 2015 noted differential expression between clades iv and v and two commensal e coli strains during starvation conditions up regulation of genes related to stress responses was noted for cryptic clade strains which potentially allowed faster adaptations to poor nutrient environments external to the host intestinal niche di sante et al 2018 investigated the environmental survival strategy of biofilm formation by comparing the escherichia cryptic clades and a commensal e coli k12 intestinal strain and their abilities to produce extracellular matrices when exposed to unfavorable conditions of low temperature and nutrient deprivation clades iii iv and v strains but not the commensal strain were able to produce curli fimbriae and cellulose to form an extracellular matrix di sante et al 2018 this extracellular matrix is postulated to assist biofilm formation and adherence to abiotic surfaces thus acting as a potential survival mechanism in non host environments these survival mechanisms potentially increase the fitness of cryptic clade species for exploiting non host environments ingle et al 2011 in a study investigating the virulence features of clades iii v that had been isolated from coastal marine sediments 20 of the 138 putative e coli isolates were classified as belonging to the environmental escherichia cryptic clades vignaroli et al 2015 seventeen of these 20 environmental escherichia were susceptible to antimicrobials and they all lacked the enteroaggregative e coli pathotype virulence genes in addition 60 were positive for a gene encoding an enterotoxin east1 and 70 for group ii capsule production genes toxin and capsule production have been noted as bacterial strategies for surviving environmental conditions with benefits including reduced competition from other microorganisms in the case of toxins and desiccation and sunlight irradiation protection afforded by a capsule costerton et al 1995 power et al 2005 valerio et al 2010 tissue culture adhesion and invasion assays using the caco2 and int407 mammalian intestinal cell lines were performed on eight of the environmental escherichia cryptic clade isolates each varying in their gene content vignaroli et al 2015 clade v displayed the highest adhesion properties similar to intestinal strains but none of the cryptic clades showed the ability to invade the intestinal cell lines tested the authors have suggested a dual role for clade v where it has adapted to the environment but retains the ability for an intestinal lifestyle with the potential for expression of virulence traits vignaroli et al 2015 this assertion has gained support from the study of liu et al 2019 where phylogenetic analysis of whole genome sequence data indicated clustering of fecal e marmotae strains with environmental clade v isolates from the study of luo et al 2011 identification of virulence genes including enterotoxin east1 in these e marmotae fecal strains and their positive cell invasion albeit at markedly lower levels than shigella strains suggest their potential as invasive pathogens liu et al 2019 the study of vignaroli et al 2015 also identified a potential environmental biomarker pduc which encodes a propanediol hydratase and was statistically significantly associated with but not exclusive to the environmental escherichia cryptic clades it is important to have methods that discriminate between e coli and the naturalized escherichia cryptic clades to avoid classifying waterways as non compliant where non fecal sources of escherichia are contributing to conventional e coli water testing fig 1 and table 2 the quadruplex pcr of clermont et al 2013 with additional pcr updates in clermont et al 2019 for identification of phylogroup g enable initial screening of putative e coli isolates into eight phylogroups but also into non specific groupings of the escherichia cryptic clades for example one amplicon in the quadruplex clermont et al 2013 pcr detects members of clades iii iv and v the clades can then be further differentiated into individual clade designations by the specific pcr markers developed by clermont et al 2011 these allele specific pcrs target the aes gene and the dna fragment chua to obtain discrimination between all five cryptic clades e coli isolates previously subtyped by clermont et al 2000 and then retyped by the pcr method of clermont et al 2013 reported low reclassification rates 8 14 for human e coli isolates but 54 reclassification for avian pathogenic e coli isolates logue et al 2017 this revision included some e coli 1 that were retyped from a or b2 to cryptic clade i logue et al 2017 another comparative analysis of e coli isolates re typed by the clermont et al 2013 method identified that more human isolates and less avian isolates required re classification in comparison to the study of logue et al 2017 emphasizing differences between host environments starčič erjavec et al 2017 these researchers also noted a higher number of non typable nt isolates in their study and suggested the need to identify novel host environments where these nt e coli reside so that whole genome analyses can be performed and new phylotyping schemes developed for nt isolates starčič erjavec et al 2017 it should be noted that neither of these comparative studies reclassified e coli phylogroups to any of the clade ii v groups the findings of these studies using the new pcr tools for re classification adds to the evidence that the cryptic clades ii v are present at low frequency in e coli culture collections other researchers are investigating pcr methods for differentiating between naturalized escherichia and enteric e coli as pcr would provide the most efficient genetic classification system for water managers table 2 deng et al 2014 identified a gene that is likely to be important for the enteric population of e coli to survive the intestinal environment and proposed that identification of the putative glucosyltransferase gene ycjm in e coli may confirm a recent fecal origin however there was not a clear delineation because although ycjm was identified in 97 of 398 of clinical and fecal e coli isolates from animals and birds it was also identified in 28 of the isolates of the escherichia clades ii v however the ycjm marker was an improvement on pcrs that target the β d glucuronidase gene as an identifier of e coli where 92 of cryptic clade isolates were positive deng et al 2014 a pcr method incorporating the dye propidium monoazide pma to target only viable bacteria has also been investigated using a modification of the ycjm gene target of deng et al 2014 to differentiate e coli from the non e coli false positives yuan et al 2018 the attempt to reduce the number of false positives for e coli detection 96 specificity for ycjm in drinking and environmental waters showed statistically comparable results between pma qpcr e coli levels and standard culturable methods yuan et al 2018 however turbidity was an issue and pretreatment of water samples was suggested prior to analysis a pcr targeting the ybbw gene a putative allantoin transporter gene was developed that reported 100 specificity and sensitivity for e coli when tested against closely related species including four other escherichia species and shigella walker et al 2017 in environmental waters there was a log linear relationship between e coli counts in the water and the copy number of ybbw measured by the pcr assay further investigations with this ybbw marker in a qpcr method has also demonstrated 100 specificity with e coli compared to 22 other enteric bacterial species mcquillan and wilson 2019 but its specificity against the escherichia cryptic clades remains to be determined if this pcr marker excludes the cryptic clades it could overcome the issue of concurrent detection with e coli during water quality monitoring 2 1 2 habitats for escherichia cryptic clades identification of clades iii v in australia united states and puerto rico by extended mlst suggest a wide geographic representation for the environmental escherichia cryptic clades walk et al 2009 there is growing evidence of the presence of the escherichia clades ii v in the feces of avian and feral animals and to date clade v has been the most abundant of the environmental escherichia cryptic clades isolated blyton et al 2015 clermont et al 2011 vignaroli et al 2015 table 3 presents the geographical locations and environmental animal habitats where escherichia cryptic clades have been identified the identification of the escherichia clades ii v as better adapted to the non intestinal environments of water soil freshwater beach sand and sediment has led researchers to develop the environmental hypothesis walk 2015 based on their extremely low prevalence in host associated culture collections especially from clinical sources it has been hypothesized that the cryptic clades are more abundant in and better adapted to habitats outside the host compared with inside the host excluding clade i walk 2015 this environmental hypothesis supports the comparative genomic analyses which have revealed genes conserved in enteric strains such as genes important for adhesion to the gut wall which are not present in environmental strains luo et al 2011 oh et al 2012 a study of the prevalence of the cryptic clades isolated from duck pond water and duck feces provided support for the environmental hypothesis table 3 walk 2015 the study identified cryptic clade isolates in the pond water but not in the duck feces additional research however is required to establish whether wildlife represent a spillover host for clades ii v due to transient passage and proximity of wildlife to water sources or if these animals are a reservoir for the cryptic clades alonso et al 2017 walk 2015 there are few sampling studies that have genotypically characterized escherichia coli isolates from various non animal environments however further analyses will be assisted with additional testing of escherichia isolates using pcr and in silico wgs culture independent techniques beghain et al 2018 clermont et al 2013 clermont et al 2011 cookson et al 2017 fig 1 presents a decision tree for a sampling protocol to differentiate putative naturalized escherichia either naturalized e coli or escherichia cryptic clade isolates from fecal inputs of e coli application of this sampling protocol to waterways where the putative elevated e coli levels detected during conventional water quality monitoring are suspected to be derived from non recent fecal inputs could determine the prevalence of escherichia cryptic clades within the aquatic environment in addition identification of clonally related subtypes of a particular e coli phylogroup that is numerically dominant in a sediment sample may be indicative of a naturalized e coli strain that has adapted to the non host environment and is either persisting or replicating within the sediment brinkmeyer et al 2015 liang et al 2016 shelton et al 2014 studies of the environmental reservoirs of escherichia are discussed in further detail in section 3 including recent studies that have differentiated e coli phylogroups from escherichia cryptic clade isolates 2 2 the enterococcus genus members of the enterococcus genus were formerly included in the genus streptococcus until 1984 when nucleic acid hybridization studies revealed that they were only distantly related to other streptococcus members as reviewed in byappanahalli et al 2012a a new genus enterococcus was therefore created with 36 currently known species divided into five groups enterococcus are gram positive spherical ovoid cells arranged in chains or in pairs they are non spore formers facultative anaerobes and defined by a temperature growth range of 10 to 45 c and their ability to grow in sodium chloride 6 5 and high ph 9 6 conditions facklam et al 2002 sherman 1937 these factors together with their resistance to bile acids and desiccation enable them to be robust survivors in post intestinal environments aarestrup et al 2002 staley et al 2014 as reviewed by byappanahalli et al 2012a most enterococcus species are identified in an animal habitat including that of humans and in the gut of insects the yellow pigmented species of e casseliflavus and e mundtii have been predominantly associated with environmental sources such as plants and soil but also as pathogenic to humans aarestrup et al 2002 collins et al 1986 collins et al 1984 the predominant enterococci species identified in animal and human intestinal environments are e faecalis and e faecium these are also the most commonly identified environmental species see the reviews of ogier and serror 2008 staley et al 2014 and garcia solache and rice 2019 in terms of water quality monitoring it is important to be able to differentiate between those enterococci associated with environmental matrices such as plants and soils and those that are derived from fecal habitats it is difficult to differentiate between these categories as some enterococci could be normal inhabitants or environmental contaminants from fecal sources aarestrup et al 2002 badgley et al 2010a during an evaluation of the european bathing water directive standard methods for enumeration of intestinal enterococci tiwari et al 2018 found that 93 of confirmed isolates were identified as either e faecalis or e faecium using partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene environmental enterococci including e gallinarum and e casseliflavus were also identified at all bathing sites albeit in low numbers both of these enterococci species have also been identified in the feces of gull species fogarty et al 2003 evaluation of genome sequencing of enterococci isolates from enteric environments identified specific gene signatures for carbohydrate utilization of sugars such as xylose which are prevalent in the gut weigand et al 2014 the genome of 11 isolates of enterococcus faecalis collected from freshwater environments were compared with these enteric strains of e faecalis weigand et al 2014 identified putative habitat specific strains of enterococci where the environmental and enteric strains could not be differentiated by traditional phenotypic tests or by genetic tests using dna dna hybridization or 16s rdna sequencing pathogenicity islands pai however were identified as a common feature in the genome of enteric enterococci but not environmental isolates pai contain sequences which allow insertion deletion into chromosomes and thus horizontal gene transfer between bacterial genomes and pai are known to encode virulence genes and aid host colonization mecsas and strauss 1996 genomic evidence presented by weigand et al 2014 suggests that the extra enteric strains may predate the enteric strains meaning that enterococci originated as environmental strains these environmental strains then adapted to an enteric environment by acquisition of accessory metabolic functions for example via pathogenicity islands this work is supported by lebreton et al 2017 who used molecular clock estimations in conjunction with phenotypic and environmental characterization to investigate the ancestral linkages of enterococci starling 2017 they identified that enterococci were potentially associated with sediments in marine habitats prior to the association of enterococci with land animal hosts lebreton et al 2017 suggested that carbohydrate uptake and utilization genes have been major drivers in the differentiation of the enterococcus into diverse species as they adapted to the unique intestinal environments of a particular land animal host properties that facilitate the importance of enterococci as significant multidrug resistant pathogens in hospital acquired infections include their ability to acquire mobile elements and innate resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants due to a hardened cell wall lebreton et al 2017 postulated that the enterococci s hardened cell wall was a product of natural selection within the marine environment in response to environmental stresses and enabled them to adapt to the transition from marine to terrestrial animals where gut microflora encountered cycles of starvation and desiccation post excretion before re entering the terrestrial animal food chain another study exploring the genetic differences between the enteric and environmental enterococci noted that virulence and antibiotic resistance genes were more commonly identified in enterococci derived from clinical settings compared with strains isolated from marine sediments di cesare et al 2014 in particular the virulence gene esp important in host colonization and biofilm formation fisher and phillips 2009 was only identified in clinical isolates the nickel uptake operon was however identified as a potential biomarker for environmental enterococci because of its almost exclusive presence in environmental enterococci di cesare et al 2014 it was suggested that deletion of this operon in the enteric environment may not be disadvantageous because nickel is present in much higher concentrations in the intestine compared with freshwater environments di cesare et al 2014 also identified a gene in the enterococci isolated from marine sediments which conferred resistance to copper and suggested its presence may be related to industrial pollution outputs in the adriatic sea environment the field of comparative genomics between enterococci isolated from clinical and non clinical environments has continued to reveal insights into differences in genetic adaptations he et al 2018 in a study of 78 genomes of enterococcus faecalis which included isolates from water and enteric strains the water isolates had the lowest predicted open reading frame size and smallest genome sizes whereas there were no significant differences between enteric strains from blood feces and urine he et al 2018 this study identified 84 genes that were specific to the water isolates 28 of those genes were present in all water isolates including the genes involved in the cobalt and the nickel transport system supporting the finding of di cesare et al 2014 that the nickel uptake operon could be a target for the identification of environmental enterococci the number of antibiotic resistance genes in enterococci isolated from blood were significantly higher compared with those from water or dairy products furthermore a high number of environment specific genes were identified that did not have a known cellular function genomic studies are finding that the natural habitat from which the enterococci are isolated contributes to shaping the genome of the bacterium allowing it to adapt to its environment he et al 2018 zhong et al 2019 future studies may allow for genetic methods to specifically target environmentally adapted enterococci and discriminate them from the enteric enterococci this would significantly enhance water quality monitoring enabling targeting of enterococci derived from fecal contamination sources rather than the free living enterococci 3 environmental reservoirs of fib many reviews have documented that the fecal indicators e coli and enterococci can occur in the absence of fresh fecal inputs as part of the microbiota in sediments soil and sand terrestrial and aquatic plants and algal mats byappanahalli et al 2012a jang et al 2017 nevers et al 2014 teixeira et al 2020 whitman et al 2014 tables 1 and 4 although these fib are sourced from historical fecal inputs these environmental reservoirs can also be important sources of environmentally persistent pathogens in recreational areas with potential for human health impacts mackowiak et al 2018 sabino et al 2014 solo gabriele et al 2016 weiskerger and brandão 2020 weiskerger et al 2019 genotypic and phenotypic studies in various climates have shown that populations of e coli and enterococci isolated from soils and sand cluster by geographic location into distinct but diverse groups such clustering especially at the genotypic level suggests that fib in the natural environment come from multiple sources but have sufficiently diverged from animal and bird fecal sources in the same geographical location for the fib to no longer be considered of recent fecal origin byappanahalli et al 2012c fujioka and byappanahalli 2001 ishii et al 2006a perchec merien and lewis 2013 furthermore genetic typing studies have identified where the e coli populations in environmental reservoirs such as sediment provided evidence of clonal populations and thus environmental replication ibekwe et al 2011 ksoll et al 2007 this has led to the term naturalized or environmental enteric fib populations which are capable of persistence and or replication in the post defecation environment perchec merien and lewis 2013 staley et al 2014 whitman et al 2014 therefore identification of fib that indicate fresh sources of fecal inputs with concomitant high probability of pathogen presence requires the understanding of the science related to survival and persistence of inputs of fib from aged fecal sources many of the studies that follow discuss enterococci and e coli persistence in the environment without differentiating either between fib as derived from aged fecal sources or the non fecal non enteric sources of fib future studies will be able to incorporate the genetic tools identified in this review to differentiate the fib populations in these habitats to explore their derivation and relevance to health risk assessments 3 1 fib in soil and sediments many rivers particularly those in catchments prone to erosion have the potential to store enteric indicators and pathogens in their sediments with concomitant public health impacts if sediment resuspension events occur abia et al 2017 abia et al 2016 devane et al 2019 drummond et al 2015 enteric pathogens and e coli were evaluated for survival in sediment microcosm experiments in flow chambers to simulate their survival in riverbeds abia et al 2016 the researchers concluded that river sediments can provide a favorable environment for both enteric pathogens and indicators depending on temperature parameters e coli and salmonella sp were noted to survive longer at 4 c whereas vibrio cholerae had the greatest persistence of all tested microbes at 20 c and 30 c in sediment abia et al 2016 growth and persistence of fib was observed in sediment microcosms obtained from a swiss freshwater lake pote et al 2009 low temperatures 10 c and low organic matter content in the sediment negatively impacted fib concentrations intact sediment cores collected from a swiss freshwater lake contained fib levels ranging between 105 and 107 colony forming units cfu 100 g dry weight haller et al 2009 the cores were stored at 4 c for 90 days and persistence of e coli and enterococci up to 90 days in the top surface layer 2 cm depth was noted at concentrations between 104 and 105 cfu 100 g dry sediment mesocosm experiments using sediment and water collected from a river system in florida revealed growth of enterococci and e coli under conditions of simulated tidal influence with wetting and drying phases desmarais et al 2002 in hawaiian soils soil moisture nutrient conditions and indigenous soil bacteria were identified by byappanahalli and fujioka 2004 as limiting factors influencing the growth of e coli but to a lesser extent enterococci in this tropical environment they still observed slow and sporadic replication of fib which allowed fib to establish as a minor fraction of the soil microbiota other studies have confirmed the importance of higher levels of organic matter 1 0 and fine sediment silt and clay for facilitating the survival of fib in sediment and soil brinkmeyer et al 2015 desmarais et al 2002 garzio hadzick et al 2010 lee et al 2006 stocker et al 2018 liang et al 2016 identified that the surface properties of e coli isolated from stream sediments were different to the e coli isolated from stream water and that differences in habitat had a regulating effect on the expression of surface properties such as hydrophobicity and the production of extracellular polymeric substances eps the hydrophobicity of stream sediment e coli was noted to be significantly higher these changes in eps content may be advantageous for persistence of the e coli cells by aiding cell adhesion and biofilm formation in the stream sediments one of the first studies to investigate whether there are any habitat preferences between phylogroups of e coli used single nucleotide polymorphism qpcr to differentiate the four phylogroups of e coli b1 b2 d and e dusek et al 2018 these researchers studied e coli prevalence in soil under different land use types in the u s to determine if soil and landscape characteristics impacted phylogroup survival and distribution a high prevalence of e coli was identified in both forest soils and pastureland however core genome analysis of isolates did not identify any cryptic clades of escherichia the phylogroup b1 was the dominant e coli identified in soils phylogroups b1 and e were more commonly associated with pasturelands while phylogroups b2 and d had a greater association with wooded areas and more acidic soils dusek et al 2018 pathogenic salmonella species have been identified as surviving in estuarine bank sediments with comparable persistence to e coli suggesting that e coli could be a useful indicator of the survival of this pathogen in estuary environments siddiqee et al 2018 pathogen survival was investigated in fresh and stored one year sediments from storage tanks of storm water treatment plants to ascertain the risk to human health from redistributing the sediment to land sałata et al 2018 some fresh sediments from the storm water treatment plants did contain pathogens including salmonella and fecal enterococci highlighting a potential hazard if they were applied to agricultural land in contrast stored sediments were not identified as containing the above pathogens or e coli or shigella the authors suggest that with increasing quantities of sediment from storm water facilities there is a need for guidelines on the levels of microbes that may represent a biological hazard if such sediments are applied directly to land with the recognition of the persistence in sediments and soils of fecal microbes derived from anthropogenic pollutants investigations of environmental reservoirs are now focusing on the persistence and prevalence of pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes in waterways and their correlation with fib barron et al 2018 brown et al 2019 devane et al 2014 vignaroli et al 2018 the impact of fib in sediments and soils and their correlation with pathogen presence warrants further investigations to facilitate recommendations for water scientists on the management of these environmental reservoirs 3 2 fib in beach sands wave activity and the resuspension of beach sands may affect fib levels weiskerger et al 2019 in a study of californian marine beach sands lee et al 2006 observed levels of enterococci at 104 mpn 100 g wet sediment in enclosed beaches where the intensity of wave activity was low this level of enterococci in sediment was two to three orders of magnitude higher than levels at eleven open beaches where the authors postulate that wave activity led to increases in resuspension and transportation of enterococci seaward in contrast the relationship between e coli concentrations in sediment was less clear when comparing open and enclosed beaches as levels of e coli in sediment were similar at both beach types an extreme weather event in portugal in 2010 resulted in flash floods and mudslides which caused severe impacts including to recreational beaches in the archipelago of madeira levels of e coli and enterococci in beach sand at eight of these beaches in the madeira archipelago were increased with higher concentrations for enterococci compared with e coli over the three months following the storm abreu et al 2016 romão et al 2017 in subsequent months removal of debris and the repair of damaged infrastructure such as sewer lines were important actions for reducing the microbial contaminant load fib mycelial fungi and yeast at these beaches it was observed however that artificial beaches had higher levels of microbial contaminants compared with natural beaches and this was not correlated to the type of beach sand at these localities rather it was postulated that hard protection surfaces built to reduce erosion of sand at artificial beaches had the effect of disrupting the natural cleansing processes such as wave action the authors suggest that these artificial beaches require a different management approach to natural beaches to reduce health risks from microbial contaminants in sand and water in microcosm experiments it was observed that the presence of autoclaved beach sediment enhanced the levels of e coli in the water column by two to three orders of magnitude lee et al 2006 in comparison in those microcosms that lacked sediment the e coli levels in the water decreased by three orders of magnitude over the first two days similar to the soil sediment studies in the previous section the researchers postulated that higher organic matter content in sediments and the formation of biofilms in the presence of beach sediments were factors that contributed to the persistence of fib populations in the water column lee et al 2006 in other studies where predators in sediment sand microcosms were not inactivated the fib were noted to persist rather than grow craig et al 2004 hartz et al 2008 lack of growth was attributed to the presence of predators restricting fib numbers and competition with indigenous bacteria for limited nutrient resources an initial increase in e coli concentration within the first 24 h was observed in sandplots inoculated with e coli cells 107 100 g sand beversdorf et al 2007 this initial observation of e coli growth has been reported in marine and freshwater mesocosms inoculated with sewage gilpin et al 2013 and in field survival experiments with wildfowl and cattle feces moriarty et al 2012 sinton et al 2007 the sandplots exposed to environmental conditions with fluctuating temperatures 23 32 c showed the highest e coli cell increases of 100 fold and maintained cell numbers up to 6 days before a gradual decrease in cell density beversdorf et al 2007 the temperature controlled sandplots showed up to a twenty fold increase of e coli with the greatest increase seen at ambient temperature 23 25 c followed by 4 c and 37 c and then 44 5 c no e coli were recovered from sandplots held at either 50 c or 55 c after initial increases the cell densities from sandplots of ambient 4 c and 37 c remained stable up to 2 days before die off compared with lower temperatures the fastest rates of cell density decline were seen at temperatures of 37 c and 44 5 c multiple e coli and enterococci virulence genes including shiga toxin genes and antibiotic resistant genes have been identified in marine sediments in the mediterranean sea potentially pathogenic bacteria carrying these virulence genes have been identified in the sediments of recreational beaches where the overlying seawater complied with recreational water quality guidelines di cesare et al 2014 luna et al 2010 vignaroli et al 2013 vignaroli et al 2012 vignaroli et al 2018 characterization of e coli isolated from venus clams growing in natural beds within the mediterranean sea found that the majority of isolates belonged to the phylogroups a and b1 and one third were resistant to at least one antibiotic with 11 being multidrug resistant vignaroli et al 2016 the prevalence of cryptic clades isolated from clams was 8 with nine of the eleven cryptic clade isolates belonging to clade v and one isolate each belonging to clade iii and iv vignaroli et al 2016 based on concerns about the health risk associated with aquatic sediments sands researchers have recommended including sediment environments in sampling strategies when monitoring water quality international experts convened a workshop to discuss the issues relating to the microbial quality of beach sands and its relationship to public health with a view to developing the standards for the routine evaluation of sand at coastal sites of recreational significance sabino et al 2014 vogel et al 2017 recommendations included that beach sand should be screened for a variety of pathogens known to impact human health and monitoring of sand microbial quality should occur in conjunction with routine water monitoring abreu et al 2016 fujioka et al 2015 romão et al 2017 solo gabriele et al 2016 the reviews of weiskerger et al 2019 and weiskerger and brandão 2020 discuss fib fungi and other pathogens and the role of beach sands in transmission of these pathogens to the general public including the potential resuspension of pathogens into the water column these reviews highlight concerns associated with increased concentrations of pathogens entrained from sediments into the water column due to the effects of climate change such as intensified wave action and higher temperatures facilitating microbial growth these effects could lead to increased health risks for recreational bathers exposed to pathogens resuspended from beach sands supporting the call for monitoring the microbial quality of both water and sand at recreational locations and establishing protocols for quantitative microbial risk assessments weiskerger et al 2019 3 3 fib in the water column and wastewater the understanding that aquatic environments are impacted by fib derived from multiple sources including environmentally adapted naturalized fib has led to better decision making around mitigation strategies and the research required to focus on the best management practices including differentiation of fib strains in environmental samples the e coli budget representing the input of e coli loss and persistence was explored in lake michigan using 7000 e coli observations collected between 2000 and 2014 weiskerger and whitman 2018 this long term dataset afforded the researchers the ability to investigate e coli trends and postulate reasons for decreases in e coli concentrations over time by unraveling a complex and multivariate process they discuss the impacts of wastewater and beach management practices bird control measures hydrometeorological and climate changes and the introduction of invasive quagga mussels to the lake system their main conclusion was that reductions in water clarity due in part to the high densities of the quagga mussels had the greatest impact allowing for sunlight inactivation of e coli leading to reductions in e coli water populations in australia e coli blooms 10 000 cfu 100 ml have been attributed to e coli strains assigned to phylogroups a and b1 with these clonal strains isolated across multiple southeastern australian waterbodies power et al 2005 a week prior to the formation of these e coli blooms the coliform counts in lake water were less than 150 cells 100 ml these particular bloom strains of e coli were not among the 435 e coli isolated from the feces of vertebrates collected from throughout australia power et al 2005 blooms of a clonal e coli b1 strain have been observed in australian waterbodies up to three times a year as reported in the review of gordon 2013 characterization of the genome of the e coli phylotype b1 bloom strain suggested it was closely related to shigella strains rather than typical e coli but that it lacked most of the virulence traits associated with shigella gordon 2013 gordon 2013 and power et al 2005 suggested these bloom strains may represent free living e coli strains that are disconnected from fecal inputs such strains have adapted to the non intestinal environment through expression of survival traits such as capsules which facilitate evasion of predators and protection from desiccation and sunlight inactivation power et al 2005 a whole genome meta analysis was undertaken of e coli isolates n 1294 collected from a variety of environmental avian fecal and meat non human mammalian feces and human sources from diverse locations within australia touchon et al 2020 the e coli included freshwater isolates n 285 from the study of power et al 2005 and revealed insights into the marked genetic differences between the freshwater e coli strains and those from other habitats overall the freshwater e coli isolates had smaller genome sizes compared with the isolates from other habitats although these freshwater genomes of e coli isolates carried the lowest number of mobile genetic elements and lacked plasmids the isolates were identified as having a high level of acquisition and loss of genes the authors suggest that these genomic differences were driven by adaptations to the non enteric environment which included the carriage of a low number of virulence traits and antibiotic resistance genes conversely a high number of gene families associated with capsule biosynthesis were identified in the water isolates which the authors hypothesized were an important adaptation to the aquatic environment touchon et al 2020 the authors concluded that there was strong evidence to suggest that the evolution of e coli is shaped by horizontal gene transfer resulting in adaptations to its niche environments the identification of environmentally adapted e coli strains in canal water suggested that environmental conditions were promoting the survival and proliferation of certain e coli strains in the canals jokinen et al 2019 tymensen et al 2015 e coli isolates from surface water and sediment were differentiated from fecal e coli isolates based on phylotyping by the clermont pcr clermont et al 2013 and comparative accessory gene fingerprinting jokinen et al 2019 tymensen et al 2015 in addition c lari was the campylobacter most commonly isolated from irrigation water compared with animal feces or sediment whereas when the human pathogen c jejuni was identified in canal water it was in association with e coli exceedances high rainfall and land runoff from surrounding agricultural land jokinen et al 2019 e coli belonging to phylogroup b1 were the dominant isolates identified in reservoir water and canals in both studies jokinen et al 2019 tymensen et al 2015 the study of tymensen et al 2015 found that there was no single gene that was able to differentiate the fresh fecal e coli b1 isolates from the environmental b1 isolates initial pcr assays targeted 14 accessory genes but none of those targets were specific to a particular ecotype six of the 14 gene targets however were enriched for either the fecal or environmental ecotypes sediment and water and therefore these six genes were assayed to develop binary presence absence of each gene fingerprints that differentiated the e coli isolates into ecotype specific groups and ecotype enriched groups where 75 of isolates belonged to either the fecal or environmental ecotypes some of these six genes encoded toxin antitoxin genes which are strongly associated with fecal e coli isolates whereas other genes encoded for iron acquisition and biofilm formation traits which are thought to convey an advantage for environmentally adapted e coli strains tymensen et al 2015 this type of study shows that a clear delineation between fecal and environmental ecotypes of e coli phylogroups will be challenging even with sophisticated genetic tools fib play an important role in the detection of potential fecal contamination events in drinking water sources genotypic characterization was undertaken of 28 e coli isolated from chlorinated drinking water distribution plants in australia to identify the source of the isolates and the potential risk to public health blyton and gordon 2017 the investigation included characterization of virulence factors and antibiotic resistant determinants associated with each isolate and based on these criteria four of the 28 isolates were deemed to be potential pathogens nine of the e coli isolates were characterized as belonging to what the researchers termed free living e coli with multiple isolates identified on the same day within the same water distribution network six of these free living isolates were typed as belonging to a commensal e coli phylogroup which had previously been isolated from e coli blooms in australia the authors noted that these free living e coli would be unlikely to pose a human health risk the remainder of the drinking water isolates belonged to e coli phylogroups b1 b2 d and clade i however no other members of the cryptic clades of escherichia were identified in an indian study a strain of e coli was isolated from arsenic contaminated groundwater mohapatra and sar 2018 genomic sequencing revealed a genetic repertoire that enabled this bacterium to survive in the oligotrophic conditions of the groundwater and develop resistance to high concentrations of arsenic and iron found in the arsenic rich groundwaters of india and bangladesh studies of the persistence of fib through the wastewater treatment process have identified resilient fib populations the growth of enterococci in oxidation ponds up to 180 000 100 ml was identified at a wastewater treatment plant in new zealand moriarty et al 2008 antibiotic resistance analysis and genetic subtyping of isolates showed very low population diversity in comparison to the high diversity of enterococcus screened from the wastewater influent and feces from wildfowl residing around the ponds the authors concluded that the highly clonal nature of these enterococcus pond isolates suggested replication of an environmental source of enterococci rather than breakthrough from the wastewater or avian inputs on the basis of these findings the municipal authority was able to remove enterococci concentrations from their discharge conditions and focus on e coli monitoring to ascertain elevated health risks moriarty et al 2008 a canadian wastewater study revealed evidence of stress tolerant chlorine resistant strains of e coli persisting through the municipal wastewater treatment process zhi et al 2016 isolates belonged to e coli phylogroup a and carried genes that increased survivability the authors developed a pcr targeting unique genetic elements in these wastewater specific e coli table 2 and this pcr was negative in the feces of animal hosts further investigation of these strains of e coli using whole genome phylogenetic analysis and including similar strains from wastewater in the us and switzerland revealed that these wastewater strains formed a separate clade to the enteric phylogroups a f of e coli and to the cryptic clades ii v zhi et al 2019 interestingly their genetic repertoire spanned that of both the enteric and cryptic clades in that they shared some biochemical characteristics of the enteric e coli but also had biochemical profiles that are found in the cryptic clades such as biofilm adhesion many of the antibiotic resistance genes identified in the wastewater strains were also represented in the cryptic clade strains including genes for efflux pumps which are important in the transport of other hydrophilic molecules besides antibiotics and may confer an advantage in non host environments in a united states catchment with mixed land use including urban agriculture forest rural septic tanks the prevalence of e coli phylogroups in surface waters was shown to be dominated by phylogroups b1 31 and b2 32 cho et al 2018 there was a low level of antimicrobial resistance detected in the isolates 7 of the 496 e coli isolates tested 20 belonged to pathogenic e coli with the majority being enteropathogenic e coli epec but none of these 20 isolates carried antimicrobial resistance genes the isolation from waterways of e coli carrying virulence genes even when identified at low levels raises concerns about the potential for horizontal gene transfer of virulence traits between bacteria cho et al 2018 davison 1999 wetlands have been advocated in urban and rural settings as natural biofilters for the removal of microbial and nutrient pollutants from point source and diffuse land runoff sources almuktar et al 2018 hsu et al 2017 kaushal et al 2018 kipasika et al 2014 fib have traditionally been employed with varying degrees of success as surrogates to determine the efficiency of pathogen reductions in the water discharged mcminn et al 2019 rusinol et al 2020 in a study of an urban constructed wetland vivant et al 2016 discussed the design of the wetland and maximizing those physical and biological characteristics that contribute to pathogen indicator reductions for example by uv irradiation and the effects of minimizing the impacts of wildlife and seasonal increases in temperature which contribute to microbial growth persistence the authors also noted a decrease in both concentration and diversity of antibiotic resistant e coli as they passaged through the urban wetland suggesting that this wetland design limited the dissemination into surface waters of bla genes associated with the antibiotic resistant e coli vivant et al 2016 a common theme in many recent wetland publications is the role played by animal fecal deposition particularly avian species as a source of both fib and or pathogens as water travels through a wetland hsu et al 2017 in a constructed wetland to treat stormwater discharge meng et al 2018 noted that e coli was a poor indicator of reductions in the pathogen campylobacter and proposed that direct fecal defecation by waterfowl was a source of the discrepancies between bacterial concentrations in the wetland inputs versus the outflows mcminn et al 2019 investigated the effect of wetland treatment on fib concentrations and noted similar concentrations of fib throughout all treatment stages of the constructed wetland human fecal source markers identified in the early stages of the wetland treatment were significantly higher than in the latter stages whilst avian fecal signatures and campylobacter were detected at higher levels in the latter stages of wetland treatment consistent with observed bird activity and postulated fecal inputs the authors suggested that fecal source markers provided more sensitive information on the efficacy of wetlands as treatment centers compared with relying on fib as indicators of fecal contamination another wetland study also identified impacts from avian species in relation to antibiotic resistant e coli isolated from wetland water and from avian feces collected in the vicinity of the wetland sen et al 2019 overall there was similar antibiotic resistance observed in avian fecal and water isolates to 12 of the 13 antibiotics tested statistically similar prevalences of individual e coli phylogroups were identified in fecal and water matrices the water and fecal samples were dominated by the b1 phylogroup at 39 and 37 respectively followed by the b2 phylogroup at 13 and 21 respectively in addition 5 of water samples and 9 of avian fecal samples carried isolates belonging to the escherichia clades iii iv and v the impact of an isolate s origins was studied by berthe et al 2013 to understand the ability of escherichia to survive when released into the water strains were isolated from water bodies human feces and bovine feces and subjected to different survival conditions in microcosm water experiments in general e coli isolates from recent fecal events rapidly lost their culturability in 2 days and most of these were multi resistant to antibiotics and harbored several virulence factors in contrast persistent strains able to survive from 4 to 14 days were more often found in water with low levels of fecal contamination and belonged mainly to the b1 phylogroup these persistent strains were susceptible to the 17 antibiotics tested often harbored only one virulence factor and were able to grow at temperatures as low as 7 c in comparison the b2 strains and the clade v strains were shown to lose their culturability more rapidly 2 days after release into water overall those e coli strains that harbored only one virulence factor were identified as better survivors suggesting that survival is enhanced by reducing energy expended on maintaining virulence traits consistent with the above study was the finding that b1 was the dominant e coli identified in canals used for the irrigation of food crops jokinen et al 2019 tymensen et al 2015 these studies illustrate that some e coli strains derived from fecal inputs have a genomic repertoire that enhances their survival in a non host environment the studies above are examples of how traditonal monitoring of fib is expanding to include a more robust analysis of the e coli and enterococci subpopulations in the water improvements in the interpretation of fib concentrations in relation to water quality leads to the focusing of resources on to those pollution inputs that contribute to a public health risk 3 4 partitioning of fib between the underlying substrate and the water column the water management impacts of sediment resuspension in beaches and in river systems are discussed in relation to fib levels in the water which are potentially derived from the underlying sediment substrate a comprehensive spring summer survey of e coli concentrations at a freshwater lake beach detected mean counts of e coli 100 ml that were consistently higher in foreshore sand 104 than submerged sand 103 and water 102 whitman and nevers 2003 a disconnect between e coli counts in water between consecutive days was noted calling into question the reliance on fib results collected on day one in determining beach closures for day two in addition the practice of replacing foreshore sand each year for the swimming season led to a rapid re colonization of e coli concentrations in the imported sand a synchronous trend of increasing and decreasing e coli counts in the water and sand was observed over the bathing seasons with a gradual increase in e coli concentrations in both matrices the authors attributed this slow increase to physical parameters such as the seasonal rise in air and water temperatures for this locality the authors provided evidence that the water was not concentrating e coli to the sand this evidence included the higher concentrations in sand compared with water and the steady temporal equilibrium between counts in water and sand this seminal study concluded that beach sand has an important role to play in fib levels in water and that the sand rather than acting as a sink for e coli was in fact acting as a source of e coli for the water column above subsequent studies have used genetic analyses of bacterial communities to ascertain the contributions of sediment fib reservoirs to the water column rothenheber and jones 2018 carried out an assessment of enterococci concentrations and fecal sources impacting a watershed that encompassed freshwater estuary and marine beach sites results of bacterial community analyses by metagenomic sequencing indicated that there was a high level of mixing between sediment and the overlying freshwater as 74 of the bacterial communities identified in the freshwater were also identified in the underlying sediments in addition elevated concentrations of enterococci in water were influenced by the type of fecal source input hydrological conditions and environmental sources suggesting that freshwater sediment reservoirs of enterococci were contributing to enterococci levels identified in freshwater readers are referred to the review of weiskerger et al 2019 for a more comprehensive overview of studies of resuspension of fib and pathogens at beach sites and the physical factors including sand composition wind and wave action and rainfall and biological mechanisms such as biofilm formation in sand that contribute to transport of fib within the beach environment in river systems the transport of microbes between the sediment and water column may be a dynamic process that occurs during base river flows as well as during high flow events drummond et al 2015 jeon et al 2020 litton et al 2010 stocker et al 2016 yakirevich et al 2013 it has been hypothesized that continual entrainment of microbes into the water column is due to exchange of water across the sediment water interface in the area beneath and alongside a river bed in the regions where there is mixing of shallow groundwater and surface water grant et al 2011 the scouring effect of these sediment resuspension events have been shown to occur from the top 2 cm depth of the sediment surface with the concentration of e coli decreasing by an order of magnitude between one and three centimetres depth from the top of the sediment smith et al 2019 yakirevich et al 2013 under base flow conditions pachepsky et al 2017 recorded net release rates from sediments of up to 57 and 87 cells m2 s for e coli and enterococci respectively the net release rates reported by pachepsky et al 2017 were used by jeon et al 2020 to estimate efflux levels of e coli of 86 cfu 100 ml which accounted for the observed increases in the water column noted during baseflow periods in their study of a predominantly agricultural zone in a pennsylvanian creek investigation of e coli concentrations and populations in streambeds has increased the understanding of their impacts on sampling strategies during baseflow and storm flow conditions piorkowski et al 2014b stocker et al 2018 spatial variability in sediment with hot spots of high e coli concentration were noted along a creek bed 500 m monitoring length stocker et al 2018 during high flow experiments these hot spots led to an increase in the average e coli sediment levels for the stream reach even when most locations were recording a decrease in e coli sediment levels in another stream study dna fingerprinting of e coli populations revealed that high velocity features in a stream such as riffles and runs had different populations of e coli strains compared with areas of deposition such as pools piorkowski et al 2014b comparing the dna fingerprint profiles of e coli in sediment and downstream water samples brinkmeyer et al 2015 identified that 36 of e coli water isolates had similar dna profiles to the upstream sediment e coli this contribution from upstream sources of e coli and the identified heterogeneity of sediment e coli levels has led to a call for further characterization of these e coli hotspots and their influence on stream reach loads of e coli piorkowski et al 2014b stocker et al 2018 furthermore piorkowski et al 2014b advised that characterizing the population of e coli isolates requires up to 120 isolates per streambed feature to capture the inherent high diversity of e coli strains an amplicon sequencing method which targets the highly recombinant prone gnd 6 phosphogluconate dehydrogenase gene has shown the ability to resolve the high diversity associated with e coli strains and could be a useful tool for future studies to investigate environmental reservoirs of e coli without the requirement for colony isolation cookson et al 2017 during baseflow effective particle sediment size and water velocity were the most important parameters impacting on e coli entrainment into the water column piorkowski et al 2014b in comparison during storm flow organic carbon in the sediment and the median particle diameter of the sediment were also important variables for explaining e coli resuspension many studies have identified that survival and retention reduced hyporheic exchange of fib in sediment has been associated with finer grain sediments higher nutrient and organic matter content in the sediment and lower interstitial water content which decreased e coli efflux into the water brinkmeyer et al 2015 haller et al 2009 jamieson et al 2005 korajkic et al 2019 stocker et al 2018 another study investigating the sources of elevated e coli in an urban environment in lincoln nebraska in the u s attempted to quantify the contribution of environmental sources to the bacterial community of an urban stream under dry and wet weather conditions baral et al 2018 the bacterial community was identified using a 16s rrna amplicon metagenomic approach on water and sediment samples collected from the urban stream and water from an upstream lake urban soils and street sweepings sanitary sewage and local animal and bird fecal samples using sourcetracker bioinformatic analysis the main sources of the microbial community identified in the urban stream were aligned to the upstream lake during dry weather and the wash off from urban streets into storm water during wet conditions during dry weather conditions the streambed sediment was not identified as a significant source of microbes resuspended into the stream baral et al 2018 evaluation of e coli populations in a temperate stream by dna fingerprinting techniques revealed a wide diversity of e coli strains with water populations showing greater diversity compared with sediments chandrasekaran et al 2015 there was however substantial overlap between strains in water and sediments over the two year study the e coli strains displayed annual shifts in their populations although some strains particularly in sediment were identified throughout the study this study and another in a temperate climate have noted that e coli levels in sediments were higher in autumn compared with spring even though sediment temperatures were similar chandrasekaran et al 2015 ishii et al 2007 similar findings of higher fib concentrations in sediment during summer compared with winter conditions were identified in another creek study table 4 stocker et al 2019 the higher concentrations were attributed to e coli populations persisting and accumulating over summer months and becoming a stable part of the sediment microbiota chandrasekaran et al 2015 found the mixing of strains between water and sediment and at different sites along the watercourse supported the findings of other studies which had shown that overland runoff and rainfall high flow events influenced the transport and distribution of e coli ishii et al 2006a piorkowski et al 2014a solo gabriele et al 2000 these researchers highlighted how these factors impact the concentrations observed during monitoring of e coli in the water column chandrasekaran et al 2015 the studies cited above did not include the differentiation of e coli phylogroups from the escherichia cryptic clades but chandrasekaran et al 2015 described the need to develop genetic methods that target e coli from fecal sources and negate contributions from naturalized escherichia to improve assessments of water quality e coli concentrations in agricultural irrigation ponds recorded temporally stable spatial patterns in the water at different locations within the pond and higher concentrations and prevalence in the interior pond sediments compared with the bank sediments table 4 pachepsky et al 2018 in this study it was noted that persistence of e coli in the sediments and the high spatial variability noted in the water highlighted the requirement for careful assessments of where to take samples when monitoring the water quality prior to application of irrigation water to land from the studies discussed above it is apparent that multiple factors affect the decline or persistence of fib once discharged to the aquatic environment and it is likely that the impact of each of these factors will be dependent on the water type and natural environment of the receiving water wanjugi and harwood 2013 it appears clear however that sediments sands from beaches lakes rivers and even irrigation ponds are likely to provide a reservoir for fib which are available for resuspension to the water column during disturbance events such as high rainfall in addition there is growing evidence that entrainment into the water column from sediments can occur under baseflow conditions future studies therefore need to include characterization of the subpopulations of fib sediment loads through genetic methods of analysis to better understand their contribution to the water column this would facilitate differentiation of naturalized fib from both enteric and environmental sources and lead to improvements in public health risk assessments of aquatic environments 3 5 aquatic vegetation as a reservoir for fib aquatic vegetation can provide protection to fib which are susceptible to predation and the harmful effects of uv irradiation and the vegetation may also provide nutrient sources from thallus surface exudates beckinghausen et al 2014 marks and power 2001 mcminn et al 2020 nelson et al 2018 zulkifly et al 2012 3 5 1 the alga cladophora as a reservoir for fib the study of fib associated with macrophytes has mainly focused on the green alga cladophora which inhabits both freshwater and marine environments cladophora colonises rocks and piers where it has a preference for growing on hard substrates in shallow waters dodds and gudder 1992 from these substrates cladophora can break free and form large floating mats it is these mats that were first identified as sources of fib when they washed up on beaches in the great lakes area of north america byappanahalli et al 2003b olapade et al 2006 whitman et al 2003 a study using culture methods and pcr identified pathogens including salmonella and pathogenic e coli species in association with cladophora ishii et al 2006b in contrast a metagenomic investigation using 16s rrna did not identify pathogens or e coli associated with the epiphytic bacterial community of actively growing cladophora zulkifly et al 2012 microcosm studies of the impact of uv irradiation on the interaction of salmonella and e coli with cladophora noted extended survival of the two microbes when associated with the alga suggesting a protective effect provided by the algal mats beckinghausen et al 2014 initial concentrations of e coli underwent a seven log reduction in numbers after six hours in water with no algae present compared with 16 h for the same level of removal in the presence of algae in comparison salmonella showed a higher resistance to die off with and without algal presence with greater persistence in the presence of the algal mats in another study focused on in situ free floating cladophora the e coli concentrations associated with the algal mats were investigated by sampling water underlying the mats adjacent to the mats and at regularly spaced intervals within the mats heuvel et al 2010 concentrations of e coli in the surrounding water 1 0 3 5 log10 mpn 100 ml were significantly lower than in the water beneath the algal mats 3 0 4 0 log10 mpn 100 ml significant positive correlations were identified in concentrations of e coli attached to the algae and e coli in the water underlying the algal mat the concentration gradient of e coli showed that there were higher e coli concentrations at the center of the mat compared to the edges presumably due to the mat s protective influence from the effects of waves and wind a follow up study on the cladophora mats in lake michigan badgley et al 2011 confirmed that algal mats may be a source of e coli to nearby water e coli from the mats n 4000 isolates were collected over a three year timeframe and during multiple three day sampling periods to analyze their population structure using dna fingerprint analyses spatially and temporally over annual periods genetic analysis revealed a high degree of diversity between isolates although 33 of isolates were represented by multiple clonal groups the authors suggested that these clonal populations may represent naturalized groups of e coli that are persisting in the environment and have adapted to survive and replicate within the algal mats badgley et al 2011 e coli isolates were highly related within individual mats when the finer detail of diversity was examined between the mats and over the three day periods for individual mats furthermore there was temporal genetic clustering of isolates when the same mat was examined over a three day period suggesting transient populations that changed on a daily basis together these results reflected a mosaic pattern of e coli strains from a variety of fecal inputs and concurrent populations of naturalized e coli populations the authors concluded that the complex and dynamic pattern of e coli strains makes it difficult to use them as indicators for tracking the source of fecal pollution future studies of algal mats and algal blooms and their implications for water quality could include discrimination of fib subpopulations using the genetic tools described in this review this would facilitate the understanding of the role of non fecal escherichia and enterococcus species in contributing to the increased fib loadings associated with mass gatherings of algae in the water column and dried algal mats washed up on the shores of beaches and lakes 3 5 2 aquatic plants as a reservoir of fib in freshwater and estuarine environments badgley et al 2010a conducted a survey of the concentration and genetic make up of enterococci populations associated with a variety of submerged aquatic vegetation sav sediment and water they noted a decreasing mean density of enterococci concentrations from sav to sediment to water table 4 with a range of genetic diversity from high to low the lowest diversity was noted in lake water during summer they also provided evidence for the persistence of certain enterococci strains that might represent naturalized populations in mesocosm studies badgley et al 2010b studied the effects of submerged macrophytes on enterococci populations they seeded the mesocosms with freshwater populations of sav mostly the plant hydrilla verticillata water and sediment at the time of sampling all matrices had chronically elevated levels of enterococci the concentrations of enterococci were monitored over 14 days in the mesocosms of sediment and water which were seeded with and without sav as in the study of badgley et al 2010a enterococci were observed in the highest densities in the macrophytes compared with sediments and water furthermore the presence of sav was observed to facilitate the persistence of enterococci in the vegetated mesocosms compared with non vegetated mesocosms however when comparing their total mass to water and sediment matrices the contribution of macrophyte associated enterococci was determined to be a minor portion of the entire system the importance of fib associated substrates on water quality concentrations will be location dependent with factors such as the total mass of the substrate reservoirs and the volume of water available for resuspension playing significant roles badgley et al 2010b genotypic typing of the enterococci strains throughout the study revealed that the population was dominated by a single strain of enterococcus casseliflavus this bacterium has commonly been associated with vegetation and waterfowl aarestrup et al 2002 cho et al 2020 kim et al 2020 additionally e casseliflavus was identified as an inhabitant of the lake from which the plant material was sourced for the experiments this naturalized strain of e casseliflavus persisted over the ten month duration of the study suggesting its ability to reproduce in the environment the impact of the aquatic macrophytes sagittaria and myriophyllum on e coli concentrations in freshwater was studied by leewis 2006 an increased e coli concentration was noted in association with macrophyte mats in comparison to the e coli concentrations in water at distances of 2 5 and 10 m from the mats these findings were similar to the cladophora mat experiments of heuvel et al 2010 sediment and vegetation collected from the water surface were investigated as reservoirs of fecal coliforms and enterococci by nguyen et al 2018 similar to badgley et al 2010a these researchers compared the concentration of fib in the wet weight of sediment 100 g or vegetation 100 g with 100 ml of water sample and showed that concentrations in the sediment and vegetation were 1 2 orders of magnitude higher compared with the water adding to the evidence that these matrices act as reservoirs of fib the problems of invasive weed populations in aquatic environments was highlighted in a study of the association between the introduced submerged macrophyte eurasian watermilfoil e coli and bacterial pathogens in north american lakes mathai et al 2019 they identified that the eurasian watermilfoil could harbor elevated densities of e coli and be an agent of dispersal of these and other bacteria in this study molecular methods including pcr markers and dna metagenomic sequencing identified avian pollution as the primary source of the fecal bacteria associated with this invasive weed 3 5 3 periphyton as reservoirs for fib biofilms of periphyton form on submerged substrates and consist of green algae diatoms protozoa and a complex community of microbes including fungi and cyanobacteria li et al 2018 ksoll et al 2007 investigated the contribution of periphyton as reservoirs of fecal coliforms in a freshwater temperate lake in the summer periphyton associated concentrations of fecal coliforms peaked at 105 cfu cm2 using genetic subtyping techniques ksoll et al 2007 determined that waterfowl and sewage were the major fecal sources of the e coli contributing to water samples overlying the periphyton they also identified some e coli strains that persisted over time but could not be attributed to a source postulating that these strains may belong to a group of naturalized e coli as this study was conducted prior to the recognition of the escherichia cryptic clades it is possible that this last subset of e coli could potentially belong to the cryptic clades rather than naturalized e coli moreira et al 2012 isolated strains of e coli from periphyton in freshwater lakes and established that they had enhanced biofilm formation capability when compared with e coli strains isolated from bovine and human fecal sources as noted in other studies moreira et al 2012 suggested that biofilm formation may give persistent e coli strains a selective survival advantage in aquatic environments di sante et al 2018 ingle et al 2011 liang et al 2016 tymensen et al 2015 zhi et al 2019 a mesocosm study measured the interaction of genetic markers between the water column and periphyton in an experimental stream facility subjected to wastewater inputs li et al 2018 the genetic markers targeted e coli enterococci and human fecal markers as seen in the study of stocker et al 2019 for e coli and enterococci table 4 the researchers established that the periphyton can act as environmental reservoirs for these genetic markers and presumably the bacteria they target the net flux shifts between concentrations of each marker in the water inflow compared with the outflow showed that the genetic markers can be resuspended from the periphyton but that partitioning of the markers between the water column and the periphyton is dynamic and complex li et al 2018 the study of fib concentrations in a rural creek over approximately 3 km of its course showed significant correlations between concentrations of e coli in water sediment and periphyton and similar but lower correlations between enterococci and the three matrices stocker et al 2019 there were consistently higher concentrations of fib recovered from periphyton than sediment samples collected in the same location table 4 fib levels in the periphyton were significantly higher in the summer samplings compared with winter and of the three matrices the periphyton showed the highest variability followed by sediment the study concluded that fib survivability was highest in periphyton followed by sediment and then water overall aquatic vegetation can harbor significant loads of fib species in relation to their mass compared with the other matrices sediment and water in aquatic environments and therefore have the potential to contribute significant concentrations of fib to the water column the total mass and resuspension potential of each matrix however needs to be evaluated to determine if these fib harbored by aquatic vegetation will be major contributors to fib water quality monitoring results 3 6 micro invertebrates as an environmental reservoir of microorganisms the identification of microorganisms in micro invertebrates adds another facet to the persistence of fecally derived microbes in the environment with the micro invertebrate hypothesized to act as a trojan horse barker and brown 1994 mcdougald and longford 2020 neogi et al 2014 defines micro invertebrates as organisms mostly in the range of 50 500 µm but up to 5 mm and includes copepods rotifers nematodes protozoa crustacean larvae and some insect larvae as predators micro invertebrates can have a negative influence on the numbers of bacteria as shown by the grazing rates of some in vitro protozoa being estimated at 2000 bacteria ingested per hour macek et al 1997 however some bacteria including pathogens have developed mechanisms to evade predation post ingestion and survive within the micro invertebrate boamah et al 2017 sun et al 2013 evidence now suggests that protozoa such as amoeba can act as vectors of various bacteria including e coli and the pathogens campylobacter and legionella buse and ashbolt 2011 greub and raoult 2004 hasni et al 2020 moreno mesonero et al 2020 another potential transmission route for dissemination of these bacteria could occur when avian species ingest micro invertebrates under these circumstances microorganisms could survive and grow within the micro invertebrates and evade the host s immune system neogi et al 2014 recent evidence suggests that convergent evolution has occurred where pathogens like legionella which originally adapted to micro invertebrate invasion are now primed for virulence in human macrophages hasni et al 2020 neogi et al 2014 park et al 2020 this phenomenon has raised concern because the protozoa and their intracellular bacterial companions are resistant to the chlorine doses used in municipal drinking water sources posing a health risk from the trojan horse carriage of these pathogens codony et al 2012 king et al 1988 shaheen and ashbolt 2018 researchers have observed nematodes feeding on and producing viable and infective forms of the oocysts of cryptosporidium and bacterial pathogens thus acting as vectors of these disease causing organisms anderson et al 2003 huamanchay et al 2004 more recently studies have demonstrated occasions of nematodes ingesting legionella infected amoeba and the subsequent colonization of the nematode intestinal cells by legionella suggesting that nematodes could be another environmental reservoir of pathogenic legionella such as l pneumophila hellinga et al 2015 rasch et al 2016 the intracellular carriage of fib and pathogens by micro invertebrates has implications for all water environments including drinking water reported growth of microorganisms including e coli within these micro invertebrate vectors could lead to the dissemination of fib and pathogens into the water environment once the micro invertebrate decays and the cell wall ruptures resulting in the release of high levels of fib pathogens 3 7 poikilothermic animals as reservoirs for e coli and enterococci poikilothermic animals such as fish snails and frogs have body temperatures that vary in relation to their environment as compared to the homeostatic temperature of mammals or birds in an australian study e coli was isolated from the feces or lower intestinal tract of vertebrates including 12 of the frogs examined n 106 with most of the frog isolates being associated with urban environments gordon and cowling 2003 reptiles such as crocodiles turtles and snakes were also noted to carry e coli with 33 4 and 2 prevalence respectively in the same study e coli was isolated from 10 of the fish examined n 138 gordon and cowling 2003 used the clermont 2000 pcr to characterize the e coli isolates into the four known phylogroups of the time a b1 b2 and d although sample numbers were too low for meaningful statistical analyses the e coli phylogroup b1 was identified as having the highest prevalence in fish frogs and reptiles a recent study identified high levels of e coli and enterococci in the guts of fish frogs and gastropods frick et al 2018 the mean e coli concentration in fish frogs and gastropods snails and slugs ranged between 4 2 and 5 2 log10 cfu g of feces with prevalence ranging from 68 to 85 table 4 enterococci were similarly present with a mean concentration ranging between 3 3 and 5 1 log10 cfu g and a prevalence of 68 to 96 e coli were not identified in earthworms but enterococci were present in low abundance researchers noted the concentrations of fib in these poikilothermic organisms were similar to concentrations isolated from mammals and bird feces in the same study frick et al 2018 they suggest that their findings challenge those of early researchers such as geldreich and clarke 1966 that e coli and enterococci are not permanent members of the fish intestinal flora however geldreich and clarke 1966 did identify that the fib intestinal concentration was dependent on the degree of fecal contamination present in the aquatic environment frick et al 2018 noted that microbial results from waterways identified with low concentrations of fib require careful interpretation as the fib may not be from conventionally recognized fecal pollution sources that study and its conclusions are supported by another investigation of freshwater fish trout eel inanga and bullies in new zealand where e coli and enterococci were recovered from 71 and 76 of fecal samples respectively coxon et al 2019 concentrations of fib although highly variable between individual fish samples reached maximum levels of 2 1 104 e coli and 1 3 106 enterococci g feces furthermore concentrations of fib in the water column were recorded at substantially lower levels for example four orders of magnitude less suggesting potential replication or concentration within the intestinal tract of fish coxon et al 2019 the isolation of e coli and enterococci from poikilothermic organisms such as fish and reptiles prompts the question of whether these aquatic organisms are providing an intestinal habitat for colonization of fib and thus acting as a reservoir in aquatic environments another possibility is that the isolated fib are members of a transient microbial community ingested from water and passing through the gut of these aquatic species geldreich and clarke 1966 noted that fib concentrations were not stably maintained as colonizers of fish intestines unless there was a continuous source of fecal contamination in the water if recent research establishes that fib are colonizing the gut of fish species rather than transiting the gut this evidence would raise additional questions it would be relevant to ask whether colonization of fib in aquatic organisms is as a result of ongoing high levels of fecal contamination in our chronically polluted aquatic environments this premise would change the original view that fib are not a normal part of the fish intestinal flora as observed by geldreich 1966 this again raises the validity of fib as indicators of mammalian fecal contamination inputs to our waterways future research should identify if fib populations within aquatic species are diverse or made up of certain clonal strains such as e coli phylogroup b1 which is often identified as a persistent phylogroup isolated from waterways jokinen et al 2019 tymensen et al 2015 furthermore e coli b1 was identified in the earlier study of gordon and cowling 2003 as the main phylogroup in poikilothermic animals another question is whether the escherichia cryptic clades colonize the fish intestine thereby suggesting that poikilothermic species may act as an unidentified fecal reservoir for these naturalized escherichia 4 conclusions and recommendations for future research the fib belonging to the genera escherichia and enterococcus are widely identified in on non host environments including soil sediment and aquatic vegetation including algae their widespread presence in the environment has the potential to confound water quality monitoring which is typically based on fib as indicators of fecal contamination recent evidence suggests that fib may be part of the microbiota of some aquatic organisms research is required to investigate whether the original hypothesis that e coli and enterococci do not colonize the guts of aquatic organisms such as reptiles and fish remains valid in the chronically polluted waters of current environments if fib are colonizing the intestine of aquatic organisms then these organisms are acting as fecal reservoirs for fib with the potential to impact conventional water quality monitoring genomic studies have revealed that there are two groups of naturalized fib consisting of those defecated into the environment and able to persist under favourable conditions indicators of non recent fecal inputs and those that are ancient relatives of e coli or enterococci lineages and naturally inhabit the environmental reservoirs of waterways this latter group is identified as fib by conventional water testing methods but because they are not derived from a fecal contamination event are not correlated with health risk for enterococci there are many different species and some of those species are truly environmental while there is also evidence to suggest that some enteric enterococci species such as e faecalis have strains that have adapted their genome to an environmental non host lifestyle genes have been identified in enterococci that may be targets for differentiation of the enteric from naturalized enterococci further research is required to validate these enterococci biomarkers in the case of the escherichia genus there are two different types of naturalized bacteria which have the potential to confound water quality monitoring one type of naturalized escherichia are represented by the eight phylogroups of e coli and are derived from a mammalian avian fecal origin these naturalized e coli are able to survive post defecation in the environment and reside in reservoirs such as soil and river sediment where they may replicate within these phylogroups the b1 group has been identified as the most prevalent e coli phylogroup in environmental reservoirs the other type of naturalized escherichia termed cryptic clades are identified as e coli using conventional e coli water quality testing methods but in fact belong to separate species within the escherichia genus typical biochemical tests used to differentiate e coli from other escherichia species do not distinguish these naturalized escherichia cryptic clades from e coli escherichia cryptic clades have been rarely identified in human clinical or mammalian fecal specimens and have low levels of antibiotic resistance and few virulence genes these findings suggest that cryptic clades are likely to be poor indicators of pathogens derived from fecal sources additional studies on fecal sources are required to determine the environmental reservoirs of escherichia cryptic clades including aquatic poikilothermic species avian and feral animals in the search for biomarkers that distinguish between fib adapted to environmental versus enteric habitats it is important to determine whether the environmentally associated strains have the ability to switch between their environmental reservoirs and the enteric environment by expressing genes required for either lifestyle or whether those genes are absent from their genome advances in whole genome sequencing and metagenomic assays will aid the identification of genes peculiar or enriched in particular ecotypes that enable discrimination between the enteric and naturalized fib naturalized fib that originate from a non recent fecal contamination event may be associated with fecal pathogens that also endure in sediments pathogens such as cryptosporidium are able to persist as hardy oocysts and may potentially be infectious post defecation when harbored in soil and sediments naturalized fib derived from a fecal input therefore may still represent a health risk declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

17573,in tropical to temperate environments fecal indicator bacteria fib such as enterococci and escherichia coli can persist and potentially multiply far removed from their natural reservoir of the animal gut fib isolated from environmental reservoirs such as stream sediments beach sand and vegetation have been termed naturalized fib in addition recent research suggests that the intestines of poikilothermic animals such as fish may be colonized by enterococci and e coli and therefore these animals may contribute to fib concentrations in the aquatic environment naturalized fib that are derived from fecal inputs into the environment and subsequently adapted to maintain their population within the non host environment are termed naturalized enteric fib in contrast an additional theory suggests that some naturalized fib diverged from enteric fib many millions of years ago and are now normal inhabitants of the environment where they are referred to as naturalized non enteric fib in the case of the escherichia genus the naturalized non enteric members are identified as e coli during routine water quality monitoring an over estimation of the health risk could result when these naturalized non enteric fib that is not derived from avian or mammalian fecal contamination contribute to water quality monitoring results it has been postulated that these environmental fib belonging to the genera escherichia and enterococcus can be differentiated from enteric fib by genetic methods because they lack some of the genes required for colonization of the host intestine and have acquired genes that aid survival in the environment advances in molecular tools such as next generation sequencing will aid the identification of genes peculiar or enriched in particular habitats to discriminate between enteric and environmental fib in this appraisal we have reviewed the research studying naturalized fib and discussed the techniques for their differentiation from enteric fib this differentiation includes the important distinction between enteric fib derived from fresh and non recent fecal inputs and those truly non enteric environmental microbes which are currently identified as fib during routine water quality monitoring the inclusion of tools for the identification of naturalized fib enteric or environmental would be a valuable resource for future studies assessing water

such as swimming and boating are an important part of the lifestyle in western countries with over 60 of the united states population engaging in water sports deflorio barker et al 2018 these activities however come with a substantial economic cost due to the burden of associated waterborne illnesses caused by pathogenic microorganisms deflorio barker et al 2017 deflorio barker et al 2018 fecal contamination of recreational waters is a major source of pathogens that cause waterborne disease korajkic et al 2018 there are however many constraints associated with the detection of pathogens in water contaminated by feces these constraints include the high cost of pathogen testing intermittent carriage of pathogens by an animal community and the technical difficulties of detecting the low concentration of pathogens usually present in water soller et al 2010 wu et al 2011 as a result most water monitoring schemes use the identification of indicators of fecal inputs as a surrogate to pathogen detection in fresh untreated sewage e coli and enterococci are considered good indicators of potential risk to human health from fecal pathogens because they are present in high concentrations in the feces of mammals sadowsky and whitman 2011 usepa 1996 after discharge of sewage into the aquatic environment however the relationship between these fecal indicator bacteria fib and the pathogens of concern may change due to a range of factors such as dilution water flow characteristics and survival of the pathogens in the environment ahmed et al 2018 boehm et al 2018 boehm et al 2015 devane et al 2014 nelson et al 2018 the ability to determine the presence of pathogens in aquatic environments using fecal microbial indicators has been investigated by researchers with mixed results for indicator pathogen correlations using both traditional fib and microbial source tracking mst markers korajkic et al 2018 examined over 73 studies conducted within a 40 year time span and corroborated the views of many researchers and reviewers who have noted that no single indicator is sufficient to predict all pathogens bacteria viruses and protozoa most recreational water quality criteria rwqc are based on scientific conclusions drawn from the relationship between concentrations of culturable fecal indicator bacteria and rates of gastrointestinal illness gi attributed to recreational water activities strachan et al 2012 thoe et al 2018 wade et al 2003 in international epidemiological studies enterococci have been recognized as better predictors of gi illness in marine waters than e coli wade et al 2008 wade et al 2006 wade et al 2010 and more recently also recognized as suitable predictors for freshwaters usepa 2012 in many situations however the efficacy of fib as indicators of health risk from fecal contamination has been questioned particularly where the dominant sources of fecal microbes in water has changed from high levels of contamination related to human fecal inputs to lower levels of diffuse pollution from a range of non human and human sources evans et al 2019 fujioka et al 2015 point sources of fecal contamination such as wastewater from municipal sewage treatment plants generally result in very high levels of fib which are more readily identified compared with diffuse pollution sources devane et al 2014 non point sources of diffuse pollution such as leaking sewer pipes or septic tanks wildlife sources and agricultural land runoff may represent lower but persistent concentrations of fib elevated above guideline concentrations these diffuse sources may be a mixture of recent and aged fecal inputs which are difficult to trace and require more sophisticated genetic and chemical tools for tracking the source of fecal contamination devane et al 2018 hagedorn et al 2011 teixeira et al 2020 tran et al 2015 in addition to the above factors the role of fib as indicators of water quality has been debated due to research revealing their growth and or persistence in the environment jang et al 2017 mulugeta et al 2012 teixeira et al 2020 walk 2015 whitman et al 2014 whitman et al 2006 fib are no longer considered to be exclusively found in the gut of warm blooded animal hosts with a short survival time once excreted into the environment frick et al 2018 when fecal coliforms including e coli were first proposed as a method of assessing water quality it was thought that fecal coliforms were only able to survive and replicate in the homeostatic intestinal environment of their animal host geldreich 1966 replication of fib in water environments was considered unlikely because ambient temperatures ranged from 4 to 25 c and nutrient status was in continual flux geldreich 1966 when the survival of fib in the environment was first reported studies were limited to tropical areas where higher temperatures were suggested as aiding their survival and growth byappanahalli and fujioka 1998 jimenez et al 1989 however further work established the same trend for the persistence of indicator bacteria in subtropical environments anderson et al 2005 desmarais et al 2002 solo gabriele et al 2000 and temperate environments byappanahalli et al 2003a ishii et al 2006a mclellan 2004 whitman and nevers 2003 table 1 these ground breaking studies showed the ability of fib to persist and replicate in the environment under nutrient regimes and temperatures not previously thought credible by scientists and led to the terms naturalized e coli and enterococci it was recognized that identification of these environmentally adapted fib as part of a water quality monitoring program could overestimate the health risk from fecal pathogens which are usually associated with fresh fecal sources however identification of naturalized fecal fib associated with non recent fecal inputs may still indicate a health risk from pathogens persisting in the aquatic environment this circumstance was noted in the study of an urban river receiving major raw sewage discharges over six months where the concentrations of cryptosporidium and giardia were found to be higher in the sediments after the discharges ceased devane et al 2014 in this scenario no cryptosporidium and reduced concentrations of giardia were found in the overlying water post discharge illustrating that there can be a potential risk from pathogens persisting in sediments which are disconnected from recent fecal inputs in the last decades with the advent of whole genome analysis of bacteria other sources of naturalized fib have been proposed that are not derived from fecal sources non fecal fib these true environmental strains may only now be recognized as different to enteric enterococcus and e coli due to new sequencing technologies which allow a greater understanding of the thousands of genes present in each of these microorganisms he et al 2018 walk 2015 it is postulated that some naturalized fib diverged from enteric fib many millions of years ago and are currently natural inhabitants of the environment jang et al 2017 staley et al 2014 walk 2015 walk et al 2009 weigand et al 2014 this latter group containing non e coli members of the escherichia genus and the environmental enterococci are still identified as belonging to the fib by conventional biochemical testing and water quality monitoring methods byappanahalli et al 2012a he et al 2018 jang et al 2017 walk 2015 walk et al 2009 in the case of the escherichia genus many conventional water quality testing methods enumerate e coli by targeting its ß d glucuronidase activity bej et al 1991 maheux et al 2015 shadix and rice 1991 other species in the escherichia genus however have been identified that also possess this enzyme activity and test positive using conventional methods thereby potentially confounding interpretations of water quality by overestimating the risk to recreational users deng et al 2014 genetic technologies are being developed that enable discrimination of the enteric fib from naturalized non enteric escherichia and enterococcus species discrimination of these naturalized species has been proposed based on the absence of genes required for colonization of the host intestine and the acquisition of genes that aid survival in the post excretion environment luo et al 2011 weigand et al 2014 in this review research investigating naturalized sources of fib and their identification as fecal indicators is discussed examining whether overestimates of health risk occur during routine water quality monitoring the review describes the important distinction between those enteric fib derived from fresh and non recent fecal inputs and those truly non fecal non enteric environmental microbes which are currently identified as fib using conventional water quality monitoring tests it discusses environmental non fecal reservoirs sources of fib and highlights research into genetic techniques for discriminating between fecal fib and naturalized fib both enteric and environmental and suggests the areas where research is required to advance the development and understanding of these genetic tools for future environmental studies 1 1 search engines and keywords for this literature review the following search engines were used to search for keywords relevant to this review on

indicator bacteria 2 1 the escherichia genus escherichia have previously been characterized as containing the six different species e coli e albertii e fergusonii e blattae e hermannii and e vulneris alm et al 2011 as reviewed by alm et al 2011 and chaudhuri and henderson 2012 this classification was based on dna dna hybridization studies and phenotypic analyses subsequent analyses of nucleotide sequences of 16s ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid rdna and housekeeping genes has suggested that the escherichia genus should only contain the three species e coli e albertii e fergusonii which form a monophyletic lineage recently in china an escherichia strain was isolated from the feces of a marmot and showed 99 2 homology to e coli 16s rrna sharing 70 dna dna hybridization with other species of escherichia these findings led to the proposal that it is a novel species e marmotae within the escherichia genus liu et al 2019 liu et al 2015 it is recognized that the species e coli has extensive genetic diversity chaudhuri and henderson 2012 touchon et al 2020 the average e coli genome contains approximately 4700 genes but only 2000 of these genes are conserved between members of the e coli species and represent the core genome tenaillon et al 2010 the additional genes represent a genome of high plasticity allowing for environmental adaptations through the acquisition and loss of multiple genes whole genome analysis has revealed that this turnover of genes is largely driven by the transfer of mobile genetic elements touchon et al 2020 clermont et al 2000 designed a triplex polymerase chain reaction pcr method for assigning e coli to four phylogenetic groups a b1 b2 and d this pcr system was subsequently updated to include three new phylogenetic groups identified by genomic data and to recognize the novel escherichia cryptic clades i v clermont et al 2013 the escherichia cryptic clades are discussed in detail in the next section recently an additional phylogroup g has been proposed clermont et al 2019 lu et al 2016 therefore the species members of e coli sensu stricto strictly belonging to the species escherichia coli are currently recognized as forming eight main phylogenetic groups a b1 b2 c d e f and g clermont et al 2015 clermont et al 2019 touchon et al 2020 these eight phylogroups are known to reside primarily in the gut of animals and there is evidence to suggest they are involved in distinct ecological roles smati et al 2015 tenaillon et al 2010 for example in the developed world b2 has been recognized as the dominant phylogroup in human feces whereas in general e coli in the animal microbiota are dominated by phylogroup b1 ambrosi et al 2019 vadnov et al 2017 subsequently the focus is changing from pcr characterization to using whole genome sequencing wgs to identify microbial species and strains clermont et al 2015 beghain et al 2018 have developed an in silico method for phylotyping the escherichia genus called the clermontyper and they have made this free web resource accessible to the scientific community current identification of e coli strains present in a sample requires isolation of the colony before wgs which is labor intensive and costly future studies will incorporate culture independent techniques which target genes that can investigate the inherent diversity of e coli and provide greater resolution of the fecal e coli microbiota cookson et al 2017 2 1 1 cryptic clades of escherichia in addition to the known eight phylogenetic groups for e coli strains a study using multilocus sequence typing mlst identified five novel clades designated clades i to v of escherichia walk et al 2009 clades are a phylogenetically distinct group derived from a common ancestor the original escherichia cryptic clades were isolated from freshwater beaches by standard methods used by the u s environmental protection agency for fib in recreational waters usepa 2000 walk 2015 walk et al 2007 initially the escherichia clades were thought to be encompassed by the e coli species criterion due to their lack of phenotypic differentiation from e coli using traditional biochemical testing methods alm et al 2011 walk et al 2007 the putative environmental clades of escherichia have been shown to be phenotypically and taxonomically indistinguishable to the enteric e coli isolates using the standardized api20e identification system biomerieux inc and the bbl crystal identification system becton dickinson and company walk et al 2009 the β d glucuronidase gene used to confirm e coli in many culture and genetic based water quality tests was also found to be 92 to 100 positive in all of the cryptic clade isolates n 24 deng et al 2014 comparison of the cryptic clade 16s rdna profiles with those of e coli sensu stricto confirmed their identity as e coli walk et al 2009 in addition walk et al 2009 identified that only the phenotypic profile of clade iii was statistically different from the e coli phenotype due to the inability of clade iii isolates to ferment sucrose and sorbitol and utilize lysine the term escherichia cryptic clades was used to re classify the clades i to v because of their lack of phenotypic differentiation from e coli using traditional biochemical profiles but their divergence from e coli when applying genetic techniques walk et al 2009 analysis of sequence databases of e coli strains has infrequently turned up members of the clades i v walk et al 2009 these databases have a major focus on strains isolated from human fecal samples and therefore are representative of clinically relevant e coli to the exclusion of other habitats which remain under sampled walk 2015 walk et al 2009 for example in a multi center study of patients n 1081 with e coli bacteremia two clade v and one clade iii strains were isolated corroborating their low pathogen potential 0 3 of e coli isolates clermont et al 2011 lefort et al 2011 the low prevalence of cryptic clades in current databases of e coli suggests they may not be indicative of fecal contamination when identified in waterways genomic sequencing of a range of enteric and environmental escherichia isolates revealed that while they all shared a core set of approximately 2000 genes there were genes that were either specific to or highly represented in either the escherichia cryptic clades or enteric e coli groups luo et al 2011 for example enteric e coli had specific functional genes related to the transport and acquisition of nutrients abundant in the gut e g gluconate in contrast the functions of genes specific to the escherichia cryptic clades were related to survival in a non enteric environment such as enzymes that aid the hydrolysis of bacterial cell walls these findings have been supported by a comparative microarray dna dna hybridization study which identified bacterial adhesion genes in enteric e coli important for host colonization by both pathogenic and commensal intestinal isolates oh et al 2012 the phenotypes of the majority of enteric e coli are positive for the catabolism of lysine and ornithine clermont et al 2011 in the case of the escherichia cryptic clades the isolates were identified as being negative for lysine and or ornithine catabolism providing phenotypic traits that distinguished them from the enteric e coli clermont et al 2011 the exception to this is clade i where the majority of isolates were positive for catabolism of both ornithine and lysine strains of clade i were also shown to be genotypically very close to enteric e coli and therefore could be classified as enteric bacteria deng et al 2014 luo et al 2011 further work identified a heat labile toxin from members of clade i isolated from clinical cases of diarrhea with carriage of this virulence factor distinguishing them as enterotoxigenic e coli etec and confirming their status as enteric escherichia isolates with pathogenic potential steinsland et al 2010 walk 2015 the review of walk 2015 outlines other studies where escherichia clade i isolates have been identified in human cases of gastroenteritis and provides further discussion regarding whether clade i should be recognized as a subspecies of e coli comparison of the dna dna hybridization and average nucleotide identity scores used to designate species determination provides evidence that clades iii and iv are subspecies of a novel escherichia species while clade v is a separate novel member of the escherichia genus walk 2015 in the case of clade ii more in depth sequence analysis is required before any such species designations can be postulated for this rarely isolated strain walk 2015 classification however is dynamic and with regards to clade v two isolates of the avirulent clade v from the study of luo et al 2011 clustered with the novel escherichia species e marmotae isolated from the feces of the marmot liu et al 2019 in comparison as discussed in walk 2015 clades iii and iv were well differentiated from the other escherichia species liu et al 2019 recent phylogenetic and phenotypic analysis provides evidence for the incorporation of clades iii and iv as the two subspecies in a novel escherichia species e ruysiae which was originally isolated from the feces of a person who had travelled to asia van der putten et al 2020 interestingly despite subsequent attempts to re isolate the e ruysiae from the human case it was only recovered on a single occasion hinting that carriage and excretion from the human gut was transient van der putten et al 2020 a study investigating the virulence potential of the putative escherichia cryptic clades observed that they were poor competitors in gut colonization compared with the enteric e coli strains ingle et al 2011 furthermore although these escherichia cryptic clades carried a varied range of virulence factors they including five clade v isolates were not found to be virulent in mouse models of extraintestinal infection and were reported to be uncommon isolates from vertebrate hosts all of these factors suggested they could be opportunistic pathogens rather than true inhabitants of the intestine ingle et al 2011 other important characteristics differentiating the cryptic clades from enteric e coli isolates include enhanced ability to form biofilms and low levels of antibiotic resistance ingle et al 2011 they also have a lower temperature growth tolerance of 5 c compared with 11 c for the majority of e coli whilst maintaining optimal growth temperatures of 41 42 c similar to other members of the escherichia genus ingle et al 2011 moreira et al 2012 their low occurrence in clinical settings and in vertebrate hosts and low level of antibiotic resistance and virulence factors supports the hypothesis that the cryptic clades ii v are not highly pathogenic but rather opportunistic pathogens as reviewed by walk 2015 gene expression studies of growth and starvation conditions by vital et al 2015 noted differential expression between clades iv and v and two commensal e coli strains during starvation conditions up regulation of genes related to stress responses was noted for cryptic clade strains which potentially allowed faster adaptations to poor nutrient environments external to the host intestinal niche di sante et al 2018 investigated the environmental survival strategy of biofilm formation by comparing the escherichia cryptic clades and a commensal e coli k12 intestinal strain and their abilities to produce extracellular matrices when exposed to unfavorable conditions of low temperature and nutrient deprivation clades iii iv and v strains but not the commensal strain were able to produce curli fimbriae and cellulose to form an extracellular matrix di sante et al 2018 this extracellular matrix is postulated to assist biofilm formation and adherence to abiotic surfaces thus acting as a potential survival mechanism in non host environments these survival mechanisms potentially increase the fitness of cryptic clade species for exploiting non host environments ingle et al 2011 in a study investigating the virulence features of clades iii v that had been isolated from coastal marine sediments 20 of the 138 putative e coli isolates were classified as belonging to the environmental escherichia cryptic clades vignaroli et al 2015 seventeen of these 20 environmental escherichia were susceptible to antimicrobials and they all lacked the enteroaggregative e coli pathotype virulence genes in addition 60 were positive for a gene encoding an enterotoxin east1 and 70 for group ii capsule production genes toxin and capsule production have been noted as bacterial strategies for surviving environmental conditions with benefits including reduced competition from other microorganisms in the case of toxins and desiccation and sunlight irradiation protection afforded by a capsule costerton et al 1995 power et al 2005 valerio et al 2010 tissue culture adhesion and invasion assays using the caco2 and int407 mammalian intestinal cell lines were performed on eight of the environmental escherichia cryptic clade isolates each varying in their gene content vignaroli et al 2015 clade v displayed the highest adhesion properties similar to intestinal strains but none of the cryptic clades showed the ability to invade the intestinal cell lines tested the authors have suggested a dual role for clade v where it has adapted to the environment but retains the ability for an intestinal lifestyle with the potential for expression of virulence traits vignaroli et al 2015 this assertion has gained support from the study of liu et al 2019 where phylogenetic analysis of whole genome sequence data indicated clustering of fecal e marmotae strains with environmental clade v isolates from the study of luo et al 2011 identification of virulence genes including enterotoxin east1 in these e marmotae fecal strains and their positive cell invasion albeit at markedly lower levels than shigella strains suggest their potential as invasive pathogens liu et al 2019 the study of vignaroli et al 2015 also identified a potential environmental biomarker pduc which encodes a propanediol hydratase and was statistically significantly associated with but not exclusive to the environmental escherichia cryptic clades it is important to have methods that discriminate between e coli and the naturalized escherichia cryptic clades to avoid classifying waterways as non compliant where non fecal sources of escherichia are contributing to conventional e coli water testing fig 1 and table 2 the quadruplex pcr of clermont et al 2013 with additional pcr updates in clermont et al 2019 for identification of phylogroup g enable initial screening of putative e coli isolates into eight phylogroups but also into non specific groupings of the escherichia cryptic clades for example one amplicon in the quadruplex clermont et al 2013 pcr detects members of clades iii iv and v the clades can then be further differentiated into individual clade designations by the specific pcr markers developed by clermont et al 2011 these allele specific pcrs target the aes gene and the dna fragment chua to obtain discrimination between all five cryptic clades e coli isolates previously subtyped by clermont et al 2000 and then retyped by the pcr method of clermont et al 2013 reported low reclassification rates 8 14 for human e coli isolates but 54 reclassification for avian pathogenic e coli isolates logue et al 2017 this revision included some e coli 1 that were retyped from a or b2 to cryptic clade i logue et al 2017 another comparative analysis of e coli isolates re typed by the clermont et al 2013 method identified that more human isolates and less avian isolates required re classification in comparison to the study of logue et al 2017 emphasizing differences between host environments starčič erjavec et al 2017 these researchers also noted a higher number of non typable nt isolates in their study and suggested the need to identify novel host environments where these nt e coli reside so that whole genome analyses can be performed and new phylotyping schemes developed for nt isolates starčič erjavec et al 2017 it should be noted that neither of these comparative studies reclassified e coli phylogroups to any of the clade ii v groups the findings of these studies using the new pcr tools for re classification adds to the evidence that the cryptic clades ii v are present at low frequency in e coli culture collections other researchers are investigating pcr methods for differentiating between naturalized escherichia and enteric e coli as pcr would provide the most efficient genetic classification system for water managers table 2 deng et al 2014 identified a gene that is likely to be important for the enteric population of e coli to survive the intestinal environment and proposed that identification of the putative glucosyltransferase gene ycjm in e coli may confirm a recent fecal origin however there was not a clear delineation because although ycjm was identified in 97 of 398 of clinical and fecal e coli isolates from animals and birds it was also identified in 28 of the isolates of the escherichia clades ii v however the ycjm marker was an improvement on pcrs that target the β d glucuronidase gene as an identifier of e coli where 92 of cryptic clade isolates were positive deng et al 2014 a pcr method incorporating the dye propidium monoazide pma to target only viable bacteria has also been investigated using a modification of the ycjm gene target of deng et al 2014 to differentiate e coli from the non e coli false positives yuan et al 2018 the attempt to reduce the number of false positives for e coli detection 96 specificity for ycjm in drinking and environmental waters showed statistically comparable results between pma qpcr e coli levels and standard culturable methods yuan et al 2018 however turbidity was an issue and pretreatment of water samples was suggested prior to analysis a pcr targeting the ybbw gene a putative allantoin transporter gene was developed that reported 100 specificity and sensitivity for e coli when tested against closely related species including four other escherichia species and shigella walker et al 2017 in environmental waters there was a log linear relationship between e coli counts in the water and the copy number of ybbw measured by the pcr assay further investigations with this ybbw marker in a qpcr method has also demonstrated 100 specificity with e coli compared to 22 other enteric bacterial species mcquillan and wilson 2019 but its specificity against the escherichia cryptic clades remains to be determined if this pcr marker excludes the cryptic clades it could overcome the issue of concurrent detection with e coli during water quality monitoring 2 1 2 habitats for escherichia cryptic clades identification of clades iii v in australia united states and puerto rico by extended mlst suggest a wide geographic representation for the environmental escherichia cryptic clades walk et al 2009 there is growing evidence of the presence of the escherichia clades ii v in the feces of avian and feral animals and to date clade v has been the most abundant of the environmental escherichia cryptic clades isolated blyton et al 2015 clermont et al 2011 vignaroli et al 2015 table 3 presents the geographical locations and environmental animal habitats where escherichia cryptic clades have been identified the identification of the escherichia clades ii v as better adapted to the non intestinal environments of water soil freshwater beach sand and sediment has led researchers to develop the environmental hypothesis walk 2015 based on their extremely low prevalence in host associated culture collections especially from clinical sources it has been hypothesized that the cryptic clades are more abundant in and better adapted to habitats outside the host compared with inside the host excluding clade i walk 2015 this environmental hypothesis supports the comparative genomic analyses which have revealed genes conserved in enteric strains such as genes important for adhesion to the gut wall which are not present in environmental strains luo et al 2011 oh et al 2012 a study of the prevalence of the cryptic clades isolated from duck pond water and duck feces provided support for the environmental hypothesis table 3 walk 2015 the study identified cryptic clade isolates in the pond water but not in the duck feces additional research however is required to establish whether wildlife represent a spillover host for clades ii v due to transient passage and proximity of wildlife to water sources or if these animals are a reservoir for the cryptic clades alonso et al 2017 walk 2015 there are few sampling studies that have genotypically characterized escherichia coli isolates from various non animal environments however further analyses will be assisted with additional testing of escherichia isolates using pcr and in silico wgs culture independent techniques beghain et al 2018 clermont et al 2013 clermont et al 2011 cookson et al 2017 fig 1 presents a decision tree for a sampling protocol to differentiate putative naturalized escherichia either naturalized e coli or escherichia cryptic clade isolates from fecal inputs of e coli application of this sampling protocol to waterways where the putative elevated e coli levels detected during conventional water quality monitoring are suspected to be derived from non recent fecal inputs could determine the prevalence of escherichia cryptic clades within the aquatic environment in addition identification of clonally related subtypes of a particular e coli phylogroup that is numerically dominant in a sediment sample may be indicative of a naturalized e coli strain that has adapted to the non host environment and is either persisting or replicating within the sediment brinkmeyer et al 2015 liang et al 2016 shelton et al 2014 studies of the environmental reservoirs of escherichia are discussed in further detail in section 3 including recent studies that have differentiated e coli phylogroups from escherichia cryptic clade isolates 2 2 the enterococcus genus members of the enterococcus genus were formerly included in the genus streptococcus until 1984 when nucleic acid hybridization studies revealed that they were only distantly related to other streptococcus members as reviewed in byappanahalli et al 2012a a new genus enterococcus was therefore created with 36 currently known species divided into five groups enterococcus are gram positive spherical ovoid cells arranged in chains or in pairs they are non spore formers facultative anaerobes and defined by a temperature growth range of 10 to 45 c and their ability to grow in sodium chloride 6 5 and high ph 9 6 conditions facklam et al 2002 sherman 1937 these factors together with their resistance to bile acids and desiccation enable them to be robust survivors in post intestinal environments aarestrup et al 2002 staley et al 2014 as reviewed by byappanahalli et al 2012a most enterococcus species are identified in an animal habitat including that of humans and in the gut of insects the yellow pigmented species of e casseliflavus and e mundtii have been predominantly associated with environmental sources such as plants and soil but also as pathogenic to humans aarestrup et al 2002 collins et al 1986 collins et al 1984 the predominant enterococci species identified in animal and human intestinal environments are e faecalis and e faecium these are also the most commonly identified environmental species see the reviews of ogier and serror 2008 staley et al 2014 and garcia solache and rice 2019 in terms of water quality monitoring it is important to be able to differentiate between those enterococci associated with environmental matrices such as plants and soils and those that are derived from fecal habitats it is difficult to differentiate between these categories as some enterococci could be normal inhabitants or environmental contaminants from fecal sources aarestrup et al 2002 badgley et al 2010a during an evaluation of the european bathing water directive standard methods for enumeration of intestinal enterococci tiwari et al 2018 found that 93 of confirmed isolates were identified as either e faecalis or e faecium using partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene environmental enterococci including e gallinarum and e casseliflavus were also identified at all bathing sites albeit in low numbers both of these enterococci species have also been identified in the feces of gull species fogarty et al 2003 evaluation of genome sequencing of enterococci isolates from enteric environments identified specific gene signatures for carbohydrate utilization of sugars such as xylose which are prevalent in the gut weigand et al 2014 the genome of 11 isolates of enterococcus faecalis collected from freshwater environments were compared with these enteric strains of e faecalis weigand et al 2014 identified putative habitat specific strains of enterococci where the environmental and enteric strains could not be differentiated by traditional phenotypic tests or by genetic tests using dna dna hybridization or 16s rdna sequencing pathogenicity islands pai however were identified as a common feature in the genome of enteric enterococci but not environmental isolates pai contain sequences which allow insertion deletion into chromosomes and thus horizontal gene transfer between bacterial genomes and pai are known to encode virulence genes and aid host colonization mecsas and strauss 1996 genomic evidence presented by weigand et al 2014 suggests that the extra enteric strains may predate the enteric strains meaning that enterococci originated as environmental strains these environmental strains then adapted to an enteric environment by acquisition of accessory metabolic functions for example via pathogenicity islands this work is supported by lebreton et al 2017 who used molecular clock estimations in conjunction with phenotypic and environmental characterization to investigate the ancestral linkages of enterococci starling 2017 they identified that enterococci were potentially associated with sediments in marine habitats prior to the association of enterococci with land animal hosts lebreton et al 2017 suggested that carbohydrate uptake and utilization genes have been major drivers in the differentiation of the enterococcus into diverse species as they adapted to the unique intestinal environments of a particular land animal host properties that facilitate the importance of enterococci as significant multidrug resistant pathogens in hospital acquired infections include their ability to acquire mobile elements and innate resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants due to a hardened cell wall lebreton et al 2017 postulated that the enterococci s hardened cell wall was a product of natural selection within the marine environment in response to environmental stresses and enabled them to adapt to the transition from marine to terrestrial animals where gut microflora encountered cycles of starvation and desiccation post excretion before re entering the terrestrial animal food chain another study exploring the genetic differences between the enteric and environmental enterococci noted that virulence and antibiotic resistance genes were more commonly identified in enterococci derived from clinical settings compared with strains isolated from marine sediments di cesare et al 2014 in particular the virulence gene esp important in host colonization and biofilm formation fisher and phillips 2009 was only identified in clinical isolates the nickel uptake operon was however identified as a potential biomarker for environmental enterococci because of its almost exclusive presence in environmental enterococci di cesare et al 2014 it was suggested that deletion of this operon in the enteric environment may not be disadvantageous because nickel is present in much higher concentrations in the intestine compared with freshwater environments di cesare et al 2014 also identified a gene in the enterococci isolated from marine sediments which conferred resistance to copper and suggested its presence may be related to industrial pollution outputs in the adriatic sea environment the field of comparative genomics between enterococci isolated from clinical and non clinical environments has continued to reveal insights into differences in genetic adaptations he et al 2018 in a study of 78 genomes of enterococcus faecalis which included isolates from water and enteric strains the water isolates had the lowest predicted open reading frame size and smallest genome sizes whereas there were no significant differences between enteric strains from blood feces and urine he et al 2018 this study identified 84 genes that were specific to the water isolates 28 of those genes were present in all water isolates including the genes involved in the cobalt and the nickel transport system supporting the finding of di cesare et al 2014 that the nickel uptake operon could be a target for the identification of environmental enterococci the number of antibiotic resistance genes in enterococci isolated from blood were significantly higher compared with those from water or dairy products furthermore a high number of environment specific genes were identified that did not have a known cellular function genomic studies are finding that the natural habitat from which the enterococci are isolated contributes to shaping the genome of the bacterium allowing it to adapt to its environment he et al 2018 zhong et al 2019 future studies may allow for genetic methods to specifically target environmentally adapted enterococci and discriminate them from the enteric enterococci this would significantly enhance water quality monitoring enabling targeting of enterococci derived from fecal contamination sources rather than the free living enterococci 3 environmental reservoirs of fib many reviews have documented that the fecal indicators e coli and enterococci can occur in the absence of fresh fecal inputs as part of the microbiota in sediments soil and sand terrestrial and aquatic plants and algal mats byappanahalli et al 2012a jang et al 2017 nevers et al 2014 teixeira et al 2020 whitman et al 2014 tables 1 and 4 although these fib are sourced from historical fecal inputs these environmental reservoirs can also be important sources of environmentally persistent pathogens in recreational areas with potential for human health impacts mackowiak et al 2018 sabino et al 2014 solo gabriele et al 2016 weiskerger and brandão 2020 weiskerger et al 2019 genotypic and phenotypic studies in various climates have shown that populations of e coli and enterococci isolated from soils and sand cluster by geographic location into distinct but diverse groups such clustering especially at the genotypic level suggests that fib in the natural environment come from multiple sources but have sufficiently diverged from animal and bird fecal sources in the same geographical location for the fib to no longer be considered of recent fecal origin byappanahalli et al 2012c fujioka and byappanahalli 2001 ishii et al 2006a perchec merien and lewis 2013 furthermore genetic typing studies have identified where the e coli populations in environmental reservoirs such as sediment provided evidence of clonal populations and thus environmental replication ibekwe et al 2011 ksoll et al 2007 this has led to the term naturalized or environmental enteric fib populations which are capable of persistence and or replication in the post defecation environment perchec merien and lewis 2013 staley et al 2014 whitman et al 2014 therefore identification of fib that indicate fresh sources of fecal inputs with concomitant high probability of pathogen presence requires the understanding of the science related to survival and persistence of inputs of fib from aged fecal sources many of the studies that follow discuss enterococci and e coli persistence in the environment without differentiating either between fib as derived from aged fecal sources or the non fecal non enteric sources of fib future studies will be able to incorporate the genetic tools identified in this review to differentiate the fib populations in these habitats to explore their derivation and relevance to health risk assessments 3 1 fib in soil and sediments many rivers particularly those in catchments prone to erosion have the potential to store enteric indicators and pathogens in their sediments with concomitant public health impacts if sediment resuspension events occur abia et al 2017 abia et al 2016 devane et al 2019 drummond et al 2015 enteric pathogens and e coli were evaluated for survival in sediment microcosm experiments in flow chambers to simulate their survival in riverbeds abia et al 2016 the researchers concluded that river sediments can provide a favorable environment for both enteric pathogens and indicators depending on temperature parameters e coli and salmonella sp were noted to survive longer at 4 c whereas vibrio cholerae had the greatest persistence of all tested microbes at 20 c and 30 c in sediment abia et al 2016 growth and persistence of fib was observed in sediment microcosms obtained from a swiss freshwater lake pote et al 2009 low temperatures 10 c and low organic matter content in the sediment negatively impacted fib concentrations intact sediment cores collected from a swiss freshwater lake contained fib levels ranging between 105 and 107 colony forming units cfu 100 g dry weight haller et al 2009 the cores were stored at 4 c for 90 days and persistence of e coli and enterococci up to 90 days in the top surface layer 2 cm depth was noted at concentrations between 104 and 105 cfu 100 g dry sediment mesocosm experiments using sediment and water collected from a river system in florida revealed growth of enterococci and e coli under conditions of simulated tidal influence with wetting and drying phases desmarais et al 2002 in hawaiian soils soil moisture nutrient conditions and indigenous soil bacteria were identified by byappanahalli and fujioka 2004 as limiting factors influencing the growth of e coli but to a lesser extent enterococci in this tropical environment they still observed slow and sporadic replication of fib which allowed fib to establish as a minor fraction of the soil microbiota other studies have confirmed the importance of higher levels of organic matter 1 0 and fine sediment silt and clay for facilitating the survival of fib in sediment and soil brinkmeyer et al 2015 desmarais et al 2002 garzio hadzick et al 2010 lee et al 2006 stocker et al 2018 liang et al 2016 identified that the surface properties of e coli isolated from stream sediments were different to the e coli isolated from stream water and that differences in habitat had a regulating effect on the expression of surface properties such as hydrophobicity and the production of extracellular polymeric substances eps the hydrophobicity of stream sediment e coli was noted to be significantly higher these changes in eps content may be advantageous for persistence of the e coli cells by aiding cell adhesion and biofilm formation in the stream sediments one of the first studies to investigate whether there are any habitat preferences between phylogroups of e coli used single nucleotide polymorphism qpcr to differentiate the four phylogroups of e coli b1 b2 d and e dusek et al 2018 these researchers studied e coli prevalence in soil under different land use types in the u s to determine if soil and landscape characteristics impacted phylogroup survival and distribution a high prevalence of e coli was identified in both forest soils and pastureland however core genome analysis of isolates did not identify any cryptic clades of escherichia the phylogroup b1 was the dominant e coli identified in soils phylogroups b1 and e were more commonly associated with pasturelands while phylogroups b2 and d had a greater association with wooded areas and more acidic soils dusek et al 2018 pathogenic salmonella species have been identified as surviving in estuarine bank sediments with comparable persistence to e coli suggesting that e coli could be a useful indicator of the survival of this pathogen in estuary environments siddiqee et al 2018 pathogen survival was investigated in fresh and stored one year sediments from storage tanks of storm water treatment plants to ascertain the risk to human health from redistributing the sediment to land sałata et al 2018 some fresh sediments from the storm water treatment plants did contain pathogens including salmonella and fecal enterococci highlighting a potential hazard if they were applied to agricultural land in contrast stored sediments were not identified as containing the above pathogens or e coli or shigella the authors suggest that with increasing quantities of sediment from storm water facilities there is a need for guidelines on the levels of microbes that may represent a biological hazard if such sediments are applied directly to land with the recognition of the persistence in sediments and soils of fecal microbes derived from anthropogenic pollutants investigations of environmental reservoirs are now focusing on the persistence and prevalence of pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes in waterways and their correlation with fib barron et al 2018 brown et al 2019 devane et al 2014 vignaroli et al 2018 the impact of fib in sediments and soils and their correlation with pathogen presence warrants further investigations to facilitate recommendations for water scientists on the management of these environmental reservoirs 3 2 fib in beach sands wave activity and the resuspension of beach sands may affect fib levels weiskerger et al 2019 in a study of californian marine beach sands lee et al 2006 observed levels of enterococci at 104 mpn 100 g wet sediment in enclosed beaches where the intensity of wave activity was low this level of enterococci in sediment was two to three orders of magnitude higher than levels at eleven open beaches where the authors postulate that wave activity led to increases in resuspension and transportation of enterococci seaward in contrast the relationship between e coli concentrations in sediment was less clear when comparing open and enclosed beaches as levels of e coli in sediment were similar at both beach types an extreme weather event in portugal in 2010 resulted in flash floods and mudslides which caused severe impacts including to recreational beaches in the archipelago of madeira levels of e coli and enterococci in beach sand at eight of these beaches in the madeira archipelago were increased with higher concentrations for enterococci compared with e coli over the three months following the storm abreu et al 2016 romão et al 2017 in subsequent months removal of debris and the repair of damaged infrastructure such as sewer lines were important actions for reducing the microbial contaminant load fib mycelial fungi and yeast at these beaches it was observed however that artificial beaches had higher levels of microbial contaminants compared with natural beaches and this was not correlated to the type of beach sand at these localities rather it was postulated that hard protection surfaces built to reduce erosion of sand at artificial beaches had the effect of disrupting the natural cleansing processes such as wave action the authors suggest that these artificial beaches require a different management approach to natural beaches to reduce health risks from microbial contaminants in sand and water in microcosm experiments it was observed that the presence of autoclaved beach sediment enhanced the levels of e coli in the water column by two to three orders of magnitude lee et al 2006 in comparison in those microcosms that lacked sediment the e coli levels in the water decreased by three orders of magnitude over the first two days similar to the soil sediment studies in the previous section the researchers postulated that higher organic matter content in sediments and the formation of biofilms in the presence of beach sediments were factors that contributed to the persistence of fib populations in the water column lee et al 2006 in other studies where predators in sediment sand microcosms were not inactivated the fib were noted to persist rather than grow craig et al 2004 hartz et al 2008 lack of growth was attributed to the presence of predators restricting fib numbers and competition with indigenous bacteria for limited nutrient resources an initial increase in e coli concentration within the first 24 h was observed in sandplots inoculated with e coli cells 107 100 g sand beversdorf et al 2007 this initial observation of e coli growth has been reported in marine and freshwater mesocosms inoculated with sewage gilpin et al 2013 and in field survival experiments with wildfowl and cattle feces moriarty et al 2012 sinton et al 2007 the sandplots exposed to environmental conditions with fluctuating temperatures 23 32 c showed the highest e coli cell increases of 100 fold and maintained cell numbers up to 6 days before a gradual decrease in cell density beversdorf et al 2007 the temperature controlled sandplots showed up to a twenty fold increase of e coli with the greatest increase seen at ambient temperature 23 25 c followed by 4 c and 37 c and then 44 5 c no e coli were recovered from sandplots held at either 50 c or 55 c after initial increases the cell densities from sandplots of ambient 4 c and 37 c remained stable up to 2 days before die off compared with lower temperatures the fastest rates of cell density decline were seen at temperatures of 37 c and 44 5 c multiple e coli and enterococci virulence genes including shiga toxin genes and antibiotic resistant genes have been identified in marine sediments in the mediterranean sea potentially pathogenic bacteria carrying these virulence genes have been identified in the sediments of recreational beaches where the overlying seawater complied with recreational water quality guidelines di cesare et al 2014 luna et al 2010 vignaroli et al 2013 vignaroli et al 2012 vignaroli et al 2018 characterization of e coli isolated from venus clams growing in natural beds within the mediterranean sea found that the majority of isolates belonged to the phylogroups a and b1 and one third were resistant to at least one antibiotic with 11 being multidrug resistant vignaroli et al 2016 the prevalence of cryptic clades isolated from clams was 8 with nine of the eleven cryptic clade isolates belonging to clade v and one isolate each belonging to clade iii and iv vignaroli et al 2016 based on concerns about the health risk associated with aquatic sediments sands researchers have recommended including sediment environments in sampling strategies when monitoring water quality international experts convened a workshop to discuss the issues relating to the microbial quality of beach sands and its relationship to public health with a view to developing the standards for the routine evaluation of sand at coastal sites of recreational significance sabino et al 2014 vogel et al 2017 recommendations included that beach sand should be screened for a variety of pathogens known to impact human health and monitoring of sand microbial quality should occur in conjunction with routine water monitoring abreu et al 2016 fujioka et al 2015 romão et al 2017 solo gabriele et al 2016 the reviews of weiskerger et al 2019 and weiskerger and brandão 2020 discuss fib fungi and other pathogens and the role of beach sands in transmission of these pathogens to the general public including the potential resuspension of pathogens into the water column these reviews highlight concerns associated with increased concentrations of pathogens entrained from sediments into the water column due to the effects of climate change such as intensified wave action and higher temperatures facilitating microbial growth these effects could lead to increased health risks for recreational bathers exposed to pathogens resuspended from beach sands supporting the call for monitoring the microbial quality of both water and sand at recreational locations and establishing protocols for quantitative microbial risk assessments weiskerger et al 2019 3 3 fib in the water column and wastewater the understanding that aquatic environments are impacted by fib derived from multiple sources including environmentally adapted naturalized fib has led to better decision making around mitigation strategies and the research required to focus on the best management practices including differentiation of fib strains in environmental samples the e coli budget representing the input of e coli loss and persistence was explored in lake michigan using 7000 e coli observations collected between 2000 and 2014 weiskerger and whitman 2018 this long term dataset afforded the researchers the ability to investigate e coli trends and postulate reasons for decreases in e coli concentrations over time by unraveling a complex and multivariate process they discuss the impacts of wastewater and beach management practices bird control measures hydrometeorological and climate changes and the introduction of invasive quagga mussels to the lake system their main conclusion was that reductions in water clarity due in part to the high densities of the quagga mussels had the greatest impact allowing for sunlight inactivation of e coli leading to reductions in e coli water populations in australia e coli blooms 10 000 cfu 100 ml have been attributed to e coli strains assigned to phylogroups a and b1 with these clonal strains isolated across multiple southeastern australian waterbodies power et al 2005 a week prior to the formation of these e coli blooms the coliform counts in lake water were less than 150 cells 100 ml these particular bloom strains of e coli were not among the 435 e coli isolated from the feces of vertebrates collected from throughout australia power et al 2005 blooms of a clonal e coli b1 strain have been observed in australian waterbodies up to three times a year as reported in the review of gordon 2013 characterization of the genome of the e coli phylotype b1 bloom strain suggested it was closely related to shigella strains rather than typical e coli but that it lacked most of the virulence traits associated with shigella gordon 2013 gordon 2013 and power et al 2005 suggested these bloom strains may represent free living e coli strains that are disconnected from fecal inputs such strains have adapted to the non intestinal environment through expression of survival traits such as capsules which facilitate evasion of predators and protection from desiccation and sunlight inactivation power et al 2005 a whole genome meta analysis was undertaken of e coli isolates n 1294 collected from a variety of environmental avian fecal and meat non human mammalian feces and human sources from diverse locations within australia touchon et al 2020 the e coli included freshwater isolates n 285 from the study of power et al 2005 and revealed insights into the marked genetic differences between the freshwater e coli strains and those from other habitats overall the freshwater e coli isolates had smaller genome sizes compared with the isolates from other habitats although these freshwater genomes of e coli isolates carried the lowest number of mobile genetic elements and lacked plasmids the isolates were identified as having a high level of acquisition and loss of genes the authors suggest that these genomic differences were driven by adaptations to the non enteric environment which included the carriage of a low number of virulence traits and antibiotic resistance genes conversely a high number of gene families associated with capsule biosynthesis were identified in the water isolates which the authors hypothesized were an important adaptation to the aquatic environment touchon et al 2020 the authors concluded that there was strong evidence to suggest that the evolution of e coli is shaped by horizontal gene transfer resulting in adaptations to its niche environments the identification of environmentally adapted e coli strains in canal water suggested that environmental conditions were promoting the survival and proliferation of certain e coli strains in the canals jokinen et al 2019 tymensen et al 2015 e coli isolates from surface water and sediment were differentiated from fecal e coli isolates based on phylotyping by the clermont pcr clermont et al 2013 and comparative accessory gene fingerprinting jokinen et al 2019 tymensen et al 2015 in addition c lari was the campylobacter most commonly isolated from irrigation water compared with animal feces or sediment whereas when the human pathogen c jejuni was identified in canal water it was in association with e coli exceedances high rainfall and land runoff from surrounding agricultural land jokinen et al 2019 e coli belonging to phylogroup b1 were the dominant isolates identified in reservoir water and canals in both studies jokinen et al 2019 tymensen et al 2015 the study of tymensen et al 2015 found that there was no single gene that was able to differentiate the fresh fecal e coli b1 isolates from the environmental b1 isolates initial pcr assays targeted 14 accessory genes but none of those targets were specific to a particular ecotype six of the 14 gene targets however were enriched for either the fecal or environmental ecotypes sediment and water and therefore these six genes were assayed to develop binary presence absence of each gene fingerprints that differentiated the e coli isolates into ecotype specific groups and ecotype enriched groups where 75 of isolates belonged to either the fecal or environmental ecotypes some of these six genes encoded toxin antitoxin genes which are strongly associated with fecal e coli isolates whereas other genes encoded for iron acquisition and biofilm formation traits which are thought to convey an advantage for environmentally adapted e coli strains tymensen et al 2015 this type of study shows that a clear delineation between fecal and environmental ecotypes of e coli phylogroups will be challenging even with sophisticated genetic tools fib play an important role in the detection of potential fecal contamination events in drinking water sources genotypic characterization was undertaken of 28 e coli isolated from chlorinated drinking water distribution plants in australia to identify the source of the isolates and the potential risk to public health blyton and gordon 2017 the investigation included characterization of virulence factors and antibiotic resistant determinants associated with each isolate and based on these criteria four of the 28 isolates were deemed to be potential pathogens nine of the e coli isolates were characterized as belonging to what the researchers termed free living e coli with multiple isolates identified on the same day within the same water distribution network six of these free living isolates were typed as belonging to a commensal e coli phylogroup which had previously been isolated from e coli blooms in australia the authors noted that these free living e coli would be unlikely to pose a human health risk the remainder of the drinking water isolates belonged to e coli phylogroups b1 b2 d and clade i however no other members of the cryptic clades of escherichia were identified in an indian study a strain of e coli was isolated from arsenic contaminated groundwater mohapatra and sar 2018 genomic sequencing revealed a genetic repertoire that enabled this bacterium to survive in the oligotrophic conditions of the groundwater and develop resistance to high concentrations of arsenic and iron found in the arsenic rich groundwaters of india and bangladesh studies of the persistence of fib through the wastewater treatment process have identified resilient fib populations the growth of enterococci in oxidation ponds up to 180 000 100 ml was identified at a wastewater treatment plant in new zealand moriarty et al 2008 antibiotic resistance analysis and genetic subtyping of isolates showed very low population diversity in comparison to the high diversity of enterococcus screened from the wastewater influent and feces from wildfowl residing around the ponds the authors concluded that the highly clonal nature of these enterococcus pond isolates suggested replication of an environmental source of enterococci rather than breakthrough from the wastewater or avian inputs on the basis of these findings the municipal authority was able to remove enterococci concentrations from their discharge conditions and focus on e coli monitoring to ascertain elevated health risks moriarty et al 2008 a canadian wastewater study revealed evidence of stress tolerant chlorine resistant strains of e coli persisting through the municipal wastewater treatment process zhi et al 2016 isolates belonged to e coli phylogroup a and carried genes that increased survivability the authors developed a pcr targeting unique genetic elements in these wastewater specific e coli table 2 and this pcr was negative in the feces of animal hosts further investigation of these strains of e coli using whole genome phylogenetic analysis and including similar strains from wastewater in the us and switzerland revealed that these wastewater strains formed a separate clade to the enteric phylogroups a f of e coli and to the cryptic clades ii v zhi et al 2019 interestingly their genetic repertoire spanned that of both the enteric and cryptic clades in that they shared some biochemical characteristics of the enteric e coli but also had biochemical profiles that are found in the cryptic clades such as biofilm adhesion many of the antibiotic resistance genes identified in the wastewater strains were also represented in the cryptic clade strains including genes for efflux pumps which are important in the transport of other hydrophilic molecules besides antibiotics and may confer an advantage in non host environments in a united states catchment with mixed land use including urban agriculture forest rural septic tanks the prevalence of e coli phylogroups in surface waters was shown to be dominated by phylogroups b1 31 and b2 32 cho et al 2018 there was a low level of antimicrobial resistance detected in the isolates 7 of the 496 e coli isolates tested 20 belonged to pathogenic e coli with the majority being enteropathogenic e coli epec but none of these 20 isolates carried antimicrobial resistance genes the isolation from waterways of e coli carrying virulence genes even when identified at low levels raises concerns about the potential for horizontal gene transfer of virulence traits between bacteria cho et al 2018 davison 1999 wetlands have been advocated in urban and rural settings as natural biofilters for the removal of microbial and nutrient pollutants from point source and diffuse land runoff sources almuktar et al 2018 hsu et al 2017 kaushal et al 2018 kipasika et al 2014 fib have traditionally been employed with varying degrees of success as surrogates to determine the efficiency of pathogen reductions in the water discharged mcminn et al 2019 rusinol et al 2020 in a study of an urban constructed wetland vivant et al 2016 discussed the design of the wetland and maximizing those physical and biological characteristics that contribute to pathogen indicator reductions for example by uv irradiation and the effects of minimizing the impacts of wildlife and seasonal increases in temperature which contribute to microbial growth persistence the authors also noted a decrease in both concentration and diversity of antibiotic resistant e coli as they passaged through the urban wetland suggesting that this wetland design limited the dissemination into surface waters of bla genes associated with the antibiotic resistant e coli vivant et al 2016 a common theme in many recent wetland publications is the role played by animal fecal deposition particularly avian species as a source of both fib and or pathogens as water travels through a wetland hsu et al 2017 in a constructed wetland to treat stormwater discharge meng et al 2018 noted that e coli was a poor indicator of reductions in the pathogen campylobacter and proposed that direct fecal defecation by waterfowl was a source of the discrepancies between bacterial concentrations in the wetland inputs versus the outflows mcminn et al 2019 investigated the effect of wetland treatment on fib concentrations and noted similar concentrations of fib throughout all treatment stages of the constructed wetland human fecal source markers identified in the early stages of the wetland treatment were significantly higher than in the latter stages whilst avian fecal signatures and campylobacter were detected at higher levels in the latter stages of wetland treatment consistent with observed bird activity and postulated fecal inputs the authors suggested that fecal source markers provided more sensitive information on the efficacy of wetlands as treatment centers compared with relying on fib as indicators of fecal contamination another wetland study also identified impacts from avian species in relation to antibiotic resistant e coli isolated from wetland water and from avian feces collected in the vicinity of the wetland sen et al 2019 overall there was similar antibiotic resistance observed in avian fecal and water isolates to 12 of the 13 antibiotics tested statistically similar prevalences of individual e coli phylogroups were identified in fecal and water matrices the water and fecal samples were dominated by the b1 phylogroup at 39 and 37 respectively followed by the b2 phylogroup at 13 and 21 respectively in addition 5 of water samples and 9 of avian fecal samples carried isolates belonging to the escherichia clades iii iv and v the impact of an isolate s origins was studied by berthe et al 2013 to understand the ability of escherichia to survive when released into the water strains were isolated from water bodies human feces and bovine feces and subjected to different survival conditions in microcosm water experiments in general e coli isolates from recent fecal events rapidly lost their culturability in 2 days and most of these were multi resistant to antibiotics and harbored several virulence factors in contrast persistent strains able to survive from 4 to 14 days were more often found in water with low levels of fecal contamination and belonged mainly to the b1 phylogroup these persistent strains were susceptible to the 17 antibiotics tested often harbored only one virulence factor and were able to grow at temperatures as low as 7 c in comparison the b2 strains and the clade v strains were shown to lose their culturability more rapidly 2 days after release into water overall those e coli strains that harbored only one virulence factor were identified as better survivors suggesting that survival is enhanced by reducing energy expended on maintaining virulence traits consistent with the above study was the finding that b1 was the dominant e coli identified in canals used for the irrigation of food crops jokinen et al 2019 tymensen et al 2015 these studies illustrate that some e coli strains derived from fecal inputs have a genomic repertoire that enhances their survival in a non host environment the studies above are examples of how traditonal monitoring of fib is expanding to include a more robust analysis of the e coli and enterococci subpopulations in the water improvements in the interpretation of fib concentrations in relation to water quality leads to the focusing of resources on to those pollution inputs that contribute to a public health risk 3 4 partitioning of fib between the underlying substrate and the water column the water management impacts of sediment resuspension in beaches and in river systems are discussed in relation to fib levels in the water which are potentially derived from the underlying sediment substrate a comprehensive spring summer survey of e coli concentrations at a freshwater lake beach detected mean counts of e coli 100 ml that were consistently higher in foreshore sand 104 than submerged sand 103 and water 102 whitman and nevers 2003 a disconnect between e coli counts in water between consecutive days was noted calling into question the reliance on fib results collected on day one in determining beach closures for day two in addition the practice of replacing foreshore sand each year for the swimming season led to a rapid re colonization of e coli concentrations in the imported sand a synchronous trend of increasing and decreasing e coli counts in the water and sand was observed over the bathing seasons with a gradual increase in e coli concentrations in both matrices the authors attributed this slow increase to physical parameters such as the seasonal rise in air and water temperatures for this locality the authors provided evidence that the water was not concentrating e coli to the sand this evidence included the higher concentrations in sand compared with water and the steady temporal equilibrium between counts in water and sand this seminal study concluded that beach sand has an important role to play in fib levels in water and that the sand rather than acting as a sink for e coli was in fact acting as a source of e coli for the water column above subsequent studies have used genetic analyses of bacterial communities to ascertain the contributions of sediment fib reservoirs to the water column rothenheber and jones 2018 carried out an assessment of enterococci concentrations and fecal sources impacting a watershed that encompassed freshwater estuary and marine beach sites results of bacterial community analyses by metagenomic sequencing indicated that there was a high level of mixing between sediment and the overlying freshwater as 74 of the bacterial communities identified in the freshwater were also identified in the underlying sediments in addition elevated concentrations of enterococci in water were influenced by the type of fecal source input hydrological conditions and environmental sources suggesting that freshwater sediment reservoirs of enterococci were contributing to enterococci levels identified in freshwater readers are referred to the review of weiskerger et al 2019 for a more comprehensive overview of studies of resuspension of fib and pathogens at beach sites and the physical factors including sand composition wind and wave action and rainfall and biological mechanisms such as biofilm formation in sand that contribute to transport of fib within the beach environment in river systems the transport of microbes between the sediment and water column may be a dynamic process that occurs during base river flows as well as during high flow events drummond et al 2015 jeon et al 2020 litton et al 2010 stocker et al 2016 yakirevich et al 2013 it has been hypothesized that continual entrainment of microbes into the water column is due to exchange of water across the sediment water interface in the area beneath and alongside a river bed in the regions where there is mixing of shallow groundwater and surface water grant et al 2011 the scouring effect of these sediment resuspension events have been shown to occur from the top 2 cm depth of the sediment surface with the concentration of e coli decreasing by an order of magnitude between one and three centimetres depth from the top of the sediment smith et al 2019 yakirevich et al 2013 under base flow conditions pachepsky et al 2017 recorded net release rates from sediments of up to 57 and 87 cells m2 s for e coli and enterococci respectively the net release rates reported by pachepsky et al 2017 were used by jeon et al 2020 to estimate efflux levels of e coli of 86 cfu 100 ml which accounted for the observed increases in the water column noted during baseflow periods in their study of a predominantly agricultural zone in a pennsylvanian creek investigation of e coli concentrations and populations in streambeds has increased the understanding of their impacts on sampling strategies during baseflow and storm flow conditions piorkowski et al 2014b stocker et al 2018 spatial variability in sediment with hot spots of high e coli concentration were noted along a creek bed 500 m monitoring length stocker et al 2018 during high flow experiments these hot spots led to an increase in the average e coli sediment levels for the stream reach even when most locations were recording a decrease in e coli sediment levels in another stream study dna fingerprinting of e coli populations revealed that high velocity features in a stream such as riffles and runs had different populations of e coli strains compared with areas of deposition such as pools piorkowski et al 2014b comparing the dna fingerprint profiles of e coli in sediment and downstream water samples brinkmeyer et al 2015 identified that 36 of e coli water isolates had similar dna profiles to the upstream sediment e coli this contribution from upstream sources of e coli and the identified heterogeneity of sediment e coli levels has led to a call for further characterization of these e coli hotspots and their influence on stream reach loads of e coli piorkowski et al 2014b stocker et al 2018 furthermore piorkowski et al 2014b advised that characterizing the population of e coli isolates requires up to 120 isolates per streambed feature to capture the inherent high diversity of e coli strains an amplicon sequencing method which targets the highly recombinant prone gnd 6 phosphogluconate dehydrogenase gene has shown the ability to resolve the high diversity associated with e coli strains and could be a useful tool for future studies to investigate environmental reservoirs of e coli without the requirement for colony isolation cookson et al 2017 during baseflow effective particle sediment size and water velocity were the most important parameters impacting on e coli entrainment into the water column piorkowski et al 2014b in comparison during storm flow organic carbon in the sediment and the median particle diameter of the sediment were also important variables for explaining e coli resuspension many studies have identified that survival and retention reduced hyporheic exchange of fib in sediment has been associated with finer grain sediments higher nutrient and organic matter content in the sediment and lower interstitial water content which decreased e coli efflux into the water brinkmeyer et al 2015 haller et al 2009 jamieson et al 2005 korajkic et al 2019 stocker et al 2018 another study investigating the sources of elevated e coli in an urban environment in lincoln nebraska in the u s attempted to quantify the contribution of environmental sources to the bacterial community of an urban stream under dry and wet weather conditions baral et al 2018 the bacterial community was identified using a 16s rrna amplicon metagenomic approach on water and sediment samples collected from the urban stream and water from an upstream lake urban soils and street sweepings sanitary sewage and local animal and bird fecal samples using sourcetracker bioinformatic analysis the main sources of the microbial community identified in the urban stream were aligned to the upstream lake during dry weather and the wash off from urban streets into storm water during wet conditions during dry weather conditions the streambed sediment was not identified as a significant source of microbes resuspended into the stream baral et al 2018 evaluation of e coli populations in a temperate stream by dna fingerprinting techniques revealed a wide diversity of e coli strains with water populations showing greater diversity compared with sediments chandrasekaran et al 2015 there was however substantial overlap between strains in water and sediments over the two year study the e coli strains displayed annual shifts in their populations although some strains particularly in sediment were identified throughout the study this study and another in a temperate climate have noted that e coli levels in sediments were higher in autumn compared with spring even though sediment temperatures were similar chandrasekaran et al 2015 ishii et al 2007 similar findings of higher fib concentrations in sediment during summer compared with winter conditions were identified in another creek study table 4 stocker et al 2019 the higher concentrations were attributed to e coli populations persisting and accumulating over summer months and becoming a stable part of the sediment microbiota chandrasekaran et al 2015 found the mixing of strains between water and sediment and at different sites along the watercourse supported the findings of other studies which had shown that overland runoff and rainfall high flow events influenced the transport and distribution of e coli ishii et al 2006a piorkowski et al 2014a solo gabriele et al 2000 these researchers highlighted how these factors impact the concentrations observed during monitoring of e coli in the water column chandrasekaran et al 2015 the studies cited above did not include the differentiation of e coli phylogroups from the escherichia cryptic clades but chandrasekaran et al 2015 described the need to develop genetic methods that target e coli from fecal sources and negate contributions from naturalized escherichia to improve assessments of water quality e coli concentrations in agricultural irrigation ponds recorded temporally stable spatial patterns in the water at different locations within the pond and higher concentrations and prevalence in the interior pond sediments compared with the bank sediments table 4 pachepsky et al 2018 in this study it was noted that persistence of e coli in the sediments and the high spatial variability noted in the water highlighted the requirement for careful assessments of where to take samples when monitoring the water quality prior to application of irrigation water to land from the studies discussed above it is apparent that multiple factors affect the decline or persistence of fib once discharged to the aquatic environment and it is likely that the impact of each of these factors will be dependent on the water type and natural environment of the receiving water wanjugi and harwood 2013 it appears clear however that sediments sands from beaches lakes rivers and even irrigation ponds are likely to provide a reservoir for fib which are available for resuspension to the water column during disturbance events such as high rainfall in addition there is growing evidence that entrainment into the water column from sediments can occur under baseflow conditions future studies therefore need to include characterization of the subpopulations of fib sediment loads through genetic methods of analysis to better understand their contribution to the water column this would facilitate differentiation of naturalized fib from both enteric and environmental sources and lead to improvements in public health risk assessments of aquatic environments 3 5 aquatic vegetation as a reservoir for fib aquatic vegetation can provide protection to fib which are susceptible to predation and the harmful effects of uv irradiation and the vegetation may also provide nutrient sources from thallus surface exudates beckinghausen et al 2014 marks and power 2001 mcminn et al 2020 nelson et al 2018 zulkifly et al 2012 3 5 1 the alga cladophora as a reservoir for fib the study of fib associated with macrophytes has mainly focused on the green alga cladophora which inhabits both freshwater and marine environments cladophora colonises rocks and piers where it has a preference for growing on hard substrates in shallow waters dodds and gudder 1992 from these substrates cladophora can break free and form large floating mats it is these mats that were first identified as sources of fib when they washed up on beaches in the great lakes area of north america byappanahalli et al 2003b olapade et al 2006 whitman et al 2003 a study using culture methods and pcr identified pathogens including salmonella and pathogenic e coli species in association with cladophora ishii et al 2006b in contrast a metagenomic investigation using 16s rrna did not identify pathogens or e coli associated with the epiphytic bacterial community of actively growing cladophora zulkifly et al 2012 microcosm studies of the impact of uv irradiation on the interaction of salmonella and e coli with cladophora noted extended survival of the two microbes when associated with the alga suggesting a protective effect provided by the algal mats beckinghausen et al 2014 initial concentrations of e coli underwent a seven log reduction in numbers after six hours in water with no algae present compared with 16 h for the same level of removal in the presence of algae in comparison salmonella showed a higher resistance to die off with and without algal presence with greater persistence in the presence of the algal mats in another study focused on in situ free floating cladophora the e coli concentrations associated with the algal mats were investigated by sampling water underlying the mats adjacent to the mats and at regularly spaced intervals within the mats heuvel et al 2010 concentrations of e coli in the surrounding water 1 0 3 5 log10 mpn 100 ml were significantly lower than in the water beneath the algal mats 3 0 4 0 log10 mpn 100 ml significant positive correlations were identified in concentrations of e coli attached to the algae and e coli in the water underlying the algal mat the concentration gradient of e coli showed that there were higher e coli concentrations at the center of the mat compared to the edges presumably due to the mat s protective influence from the effects of waves and wind a follow up study on the cladophora mats in lake michigan badgley et al 2011 confirmed that algal mats may be a source of e coli to nearby water e coli from the mats n 4000 isolates were collected over a three year timeframe and during multiple three day sampling periods to analyze their population structure using dna fingerprint analyses spatially and temporally over annual periods genetic analysis revealed a high degree of diversity between isolates although 33 of isolates were represented by multiple clonal groups the authors suggested that these clonal populations may represent naturalized groups of e coli that are persisting in the environment and have adapted to survive and replicate within the algal mats badgley et al 2011 e coli isolates were highly related within individual mats when the finer detail of diversity was examined between the mats and over the three day periods for individual mats furthermore there was temporal genetic clustering of isolates when the same mat was examined over a three day period suggesting transient populations that changed on a daily basis together these results reflected a mosaic pattern of e coli strains from a variety of fecal inputs and concurrent populations of naturalized e coli populations the authors concluded that the complex and dynamic pattern of e coli strains makes it difficult to use them as indicators for tracking the source of fecal pollution future studies of algal mats and algal blooms and their implications for water quality could include discrimination of fib subpopulations using the genetic tools described in this review this would facilitate the understanding of the role of non fecal escherichia and enterococcus species in contributing to the increased fib loadings associated with mass gatherings of algae in the water column and dried algal mats washed up on the shores of beaches and lakes 3 5 2 aquatic plants as a reservoir of fib in freshwater and estuarine environments badgley et al 2010a conducted a survey of the concentration and genetic make up of enterococci populations associated with a variety of submerged aquatic vegetation sav sediment and water they noted a decreasing mean density of enterococci concentrations from sav to sediment to water table 4 with a range of genetic diversity from high to low the lowest diversity was noted in lake water during summer they also provided evidence for the persistence of certain enterococci strains that might represent naturalized populations in mesocosm studies badgley et al 2010b studied the effects of submerged macrophytes on enterococci populations they seeded the mesocosms with freshwater populations of sav mostly the plant hydrilla verticillata water and sediment at the time of sampling all matrices had chronically elevated levels of enterococci the concentrations of enterococci were monitored over 14 days in the mesocosms of sediment and water which were seeded with and without sav as in the study of badgley et al 2010a enterococci were observed in the highest densities in the macrophytes compared with sediments and water furthermore the presence of sav was observed to facilitate the persistence of enterococci in the vegetated mesocosms compared with non vegetated mesocosms however when comparing their total mass to water and sediment matrices the contribution of macrophyte associated enterococci was determined to be a minor portion of the entire system the importance of fib associated substrates on water quality concentrations will be location dependent with factors such as the total mass of the substrate reservoirs and the volume of water available for resuspension playing significant roles badgley et al 2010b genotypic typing of the enterococci strains throughout the study revealed that the population was dominated by a single strain of enterococcus casseliflavus this bacterium has commonly been associated with vegetation and waterfowl aarestrup et al 2002 cho et al 2020 kim et al 2020 additionally e casseliflavus was identified as an inhabitant of the lake from which the plant material was sourced for the experiments this naturalized strain of e casseliflavus persisted over the ten month duration of the study suggesting its ability to reproduce in the environment the impact of the aquatic macrophytes sagittaria and myriophyllum on e coli concentrations in freshwater was studied by leewis 2006 an increased e coli concentration was noted in association with macrophyte mats in comparison to the e coli concentrations in water at distances of 2 5 and 10 m from the mats these findings were similar to the cladophora mat experiments of heuvel et al 2010 sediment and vegetation collected from the water surface were investigated as reservoirs of fecal coliforms and enterococci by nguyen et al 2018 similar to badgley et al 2010a these researchers compared the concentration of fib in the wet weight of sediment 100 g or vegetation 100 g with 100 ml of water sample and showed that concentrations in the sediment and vegetation were 1 2 orders of magnitude higher compared with the water adding to the evidence that these matrices act as reservoirs of fib the problems of invasive weed populations in aquatic environments was highlighted in a study of the association between the introduced submerged macrophyte eurasian watermilfoil e coli and bacterial pathogens in north american lakes mathai et al 2019 they identified that the eurasian watermilfoil could harbor elevated densities of e coli and be an agent of dispersal of these and other bacteria in this study molecular methods including pcr markers and dna metagenomic sequencing identified avian pollution as the primary source of the fecal bacteria associated with this invasive weed 3 5 3 periphyton as reservoirs for fib biofilms of periphyton form on submerged substrates and consist of green algae diatoms protozoa and a complex community of microbes including fungi and cyanobacteria li et al 2018 ksoll et al 2007 investigated the contribution of periphyton as reservoirs of fecal coliforms in a freshwater temperate lake in the summer periphyton associated concentrations of fecal coliforms peaked at 105 cfu cm2 using genetic subtyping techniques ksoll et al 2007 determined that waterfowl and sewage were the major fecal sources of the e coli contributing to water samples overlying the periphyton they also identified some e coli strains that persisted over time but could not be attributed to a source postulating that these strains may belong to a group of naturalized e coli as this study was conducted prior to the recognition of the escherichia cryptic clades it is possible that this last subset of e coli could potentially belong to the cryptic clades rather than naturalized e coli moreira et al 2012 isolated strains of e coli from periphyton in freshwater lakes and established that they had enhanced biofilm formation capability when compared with e coli strains isolated from bovine and human fecal sources as noted in other studies moreira et al 2012 suggested that biofilm formation may give persistent e coli strains a selective survival advantage in aquatic environments di sante et al 2018 ingle et al 2011 liang et al 2016 tymensen et al 2015 zhi et al 2019 a mesocosm study measured the interaction of genetic markers between the water column and periphyton in an experimental stream facility subjected to wastewater inputs li et al 2018 the genetic markers targeted e coli enterococci and human fecal markers as seen in the study of stocker et al 2019 for e coli and enterococci table 4 the researchers established that the periphyton can act as environmental reservoirs for these genetic markers and presumably the bacteria they target the net flux shifts between concentrations of each marker in the water inflow compared with the outflow showed that the genetic markers can be resuspended from the periphyton but that partitioning of the markers between the water column and the periphyton is dynamic and complex li et al 2018 the study of fib concentrations in a rural creek over approximately 3 km of its course showed significant correlations between concentrations of e coli in water sediment and periphyton and similar but lower correlations between enterococci and the three matrices stocker et al 2019 there were consistently higher concentrations of fib recovered from periphyton than sediment samples collected in the same location table 4 fib levels in the periphyton were significantly higher in the summer samplings compared with winter and of the three matrices the periphyton showed the highest variability followed by sediment the study concluded that fib survivability was highest in periphyton followed by sediment and then water overall aquatic vegetation can harbor significant loads of fib species in relation to their mass compared with the other matrices sediment and water in aquatic environments and therefore have the potential to contribute significant concentrations of fib to the water column the total mass and resuspension potential of each matrix however needs to be evaluated to determine if these fib harbored by aquatic vegetation will be major contributors to fib water quality monitoring results 3 6 micro invertebrates as an environmental reservoir of microorganisms the identification of microorganisms in micro invertebrates adds another facet to the persistence of fecally derived microbes in the environment with the micro invertebrate hypothesized to act as a trojan horse barker and brown 1994 mcdougald and longford 2020 neogi et al 2014 defines micro invertebrates as organisms mostly in the range of 50 500 µm but up to 5 mm and includes copepods rotifers nematodes protozoa crustacean larvae and some insect larvae as predators micro invertebrates can have a negative influence on the numbers of bacteria as shown by the grazing rates of some in vitro protozoa being estimated at 2000 bacteria ingested per hour macek et al 1997 however some bacteria including pathogens have developed mechanisms to evade predation post ingestion and survive within the micro invertebrate boamah et al 2017 sun et al 2013 evidence now suggests that protozoa such as amoeba can act as vectors of various bacteria including e coli and the pathogens campylobacter and legionella buse and ashbolt 2011 greub and raoult 2004 hasni et al 2020 moreno mesonero et al 2020 another potential transmission route for dissemination of these bacteria could occur when avian species ingest micro invertebrates under these circumstances microorganisms could survive and grow within the micro invertebrates and evade the host s immune system neogi et al 2014 recent evidence suggests that convergent evolution has occurred where pathogens like legionella which originally adapted to micro invertebrate invasion are now primed for virulence in human macrophages hasni et al 2020 neogi et al 2014 park et al 2020 this phenomenon has raised concern because the protozoa and their intracellular bacterial companions are resistant to the chlorine doses used in municipal drinking water sources posing a health risk from the trojan horse carriage of these pathogens codony et al 2012 king et al 1988 shaheen and ashbolt 2018 researchers have observed nematodes feeding on and producing viable and infective forms of the oocysts of cryptosporidium and bacterial pathogens thus acting as vectors of these disease causing organisms anderson et al 2003 huamanchay et al 2004 more recently studies have demonstrated occasions of nematodes ingesting legionella infected amoeba and the subsequent colonization of the nematode intestinal cells by legionella suggesting that nematodes could be another environmental reservoir of pathogenic legionella such as l pneumophila hellinga et al 2015 rasch et al 2016 the intracellular carriage of fib and pathogens by micro invertebrates has implications for all water environments including drinking water reported growth of microorganisms including e coli within these micro invertebrate vectors could lead to the dissemination of fib and pathogens into the water environment once the micro invertebrate decays and the cell wall ruptures resulting in the release of high levels of fib pathogens 3 7 poikilothermic animals as reservoirs for e coli and enterococci poikilothermic animals such as fish snails and frogs have body temperatures that vary in relation to their environment as compared to the homeostatic temperature of mammals or birds in an australian study e coli was isolated from the feces or lower intestinal tract of vertebrates including 12 of the frogs examined n 106 with most of the frog isolates being associated with urban environments gordon and cowling 2003 reptiles such as crocodiles turtles and snakes were also noted to carry e coli with 33 4 and 2 prevalence respectively in the same study e coli was isolated from 10 of the fish examined n 138 gordon and cowling 2003 used the clermont 2000 pcr to characterize the e coli isolates into the four known phylogroups of the time a b1 b2 and d although sample numbers were too low for meaningful statistical analyses the e coli phylogroup b1 was identified as having the highest prevalence in fish frogs and reptiles a recent study identified high levels of e coli and enterococci in the guts of fish frogs and gastropods frick et al 2018 the mean e coli concentration in fish frogs and gastropods snails and slugs ranged between 4 2 and 5 2 log10 cfu g of feces with prevalence ranging from 68 to 85 table 4 enterococci were similarly present with a mean concentration ranging between 3 3 and 5 1 log10 cfu g and a prevalence of 68 to 96 e coli were not identified in earthworms but enterococci were present in low abundance researchers noted the concentrations of fib in these poikilothermic organisms were similar to concentrations isolated from mammals and bird feces in the same study frick et al 2018 they suggest that their findings challenge those of early researchers such as geldreich and clarke 1966 that e coli and enterococci are not permanent members of the fish intestinal flora however geldreich and clarke 1966 did identify that the fib intestinal concentration was dependent on the degree of fecal contamination present in the aquatic environment frick et al 2018 noted that microbial results from waterways identified with low concentrations of fib require careful interpretation as the fib may not be from conventionally recognized fecal pollution sources that study and its conclusions are supported by another investigation of freshwater fish trout eel inanga and bullies in new zealand where e coli and enterococci were recovered from 71 and 76 of fecal samples respectively coxon et al 2019 concentrations of fib although highly variable between individual fish samples reached maximum levels of 2 1 104 e coli and 1 3 106 enterococci g feces furthermore concentrations of fib in the water column were recorded at substantially lower levels for example four orders of magnitude less suggesting potential replication or concentration within the intestinal tract of fish coxon et al 2019 the isolation of e coli and enterococci from poikilothermic organisms such as fish and reptiles prompts the question of whether these aquatic organisms are providing an intestinal habitat for colonization of fib and thus acting as a reservoir in aquatic environments another possibility is that the isolated fib are members of a transient microbial community ingested from water and passing through the gut of these aquatic species geldreich and clarke 1966 noted that fib concentrations were not stably maintained as colonizers of fish intestines unless there was a continuous source of fecal contamination in the water if recent research establishes that fib are colonizing the gut of fish species rather than transiting the gut this evidence would raise additional questions it would be relevant to ask whether colonization of fib in aquatic organisms is as a result of ongoing high levels of fecal contamination in our chronically polluted aquatic environments this premise would change the original view that fib are not a normal part of the fish intestinal flora as observed by geldreich 1966 this again raises the validity of fib as indicators of mammalian fecal contamination inputs to our waterways future research should identify if fib populations within aquatic species are diverse or made up of certain clonal strains such as e coli phylogroup b1 which is often identified as a persistent phylogroup isolated from waterways jokinen et al 2019 tymensen et al 2015 furthermore e coli b1 was identified in the earlier study of gordon and cowling 2003 as the main phylogroup in poikilothermic animals another question is whether the escherichia cryptic clades colonize the fish intestine thereby suggesting that poikilothermic species may act as an unidentified fecal reservoir for these naturalized escherichia 4 conclusions and recommendations for future research the fib belonging to the genera escherichia and enterococcus are widely identified in on non host environments including soil sediment and aquatic vegetation including algae their widespread presence in the environment has the potential to confound water quality monitoring which is typically based on fib as indicators of fecal contamination recent evidence suggests that fib may be part of the microbiota of some aquatic organisms research is required to investigate whether the original hypothesis that e coli and enterococci do not colonize the guts of aquatic organisms such as reptiles and fish remains valid in the chronically polluted waters of current environments if fib are colonizing the intestine of aquatic organisms then these organisms are acting as fecal reservoirs for fib with the potential to impact conventional water quality monitoring genomic studies have revealed that there are two groups of naturalized fib consisting of those defecated into the environment and able to persist under favourable conditions indicators of non recent fecal inputs and those that are ancient relatives of e coli or enterococci lineages and naturally inhabit the environmental reservoirs of waterways this latter group is identified as fib by conventional water testing methods but because they are not derived from a fecal contamination event are not correlated with health risk for enterococci there are many different species and some of those species are truly environmental while there is also evidence to suggest that some enteric enterococci species such as e faecalis have strains that have adapted their genome to an environmental non host lifestyle genes have been identified in enterococci that may be targets for differentiation of the enteric from naturalized enterococci further research is required to validate these enterococci biomarkers in the case of the escherichia genus there are two different types of naturalized bacteria which have the potential to confound water quality monitoring one type of naturalized escherichia are represented by the eight phylogroups of e coli and are derived from a mammalian avian fecal origin these naturalized e coli are able to survive post defecation in the environment and reside in reservoirs such as soil and river sediment where they may replicate within these phylogroups the b1 group has been identified as the most prevalent e coli phylogroup in environmental reservoirs the other type of naturalized escherichia termed cryptic clades are identified as e coli using conventional e coli water quality testing methods but in fact belong to separate species within the escherichia genus typical biochemical tests used to differentiate e coli from other escherichia species do not distinguish these naturalized escherichia cryptic clades from e coli escherichia cryptic clades have been rarely identified in human clinical or mammalian fecal specimens and have low levels of antibiotic resistance and few virulence genes these findings suggest that cryptic clades are likely to be poor indicators of pathogens derived from fecal sources additional studies on fecal sources are required to determine the environmental reservoirs of escherichia cryptic clades including aquatic poikilothermic species avian and feral animals in the search for biomarkers that distinguish between fib adapted to environmental versus enteric habitats it is important to determine whether the environmentally associated strains have the ability to switch between their environmental reservoirs and the enteric environment by expressing genes required for either lifestyle or whether those genes are absent from their genome advances in whole genome sequencing and metagenomic assays will aid the identification of genes peculiar or enriched in particular ecotypes that enable discrimination between the enteric and naturalized fib naturalized fib that originate from a non recent fecal contamination event may be associated with fecal pathogens that also endure in sediments pathogens such as cryptosporidium are able to persist as hardy oocysts and may potentially be infectious post defecation when harbored in soil and sediments naturalized fib derived from a fecal input therefore may still represent a health risk declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

17574,investment in the behavioral change projects would not be possible without knowing their prerequisites and determinants including intention moral norms identity and place attachment therefore this study aimed at the determination of the effects of place attachment pat place dependence pde place identity pid and place affect paf and farmers identity conservationist identity conid and productivist identity proid on the moral norms of water conservation mnwc as well as the intention of water conservation iwc of the iranian farmers this was a descriptive correlational and causal relational study the instrument of the study was a questionnaire completed using a cross sectional survey and face to face interviews hence a stratified random sampling method along with a proportionate allocation was used to select 380 farmers the research findings indicated that the pat pde pid and paf and conid had significant positive effects on the mnwc in addition mnwc and conid had significant positive effects on the iwc however proid had a significant negative effect on the mnwc and iwc in general it was found that independent variables pde pid paf proid and conid could predict 39 and 53 of the variance of the mnwc and iwc variables respectively moreover the social psychological framework of the study provides practitioners decision makers policymakers researchers and other stakeholders of the agricultural water management with useful practical and theoretical insights about the practices of behavior changes and social interventions finally it is recommended that government decision makers should further focus on the increased attractiveness of the rural and agricultural areas to increase pat mnwc and iwc graphical abstract image 1 keywords water conservation place attachment farmers identity lake urmia iran abbreviations pat place attachment pde placedependence pid place identity paf place affect proid productivist identity conid conservationist identity mnwc moral norms of water conservation iwc intention of water conservation 1 introduction iran is considered a dry and semi arid country which one quarter of its surface has been covered by deserts one quarter by arable land and the other two quarters by the mountains madani 2014 mohammadinezhad and ahmadvand 2020 however the average rainfall in the country is 250 mm per year keshavarz and karami 2016 which does not have good temporal and spatial distribution madani 2014 although many areas of iran have experienced serious water crises in recent years because of the above mentioned reasons west azerbaijan province is of special importance due to its extensive and generally traditional agriculture as well as its proximity to lake urmia ghalibaf and moussavi 2014 however several political economic social and ecological factors have been involved in the occurrence of water scarcity in the region i e mosavi et al 2014 madani et al 2016 madani et al 2016 salehi et al 2018 tatar et al 2019 rezaei et al 2020 shojaei miandoragh et al 2020 sadeghi et al 2020 akbari et al 2020 according to many experts the role of agriculture or excessive water consumption in this sector could not be ignored in the occurrence of such a crisis mojarrad ashnaabad 2013 concluded that the volume of rainfall and water available in the region had been higher than the required volume during all the years in other words it has been the agricultural sector that played a major role in the water scarcity in the region by consuming 90 percent of this water therefore changing the farmers behavior as one of the main target groups should be considered for water conservation policies and water resources management plans in the region some researchers salehi et al 2018 valizadeh et al 2018a believe that water users behavior is like a double edged sword so it has been not only one of the most important factors with the greatest effects on the water crisis in the region but could also act as one of the most important factors for crisis management and its eradication therefore we can initially reduce the severity of damages by focusing on and improving favorable water conservation behaviors among farmers yazdanpanah et al 2015 abadi 2019 shafiei and maleksaeidi 2020 and then emphasize the reinforcement and compensation of the damages to water resources in the long term valizadeh et al 2018b bijani et al 2019 haji et al 2020 hence it is necessary to identify the factors affecting the farmers intention of water conservation iwc and water conservation behaviors a review of the literature on the factors affecting iwc indicated that numerous researchers clark and finley 2007 hurlimann et al 2009 valizadeh et al 2018a 2019a abadi 2019 neisi et al 2020 have proposed multiple factors including attitude perceived behavioral control subjective norms awareness value orientation self efficacy and so forth as the variables affecting the farmers water conservation behaviors in this regard they emphasized that these factors should be considered to reinforce and improve the water conservation behaviors of farmers in different agricultural communities however according to a report made by the agricultural jihad organization of west azerbaijan province one of the neglected issues regarding the improvement of the farmers water conservation behaviors in the region is the place attachment pat and its effect on the farmers iwc agricultural jihad organization of west azerbaijan province 2019 in fact farmers in these regions are forced to emigrate for various reasons such as scarcity of water resources lack of affordable agricultural products and low incomes moreover a number of farmers who did not emigrate and worked on their own agricultural land consider agricultural land and the farming job as an auxiliary tool for livelihood and are mostly involved in non agricultural activities outside the region these factors have reduced the pat among farmers in the study area due to the tragic problems associated with the lake urmia the government has been partially encouraged to reduce but not modify agricultural activities in these areas although this policy may convince the public about the effectiveness of the government policies in the short term it would surely not have the necessary effectiveness in the long term valizadeh et al 2019b in addition to the above mentioned problems the recent increasing migration the exit of indigenous farmers from the region and consequently the entry of non indigenous profiteering farmers into the region have unfortunately exacerbated the problem of irresponsibility and non commitment to water conservation agricultural jihad organization of west azerbaijan province 2019 these farmers did not have pat to the area and were seeking for maximum exploitation of agricultural lands and resources such as water which would likely double the problem of the study area in the near future moreover multiple studies i e scannell and gifford 2010 raymond et al 2011 mullendore et al 2015 ghazani and bijani 2016 proposed that pat led to intentions related to environmental behaviors such as iwc due to the activation of personal moral norms in addition to the farmers pat there are other important factors including moral norms that affect the farmers moral norms of water conservation mnwc in this region some researchers have introduced productivist identity proid or conservationist identity conid as one of the most important factors mcguire et al 2013 2015 they considered the farmers identity as one of the most important determinants of the farmers conservationist non conservationist behaviors proid farmers were further seeking for increasing the products and revenues and maximum use of natural resources in contrast conid farmers were seeking long term value from natural resources therefore they tried to avoid activities compromising the environment and natural resources thus these two groups would exhibit fundamentally different behaviors and desires to conserve water resources according to a review of the literature no study has been conducted on the determination of the effect of pat and place identity pid on the farmers mnwc moreover according to the reports of the agricultural jihad organization of west azerbaijan province the organization prioritized the investigation of the methods of increasing farmers pat and the effect of the farmers proid or conid on their behavioral desires therefore the main objective of this study was to analyze the effects of farmers pat and pid on the mnwc hence the novelty of the study was the analysis of the effects of pat and pid on farmers mnwc particularly in the strategic area of lake urmia 2 theoretical background gosling and williams 2010 have recently addressed the improvement of the farmers responsible behaviors and found the important role of the factors such as pat in the activation of the farmers pro environmental intentions and behaviors these researchers considered pat as a positive relationship or effective bond between a person and a particular place in addition farmers as the main managers of agricultural lands try to improve the quantity and quality of water and biodiversity based on their perception of their relationship with their place of living and work mullendore et al 2015 however farmers pat has always been one of the forgotten components in social studies in the field of water resources conservation therefore the present study considered this variable as a determinant of mnwc in fact it was assumed that when farmers were more attached to their workplaces and farming they would feel more committed to water conservation vorkinn and riese 2001 also confirmed this claim and stated that people with a strong attachment to an area likely disagreed with the degradation of the environment and natural resources it should be noted that concepts and descriptions of pat differ in different academic disciplines and each has its own perspective according to a study by halpenny 2010 pat was defined as a bond with a particular place here agricultural land and the farmers living place which had functional place dependence pde cognitive place identity pid and effective place affect paf aspects this study defined pde as a functional attachment to a place stokols and shumaker 1981 halpenny 2010 as demonstrated by stokols and shumaker 1981 pat is determined by two elements including the qualities of a particular place and the relative quality of comparable alternative places individuals and groups evaluate places in terms of functionality that is the extent to which they enable the execution of certain activities therefore pat conceptually refers to a conative domain in this study and includes individuals behavioral actions and attitudes toward a place proshansky 1978 defined pid as aspects of self which define personal identity in communication with physical environment using the complex patterns of conscious and unconscious ideas beliefs preferences feelings values objectives behavioral desires and environmental skills in general pid is an important determinant that helps to reinforce self identity and build adapt their experiences to different physical environments this factor is also defined as the symbolically important connection between the individual and setting the individual and natural world and psychological investment with a situation that has developed over time finally extensive interaction with one place can lead to pid by creating pde halpenny 2010 many authors of environmental psychology including giuliani 2003 and valizadeh et al 2018a referred to the importance of paf as an aspect of people s bond to places this effective bond has been attracted by researchers in the fields of resource management ecology and outdoor recreation entertainment according to the authors observations paf or individual affections toward a particular place was considered as the third minor aspect of pat according to the good farmer identity theory proposed by burton 2004 mcguire et al 2015 lequin et al 2019 farmers are divided into two categories of the proid and conid ones proid farmers had greater emphasis on their farms productivity morton et al 2017 and conid farmers prioritized the pro environmental symbols of successful agriculture including nutrient management and group and community collaboration lequin et al 2019 in addition mcguire indicated that farmers who considered high levels of agricultural production as the main criterion of being a good farmer had less awareness of the consequences of water scarcity mcguire et al 2013 lequin et al 2019 consequently these farmers had less responsibility to improve their behavior efficacy for conserving water on their farms sheban 2014 they usually evaluate different aspects of water conservation based on the productivity economic aspect of production and effectiveness of these activities for their personal purposes hence if farmers perceived very high personal costs for water conservation then they would have less desire for water conservation behaviors and may even disagree with it in contrast conid farmers evaluate water conservation generally based on the costs and benefits to the environment society and so forth in this regard some experts mcguire et al 2013 2015 ives and kendal 2014 valizadeh et al 2018b lequin et al 2019 argued that individuals who pay more attention to animal welfare ecosystem improvement and interests of other people than increasing production and economic benefits of the farms have higher awareness of the consequences of their misbehaviors and thus exhibit pro environmental behaviors such as water conservation behavior mohammadi mehr et al 2018 bijani et al 2019 veisi et al 2020 valizadeh et al 2020 ataei et al 2020 in order to summarize the theoretical and empirical literature and configure the theoretical framework it should be mentioned that aspects of the pat and farmers proid and conid were the main independent variables of this study whose effects on the iwc were investigated however since many studies showed that pat and farmers identity initially led to the activation of the iwc antecedents such as moral norms this variable was considered a mediating variable between aspects of pat farmers identity and iwc fig 1 therefore hypotheses of the study are as follows hypothesis 1 pde has a significant positive effect on mnwc hypothesis 2 pid has a significant positive effect on mnwc hypothesis 3 paf has a significant positive effect on mnwc hypothesis 4 mnwc has a significant positive effect on iwc hypothesis 5 proid has a significant negative effect on mnwc hypothesis 6 proid has a significant negative effect on iwc hypothesis 7 conid has a significant positive effect on mnwc hypothesis 8 conid has a significant positive effect on iwc 3 materials and methods this was an applied study with a descriptive correlational and causal relational approach statistical population of the study included farmers in mahabad and miandoab counties in west azarbaijan province iran n 36183 fig 2 the sample size was estimated to be 380 cases based on the sampling table proposed by krejcie and morgan 1970 the farmers were selected by the stratified random sampling method with a proportionate allocation there were three main reasons for using the stratified random sampling method first the variance between the strata villages sub counties and counties varied in terms of the number of farmers therefore in order to properly distribute the samples between different strata it was necessary to use this sampling method the second reason for using stratified random sampling method was related to the fact that there were significant similarities inside the strata in terms of various features such as agricultural practicing method use of water conservation technologies and so on for example in some subcounties farmers were more intent to use water conservation technologies and in some subcounties farmers were more intent to repair the old canals the third reason was the economic constraints and sampling accuracy in other words stratified random sampling method allows the researcher to classify the study community in such a way that research costs are reduced furthermore the low variance inside the floors increases the accuracy of sampling in implementation process of the sampling method after determining the total sample size the study area was first divided into two strata according to the division by iran statistical center miandoab and mahabad counties were considered as the separate strata then the number of samples was estimated according to the size of the intended population in each of these strata then each county was subdivided into a number of sub counties collection of villages according to the country divisions miandoab county has 11 sub counties and mahabad county has 5 sub counties subsequently two villages were randomly selected from each of these sub counties finally a proportional random sample of farmers was selected from each village table 1 reports the details on the population size and samples a questionnaire was used as the instrument of the study face validity of the questionnaire was confirmed by a panel of experts the panel members were experts researchers and specialists who conducted extensive research in the field of environmental psychology and water conservation behaviors intentions in order to identify the panel member and ensure that they have the sufficient expertise needed to evaluate the questionnaire various publications on environmental psychology and water conservation behaviors intentions published by iranian researchers in international and persian journals were first searched by carefully examining these documents the most relevant works to the topic of the present study were screened eight researchers whose works had more to do with the present study and did a lot of research in this field were selected as members of the panel of experts then the initial version of the designed questionnaire was presented to them in person upon receiving feedback from panelists on face and content validities the research team held two meetings to reach a consensus on experts feedback after correcting the questionnaire based on the opinions of experts the questionnaire was prepared for the pilot phase therefore a pilot study including 30 farmers was conducted data collection of the pilot study was carried out by the first author collected data were introduced to the spss24 for primary evaluation of the results and calculation of cronbach s alpha coefficient to determine the reliability of the questionnaire table 2 represents the main variables and final cronbach s alpha coefficients resulting from pilot data for different parts of the instrument the pilot study had several important results the first result was that the variables proid conid and iwc had cronbach s alpha values ranging from 0 6 to 0 7 but with the removal of some items the alpha values for proid and iwc reached an acceptable level greater than 0 7 one one and two items were removed from proid conid and iwc variables respectively however the alpha value for conid reached a maximum value of 0 65 after removal of one item it should be mentioned that the views on setting acceptable values for cronbach s alpha vary although most statisticians believe that the minimum acceptable value for alpha is 0 7 others hulin et al 2001 habibpour gatabi and safari shali 2009 van griethuijsen et al 2015 ursachi et al 2015 taber 2017 believe that values of 0 6 and higher are also acceptable the second result was that some respondents had problems in understanding some of the concepts and words used in the research tool for example the item tendency to pay for water conservation was one of these cases in which some respondents asked the interviewer to read it again or provide more explanations to solve this problem examples of farmers payments for water conservation were attached to the item to facilitate its understanding following making these revisions the questionnaire was prepared for the main survey phase the third and one of the most important results of the pilot study was that a multi cultural data collection team had to be formed to conduct the main survey project given that the study area had two ethnic groups turks and kurds the formation of such a team was essential to establish effective communication with the participants and gather credible data in this regard in order to deal with the obstacles related to the diverse cultures languages and customs in the study area a multi cultural data collection team was formed prior to the main survey the fourth result was that the pilot study helped to estimate the time and cost required to conduct the main research in order to evaluate the construct validity of the measures convergent validity was examined using the composite reliability cr average variance extracted ave and standardized factor loadings of the items these evaluation criteria were calculated and confirmed for different parts of the questionnaire in two steps in the first step the values of cr and ave were manually calculated using equations 1 and 2 1 a v e i 1 n λ i 2 i 1 n λ i 2 i 1 n σ 2 c r i 1 n λ i 2 i 1 n λ i 2 i 1 n σ i 2 where λ is the standardized factor loading n refers to the frequency of the items of latent variables and σ represents the error variance of the items according to brinckmann 2008 acceptable cut offs for cr and ave were cr 0 7 and ave 0 5 cr and ave calculation showed that their cut offs were acceptable pid ave 0 74 cr 0 82 paf ave 0 61 cr 0 79 pde ave 0 68 cr 0 86 iwc ave 0 71 cr 0 75 mnwc ave 0 76 cr 0 82 proid ave 0 59 cr 0 75 and conid ave 0 51 cr 0 72 respectively in the second step the reliability of manually calculated values of cr and ave was proved by measurement model estimation of amos20 statistical package as it was previously mentioned standardized factor loading of items is another criteria for construct validity acceptable cut offs for factor loadings are equal to or greater than 0 5 estimation of the measurement model of constructs using first order confirmatory factor analysis showed that all factor loadings have values greater than 0 5 therefore the construct and convergent validity of the research tool was confirmed furthermore the discriminant validity of the variables was examined using the average shared squared variance asv and the maximum shared squared variance msv examination of discriminant validity using asv and msv criteria has been emphasized by hair et al 1998 they argue that in order to test the discriminant validity the ave for each variable must be larger than asv and msv the main dependent variable in this study was iwc iwc is defined as the extent to which farmers intend to involve in pro environmental behaviors like agricultural water conservation yazdanpanah et al 2015 the variable mnwc which was also considered as a mediator variable in this study refers to a feeling of personal commitment to involvement collaboration in a particular action schwartz 1977 pde pid paf proid and conid were the five main independent variables with a fundamental role in activation of mnwc according to the definitions provided by halpenny 2010 pde is the farmers functional attachment to their farms and agricultural lands however pid represents the internalized beliefs about a particular place that structures the farmers experiences in different physical environments moreover paf refers to the emotions and feelings of an individual farmer towards a particular place proid and conid refer to the farmers self concepts in agricultural activities and water resource utilization morton et al 2017 lequin et al 2019 table 2 presents the number of items used to operationalize these variables and their sources it should also be noted that the five point likert scale 0 strongly disagree 1 disagree 2 neither agree nor disagree 3 agree and 4 strongly agree was used to measure and operationalize all iwc mnwc pde pid paf proid and conid variables other variables of the study included gender age education irrigation method and type of land ownership in the research studies having at least one dependent and independent variable structural equation modeling sem should be done through two distinctive tests in the first step the measurement models of the study variable should be estimated this process is carried out using first and or second order confirmatory factor analysis the aim of this step is to evaluate the convergent validity divergent validity and reliability of the studied constructs in the present study first order confirmatory factor analysis was employed with the maximum likelihood method however regarding that the study s theoretical framework consists of several independent variables and a dependent variable in the second step of sem the structural model of the variables was tested in other words in the second step of sem the structural relationship among the latent variables was examined it is also worth mentioning that the structural model of sem includes total direct model and mediation indirect structural models total direct structural model is employed for the modeling frameworks which do not have variable s mediating the relationship between dependent and independent variables regarding that the framework of this study had a mediating variable mnwc mediation indirect structural model was employed to test the hypothesis the data were collected through face to face interviews with farmers out of 380 distributed questionnaires 350 questionnaires were collected out of which 15 questionnaires were excluded due to the missing data finally 335 questionnaires were analyzed with the response rate of 88 15 and spss24 and amos20 were used to analyze data before the analysis process the normality of data was examined using multivariate normality assessment methods multivariate normality can be measured in many ways but mardia s coefficients of multivariate skewness and kurtosis are most commonly used in sem software in amos20 only mardia s coefficients of multivariate skewness and kurtosis are available thus a sample can be considered to be multivariate normally distributed at the 0 05 level of significance when the critical ratio is smaller than 1 96 indicating that the coefficient of multivariate kurtosis is not significantly different from zero mardia 1970 4 results and discussion 4 1 descriptive statistics of individual and professional variables of the respondents the mean age of the respondents was 42 5 years and most of them 38 8 were in the age range from 30 to 45 years about 93 of them were male and 6 were female it was found that 76 6 of the farmers irrigated their agricultural land using the flood irrigation method 15 7 utilized the rain fed farming method and 7 7 used drip irrigation method to irrigate their land the average number of the respondents years of education was 7 years analysis of the respondents by the education level indicated that most of them had a moderate to lower education xi 10 years the findings showed that 70 3 of the respondents owned the land wherein they were farming and 29 7 of them used the tenant farming 4 2 correlation between variables pearson correlation coefficient was used to examine the relationships between variables table 3 results obtained from the correlation analysis indicated that three components of pde including pde r 0 370 p 0 01 pid r 0 496 p 0 01 and paf r 0 322 p 0 01 had significant positive correlations with mnwc these findings were consistent with the results reported by hallaj 2017 and halpenny 2010 moreover a significant positive correlation was found between conid and mnwc r 0 429 p 0 01 however proid had a significant negative correlation with mnwc r 0 155 p 0 01 consequently the positive correlation of conid and negative correlation of proid with mnwc were supported by morton et al 2017 and sheban 2014 in addition the mnwc variable had a significant positive correlation with iwc r 0 598 p 0 01 this result was supported by the results obtained by rezaei et al 2019 and bijani et al 2019 furthermore conid showed a significant positive correlation with iwc r 0 658 p 0 01 however proid had a significant negative correlation with iwc r 0 277 p 0 01 finally it should be noted that the results reported by sheban 2014 and morton et al 2017 were in line with these results 4 3 measurement models estimation in sem in order to evaluate the convergent validity discriminant validity composite reliability and the fitness of the model the measurement models were estimated using first order confirmatory factor analysis table 4 the results revealed that the standardized factor loadings of all observed variables were significant and greater than the acceptable value of 0 5 furthermore as the results demonstrate the obtained values for cr and ave of all latent variables pid paf pde iwc mnwc proid and conid were greater than the acceptable cut offs of 0 7 and 0 5 respectively thus it can be concluded that the convergent validity and composite reliability of the research tool have been fulfilled in addition the results of sem measurement models revealed that the average shared squared variance asv and the maximum shared squared variance msv values for all variables are smaller than the ave values it means that the discriminant validity of the research instrument and variables are at a satisfactory level the results for multivariate normality assessment also revealed that mardia s coefficients of multivariate skewness and kurtosis are smaller than 1 96 this result means that the data do not have extreme violations and are normally distributed table 4 4 4 mediation indirect structural equation estimation in sem in this step of sem the structural relationships among the latent variables were examined regarding the fact that the variable mnwc was a mediating variable in the framework of this study fig 1 mediation indirect structural modeling approach was employed to test the hypothesis in order to accurately investigate the relationships between the variables first the standardized effects of the variables pde pid paf conid and proid on mnwc and iwc as the mediating variable were analyzed table 5 then the indirect and total effects of independent variables on iwc were analyzed table 6 in the end the fitness of the structural model was evaluated using structural equation modeling fit indices table 7 in addition fig 3 demonstrates the standardized form of mediation structural model with details of direct and indirect effects and fit indices 4 4 1 effects of independent variables on the mediator and dependent variables the results obtained from this study indicated that the above mentioned framework could predict 53 of the variance of iwc and 39 of the variance of mnwc table 5 and fig 3 investigation of the direct effects on iwc showed that mnwc β 0 41 p 0 001 and conid β 0 48 p 0 001 had positive and significant effects on iwc however proid variable had a significant negative effect on iwc β 0 16 p 0 019 in addition results showed that pde β 0 21 p 0 001 pid β 0 34 p 0 049 paf β 0 19 p 0 005 and conid β 0 23 p 0 013 had significant effects on mnwc finally it was found that proid β 0 05 n s had no significant effect on mnwc 4 4 2 indirect effects and total effects of independent variables on iwc we investigated indirect standardized effects of the independent variables on the dependent variable of iwc using mediation structural equation modeling and showed that variables of pde 0 086 pid 0 139 paf 0 078 proid 0 020 and conid 0 094 indirectly affected the iwc table 6 moreover according to the results of structural model the pid variable had a greater indirect standardized effect on the iwc than the other variables in the theoretical framework then we calculated total effects of the independent variables and revealed that conid 0 574 mnwc 0 410 proid 0 180 and pid 0 139 had the greatest total effects on the iwc table 6 4 4 3 examining the fit indices of mediation indirect structural model regarding that employing sem with no mention of fitness indices for the model is inappropriate and unreliable they were used to assess the suitability of the model in general the goodness of fit index gfi and the adjusted goodness of fit index agfi representing fit measures between the hypothesized model and the observed covariance matrix were higher than 0 9 gfi 0 952 agfi 0 910 in addition the bentler bonett s normed fit index nfi and the comparative fit index cfi had values above 0 9 nfi 0 971 cfi 0 972 which were indicative of appropriate data model fit it should be noted that the nfi examines the discrepancy between the chi square value of the hypothesized model and the null model and the cfi analyzes the difference between the data and the hypothesized model the root mean square error of approximation rmsea as another important fit index denoted a suitable and acceptable value rmsea 0 068 suitable values for this indicator should be less than 0 08 see browne and cudeck 1993 byrne 2010 in other words rmsea values less than 0 08 represent acceptable errors of approximation in the population the chi square normalized by degree of freedom df which should be less than the acceptable value of 5 was 2 45 detailed information about the fitness indices of model and acceptable cut offs were presented in table 7 5 conclusions and policy recommendations the general objective of this study was to determine the effects of pat and identity on the mnwc and iwc of the iranian farmers using a social psychological framework the results demonstrated that conid should be activated among farmers in order to reinforce the iwc and mnwc however proid should be inactivated as much as possible it was also found that identity or perceptions about characteristics of a good farmer were impressively affected by the society s perceptions about the criteria of a good farmer therefore it was suggested that social feedbacks and the value that agricultural community considers for a conservationist farmer should be used as a starting point for shifting proid to conid such shifts in the farmers identity could lead to rethinking and redefining the mnwc and applying the best water conservation behaviors however in order to be successful in this field practitioners change agents of agricultural extension and other institutions involved in the water resources management should be aware of the importance of conid and its role in activating the farmers mnwc and iwc in other words they should institutionalize these perceptions in their activities and programs hence communication strategies are of high importance in interventions related to the reinforcement of mnwc and iwc therefore it is recommended that agricultural extension practitioners and other water resource management actors choose their strategies based on the identity of the target farmers conid or proid for example in communication with the conservationist farmers they should focus on increasing awareness of consequences perception of risk and self efficacy that represent the negative effects of non conservation behaviors on the water resources ecosystem and agricultural community however in communication with the productivist farmers interventors should emphasize the pro production aspects of agriculture and water conservation such as increasing production in the long term and expanding the area under cultivation in the future the results of the study indicated the significant positive effect of pde and its aspects on the mnwc and iwc therefore rather than reducing agricultural activities which were practically ineffective and expanded agricultural activities by non indigenous farmers it is necessary to modify the cultivation and irrigation patterns and diversify the livelihood activities of the farmers in the region e g development of both livestock and agricultural activities this can increase the attractiveness of the rural agricultural areas in comparison with the urban areas and consequently can lower migration to cities and enhance pde of farmers finally the entry of non indigenous profiteering farmers into the region could be largely prevented with regard to the direct effects on the iwc it was found that mnwc had the highest predictive power this finding revealed the possible importance of the mnwc in explaining and strengthening iwc in other words some of the issues and problems related to the agricultural water in the study area could be improved by creating moral structures and norms among farmers in many circumstances problems related to water scarcity in society refer to the morality issues and the fact that farmers did not consider water conservation as a moral task therefore it is suggested that administrators of the organizations such as agricultural extension organization and the public participation units of iran ministry of energy who directly work on behavioral changes in the agricultural communities pay more attention to the creation and reinforcement of the moral norms in the agricultural communities this could be done through face to face communication with farmers in the training classes and courses so that the relevant discussions and discourses could convince them to accept that water conservation activities are inherently correct and moral if this process can be done successfully it will lead to the activation of the farmers iwc in general it should be mentioned that the social psychological framework proposed in this study provides practitioners decision makers policymakers researchers and other stakeholders of the agricultural water management with useful practical and theoretical insights about the practices of behavior changes and social interventions in other words this study and the introduced framework can be useful for the above mentioned end users in some respects first this model focuses their attention on the importance or key role that the variables pde farmers identity and iwc could play in the analysis of the farmers water conservation behaviors however in many previous studies conducted on water conservation behaviors they have been ignored secondly the framework suggested in the study plays a significant role in clarifying and increasing knowledge about the complex mechanisms existing among the social psychological variables in other words the present study configured some dynamic social psychological variables combined them with the environmental challenge of water conservation and obtained a simple framework with certain relationships that provided the users with a clear understanding of the relationships between these variables and also facilitated the processes of a social behavioral intervention in summation confirmation of the importance of farmers place attachment and identity in affecting moral norms and intention of water conservation is the main take home message of this study the effects of place attachment and farmers identity on farmers water conservation related norms and intention have never been investigated therefore the present study opens a new research window in the field of water conservation science to research upon the potential contributions of place attachment identity moral norms and intention to the discourse of sustainable water resources management 5 1 study limitations and suggestions for future research similar to other studies there were significant limitations in the present study the first limitation was the wide range of psychological and social variables that could affect mnwc and iwc in other words this study investigated only the effect of different aspects of pat and farmers identity on mnwc and iwc it should be noted that mnwc and iwc can also be affected by other social economic psychological cultural and even political variables therefore it is suggested that future researchers consider this issue in their studies and investigate the effect of other variables on mnwc and iwc the second limitation is related to the methodology used in the study due to the economic constraints only the questionnaire and cross sectional survey were used for data collection however the examination of the farmers mnwc and iwc using the qualitative methods such as in depth interviews grounded theory case study mixed methods and so forth may provide more realistic insights into their aspects and determinants these methods could even be used with before employing the quantitative methods for example instead of using the review of literature and outsiders perspectives to develop the items and scales of the research variables the farmers own comments insiders perspectives can be utilized for this purpose in this case there would be fewer difficulties with the gap between the researchers perception and farmers the subjects perceptions and accordingly the results would be closer to the realities in the agricultural community the third limitation was that the conceptual framework introduced in the study could predict 53 of the changes in the dependent variable iwc thus future research should search for other psychological social economic and structural variables to increase the explanation of farmers iwc the fourth limitation is related to the sample size used in the study although the size of the sample used in this study was completely sufficient based on the sampling table proposed by krejcie and morgan future researchers can use a larger sample size this can increase the robustness and generalization capability of the results ethical standards please pay attention to the following the authors also

17574,investment in the behavioral change projects would not be possible without knowing their prerequisites and determinants including intention moral norms identity and place attachment therefore this study aimed at the determination of the effects of place attachment pat place dependence pde place identity pid and place affect paf and farmers identity conservationist identity conid and productivist identity proid on the moral norms of water conservation mnwc as well as the intention of water conservation iwc of the iranian farmers this was a descriptive correlational and causal relational study the instrument of the study was a questionnaire completed using a cross sectional survey and face to face interviews hence a stratified random sampling method along with a proportionate allocation was used to select 380 farmers the research findings indicated that the pat pde pid and paf and conid had significant positive effects on the mnwc in addition mnwc and conid had significant positive effects on the iwc however proid had a significant negative effect on the mnwc and iwc in general it was found that independent variables pde pid paf proid and conid could predict 39 and 53 of the variance of the mnwc and iwc variables respectively moreover the social psychological framework of the study provides practitioners decision makers policymakers researchers and other stakeholders of the agricultural water management with useful practical and theoretical insights about the practices of behavior changes and social interventions finally it is recommended that government decision makers should further focus on the increased attractiveness of the rural and agricultural areas to increase pat mnwc and iwc graphical abstract image 1 keywords water

been covered by deserts one quarter by arable land and the other two quarters by the mountains madani 2014 mohammadinezhad and ahmadvand 2020 however the average rainfall in the country is 250 mm per year keshavarz and karami 2016 which does not have good temporal and spatial distribution madani 2014 although many areas of iran have experienced serious water crises in recent years because of the above mentioned reasons west azerbaijan province is of special importance due to its extensive and generally traditional agriculture as well as its proximity to lake urmia ghalibaf and moussavi 2014 however several political economic social and ecological factors have been involved in the occurrence of water scarcity in the region i e mosavi et al 2014 madani et al 2016 madani et al 2016 salehi et al 2018 tatar et al 2019 rezaei et al 2020 shojaei miandoragh et al 2020 sadeghi et al 2020 akbari et al 2020 according to many experts the role of agriculture or excessive water consumption in this sector could not be ignored in the occurrence of such a crisis mojarrad ashnaabad 2013 concluded that the volume of rainfall and water available in the region had been higher than the required volume during all the years in other words it has been the agricultural sector that played a major role in the water scarcity in the region by consuming 90 percent of this water therefore changing the farmers behavior as one of the main target groups should be considered for water conservation policies and water resources management plans in the region some researchers salehi et al 2018 valizadeh et al 2018a believe that water users behavior is like a double edged sword so it has been not only one of the most important factors with the greatest effects on the water crisis in the region but could also act as one of the most important factors for crisis management and its eradication therefore we can initially reduce the severity of damages by focusing on and improving favorable water conservation behaviors among farmers yazdanpanah et al 2015 abadi 2019 shafiei and maleksaeidi 2020 and then emphasize the reinforcement and compensation of the damages to water resources in the long term valizadeh et al 2018b bijani et al 2019 haji et al 2020 hence it is necessary to identify the factors affecting the farmers intention of water conservation iwc and water conservation behaviors a review of the literature on the factors affecting iwc indicated that numerous researchers clark and finley 2007 hurlimann et al 2009 valizadeh et al 2018a 2019a abadi 2019 neisi et al 2020 have proposed multiple factors including attitude perceived behavioral control subjective norms awareness value orientation self efficacy and so forth as the variables affecting the farmers water conservation behaviors in this regard they emphasized that these factors should be considered to reinforce and improve the water conservation behaviors of farmers in different agricultural communities however according to a report made by the agricultural jihad organization of west azerbaijan province one of the neglected issues regarding the improvement of the farmers water conservation behaviors in the region is the place attachment pat and its effect on the farmers iwc agricultural jihad organization of west azerbaijan province 2019 in fact farmers in these regions are forced to emigrate for various reasons such as scarcity of water resources lack of affordable agricultural products and low incomes moreover a number of farmers who did not emigrate and worked on their own agricultural land consider agricultural land and the farming job as an auxiliary tool for livelihood and are mostly involved in non agricultural activities outside the region these factors have reduced the pat among farmers in the study area due to the tragic problems associated with the lake urmia the government has been partially encouraged to reduce but not modify agricultural activities in these areas although this policy may convince the public about the effectiveness of the government policies in the short term it would surely not have the necessary effectiveness in the long term valizadeh et al 2019b in addition to the above mentioned problems the recent increasing migration the exit of indigenous farmers from the region and consequently the entry of non indigenous profiteering farmers into the region have unfortunately exacerbated the problem of irresponsibility and non commitment to water conservation agricultural jihad organization of west azerbaijan province 2019 these farmers did not have pat to the area and were seeking for maximum exploitation of agricultural lands and resources such as water which would likely double the problem of the study area in the near future moreover multiple studies i e scannell and gifford 2010 raymond et al 2011 mullendore et al 2015 ghazani and bijani 2016 proposed that pat led to intentions related to environmental behaviors such as iwc due to the activation of personal moral norms in addition to the farmers pat there are other important factors including moral norms that affect the farmers moral norms of water conservation mnwc in this region some researchers have introduced productivist identity proid or conservationist identity conid as one of the most important factors mcguire et al 2013 2015 they considered the farmers identity as one of the most important determinants of the farmers conservationist non conservationist behaviors proid farmers were further seeking for increasing the products and revenues and maximum use of natural resources in contrast conid farmers were seeking long term value from natural resources therefore they tried to avoid activities compromising the environment and natural resources thus these two groups would exhibit fundamentally different behaviors and desires to conserve water resources according to a review of the literature no study has been conducted on the determination of the effect of pat and place identity pid on the farmers mnwc moreover according to the reports of the agricultural jihad organization of west azerbaijan province the organization prioritized the investigation of the methods of increasing farmers pat and the effect of the farmers proid or conid on their behavioral desires therefore the main objective of this study was to analyze the effects of farmers pat and pid on the mnwc hence the novelty of the study was the analysis of the effects of pat and pid on farmers mnwc particularly in the strategic area of lake urmia 2 theoretical background gosling and williams 2010 have recently addressed the improvement of the farmers responsible behaviors and found the important role of the factors such as pat in the activation of the farmers pro environmental intentions and behaviors these researchers considered pat as a positive relationship or effective bond between a person and a particular place in addition farmers as the main managers of agricultural lands try to improve the quantity and quality of water and biodiversity based on their perception of their relationship with their place of living and work mullendore et al 2015 however farmers pat has always been one of the forgotten components in social studies in the field of water resources conservation therefore the present study considered this variable as a determinant of mnwc in fact it was assumed that when farmers were more attached to their workplaces and farming they would feel more committed to water conservation vorkinn and riese 2001 also confirmed this claim and stated that people with a strong attachment to an area likely disagreed with the degradation of the environment and natural resources it should be noted that concepts and descriptions of pat differ in different academic disciplines and each has its own perspective according to a study by halpenny 2010 pat was defined as a bond with a particular place here agricultural land and the farmers living place which had functional place dependence pde cognitive place identity pid and effective place affect paf aspects this study defined pde as a functional attachment to a place stokols and shumaker 1981 halpenny 2010 as demonstrated by stokols and shumaker 1981 pat is determined by two elements including the qualities of a particular place and the relative quality of comparable alternative places individuals and groups evaluate places in terms of functionality that is the extent to which they enable the execution of certain activities therefore pat conceptually refers to a conative domain in this study and includes individuals behavioral actions and attitudes toward a place proshansky 1978 defined pid as aspects of self which define personal identity in communication with physical environment using the complex patterns of conscious and unconscious ideas beliefs preferences feelings values objectives behavioral desires and environmental skills in general pid is an important determinant that helps to reinforce self identity and build adapt their experiences to different physical environments this factor is also defined as the symbolically important connection between the individual and setting the individual and natural world and psychological investment with a situation that has developed over time finally extensive interaction with one place can lead to pid by creating pde halpenny 2010 many authors of environmental psychology including giuliani 2003 and valizadeh et al 2018a referred to the importance of paf as an aspect of people s bond to places this effective bond has been attracted by researchers in the fields of resource management ecology and outdoor recreation entertainment according to the authors observations paf or individual affections toward a particular place was considered as the third minor aspect of pat according to the good farmer identity theory proposed by burton 2004 mcguire et al 2015 lequin et al 2019 farmers are divided into two categories of the proid and conid ones proid farmers had greater emphasis on their farms productivity morton et al 2017 and conid farmers prioritized the pro environmental symbols of successful agriculture including nutrient management and group and community collaboration lequin et al 2019 in addition mcguire indicated that farmers who considered high levels of agricultural production as the main criterion of being a good farmer had less awareness of the consequences of water scarcity mcguire et al 2013 lequin et al 2019 consequently these farmers had less responsibility to improve their behavior efficacy for conserving water on their farms sheban 2014 they usually evaluate different aspects of water conservation based on the productivity economic aspect of production and effectiveness of these activities for their personal purposes hence if farmers perceived very high personal costs for water conservation then they would have less desire for water conservation behaviors and may even disagree with it in contrast conid farmers evaluate water conservation generally based on the costs and benefits to the environment society and so forth in this regard some experts mcguire et al 2013 2015 ives and kendal 2014 valizadeh et al 2018b lequin et al 2019 argued that individuals who pay more attention to animal welfare ecosystem improvement and interests of other people than increasing production and economic benefits of the farms have higher awareness of the consequences of their misbehaviors and thus exhibit pro environmental behaviors such as water conservation behavior mohammadi mehr et al 2018 bijani et al 2019 veisi et al 2020 valizadeh et al 2020 ataei et al 2020 in order to summarize the theoretical and empirical literature and configure the theoretical framework it should be mentioned that aspects of the pat and farmers proid and conid were the main independent variables of this study whose effects on the iwc were investigated however since many studies showed that pat and farmers identity initially led to the activation of the iwc antecedents such as moral norms this variable was considered a mediating variable between aspects of pat farmers identity and iwc fig 1 therefore hypotheses of the study are as follows hypothesis 1 pde has a significant positive effect on mnwc hypothesis 2 pid has a significant positive effect on mnwc hypothesis 3 paf has a significant positive effect on mnwc hypothesis 4 mnwc has a significant positive effect on iwc hypothesis 5 proid has a significant negative effect on mnwc hypothesis 6 proid has a significant negative effect on iwc hypothesis 7 conid has a significant positive effect on mnwc hypothesis 8 conid has a significant positive effect on iwc 3 materials and methods this was an applied study with a descriptive correlational and causal relational approach statistical population of the study included farmers in mahabad and miandoab counties in west azarbaijan province iran n 36183 fig 2 the sample size was estimated to be 380 cases based on the sampling table proposed by krejcie and morgan 1970 the farmers were selected by the stratified random sampling method with a proportionate allocation there were three main reasons for using the stratified random sampling method first the variance between the strata villages sub counties and counties varied in terms of the number of farmers therefore in order to properly distribute the samples between different strata it was necessary to use this sampling method the second reason for using stratified random sampling method was related to the fact that there were significant similarities inside the strata in terms of various features such as agricultural practicing method use of water conservation technologies and so on for example in some subcounties farmers were more intent to use water conservation technologies and in some subcounties farmers were more intent to repair the old canals the third reason was the economic constraints and sampling accuracy in other words stratified random sampling method allows the researcher to classify the study community in such a way that research costs are reduced furthermore the low variance inside the floors increases the accuracy of sampling in implementation process of the sampling method after determining the total sample size the study area was first divided into two strata according to the division by iran statistical center miandoab and mahabad counties were considered as the separate strata then the number of samples was estimated according to the size of the intended population in each of these strata then each county was subdivided into a number of sub counties collection of villages according to the country divisions miandoab county has 11 sub counties and mahabad county has 5 sub counties subsequently two villages were randomly selected from each of these sub counties finally a proportional random sample of farmers was selected from each village table 1 reports the details on the population size and samples a questionnaire was used as the instrument of the study face validity of the questionnaire was confirmed by a panel of experts the panel members were experts researchers and specialists who conducted extensive research in the field of environmental psychology and water conservation behaviors intentions in order to identify the panel member and ensure that they have the sufficient expertise needed to evaluate the questionnaire various publications on environmental psychology and water conservation behaviors intentions published by iranian researchers in international and persian journals were first searched by carefully examining these documents the most relevant works to the topic of the present study were screened eight researchers whose works had more to do with the present study and did a lot of research in this field were selected as members of the panel of experts then the initial version of the designed questionnaire was presented to them in person upon receiving feedback from panelists on face and content validities the research team held two meetings to reach a consensus on experts feedback after correcting the questionnaire based on the opinions of experts the questionnaire was prepared for the pilot phase therefore a pilot study including 30 farmers was conducted data collection of the pilot study was carried out by the first author collected data were introduced to the spss24 for primary evaluation of the results and calculation of cronbach s alpha coefficient to determine the reliability of the questionnaire table 2 represents the main variables and final cronbach s alpha coefficients resulting from pilot data for different parts of the instrument the pilot study had several important results the first result was that the variables proid conid and iwc had cronbach s alpha values ranging from 0 6 to 0 7 but with the removal of some items the alpha values for proid and iwc reached an acceptable level greater than 0 7 one one and two items were removed from proid conid and iwc variables respectively however the alpha value for conid reached a maximum value of 0 65 after removal of one item it should be mentioned that the views on setting acceptable values for cronbach s alpha vary although most statisticians believe that the minimum acceptable value for alpha is 0 7 others hulin et al 2001 habibpour gatabi and safari shali 2009 van griethuijsen et al 2015 ursachi et al 2015 taber 2017 believe that values of 0 6 and higher are also acceptable the second result was that some respondents had problems in understanding some of the concepts and words used in the research tool for example the item tendency to pay for water conservation was one of these cases in which some respondents asked the interviewer to read it again or provide more explanations to solve this problem examples of farmers payments for water conservation were attached to the item to facilitate its understanding following making these revisions the questionnaire was prepared for the main survey phase the third and one of the most important results of the pilot study was that a multi cultural data collection team had to be formed to conduct the main survey project given that the study area had two ethnic groups turks and kurds the formation of such a team was essential to establish effective communication with the participants and gather credible data in this regard in order to deal with the obstacles related to the diverse cultures languages and customs in the study area a multi cultural data collection team was formed prior to the main survey the fourth result was that the pilot study helped to estimate the time and cost required to conduct the main research in order to evaluate the construct validity of the measures convergent validity was examined using the composite reliability cr average variance extracted ave and standardized factor loadings of the items these evaluation criteria were calculated and confirmed for different parts of the questionnaire in two steps in the first step the values of cr and ave were manually calculated using equations 1 and 2 1 a v e i 1 n λ i 2 i 1 n λ i 2 i 1 n σ 2 c r i 1 n λ i 2 i 1 n λ i 2 i 1 n σ i 2 where λ is the standardized factor loading n refers to the frequency of the items of latent variables and σ represents the error variance of the items according to brinckmann 2008 acceptable cut offs for cr and ave were cr 0 7 and ave 0 5 cr and ave calculation showed that their cut offs were acceptable pid ave 0 74 cr 0 82 paf ave 0 61 cr 0 79 pde ave 0 68 cr 0 86 iwc ave 0 71 cr 0 75 mnwc ave 0 76 cr 0 82 proid ave 0 59 cr 0 75 and conid ave 0 51 cr 0 72 respectively in the second step the reliability of manually calculated values of cr and ave was proved by measurement model estimation of amos20 statistical package as it was previously mentioned standardized factor loading of items is another criteria for construct validity acceptable cut offs for factor loadings are equal to or greater than 0 5 estimation of the measurement model of constructs using first order confirmatory factor analysis showed that all factor loadings have values greater than 0 5 therefore the construct and convergent validity of the research tool was confirmed furthermore the discriminant validity of the variables was examined using the average shared squared variance asv and the maximum shared squared variance msv examination of discriminant validity using asv and msv criteria has been emphasized by hair et al 1998 they argue that in order to test the discriminant validity the ave for each variable must be larger than asv and msv the main dependent variable in this study was iwc iwc is defined as the extent to which farmers intend to involve in pro environmental behaviors like agricultural water conservation yazdanpanah et al 2015 the variable mnwc which was also considered as a mediator variable in this study refers to a feeling of personal commitment to involvement collaboration in a particular action schwartz 1977 pde pid paf proid and conid were the five main independent variables with a fundamental role in activation of mnwc according to the definitions provided by halpenny 2010 pde is the farmers functional attachment to their farms and agricultural lands however pid represents the internalized beliefs about a particular place that structures the farmers experiences in different physical environments moreover paf refers to the emotions and feelings of an individual farmer towards a particular place proid and conid refer to the farmers self concepts in agricultural activities and water resource utilization morton et al 2017 lequin et al 2019 table 2 presents the number of items used to operationalize these variables and their sources it should also be noted that the five point likert scale 0 strongly disagree 1 disagree 2 neither agree nor disagree 3 agree and 4 strongly agree was used to measure and operationalize all iwc mnwc pde pid paf proid and conid variables other variables of the study included gender age education irrigation method and type of land ownership in the research studies having at least one dependent and independent variable structural equation modeling sem should be done through two distinctive tests in the first step the measurement models of the study variable should be estimated this process is carried out using first and or second order confirmatory factor analysis the aim of this step is to evaluate the convergent validity divergent validity and reliability of the studied constructs in the present study first order confirmatory factor analysis was employed with the maximum likelihood method however regarding that the study s theoretical framework consists of several independent variables and a dependent variable in the second step of sem the structural model of the variables was tested in other words in the second step of sem the structural relationship among the latent variables was examined it is also worth mentioning that the structural model of sem includes total direct model and mediation indirect structural models total direct structural model is employed for the modeling frameworks which do not have variable s mediating the relationship between dependent and independent variables regarding that the framework of this study had a mediating variable mnwc mediation indirect structural model was employed to test the hypothesis the data were collected through face to face interviews with farmers out of 380 distributed questionnaires 350 questionnaires were collected out of which 15 questionnaires were excluded due to the missing data finally 335 questionnaires were analyzed with the response rate of 88 15 and spss24 and amos20 were used to analyze data before the analysis process the normality of data was examined using multivariate normality assessment methods multivariate normality can be measured in many ways but mardia s coefficients of multivariate skewness and kurtosis are most commonly used in sem software in amos20 only mardia s coefficients of multivariate skewness and kurtosis are available thus a sample can be considered to be multivariate normally distributed at the 0 05 level of significance when the critical ratio is smaller than 1 96 indicating that the coefficient of multivariate kurtosis is not significantly different from zero mardia 1970 4 results and discussion 4 1 descriptive statistics of individual and professional variables of the respondents the mean age of the respondents was 42 5 years and most of them 38 8 were in the age range from 30 to 45 years about 93 of them were male and 6 were female it was found that 76 6 of the farmers irrigated their agricultural land using the flood irrigation method 15 7 utilized the rain fed farming method and 7 7 used drip irrigation method to irrigate their land the average number of the respondents years of education was 7 years analysis of the respondents by the education level indicated that most of them had a moderate to lower education xi 10 years the findings showed that 70 3 of the respondents owned the land wherein they were farming and 29 7 of them used the tenant farming 4 2 correlation between variables pearson correlation coefficient was used to examine the relationships between variables table 3 results obtained from the correlation analysis indicated that three components of pde including pde r 0 370 p 0 01 pid r 0 496 p 0 01 and paf r 0 322 p 0 01 had significant positive correlations with mnwc these findings were consistent with the results reported by hallaj 2017 and halpenny 2010 moreover a significant positive correlation was found between conid and mnwc r 0 429 p 0 01 however proid had a significant negative correlation with mnwc r 0 155 p 0 01 consequently the positive correlation of conid and negative correlation of proid with mnwc were supported by morton et al 2017 and sheban 2014 in addition the mnwc variable had a significant positive correlation with iwc r 0 598 p 0 01 this result was supported by the results obtained by rezaei et al 2019 and bijani et al 2019 furthermore conid showed a significant positive correlation with iwc r 0 658 p 0 01 however proid had a significant negative correlation with iwc r 0 277 p 0 01 finally it should be noted that the results reported by sheban 2014 and morton et al 2017 were in line with these results 4 3 measurement models estimation in sem in order to evaluate the convergent validity discriminant validity composite reliability and the fitness of the model the measurement models were estimated using first order confirmatory factor analysis table 4 the results revealed that the standardized factor loadings of all observed variables were significant and greater than the acceptable value of 0 5 furthermore as the results demonstrate the obtained values for cr and ave of all latent variables pid paf pde iwc mnwc proid and conid were greater than the acceptable cut offs of 0 7 and 0 5 respectively thus it can be concluded that the convergent validity and composite reliability of the research tool have been fulfilled in addition the results of sem measurement models revealed that the average shared squared variance asv and the maximum shared squared variance msv values for all variables are smaller than the ave values it means that the discriminant validity of the research instrument and variables are at a satisfactory level the results for multivariate normality assessment also revealed that mardia s coefficients of multivariate skewness and kurtosis are smaller than 1 96 this result means that the data do not have extreme violations and are normally distributed table 4 4 4 mediation indirect structural equation estimation in sem in this step of sem the structural relationships among the latent variables were examined regarding the fact that the variable mnwc was a mediating variable in the framework of this study fig 1 mediation indirect structural modeling approach was employed to test the hypothesis in order to accurately investigate the relationships between the variables first the standardized effects of the variables pde pid paf conid and proid on mnwc and iwc as the mediating variable were analyzed table 5 then the indirect and total effects of independent variables on iwc were analyzed table 6 in the end the fitness of the structural model was evaluated using structural equation modeling fit indices table 7 in addition fig 3 demonstrates the standardized form of mediation structural model with details of direct and indirect effects and fit indices 4 4 1 effects of independent variables on the mediator and dependent variables the results obtained from this study indicated that the above mentioned framework could predict 53 of the variance of iwc and 39 of the variance of mnwc table 5 and fig 3 investigation of the direct effects on iwc showed that mnwc β 0 41 p 0 001 and conid β 0 48 p 0 001 had positive and significant effects on iwc however proid variable had a significant negative effect on iwc β 0 16 p 0 019 in addition results showed that pde β 0 21 p 0 001 pid β 0 34 p 0 049 paf β 0 19 p 0 005 and conid β 0 23 p 0 013 had significant effects on mnwc finally it was found that proid β 0 05 n s had no significant effect on mnwc 4 4 2 indirect effects and total effects of independent variables on iwc we investigated indirect standardized effects of the independent variables on the dependent variable of iwc using mediation structural equation modeling and showed that variables of pde 0 086 pid 0 139 paf 0 078 proid 0 020 and conid 0 094 indirectly affected the iwc table 6 moreover according to the results of structural model the pid variable had a greater indirect standardized effect on the iwc than the other variables in the theoretical framework then we calculated total effects of the independent variables and revealed that conid 0 574 mnwc 0 410 proid 0 180 and pid 0 139 had the greatest total effects on the iwc table 6 4 4 3 examining the fit indices of mediation indirect structural model regarding that employing sem with no mention of fitness indices for the model is inappropriate and unreliable they were used to assess the suitability of the model in general the goodness of fit index gfi and the adjusted goodness of fit index agfi representing fit measures between the hypothesized model and the observed covariance matrix were higher than 0 9 gfi 0 952 agfi 0 910 in addition the bentler bonett s normed fit index nfi and the comparative fit index cfi had values above 0 9 nfi 0 971 cfi 0 972 which were indicative of appropriate data model fit it should be noted that the nfi examines the discrepancy between the chi square value of the hypothesized model and the null model and the cfi analyzes the difference between the data and the hypothesized model the root mean square error of approximation rmsea as another important fit index denoted a suitable and acceptable value rmsea 0 068 suitable values for this indicator should be less than 0 08 see browne and cudeck 1993 byrne 2010 in other words rmsea values less than 0 08 represent acceptable errors of approximation in the population the chi square normalized by degree of freedom df which should be less than the acceptable value of 5 was 2 45 detailed information about the fitness indices of model and acceptable cut offs were presented in table 7 5 conclusions and policy recommendations the general objective of this study was to determine the effects of pat and identity on the mnwc and iwc of the iranian farmers using a social psychological framework the results demonstrated that conid should be activated among farmers in order to reinforce the iwc and mnwc however proid should be inactivated as much as possible it was also found that identity or perceptions about characteristics of a good farmer were impressively affected by the society s perceptions about the criteria of a good farmer therefore it was suggested that social feedbacks and the value that agricultural community considers for a conservationist farmer should be used as a starting point for shifting proid to conid such shifts in the farmers identity could lead to rethinking and redefining the mnwc and applying the best water conservation behaviors however in order to be successful in this field practitioners change agents of agricultural extension and other institutions involved in the water resources management should be aware of the importance of conid and its role in activating the farmers mnwc and iwc in other words they should institutionalize these perceptions in their activities and programs hence communication strategies are of high importance in interventions related to the reinforcement of mnwc and iwc therefore it is recommended that agricultural extension practitioners and other water resource management actors choose their strategies based on the identity of the target farmers conid or proid for example in communication with the conservationist farmers they should focus on increasing awareness of consequences perception of risk and self efficacy that represent the negative effects of non conservation behaviors on the water resources ecosystem and agricultural community however in communication with the productivist farmers interventors should emphasize the pro production aspects of agriculture and water conservation such as increasing production in the long term and expanding the area under cultivation in the future the results of the study indicated the significant positive effect of pde and its aspects on the mnwc and iwc therefore rather than reducing agricultural activities which were practically ineffective and expanded agricultural activities by non indigenous farmers it is necessary to modify the cultivation and irrigation patterns and diversify the livelihood activities of the farmers in the region e g development of both livestock and agricultural activities this can increase the attractiveness of the rural agricultural areas in comparison with the urban areas and consequently can lower migration to cities and enhance pde of farmers finally the entry of non indigenous profiteering farmers into the region could be largely prevented with regard to the direct effects on the iwc it was found that mnwc had the highest predictive power this finding revealed the possible importance of the mnwc in explaining and strengthening iwc in other words some of the issues and problems related to the agricultural water in the study area could be improved by creating moral structures and norms among farmers in many circumstances problems related to water scarcity in society refer to the morality issues and the fact that farmers did not consider water conservation as a moral task therefore it is suggested that administrators of the organizations such as agricultural extension organization and the public participation units of iran ministry of energy who directly work on behavioral changes in the agricultural communities pay more attention to the creation and reinforcement of the moral norms in the agricultural communities this could be done through face to face communication with farmers in the training classes and courses so that the relevant discussions and discourses could convince them to accept that water conservation activities are inherently correct and moral if this process can be done successfully it will lead to the activation of the farmers iwc in general it should be mentioned that the social psychological framework proposed in this study provides practitioners decision makers policymakers researchers and other stakeholders of the agricultural water management with useful practical and theoretical insights about the practices of behavior changes and social interventions in other words this study and the introduced framework can be useful for the above mentioned end users in some respects first this model focuses their attention on the importance or key role that the variables pde farmers identity and iwc could play in the analysis of the farmers water conservation behaviors however in many previous studies conducted on water conservation behaviors they have been ignored secondly the framework suggested in the study plays a significant role in clarifying and increasing knowledge about the complex mechanisms existing among the social psychological variables in other words the present study configured some dynamic social psychological variables combined them with the environmental challenge of water conservation and obtained a simple framework with certain relationships that provided the users with a clear understanding of the relationships between these variables and also facilitated the processes of a social behavioral intervention in summation confirmation of the importance of farmers place attachment and identity in affecting moral norms and intention of water conservation is the main take home message of this study the effects of place attachment and farmers identity on farmers water conservation related norms and intention have never been investigated therefore the present study opens a new research window in the field of water conservation science to research upon the potential contributions of place attachment identity moral norms and intention to the discourse of sustainable water resources management 5 1 study limitations and suggestions for future research similar to other studies there were significant limitations in the present study the first limitation was the wide range of psychological and social variables that could affect mnwc and iwc in other words this study investigated only the effect of different aspects of pat and farmers identity on mnwc and iwc it should be noted that mnwc and iwc can also be affected by other social economic psychological cultural and even political variables therefore it is suggested that future researchers consider this issue in their studies and investigate the effect of other variables on mnwc and iwc the second limitation is related to the methodology used in the study due to the economic constraints only the questionnaire and cross sectional survey were used for data collection however the examination of the farmers mnwc and iwc using the qualitative methods such as in depth interviews grounded theory case study mixed methods and so forth may provide more realistic insights into their aspects and determinants these methods could even be used with before employing the quantitative methods for example instead of using the review of literature and outsiders perspectives to develop the items and scales of the research variables the farmers own comments insiders perspectives can be utilized for this purpose in this case there would be fewer difficulties with the gap between the researchers perception and farmers the subjects perceptions and accordingly the results would be closer to the realities in the agricultural community the third limitation was that the conceptual framework introduced in the study could predict 53 of the changes in the dependent variable iwc thus future research should search for other psychological social economic and structural variables to increase the explanation of farmers iwc the fourth limitation is related to the sample size used in the study although the size of the sample used in this study was completely sufficient based on the sampling table proposed by krejcie and morgan future researchers can use a larger sample size this can increase the robustness and generalization capability of the results ethical standards please pay attention to the following the authors also
