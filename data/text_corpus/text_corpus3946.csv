19730,with the accelerated application of ceo2 nanoparticles nps wastewater treatment plants will increasingly receive ceo2 nps thus inevitably causing ceo2 nps to encounter microaggregates here we comprehensively elucidate the responses in the structural physicochemical and microbial properties of wastewater biofilms to chronic exposure 75 days to different ceo2 nps concentrations with a particular emphasis on the protective mechanisms of stratified extracellular polymeric substances epss chronic exposure to 0 1 mg l ceo2 nps boosted the content and broadened the distribution of α d glucopyranose polysaccharides ps while the sharply increased production and breadth of β d glucopyranose ps forming a formidable shield was a response to 10 mg l ceo2 nps after the bacteria were exposed to ceo2 nps loosely bound epss lb epss aggregated into macromolecules increasing in apparent molecular weight amw but at a lower abundance whereas the average amw in tightly bound epss tb epss decreased the acetyl content and α helix 3 turn helix β sheet value of tb epss increased to resist ceo2 nps furthermore long term exposure to ceo2 nps decreased cell viability reduced microbial diversity and shifted the microbial composition n acylated l homoserine lactone concentrations increased with increased density of pseudomonas which was associated with ps regulated control thus promoting ps production in epss in response to ceo2 nps these results expand the understanding of how microaggregates resist environmental stress caused by nps graphical abstract image 1 keywords cerium dioxide nanoparticles stratified extracellular polymeric substances production and spatial distribution physicochemical and microbial properties n acylated l homoserine lactones 1 introduction due to their distinct chemical and physical properties engineered nanoparticles nps have been rapidly commercialized and broadly applied in past decades nps are inevitably released into industrial and domestic wastewater treatment plants wwtps during their production utilization and disposal wagner et al 2014 you et al 2017 as nps enter wwtps these particularly small particles can induce cytotoxicity in microorganisms reducing the performance of the wastewater treatment and thus leading to long term environmental and health risks tou et al 2017 xu et al 2017 jeannet et al 2016 as one of the most important microbial aggregates in wwtps biofilms have complex three dimensional structures because high densities of cells are embedded in a self produced matrix of hydrated extracellular polymeric substances epss stewart and franklin 2008 flemming and wingender 2010 at the microscopic level biofilms can be divided into an outer region of loosely bound epss lb epss an inner region of tightly bound epss tb epss and the core bacterial cells you et al 2015 2017 it is widely accepted that epss provide architecture stability and protection for biofilms sheng and liu 2011 flemming and wingender 2010 you et al 2015 however interactions with nps induce complex variations in the physicochemical properties of epss you et al 2015 hou et al 2016 decreasing the stability of the biofilm system previous studies demonstrated that acute exposure to nps increased epss production to resist nps intrusion you et al 2015 2016 furthermore the proteins pro and polysaccharides ps acting as the dominant components in epss accumulated at the outer layer of anaerobic granular sludge to cope with carbon nanotubes and iron oxide nanoparticles ambuchi et al 2017 li et al 2015 therefore the functional properties and spatial structure of epss are crucial for understanding the response of biofilms to the presence of nps unfortunately knowledge regarding the responsive mechanisms of epss especially the spatial distribution of pro and ps in biofilms after their exposure to nps is still lagging despite of the physical protection of epss in biofilms exposure to nps which are expected in the environment shifted bacterial community structures sheng and liu 2011 tlili et al 2017 battin et al 2009 in addition microbial community interactions play significant roles in controlling the antimicrobial effects of ag nps sheng and liu 2011 detailed information about not only the properties and structures of stratified epss but also microbial community interactions is urgently needed to comprehensively understand how biofilms respond to nps some bacterial species are believed to produce quorum sensing qs signaling molecules to promote cell cell communication in microbial communities shrout and nerenberg 2012 garcía contreras et al 2015 qs controls a variety of behavior and the expression of several phenotypes including biofilm formation virulence and epss production shrout and nerenberg 2012 qs typically involves production of chemical signal molecules that are highly related to the bacterial density in this sense we hypothesized that qs signaling might be affected by nps and as a result the connection between responsive epss production and the shifted microbial communities could be established through the affected qs signaling however the potential relationship between epss and microbial communities much less in the presence of nps has not been described in the literature here ceo2 nps were chosen as the model nps based on our previous studies you et al 2015 2017 in the present work we aim to comprehensively elucidate the responses of wastewater biofilms in a sequencing batch biofilm reactor sbbr to ceo2 nps exposure this study specifically investigated i the production and spatial distribution of epss with and without the addition of ceo2 nps ii the physicochemical characteristics of stratified epss in terms of their apparent molecular weight amw distribution their amino acid aa content and a spectroscopic analysis of the epss after ceo2 nps treatment iii the microbial community shift in response to ceo2 nps and iv the qs signaling responses via n acylated l homoserine lactones ahls after bacterial exposure to ceo2 nps 2 materials and methods 2 1 ceo2 nps and biofilm culturing ceo2 nanopowder was purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa the properties of the ceo2 nps were identical to those used in our previous studies you et al 2016 xu et al 2017 and detailed information was provided in the supporting information si biofilms were cultured in sbbrs with a working volume of 3 l which were filled with combined packing acting as carriers for microorganism attachment the activated sludge was taken from a secondary sedimentation tank at the jiangning municipal wwtp in nanjing china after pre aeration for 24 h the sludge was inoculated into each reactor at a concentration of 3 5 g l biomass during the culturing period each cycle consisted of a 2 min filling phase 5 h aeration recirculation 3 h anaerobic reaction and 5 min draining synthetic wastewater details in the si was then added into the reactor with a predetermined chemical oxygen demand cod 250 mg l total nitrogen tn 27 mg l and total phosphorus tp 6 25 mg l 2 2 exposure experiments and eps extraction exposure experiments were conducted when the removal of cod tn and tp in reactors reached a stable state in this experiment 0 1 mg l ceo2 nps was used as the environmentally relevant concentration in wastewater systems according to zhang et al 2011 and limbach et al 2008 in view of the rapid increase and growth in the use of ceo2 nps an estimated 7500 to 10000 t year 1 the global market for nanomaterials 2002 2016 2012 and considering other models of entry i e accidental release from a production facility a concentration of 10 mg l ceo2 nps was also considered sendra et al 2017 xu et al 2017 for the experiments 1 5 l of synthetic wastewater double the culturing concentration was fed into each reactor then a stock solution of 500 mg l ceo2 nps was prepared and stock solution volumes of 0 0 6 and 60 ml were subsequently injected into each reactor which were marked sbbr0 sbbr1 and sbbr2 respectively thereafter deionized water was added to yield a final volume of 3 l in each reactor the ceo2 nps exposure experiments lasted 75 days the desired concentrations of ceo2 nps in the influent were achieved by mixing a ceo2 nps stock suspension with synthetic wastewater and feeding this solution to the sbbr in each cycle at the end of the batch experiments lb epss and tb epss were extracted using a method including centrifugation sonication and thermal extraction processes details in the si you et al 2017 the epss fractions were stored at 20 c before analysis 2 3 multiple fluorescent staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm imaging using a multiple color staining technique and clsm together visualized the spatial distribution of epss components in microbial aggregates chen et al 2006 adav et al 2010 after their exposure to ceo2 nps biofilm samples were taken from their carriers and placed on slides the samples were then fixed with 2 5 glutaraldehyde for 12 h followed by their fluorescent staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc sigma st louis mo concanavalin a con a invitrogen life science usa and calcofluor white cw sigma st louis mo to visualize pro and α and β d glucopyranose ps respectively li et al 2015 chen et al 2007 in brief 100 μl of 0 1 m nahco3 buffer was added to the samples to retain the amine group in its non protonated form chen et al 2007 thereafter 50 μl of 1 g l fitc dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide was added and the solution was incubated at room temperature for 1 h next 100 μl of 250 mg l con a dissolved in 0 1 m nahco3 solution was added and the sample was incubated for 30 min followed by the addition of 100 μl of 300 mg l cw and incubation for another 30 min after the samples were stained they were washed with phosphate buffered saline ph 7 2 to remove excess stain finally the internal structure of stained samples was observed through a clsm nikon a1 japan the excitation emission wavelengths used to observe fitc con a and cw were 488 520 green 561 580 red and 400 435 nm blue respectively chen et al 2007 adav et al 2010 in addition viable cells were stained by syto 9 and fluoresced green while dead cells were stained by propidium iodide and fluoresced red for a semi quantitative description of the spatial correlations among the probed substances in the acquired clsm images a matlab program was used to convert the original color 2 d images of each layer to gray images with pixel values between 0 black and 255 white based on the method in the paper of adav et al 2010 and the pixel value of each point 807 807 was subsequently extracted and used for analysis 2 4 eps physicochemical property analysis extracted lb epss and tb epss were analyzed to determine their total organic carbon toc pro and ps content in the manner that had been previously described you et al 2015 hou et al 2016 the amw distribution of epss was measured using gel permeation chromatography gpc la 20 ad shimadzu japan equipped with a shodex ohpak sb 805 hq gel chromatography column the spectroscopic analyses of epss i e uv vis absorption spectra and fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy were performed using a uv vis nir spectrophotometer uv 3600 shimadzu japan and an ft ir instrument tensor 27 bruker germany additionally the degree of acetylation and the secondary structure of pro were further calculated based on you et al 2017 and seoudi and nada 2007 besides samples were hydrolyzed to analyze the aa composition of pro in epss details in si pérez and susa 2017 2 5 microbe examination biofilm samples 0 5 g were harvested at the end of exposure experiments from each sbbr system and immediately stored at 20 c until their dna was extracted dna was extracted using an e z n a soil dna kit omega d5625 01 usa based on the manufacturer s instructions the concentrations of the extracted dna were determined by 0 8 w v agarose gel electrophoresis the microbial communities in biofilms in the presence or absence of ceo2 nps were analyzed by an illumina miseq platform according to standard protocols and were conducted by guangdong magigene biotechnology co ltd china detailed information was also provided in the si 2 6 assays to quantify ahl signal molecules and statistical analysis the level of ahl content in biofilm samples before and after eps extraction was determined using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa kit nanjing senbeijia biological technology co ltd china the samples were added to and reacted with horseradish peroxidase labeled antibody n 5 carboxypentanoyl l homoserine lactone was diluted in carbonate buffer and 3 3 5 5 tetramethylbenzidine substrate was added for coloration the reaction was then stopped by the addition of 2 m h2so4 finally elisa absorbance measurements at 450 nm were performed with a microplate reader chen et al 2010 all assays were conducted with at least three replicates for statistical analysis the experimental values were compared to their corresponding control values statistical analysis t test was performed to test the significance of results and p 05 was considered to be statistically significant as similar described by hou et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 structural characteristics of epss in wastewater biofilms the production of stratified epss in biofilms after exposure to ceo2 nps was shown in fig s1 the lb epss content gradually increased from 16 93 3 43 to 25 29 3 62 mg toc l p 05 while the tb epss content which was much higher than that of lb epss declined from 117 72 9 96 to 99 25 4 31 mg toc l p 05 as the ceo2 nps concentration increased indicating that ceo2 nps caused different degrees of variation in the depth of biofilm the production of epss expressed as the sum of lb epss and tb epss slightly decreased by 7 51 p 05 after exposure to 10 mg l ceo2 nps this result suggested that long term exposure to ceo2 nps negatively affected the production of epss which is opposite to the acute responses that observed in our previous studies specifically that enhanced epss production prevented ceo2 nps toxicity you et al 2015 although chronic exposure to nps could lead to the adaptation of bacteria in biofilms to the adverse environment hou et al 2016 a slight decrease in epss content revealed the potential negative effects of ceo2 nps on the microbial community since the epss matrix is secreted by microorganisms to further characterize epss production the amount of pro and ps in stratified epss was determined and shown in fig s2 the total lb epss and tb epss content expressed by adding pro and ps together followed a pattern similar to that in fig s1 in sbbr 2 the pro concentration in lb epss and tb epss declined to 85 77 p 05 and 72 92 p 05 of the control value while the concentration of ps was 33 00 p 05 and 25 65 p 05 higher than that in control the different responses of pro and ps concentrations in epss might be attributed to their different functions when exposed to ceo2 nps and the increased ps content could act as a protective barrier for cells against the harsh environment flemming and wingender 2010 flemming 2016 basuvaraj et al 2015 the decreased pro content in epss may have negatively impacted the microbial physicochemical and physiological properties flemming and wingender 2010 han et al 2017 the images fig 1 obtained through the triple staining clsm technique showed that biofilms were morphologically heterogenous with pro and α and β d glucopyranose ps being clearly detectable in individual samples as shown in fig 1 a and d pro in green was dominant and aggregated into clusters the α d glucopyranose ps in red was dispersed throughout the field of view the β d glucopyranose ps in blue was the least dense and appeared in a few spots after the cells were chronically exposed to 0 1 mg l ceo2 nps the density of α d glucopyranose ps obviously increased fig 1 b and e however when the dosage of ceo2 nps increased to 10 mg l the β d glucopyranose ps content fig 1 c and f dramatically increased and became the dominant component suggesting that 0 1 and 10 mg l of ceo2 nps elicited different protective mechanisms the increased intensities of α and β d glucopyranose ps could be the reason for the enhanced ps content shown in fig s2 in addition the videos of these samples in the si showed that the pro was located at the center of the vertical distributions z stack of the biofilms which was consistent with the results of mcswain et al 2005 in contrast the α and β d glucopyranose ps in the ceo2 np treated biofilms were heterogeneously distributed across the biofilm depths so that the ps played an important role in supporting the structural integrity of the matrix lux et al 2004 also reported that exopolysaccharide components form a scaffold within fruiting body architecture during aggregation of myxococcus xanthus as illustrated in fig 2 a b and c the semi quantitative analysis of the 3 d clsm images exhibited that the total pixel values increased exponentially once stained substances were detected and until the brightest layer was reached then sharply decreased to near zero the calculated distribution of each component in the presence and absence of ceo2 nps were well fitted r 2 0 99 by the exponentially modified gaussian emg model as follows grushka 1972 1 f 1 x a t 0 e x t 0 2 f 2 x 1 w 2 π e x x c 2 2 w 2 3 z x x c w w t 0 4 f x y 0 f 1 f 2 x y 0 a t 0 e 1 2 w t 0 2 x x c t 0 z 1 2 π e y 2 2 d y where y0 represents the offset a is the area of the curve xc is the center w is the width and t0 represents the time constant of the exponential modifier the detailed parameters of the major epss components were obtained via the emg model and displayed in table 1 the total content of each component was further calculated by integrating the area beneath the emg model curve from 0 to the end and was shown in fig 2 d e and f fig 2 a and d showed that pro was mostly presented in the center of the biofilm whose thickness was approximately 60 μm in the control however with the addition of ceo2 nps the peak intensity of pro was obviously decreased and narrowed down which was also demonstrated by the decreased values of a and w in table 1 fig 2 b and e showed that 10 mg l ceo2 nps didn t change the production and distribution width of α d glucopyranose ps while treatment with 0 1 mg l ceo2 nps increased α d glucopyranose ps production by 35 13 beyond the values found in the control and broadened its distribution in the biofilm furthermore the xc of α d glucopyranose ps table 1 gradually increased from 21 17 to 29 27 μm indicating that α d glucopyranose ps shifted from the surface to the center of the biofilm in contrast to α d glucopyranose ps behavior the content of β d glucopyranose ps dramatically increased by 659 77 fig 2 f of the control value after long term exposure to 10 mg l ceo2 nps and the thickness correspondingly increased from 50 to 120 μm under these conditions fig 2 c the differences were also reflected by the changes of the parameters a and w the abovementioned results clearly demonstrated that the production and spatial structure of epss were affected by ceo2 nps enhanced ps production plays an important role in the protection of epss as a response to chronic ceo2 nps exposure 3 2 physicochemical characteristics of epss to assess the varied properties of key organic matters in epss responding to ceo2 nps amw distributions of epss were analyzed the amw distribution in lb epss was greatly different from that of tb epss fig s3 three peaks were observed in the lb epss distribution 1 48 104 9 15 104 and 1 69 107 da while the tb epss distribution exhibited four peaks 1005 1 66 105 1 11 107and 4 06 1010 da after the samples were exposed to ceo2 nps the three peaks of amw distributions in the lb epss had shifted to higher amw indicating that the organic matter aggregated into larger molecules however the four peaks of amw distributions in tb epss revealed that the organic matter was clearly converted into smaller molecules with greater peak intensities these distributions might be parts of the strategies for the survival of the microaggregates in the presence of ceo2 nps because the organic matter in the outer layer lb epss aggregated into macromolecules to form a shield against ceo2 nps however the macromolecular barrier also affected the mass transfer of nutrients you et al 2015 and as a result the organic matter in the inner layer tb epss was converted into smaller molecules to provide nutrients for the cells flemming and wingender 2010 the semi quantitative amw distributions were shown in table 2 the peak area of organic matter in lb epss decreased after its exposure to ceo2 nps while the percentage of each amw component was relatively constant in contrast the peak area of organic matter in tb epss generally increased compared to the value in the control moreover the percentage of the 6 104 106 da component in samples with 0 1 mg l ceo2 nps and that of the 108 1013 da component in samples with 10 mg l ceo2 nps clearly increased compared with the values of these components in the control samples from 41 73 to 48 81 and from 17 59 to 30 42 respectively these changes were consistent with the enhanced α and β d glucopyranose ps content and it may be inferred that α d glucopyranose polymerized to form biopolymers with amw near 105 da to cope with the presence of 0 1 mg l ceo2 nps whereas a great number of β d glucopyranose molecules were polymerized into polysaccharides with amw near 1010 da to resist 10 mg l ceo2 nps it is well known that aas are the main components of pro the aa composition and content were analyzed to reveal the specific types of pro involved in the interaction with nps and the results were shown in fig s4 in the control samples fourteen aas were detected in lb epss and lysine histidine and valine were dominant species with an increase in ceo2 nps concentrations the total aas content decreased from 26 60 1 03 to 26 55 0 99 and eventually reached 17 83 0 83 mg l which likely demonstrated the decreased pro content in the lb epss among these aas the sharp decline in lysine concentration was the major reason for the reduced pro content in lb epss jin et al 2014 reported that lysine being a strongly positively charged amino may lead to an interaction with ceo2 nps which are negatively charged in wastewater tyrosine and phenylalanine content reached to the zero while isoleucine was only detected in the presence of 10 mg l ceo2 nps the concentrations of aas in tb epss were much higher than those in lb epss and arginine and proline were detected in the fractions after exposure to ceo2 nps the aas content in tb epss decreased significantly p 05 which were consistent with the reduction of the pro production in tb epss while the largest decrease occurred between the control and growth in the presence of 0 1 mg l ceo2 nps this result suggested that the aas especially glutamate and aspartate in tb epss were mainly affected by the ceo2 nps themselves rather than their dose the uv vis absorption spectra of epss fractions were illustrated in fig s5 the 190 nm peak from the lb epss sample is attributed to a π π transition of benzenoid and the peak from the tb epss sample at 280 nm is attributed to an n π transition of aromatic aas such as tryptophan tyrosine and phenylalanine havel 1996 both of these peaks in lb epss and tb epss remained unchanged after exposure to ceo2 nps indicating that the structure of the benzene ring in epss was too stable to interact with ceo2 nps ft ir analysis of the 4000 400 cm 1 region was performed to unravel the chemical structure of stratified epss after their exposure to ceo2 nps in fig s6 the bands at 3450 cm 1 o h stretching and 1650 cm 1 c o stretch associated with amide i in proteins were the two predominant peaks in epss spectra you et al 2017 yin et al 2015 compared with control experiments the intensity of the hydroxyl group band in epss greatly decreased in samples that had been exposed to ceo2 nps indicating that the hydroxyl groups were likely to interact with the nps the degree of acetylation is defined as the ratio 100 a1665 1 33 a3450 and can be used to explore the changes in major functional groups in epss seoudi and nada 2007 han et al 2017 as shown in fig s7 the acetylation of lb epss in the presence and absence of ceo2 nps was almost identical while the degree of acetylation in tb epss increased in the presence of nps the increased acetyl content could enhance the local stiffness of epss polymers due to the formation of intra chain h bond networks by acetyl groups yang et al 2016 rinaudo 2006 thus facilitating the formation of a 3 d epss structure to resist ceo2 nps the functional groups were divided into four regions based on the energy at which they absorbed and detailed information of these regions was presented in table s1 the peaks at 1120 and 1060 cm 1 as well as the fingerprint region 900 400 cm 1 perhaps associated with p o vibration of phosphodiesters were also affected by ceo2 nps because the nps stripped phosphate groups li et al 2014 according to badireddy et al 2008 and yin et al 2015 the secondary structure of proteins can be obtained from derivative spectra in the 1700 1600 cm 1 region fig s8 showed the curve fitting r 2 0 999 of the amide i band after samples were exposed to ceo2 nps and the results were summarized in table s2 though the content and aas composition of pro were decreased by ceo2 nps the secondary protein structure remained relatively constant even after chronic exposure to 10 mg l ceo2 nps however the α helix 3 turn helix β sheet value of tb epss gradually increased and a high percentage of helix structure could promote the formation of strong microcolony architecture to further adapt to ceo2 nps you et al 2017 hou et al 2015 through the variations of the characteristics of epss discussed above the results concluded in section 3 1 and the employment of epss in responding to the exposure of ceo2 nps can be further confirmed 3 3 microbial properties of wastewater biofilms the microbial populations and community structures of wastewater biofilms that were chronically exposed to ceo2 nps were examined the distribution of live and dead cells in wastewater biofilms was shown in fig s9 the clsm images clearly showed that the percentage of dead cells gradually increased with an increase of ceo2 nps concentration semi quantitative results also demonstrated that the bacteria were damaged by the ceo2 nps moreover the alpha diversity parameters obtained from the high throughput sequencing and summarized in table s3 showed that compared with the control both 0 1 and 10 mg l ceo2 nps could reduce the richness and diversity of the microbial community while 0 1 mg l ceo2 nps treatment exhibited more negative effects the rarefaction and rank abundance curves in fig s10 also confirmed that the microbial diversity in the 10 mg l nps sample was greater than that in the 0 1 mg l nps sample these results could be attributed to the chronic adaptation to low concentration 0 1 mg l resulting in the culturing of specific tolerant bacteria while the high concentration 10 mg l stimulated the microbial population to increase the resistance of biofilm to toxicants xu et al 2016 to further illustrate the response of microbial compositions in the presence of ceo2 nps the populations at the phyla level were identified in fig 3 a proteobacteria 51 51 tm7 20 82 bacteroidetes 11 83 acidobacteria 3 73 actinobacteria 3 46 and chloroflexi 3 05 were the dominant phyla in the control sample and were commonly found in wastewater treatment systems xu et al 2016 wang et al 2016 these predominant species contributed to the stability of biofilms with their functions and secreted epss lv et al 2014 the relative abundances of acidobacteria chloroflexi and planctomycetes tended to decrease in the presence of ceo2 nps for 75 days after exposure to 0 1 mg l ceo2 nps the total percentage of predominant phyla including proteobacteria tm7 bacteroidetes and actinobacteria increased from 87 62 to 95 57 which could be one reason for the decreased microbial diversity showed in table s3 further analysis of the microbial community profiles was conducted at the genus level fig 3b as nitrogen and phosphorus removal were primary goals in wastewater treatment the major genera in this study were associated with bacteria that remove nitrogen and phosphorus wang et al 2017 the relative abundance of the genus prosthecobacter which included ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob was enriched as the ceo2 nps concentration increased the abundance of genera capable of oxidizing nitrite to nitrate including devosia and salinibacterium increased while the abundance of nitrospira nitrite oxidizing bacteria was reduced when the samples were exposed to 10 mg l ceo2 nps the most dominant genus thermomonas included denitrifying bacteria dnb and was highly enriched in the presence of 0 1 mg l ceo2 nps possibly contributing to the changes at the phylum level the abundance of dnb from simplicispira and citrobacter decreased whereas the abundance of dnb from rhodobacter which were able to secrete epss lv et al 2014 increased after exposure to ceo2 nps in addition sediminibacterium as a glycogen accumulating organism gao was enriched while the abundance of gao from propionicimonas was reduced with the addition of ceo2 nps the present results indicated that ceo2 nps could shift the community structure of microbes especially the relative abundances of functional bacteria in wastewater biofilms although these phenomena could disturb functions in biofilm systems they could also be the adaptability of biofilm communities and the selection of diversity for microbe survival under a continuous load of ceo2 nps boles and singh 2008 szomolay et al 2005 harrison et al 2007 furthermore the epss which form a matrix produced by the bacteria themselves were probably altered because of changes in the microbial community in responses to ceo2 nps 3 4 ahl signals in wastewater biofilms information on qs revealed that qs was in reasonable agreement with the regulation of gene expression and the biosynthesis of epss to date ahl signal molecules are regarded as the predominant qs signaling pathways in gram negative bacteria shrout and nerenberg 2012 ahl producing bacteria are often isolated in aquatic environments and ahl signals have been detected in various wastewater treatment bioreactors yeon et al 2008 valle et al 2004 the genes regulated by the various ahl signals are widely variable for different bacterial species but many influence biofilm formation and structure shrout and nerenberg 2012 valle et al 2004 therefore the level of ahl content in wastewater biofilm systems was detected and presented in fig 4 a the ahl concentration in initial biofilms increased from 60 17 in sbbr 0 65 2 ng l in sbbr 1 p 05 and eventually increased to 71 22 ng l in sbbr 2 p 05 since the phenotypes such as epss production and exopolysaccharides are mediated through qs the increased ahl concentration probably contributed to the differences of eps production in the presence of ceo2 nps shrout and nerenberg 2012 yeon et al 2008 valle et al 2004 after the removal of epss the ahl content decreased by approximately 7 in comparison to the orginal epss samples indicating that the ahl signals are mostly present at the surface or inside of bacterial cells and are seldom trapped in the epss chong et al 2012 in addition ahls were detected in wastewater and their content increased with the ceo2 nps dose possibly due to a diffusion sensing interpretation with lower rates of mass transfer garcía contreras et al 2015 cornforth et al 2014 it has been proposed that when multiple qs molecules are secreted and differentially altered by the environment both the social cell density and physical mass transfer related to epss production environments of bacteria are affected cornforth et al 2014 for some bacteria the epss production is directly controlled by ahl qs shrout and nerenberg 2012 gilbert et al 2009 pseudomonas had been numerously studied and were demonstrated to be associated with qs regulated control of ps regulation shrout and nerenberg 2012 sakuragi and kolter 2007 in this study pseudomonas was identified fig 3b despite its low abundance although the pathways are often complex a universal feature is that a small group of qs producing bacteria play key roles shrout and nerenberg 2012 the number of effective sequence tags the sequence similarity 97 of pseudomonas increased from 17 to 20 and finally to 34 with gradual addition of ceo2 nps which was consistent with the trend in ahl abundance and promoted the production of ps in epss the above mentioned results clearly showed the responses of structural physicochemical and microbial properties of wastewater biofilms to chronic exposure to different ceo2 nps concentrations as schematically illustrated in fig 4b epss of biofilms were often the first barrier of microbial cells to contact with or resist against nps in aqueous environments zhang et al 2017 our works suggested the enhanced ps production probably converted the biofilms to rigid and formed a formidable protective shield against ceo2 nps fig 4b b which was consistent with li et al 2015 on the other hand long term exposure to ceo2 nps decreased cell viability reduced microbial diversity and shifted the microbial community structure fig 4b a what s more qs producing bacteria are likely to change through the microbial community fig 4b c and further affect the phenotypes e g ps production in the presence of ceo2 nps shrout and nerenberg 2012 yeon et al 2008 in this study the concentrations of ahl increased with the increased density of pseudomonas which was demonstrated to be associated with ps regulated control leading to greater ps content in epss in response to ceo2 nps fig 4b d 4 conclusions this study comprehensively elucidated the responses of structural physicochemical and microbial properties of wastewater biofilms to chronic exposure to different ceo2 nps concentrations the main conclusions of this study are more production and broader distribution of ps α d glucopyranose ps in 0 1 mg l ceo2 nps and β d glucopyranose ps in 10 mg l ceo2 nps were observed meanwhile the percentage of the high amw components and the local stiffness and α helix 3 turn helix β sheet value in tb epss increased after exposure to ceo2 nps these responses are likely to promote the formation of strong microcolony architecture to resist ceo2 nps long term exposure to ceo2 nps decreased cell viability reduced microbial diversity and shifted the microbial community structure this could affect the abundance of qs producing bacteria the concentrations of ahl signals increased with the number of effective sequence tags of pseudomonas this probably contributed to the greater ps content in epss in response to ceo2 nps finally this is the first attempt to gain the potential relationship between the microbial community and ps production via examining ahl qs signals in the presence of ceo2 nps this new knowledge gives us a better understanding of interactions between other types of nanoparticles and microaggregates in aquatic environments acknowledgment

19730,with the accelerated application of ceo2 nanoparticles nps wastewater treatment plants will increasingly receive ceo2 nps thus inevitably causing ceo2 nps to encounter microaggregates here we comprehensively elucidate the responses in the structural physicochemical and microbial properties of wastewater biofilms to chronic exposure 75 days to different ceo2 nps concentrations with a particular emphasis on the protective mechanisms of stratified extracellular polymeric substances epss chronic exposure to 0 1 mg l ceo2 nps boosted the content and broadened the distribution of α d glucopyranose polysaccharides ps while the sharply increased production and breadth of β d glucopyranose ps forming a formidable shield was a response to 10 mg l ceo2 nps after the bacteria were exposed to ceo2 nps loosely bound epss lb epss aggregated into macromolecules increasing in apparent molecular weight amw but at a lower abundance whereas the average amw in tightly bound epss tb epss decreased the acetyl content and α helix 3 turn helix β sheet value of tb epss increased to resist ceo2 nps furthermore long term exposure to ceo2 nps decreased cell viability reduced microbial diversity and shifted the microbial composition n acylated l homoserine lactone concentrations increased with increased density of pseudomonas which was associated with ps regulated control thus promoting ps production in epss in response to ceo2 nps these results expand the understanding of how microaggregates resist environmental stress caused by nps graphical abstract image 1 keywords cerium dioxide nanoparticles stratified extracellular polymeric substances production and spatial distribution physicochemical and microbial properties n acylated l homoserine lactones 1 introduction due to their distinct chemical and physical properties engineered nanoparticles nps have been rapidly commercialized and broadly applied in past decades nps are inevitably released into industrial and domestic wastewater treatment plants wwtps during their production utilization and disposal wagner et al 2014 you et al 2017 as nps enter wwtps these particularly small particles can induce cytotoxicity in microorganisms reducing the performance of the wastewater treatment and thus leading to long term environmental and health risks tou et al 2017 xu et al 2017 jeannet et al 2016 as one of the most important microbial aggregates in wwtps biofilms have complex three dimensional structures because high densities of cells are embedded in a self produced matrix of hydrated extracellular polymeric substances epss stewart and franklin 2008 flemming and wingender 2010 at the microscopic level biofilms can be divided into an outer region of loosely bound epss lb epss an inner region of tightly bound epss tb epss and the core bacterial cells you et al 2015 2017 it is widely accepted that epss provide architecture stability and protection for biofilms sheng and liu 2011 flemming and wingender 2010 you et al 2015 however interactions with nps induce complex variations in the physicochemical properties of epss you et al 2015 hou et al 2016 decreasing the stability of the biofilm system previous studies demonstrated that acute exposure to nps increased epss production to resist nps intrusion you et al 2015 2016 furthermore the proteins pro and polysaccharides ps acting as the dominant components in epss accumulated at the outer layer of anaerobic granular sludge to cope with carbon nanotubes and iron oxide nanoparticles ambuchi et al 2017 li et al 2015 therefore the functional properties and spatial structure of epss are crucial for understanding the response of biofilms to the presence of nps unfortunately knowledge regarding the responsive mechanisms of epss especially the spatial distribution of pro and ps in biofilms after their exposure to nps is still lagging despite of the physical protection of epss in biofilms exposure to nps which are expected in the environment shifted bacterial community structures sheng and liu 2011 tlili et al 2017 battin et al 2009 in addition microbial community interactions play significant roles in controlling the antimicrobial effects of ag nps sheng and liu 2011 detailed information about not only the properties and structures of stratified epss but also microbial community interactions is urgently needed to comprehensively understand how biofilms respond to nps some bacterial species are believed to produce quorum sensing qs signaling molecules to promote cell cell communication in microbial communities shrout and nerenberg 2012 garcía contreras et al 2015 qs controls a variety of behavior and the expression of several phenotypes including biofilm formation virulence and epss production shrout and nerenberg 2012 qs typically involves production of chemical signal molecules that are highly related to the bacterial density in this sense we hypothesized that qs signaling might be affected by nps and as a result the connection between responsive epss production and the shifted microbial communities could be established through the affected qs signaling however the potential relationship between epss and microbial communities much less in the presence of nps has not been described in the literature here ceo2 nps were chosen as the model nps based on our previous studies you et al 2015 2017 in the present work we aim to comprehensively elucidate the responses of wastewater biofilms in a sequencing batch biofilm reactor sbbr to ceo2 nps exposure this study specifically investigated i the production and spatial distribution of epss with and without the addition of ceo2 nps ii the physicochemical characteristics of stratified epss in terms of their apparent molecular weight amw distribution their amino acid aa content and a spectroscopic analysis of the epss after ceo2 nps treatment iii the microbial community shift in response to ceo2 nps and iv the qs signaling responses via n acylated l homoserine lactones ahls after bacterial exposure to ceo2 nps 2 materials and methods 2 1 ceo2 nps and biofilm culturing ceo2 nanopowder was purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa the properties of the ceo2 nps were identical to those used in our previous studies you et al 2016 xu et al 2017 and detailed information was provided in the supporting information si biofilms were cultured in sbbrs with a working volume of 3 l which were filled with combined packing acting as carriers for microorganism attachment the activated sludge was taken from a secondary sedimentation tank at the jiangning municipal wwtp in nanjing china after pre aeration for 24 h the sludge was inoculated into each reactor at a concentration of 3 5 g l biomass during the culturing period each cycle consisted of a 2 min filling phase 5 h aeration recirculation 3 h anaerobic reaction and 5 min draining synthetic wastewater details in the si was then added into the reactor with a predetermined chemical oxygen demand cod 250 mg l total nitrogen tn 27 mg l and total phosphorus tp 6 25 mg l 2 2 exposure experiments and eps extraction exposure experiments were conducted when the removal of cod tn and tp in reactors reached a stable state in this experiment 0 1 mg l ceo2 nps was used as the environmentally relevant concentration in wastewater systems according to zhang et al 2011 and limbach et al 2008 in view of the rapid increase and growth in the use of ceo2 nps an estimated 7500 to 10000 t year 1 the global market for nanomaterials 2002 2016 2012 and considering other models of entry i e accidental release from a production facility a concentration of 10 mg l ceo2 nps was also considered sendra et al 2017 xu et al 2017 for the experiments 1 5 l of synthetic wastewater double the culturing concentration was fed into each reactor then a stock solution of 500 mg l ceo2 nps was prepared and stock solution volumes of 0 0 6 and 60 ml were subsequently injected into each reactor which were marked sbbr0 sbbr1 and sbbr2 respectively thereafter deionized water was added to yield a final volume of 3 l in each reactor the ceo2 nps exposure experiments lasted 75 days the desired concentrations of ceo2 nps in the influent were achieved by mixing a ceo2 nps stock suspension with synthetic wastewater and feeding this solution to the sbbr in each cycle at the end of the batch experiments lb epss and tb epss were extracted using a method including centrifugation sonication and thermal extraction processes details in the si you et al 2017 the epss fractions were stored at 20 c before analysis 2 3 multiple fluorescent staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm imaging using a multiple color staining technique and clsm together visualized the spatial distribution of epss components in microbial aggregates chen et al 2006 adav et al 2010 after their exposure to ceo2 nps biofilm samples were taken from their carriers and placed on slides the samples were then fixed with 2 5 glutaraldehyde for 12 h followed by their fluorescent staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc sigma st louis mo concanavalin a con a invitrogen life science usa and calcofluor white cw sigma st louis mo to visualize pro and α and β d glucopyranose ps respectively li et al 2015 chen et al 2007 in brief 100 μl of 0 1 m nahco3 buffer was added to the samples to retain the amine group in its non protonated form chen et al 2007 thereafter 50 μl of 1 g l fitc dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide was added and the solution was incubated at room temperature for 1 h next 100 μl of 250 mg l con a dissolved in 0 1 m nahco3 solution was added and the sample was incubated for 30 min followed by the addition of 100 μl of 300 mg l cw and incubation for another 30 min after the samples were stained they were washed with phosphate buffered saline ph 7 2 to remove excess stain finally the internal structure of stained samples was observed through a clsm nikon a1 japan the excitation emission wavelengths used to observe fitc con a and cw were 488 520 green 561 580 red and 400 435 nm blue respectively chen et al 2007 adav et al 2010 in addition viable cells were stained by syto 9 and fluoresced green while dead cells were stained by propidium iodide and fluoresced red for a semi quantitative description of the spatial correlations among the probed substances in the acquired clsm images a matlab program was used to convert the original color 2 d images of each layer to gray images with pixel values between 0 black and 255 white based on the method in the paper of adav et al 2010 and the pixel value of each point 807 807 was subsequently extracted and used for analysis 2 4 eps physicochemical property analysis extracted lb epss and tb epss were analyzed to determine their total organic carbon toc pro and ps content in the manner that had been previously described you et al 2015 hou et al 2016 the amw distribution of epss was measured using gel permeation chromatography gpc la 20 ad shimadzu japan equipped with a shodex ohpak sb 805 hq gel chromatography column the spectroscopic analyses of epss i e uv vis absorption spectra and fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy were performed using a uv vis nir spectrophotometer uv 3600 shimadzu japan and an ft ir instrument tensor 27 bruker germany additionally the degree of acetylation and the secondary structure of pro were further calculated based on you et al 2017 and seoudi and nada 2007 besides samples were hydrolyzed to analyze the aa composition of pro in epss details in si pérez and susa 2017 2 5 microbe examination biofilm samples 0 5 g were harvested at the end of exposure experiments from each sbbr system and immediately stored at 20 c until their dna was extracted dna was extracted using an e z n a soil dna kit omega d5625 01 usa based on the manufacturer s instructions the concentrations of the extracted dna were determined by 0 8 w v agarose gel electrophoresis the microbial communities in biofilms in the presence or absence of ceo2 nps were analyzed by an illumina miseq platform according to standard protocols and were conducted by guangdong magigene biotechnology co ltd china detailed information was also provided in the si 2 6 assays to quantify ahl signal molecules and statistical analysis the level of ahl content in biofilm samples before and after eps extraction was determined using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa kit nanjing senbeijia biological technology co ltd china the samples were added to and reacted with horseradish peroxidase labeled antibody n 5 carboxypentanoyl l homoserine lactone was diluted in carbonate buffer and 3 3 5 5 tetramethylbenzidine substrate was added for coloration the reaction was then stopped by the addition of 2 m h2so4 finally elisa absorbance measurements at 450 nm were performed with a microplate reader chen et al 2010 all assays were conducted with at least three replicates for statistical analysis the experimental values were compared to their corresponding control values statistical analysis t test was performed to test the significance of results and p 05 was considered to be statistically significant as similar described by hou et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 structural characteristics of epss in wastewater biofilms the production of stratified epss in biofilms after exposure to ceo2 nps was shown in fig s1 the lb epss content gradually increased from 16 93 3 43 to 25 29 3 62 mg toc l p 05 while the tb epss content which was much higher than that of lb epss declined from 117 72 9 96 to 99 25 4 31 mg toc l p 05 as the ceo2 nps concentration increased indicating that ceo2 nps caused different degrees of variation in the depth of biofilm the production of epss expressed as the sum of lb epss and tb epss slightly decreased by 7 51 p 05 after exposure to 10 mg l ceo2 nps this result suggested that long term exposure to ceo2 nps negatively affected the production of epss which is opposite to the acute responses that observed in our previous studies specifically that enhanced epss production prevented ceo2 nps toxicity you et al 2015 although chronic exposure to nps could lead to the adaptation of bacteria in biofilms to the adverse environment hou et al 2016 a slight decrease in epss content revealed the potential negative effects of ceo2 nps on the microbial community since the epss matrix is secreted by microorganisms to further characterize epss production the amount of pro and ps in stratified epss was determined and shown in fig s2 the total lb epss and tb epss content expressed by adding pro and ps together followed a pattern similar to that in fig s1 in sbbr 2 the pro concentration in lb epss and tb epss declined to 85 77 p 05 and 72 92 p 05 of the control value while the concentration of ps was 33 00 p 05 and 25 65 p 05 higher than that in control the different responses of pro and ps concentrations in epss might be attributed to their different functions when exposed to ceo2 nps and the increased ps content could act as a protective barrier for cells against the harsh environment flemming and wingender 2010 flemming 2016 basuvaraj et al 2015 the decreased pro content in epss may have negatively impacted the microbial physicochemical and physiological properties flemming and wingender 2010 han et al 2017 the images fig 1 obtained through the triple staining clsm technique showed that biofilms were morphologically heterogenous with pro and α and β d glucopyranose ps being clearly detectable in individual samples as shown in fig 1 a and d pro in green was dominant and aggregated into clusters the α d glucopyranose ps in red was dispersed throughout the field of view the β d glucopyranose ps in blue was the least dense and appeared in a few spots after the cells were chronically exposed to 0 1 mg l ceo2 nps the density of α d glucopyranose ps obviously increased fig 1 b and e however when the dosage of ceo2 nps increased to 10 mg l the β d glucopyranose ps content fig 1 c and f dramatically increased and became the dominant component suggesting that 0 1 and 10 mg l of ceo2 nps elicited different protective mechanisms the increased intensities of α and β d glucopyranose ps could be the reason for the enhanced ps content shown in fig s2 in addition the videos of these samples in the si showed that the pro was located at the center of the vertical distributions z stack of the biofilms which was consistent with the results of mcswain et al 2005 in contrast the α and β d glucopyranose ps in the ceo2 np treated biofilms were heterogeneously distributed across the biofilm depths so that the ps played an important role in supporting the structural integrity of the matrix lux et al 2004 also reported that exopolysaccharide components form a scaffold within fruiting body architecture during aggregation of myxococcus xanthus as illustrated in fig 2 a b and c the semi quantitative analysis of the 3 d clsm images exhibited that the total pixel values increased exponentially once stained substances were detected and until the brightest layer was reached then sharply decreased to near zero the calculated distribution of each component in the presence and absence of ceo2 nps were well fitted r 2 0 99 by the exponentially modified gaussian emg model as follows grushka 1972 1 f 1 x a t 0 e x t 0 2 f 2 x 1 w 2 π e x x c 2 2 w 2 3 z x x c w w t 0 4 f x y 0 f 1 f 2 x y 0 a t 0 e 1 2 w t 0 2 x x c t 0 z 1 2 π e y 2 2 d y where y0 represents the offset a is the area of the curve xc is the center w is the width and t0 represents the time constant of the exponential modifier the detailed parameters of the major epss components were obtained via the emg model and displayed in table 1 the total content of each component was further calculated by integrating the area beneath the emg model curve from 0 to the end and was shown in fig 2 d e and f fig 2 a and d showed that pro was mostly presented in the center of the biofilm whose thickness was approximately 60 μm in the control however with the addition of ceo2 nps the peak intensity of pro was obviously decreased and narrowed down which was also demonstrated by the decreased values of a and w in table 1 fig 2 b and e showed that 10 mg l ceo2 nps didn t change the production and distribution width of α d glucopyranose ps while treatment with 0 1 mg l ceo2 nps increased α d glucopyranose ps production by 35 13 beyond the values found in the control and broadened its distribution in the biofilm furthermore the xc of α d glucopyranose ps table 1 gradually increased from 21 17 to 29 27 μm indicating that α d glucopyranose ps shifted from the surface to the center of the biofilm in contrast to α d glucopyranose ps behavior the content of β d glucopyranose ps dramatically increased by 659 77 fig 2 f of the control value after long term exposure to 10 mg l ceo2 nps and the thickness correspondingly increased from 50 to 120 μm under these conditions fig 2 c the differences were also reflected by the changes of the parameters a and w the abovementioned results clearly demonstrated that the production and spatial structure of epss were affected by ceo2 nps enhanced ps production plays an important role in the protection of epss as a response to chronic ceo2 nps exposure 3 2 physicochemical characteristics of epss to assess the varied properties of key organic matters in epss responding to ceo2 nps amw distributions of epss were analyzed the amw distribution in lb epss was greatly different from that of tb epss fig s3 three peaks were observed in the lb epss distribution 1 48 104 9 15 104 and 1 69 107 da while the tb epss distribution exhibited four peaks 1005 1 66 105 1 11 107and 4 06 1010 da after the samples were exposed to ceo2 nps the three peaks of amw distributions in the lb epss had shifted to higher amw indicating that the organic matter aggregated into larger molecules however the four peaks of amw distributions in tb epss revealed that the organic matter was clearly converted into smaller molecules with greater peak intensities these distributions might be parts of the strategies for the survival of the microaggregates in the presence of ceo2 nps because the organic matter in the outer layer lb epss aggregated into macromolecules to form a shield against ceo2 nps however the macromolecular barrier also affected the mass transfer of nutrients you et al 2015 and as a result the organic matter in the inner layer tb epss was converted into smaller molecules to provide nutrients for the cells flemming and wingender 2010 the semi quantitative amw distributions were shown in table 2 the peak area of organic matter in lb epss decreased after its exposure to ceo2 nps while the percentage of each amw component was relatively constant in contrast the peak area of organic matter in tb epss generally increased compared to the value in the control moreover the percentage of the 6 104 106 da component in samples with 0 1 mg l ceo2 nps and that of the 108 1013 da component in samples with 10 mg l ceo2 nps clearly increased compared with the values of these components in the control samples from 41 73 to 48 81 and from 17 59 to 30 42 respectively these changes were consistent with the enhanced α and β d glucopyranose ps content and it may be inferred that α d glucopyranose polymerized to form biopolymers with amw near 105 da to cope with the presence of 0 1 mg l ceo2 nps whereas a great number of β d glucopyranose molecules were polymerized into polysaccharides with amw near 1010 da to resist 10 mg l ceo2 nps it is well known that aas are the main components of pro the aa composition and content were analyzed to reveal the specific types of pro involved in the interaction with nps and the results were shown in fig s4 in the control samples fourteen aas were detected in lb epss and lysine histidine and valine were dominant species with an increase in ceo2 nps concentrations the total aas content decreased from 26 60 1 03 to 26 55 0 99 and eventually reached 17 83 0 83 mg l which likely demonstrated the decreased pro content in the lb epss among these aas the sharp decline in lysine concentration was the major reason for the reduced pro content in lb epss jin et al 2014 reported that lysine being a strongly positively charged amino may lead to an interaction with ceo2 nps which are negatively charged in wastewater tyrosine and phenylalanine content reached to the zero while isoleucine was only detected in the presence of 10 mg l ceo2 nps the concentrations of aas in tb epss were much higher than those in lb epss and arginine and proline were detected in the fractions after exposure to ceo2 nps the aas content in tb epss decreased significantly p 05 which were consistent with the reduction of the pro production in tb epss while the largest decrease occurred between the control and growth in the presence of 0 1 mg l ceo2 nps this result suggested that the aas especially glutamate and aspartate in tb epss were mainly affected by the ceo2 nps themselves rather than their dose the uv vis absorption spectra of epss fractions were illustrated in fig s5 the 190 nm peak from the lb epss sample is attributed to a π π transition of benzenoid and the peak from the tb epss sample at 280 nm is attributed to an n π transition of aromatic aas such as tryptophan tyrosine and phenylalanine havel 1996 both of these peaks in lb epss and tb epss remained unchanged after exposure to ceo2 nps indicating that the structure of the benzene ring in epss was too stable to interact with ceo2 nps ft ir analysis of the 4000 400 cm 1 region was performed to unravel the chemical structure of stratified epss after their exposure to ceo2 nps in fig s6 the bands at 3450 cm 1 o h stretching and 1650 cm 1 c o stretch associated with amide i in proteins were the two predominant peaks in epss spectra you et al 2017 yin et al 2015 compared with control experiments the intensity of the hydroxyl group band in epss greatly decreased in samples that had been exposed to ceo2 nps indicating that the hydroxyl groups were likely to interact with the nps the degree of acetylation is defined as the ratio 100 a1665 1 33 a3450 and can be used to explore the changes in major functional groups in epss seoudi and nada 2007 han et al 2017 as shown in fig s7 the acetylation of lb epss in the presence and absence of ceo2 nps was almost identical while the degree of acetylation in tb epss increased in the presence of nps the increased acetyl content could enhance the local stiffness of epss polymers due to the formation of intra chain h bond networks by acetyl groups yang et al 2016 rinaudo 2006 thus facilitating the formation of a 3 d epss structure to resist ceo2 nps the functional groups were divided into four regions based on the energy at which they absorbed and detailed information of these regions was presented in table s1 the peaks at 1120 and 1060 cm 1 as well as the fingerprint region 900 400 cm 1 perhaps associated with p o vibration of phosphodiesters were also affected by ceo2 nps because the nps stripped phosphate groups li et al 2014 according to badireddy et al 2008 and yin et al 2015 the secondary structure of proteins can be obtained from derivative spectra in the 1700 1600 cm 1 region fig s8 showed the curve fitting r 2 0 999 of the amide i band after samples were exposed to ceo2 nps and the results were summarized in table s2 though the content and aas composition of pro were decreased by ceo2 nps the secondary protein structure remained relatively constant even after chronic exposure to 10 mg l ceo2 nps however the α helix 3 turn helix β sheet value of tb epss gradually increased and a high percentage of helix structure could promote the formation of strong microcolony architecture to further adapt to ceo2 nps you et al 2017 hou et al 2015 through the variations of the characteristics of epss discussed above the results concluded in section 3 1 and the employment of epss in responding to the exposure of ceo2 nps can be further confirmed 3 3 microbial properties of wastewater biofilms the microbial populations and community structures of wastewater biofilms that were chronically exposed to ceo2 nps were examined the distribution of live and dead cells in wastewater biofilms was shown in fig s9 the clsm images clearly showed that the percentage of dead cells gradually increased with an increase of ceo2 nps concentration semi quantitative results also demonstrated that the bacteria were damaged by the ceo2 nps moreover the alpha diversity parameters obtained from the high throughput sequencing and summarized in table s3 showed that compared with the control both 0 1 and 10 mg l ceo2 nps could reduce the richness and diversity of the microbial community while 0 1 mg l ceo2 nps treatment exhibited more negative effects the rarefaction and rank abundance curves in fig s10 also confirmed that the microbial diversity in the 10 mg l nps sample was greater than that in the 0 1 mg l nps sample these results could be attributed to the chronic adaptation to low concentration 0 1 mg l resulting in the culturing of specific tolerant bacteria while the high concentration 10 mg l stimulated the microbial population to increase the resistance of biofilm to toxicants xu et al 2016 to further illustrate the response of microbial compositions in the presence of ceo2 nps the populations at the phyla level were identified in fig 3 a proteobacteria 51 51 tm7 20 82 bacteroidetes 11 83 acidobacteria 3 73 actinobacteria 3 46 and chloroflexi 3 05 were the dominant phyla in the control sample and were commonly found in wastewater treatment systems xu et al 2016 wang et al 2016 these predominant species contributed to the stability of biofilms with their functions and secreted epss lv et al 2014 the relative abundances of acidobacteria chloroflexi and planctomycetes tended to decrease in the presence of ceo2 nps for 75 days after exposure to 0 1 mg l ceo2 nps the total percentage of predominant phyla including proteobacteria tm7 bacteroidetes and actinobacteria increased from 87 62 to 95 57 which could be one reason for the decreased microbial diversity showed in table s3 further analysis of the microbial community profiles was conducted at the genus level fig 3b as nitrogen and phosphorus removal were primary goals in wastewater treatment the major genera in this study were associated with bacteria that remove nitrogen and phosphorus wang et al 2017 the relative abundance of the genus prosthecobacter which included ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob was enriched as the ceo2 nps concentration increased the abundance of genera capable of oxidizing nitrite to nitrate including devosia and salinibacterium increased while the abundance of nitrospira nitrite oxidizing bacteria was reduced when the samples were exposed to 10 mg l ceo2 nps the most dominant genus thermomonas included denitrifying bacteria dnb and was highly enriched in the presence of 0 1 mg l ceo2 nps possibly contributing to the changes at the phylum level the abundance of dnb from simplicispira and citrobacter decreased whereas the abundance of dnb from rhodobacter which were able to secrete epss lv et al 2014 increased after exposure to ceo2 nps in addition sediminibacterium as a glycogen accumulating organism gao was enriched while the abundance of gao from propionicimonas was reduced with the addition of ceo2 nps the present results indicated that ceo2 nps could shift the community structure of microbes especially the relative abundances of functional bacteria in wastewater biofilms although these phenomena could disturb functions in biofilm systems they could also be the adaptability of biofilm communities and the selection of diversity for microbe survival under a continuous load of ceo2 nps boles and singh 2008 szomolay et al 2005 harrison et al 2007 furthermore the epss which form a matrix produced by the bacteria themselves were probably altered because of changes in the microbial community in responses to ceo2 nps 3 4 ahl signals in wastewater biofilms information on qs revealed that qs was in reasonable agreement with the regulation of gene expression and the biosynthesis of epss to date ahl signal molecules are regarded as the predominant qs signaling pathways in gram negative bacteria shrout and nerenberg 2012 ahl producing bacteria are often isolated in aquatic environments and ahl signals have been detected in various wastewater treatment bioreactors yeon et al 2008 valle et al 2004 the genes regulated by the various ahl signals are widely variable for different bacterial species but many influence biofilm formation and structure shrout and nerenberg 2012 valle et al 2004 therefore the level of ahl content in wastewater biofilm systems was detected and presented in fig 4 a the ahl concentration in initial biofilms increased from 60 17 in sbbr 0 65 2 ng l in sbbr 1 p 05 and eventually increased to 71 22 ng l in sbbr 2 p 05 since the phenotypes such as epss production and exopolysaccharides are mediated through qs the increased ahl concentration probably contributed to the differences of eps production in the presence of ceo2 nps shrout and nerenberg 2012 yeon et al 2008 valle et al 2004 after the removal of epss the ahl content decreased by approximately 7 in comparison to the orginal epss samples indicating that the ahl signals are mostly present at the surface or inside of bacterial cells and are seldom trapped in the epss chong et al 2012 in addition ahls were detected in wastewater and their content increased with the ceo2 nps dose possibly due to a diffusion sensing interpretation with lower rates of mass transfer garcía contreras et al 2015 cornforth et al 2014 it has been proposed that when multiple qs molecules are secreted and differentially altered by the environment both the social cell density and physical mass transfer related to epss production environments of bacteria are affected cornforth et al 2014 for some bacteria the epss production is directly controlled by ahl qs shrout and nerenberg 2012 gilbert et al 2009 pseudomonas had been numerously studied and were demonstrated to be associated with qs regulated control of ps regulation shrout and nerenberg 2012 sakuragi and kolter 2007 in this study pseudomonas was identified fig 3b despite its low abundance although the pathways are often complex a universal feature is that a small group of qs producing bacteria play key roles shrout and nerenberg 2012 the number of effective sequence tags the sequence similarity 97 of pseudomonas increased from 17 to 20 and finally to 34 with gradual addition of ceo2 nps which was consistent with the trend in ahl abundance and promoted the production of ps in epss the above mentioned results clearly showed the responses of structural physicochemical and microbial properties of wastewater biofilms to chronic exposure to different ceo2 nps concentrations as schematically illustrated in fig 4b epss of biofilms were often the first barrier of microbial cells to contact with or resist against nps in aqueous environments zhang et al 2017 our works suggested the enhanced ps production probably converted the biofilms to rigid and formed a formidable protective shield against ceo2 nps fig 4b b which was consistent with li et al 2015 on the other hand long term exposure to ceo2 nps decreased cell viability reduced microbial diversity and shifted the microbial community structure fig 4b a what s more qs producing bacteria are likely to change through the microbial community fig 4b c and further affect the phenotypes e g ps production in the presence of ceo2 nps shrout and nerenberg 2012 yeon et al 2008 in this study the concentrations of ahl increased with the increased density of pseudomonas which was demonstrated to be associated with ps regulated control leading to greater ps content in epss in response to ceo2 nps fig 4b d 4 conclusions this study comprehensively elucidated the responses of structural physicochemical and microbial properties of wastewater biofilms to chronic exposure to different ceo2 nps concentrations the main conclusions of this study are more production and broader distribution of ps α d glucopyranose ps in 0 1 mg l ceo2 nps and β d glucopyranose ps in 10 mg l ceo2 nps were observed meanwhile the percentage of the high amw components and the local stiffness and α helix 3 turn helix β sheet value in tb epss increased after exposure to ceo2 nps these responses are likely to promote the formation of strong microcolony architecture to resist ceo2 nps long term exposure to ceo2 nps decreased cell viability reduced microbial diversity and shifted the microbial community structure this could affect the abundance of qs producing bacteria the concentrations of ahl signals increased with the number of effective sequence tags of pseudomonas this probably contributed to the greater ps content in epss in response to ceo2 nps finally this is the first attempt to gain the potential relationship between the microbial community and ps production via examining ahl qs signals in the presence of ceo2 nps this new knowledge gives us a better understanding of interactions between other types of nanoparticles and microaggregates in aquatic environments acknowledgment

19731,since the 1980s the pulp and paper industry in finland has resulted in the accumulation of fibres in lake sediments one such site in lake näsijärvi contains approximately 1 5 million m3 sedimented fibres in this study the methane production potential of the sedimented fibres on average 13 total solids ts was determined in batch assays furthermore the methane production from solid on average 20 ts and liquid fractions of sedimented fibres after solid liquid separation was studied the sedimented fibres resulted in fast methane production and high methane yields of 250 80 l ch4 kg volatile solids vs the main part ca 90 of the methane potential was obtained from the solid fraction of the sedimented fibres in addition the vs removal from the total and solid sedimented fibres was high 61 65 and 63 78 respectively the liquid fraction also contained a large amount of organics on average 8 8 g cod l treatment of which also has to be considered the estimations of the methane production potentials in the case area showed potential up to 40 million m3 of methane from sedimented fibres graphical abstract image keywords pulp and paper industry sedimented fibre anaerobic digestion methane 1 introduction paper production is a globally growing industry with an annual global production that has increased from ca 240 to 409 million tons of paper and board from 1990 to 2016 finnish forest industries 2017 in finland pulp and papermaking started in the 1870s when a sulfite pulp process was introduced enabling the use of different raw materials and the production of different paper grades in the beginning of the 20th century 1890 1913 the production of pulp and paper further increased due to the exports to russia kuisma 1993 currently the pulp and paper industry in finland is the 5th largest pulp and paper making country in the world with investments in pulp and biorefineries e g biofuels with decreasing paper production the pulp and paper industry utilizes vast amounts of water as much as 200 1000 m3 paper ton in the beginning of 20th century kamali et al 2016 and thus pulp and paper mills are often situated next to water bodies such as lakes or seas in the 1970s the wastewater treatment of the pulp and paper industry in finland was comprised of some mechanical treatment and aerated lagoons junna and ruonala 1991 while in the 1980s activated sludge plants were introduced drastically decreasing the wastewater discharges rintala et al 1988 along with intensified research presented e g in iwa forest industry wastewaters conferences e g water science and technology 1985 17 1 thus for decades most of the wastewaters were discharged to the near by water bodies without any treatment during the decades of wastewater discharge various compounds accumulated in the sediments near pulp and paper mills including pulp fibres as the major material in addition heavy metals organic chlorine compounds and resin acids were accumulating kähkönen et al 1998 leppänen and oikari 1999 poole et al 1977 depending on the pulp and paper manufacturing processes used in the mills and later on the applied wastewater treatment process as well in the recipient waters the pulp fibres settle down rapidly poole et al 1977 and in time can be broken down by microbial activity into organics such as sugars or organic acids resulting in oxygen depletion and gas generation e g ch4 h2s in sediments pearson 1980 today the fibre rich sediments originating from the activities of the pulp and paper industry can be found from various locations worldwide including the nordic countries canada and china guo et al 2016 jackson 2016 ratia et al 2013 these polluted sediments are often located near cities and prevent the recreational use of water areas in addition they can cause long term environmental effects on the water bodies such as oxygen depletion eutrophication the release of detrimental compounds from the sediment and toxicity towards aquatic organisms lindholm lehto et al 2015 meriläinen et al 2000 one option initially considered for treating fibre sediments is anaerobic digestion ad as it may provide potential for both energy recovery and further use of the digestate for example primary sludge in thermophilic conditions resulted in methane yields of 230 ml ch4 g vs in batch assays and 190 240 ml ch4 g vs in continuously stirred tank reactor cstr with hydraulic retention times hrts of 16 30 d bayr and rintala 2012 the anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge was from mechanical or chemical pulp mills in batch assays resulted in methane yields of 43 155 ml ch4 g vs karlsson et al 2011 the relatively low methane yields from pulp and paper mill sludges in many studies are due to the incomplete hydrolysis of lignocellulosic constituents present in the sludge the low nutrient content and the presence of detrimental compounds kamali et al 2016 meyer and edwards 2014 to accommodate the increasing population the city of tampere finland is building a new district of 90 ha along the banks of lake näsijärvi on the site of an old pulp mill the bay area near the old pulp mill received effluents from a sulfite pulp mill from the 1910s to the 1980s and has approximately 1 5 million m3 of sedimented fibre in the bay that forms a layer up to 10 m height in this study the objective was to assess the methane production potential of the sedimented fibers in the bay area and to initially evaluate the potential role of ad in the treatment and utilization of the fibres for this purpose sedimented fibres were collected from the bottom of the lake and their anaerobic degradability was determined altogether nine samples from three different sampling points and depths were collected the solid and liquid separation efficiency of the sedimented fibres was determined and the methane production potential from the solid and liquid fractions as well as from the original total sedimented fibres were determined in addition the anaerobic degradation of the sedimented fibres were examined finally the practical scale methane potential of the sedimented fibres in the studied bay in lake näsijärvi was assessed based on the laboratory batch results 2 materials and methods 2 1 sedimented fibres and inoculum sedimented fibre samples were collected from three different sampling points a b c at three different depths of the fibre sediment containing area ca 20 ha in lake näsijärvi tampere finland near the old pulp and paper mill the sampling points were chosen to give a representative understanding of the sedimented fibres due to heterogeneous nature of the sedimented fibres especially at different depths sampling depths table 1 were chosen based on the estimated total depth of the sedimented fibre layer ranging between 0 and 10 m so that they would represent the top middle and bottom sections of the layer samples from each sampling point were taken with an excavator bucket from a sampling ferry autiola and holopainen 2016 the samples were transported to the laboratory and stored at 6 c until used before the experiments each sample was homogenized by mixing for 1 min using a concrete mixer attached to a power drill after mixing samples for total ts and volatile solids vs analysis were taken different samples for solid liquid separation and total samples for determining the biomethane potential were used digested mesophilic municipal sewage sludge from viinikanlahti sewage treatment plant tampere finland was used as the inoculum for the experiments determining biomethane potential bmp 2 2 solid liquid separation for the bmp determination liquid and solid fractions from 5 l of sedimented fibres were separated by removing liquid from the total samples with a juice press simulating a screw press in a smaller scale that had a volume of 12 l diameter 360 mm height 600 mm and where the pressure was realized with a lever arm the amount of water to be removed was determined based on the ts content 9 3 21 6 of the total sample so that for the resulting dry residue ts was approximately 20 for sample a 0 1 m the ts was already above 20 and thus no water was removed ts and vs were determined for the dry and liquid fractions in addition the total and soluble chemical oxygen demand codtot and cods were determined for liquid fractions 2 3 bmp batch assays liquid and solid fractions of the sedimented fibres were both analysed for their bmp separately in addition the bmp of the total sedimented fibre samples without solid liquid separation from sampling point b was determined for solid and total samples bmp was determined in duplicates in 1 l glass bottles containing 350 ml inoculum and sedimented fibre samples at a ratio of 2 0 g vssubstrate g vsinoculum 67 ml of 42 g l nahco3 final concentration 4 g l was added to each bottle as a buffer and the liquid volume was adjusted to 700 ml with distilled water for liquid fractions of sedimented fibres the bmp was determined in triplicates in 120 ml serum glass bottles containing 30 ml of inoculum liquid fibre samples the final total cod concentration was 5 4 9 6 g l and was dependent on the sample and 6 ml of 42 g l nahco3 to have a final concentration of 4 g l distilled water was added to reach a total liquid volume of 60 ml control samples inoculum only were prepared by replacing the substrate with distilled water both in 1 l and 120 ml glass bottles the cumulative methane production of the inoculum was excluded from the cumulative methane production of the samples the methane yields are given as the average value of the parallel samples the initial ph of the batch bottle contents was between 7 0 and 8 1 headspaces were flushed with n2 gas for 3 min after sealing to ensure anaerobic conditions the 1 l glass bottles were placed in a water bath at 35 c and connected to aluminum gas bags supel inert foil gas sampling bags supelco usa for collection of the produced gas the 120 ml serum bottles were placed in a static incubator at 35 c the content and volume of the gas were analysed 1 3 times a week at the end of the assay ph ts and vs cods and volatile fatty acids vfas were determined 2 4 analyses and calculations the methane yields in solid and liquid fibre fractions in sampling point b were also calculated against the g vs of the total sedimented fibre sample l

distillate by titrating with sulphuric acid total phosphorous and soluble phosphorous after filtration 0 45 μm were analysed with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms before icp ms the sample was degraded with microwaves in nitrohydrochloric acid ramboll analytics finland ts and vs were analyzed according to standards sfs en 14346 and sfs en 15169 respectively for liquid samples codtot and cods were analysed according to standard sfs 5504 for cods analysis samples were filtered 0 45 μm chromafil xtra pet ph was measured with wtw profiline ph 3210 and wtw ph 330i meters the methane content of the produced biogas was measured with a perkin elmer clarus 500 gc fid gas chromatograph with a mol sieve 5a plot column column detector and injector temperatures were 100 c 250 c and 230 c respectively the carrier gas was helium at a flow rate of 14 ml min for the 1 l bottles the volume of produced biogas was measured from the gas bags using the principal of water displacement the gas bag was connected with tubing to an air tight water column that was opened from the bottom the gas from the gas bags replaced a certain mass of water from the water column and the mass of the replaced water was weighed and converted to a volume at stp for the 120 ml serum bottles the volume of methane was calculated based on the percentage of ch4 in the headspace where the overpressure was accounted for and released when the ch4 content increased above 90 angelidaki et al 2009 all measurements were performed at room temperature 20 c and atmospheric pressure 1 atm air temperature and

autiola and holopainen 2016 the mass balances of the solid and liquid fractions after solid liquid separation fig 1 show that most of the ts and vs end up in the solid fraction that comprises of 46 70 of the volume of the total sample the ts and vs for the total and solid fractions of sedimented fibres and of the inoculum and cods for the liquid fractions of sedimented fibres are presented in table 2 ts for the total samples was between 9 3 and 13 9 except for a 0 1m that had a ts of 21 6 after solid liquid separation the ts of the solid fractions was in the range of 17 4 21 1 which is close to the aimed ts value of 20 both for total and solid samples the vs ts ratio was over 93 except for sample a 2 3m that had a vs ts ratio of 87 the liquid fractions contained codt in the range of 5 5 13 9 g l of which the soluble cod was 42 92 2 3 12 7 g l table 2 the total 7 1 9 0 g l and soluble 5 4 6 2 g l cod in the liquid fractions at different depths from sampling points a and c were similar while there were large variations in the total 5 5 13 9 g l and soluble 2 3 12 7 g l cod for sampling point c table 2 the nitrogen and phosphorous in four of the total samples and in two of the pore water samples as well as the organic acids in the pore water samples of two of the samples were determined the total nitrogen in the four total samples a 2 3m b 3 4m b 5 6m and c 4 5m varied between 2 9 and 4 7 g kg ts and the phosphorous between 0 27 and 0 31 g kg ts in the pore water the total vfa content varied between 2 4 and 6 4 g l table 3 the concentrations of organic acids increased while the concentrations of total nitrogen decreased with sampling depth autiola and holopainen 2016 3 2 methane production potential 3 2 1 solid fractions of sedimented fibres methane production from the solid fractions of sedimented fibres started in less than one week and 80 of the methane produced in 30 d was produced in the first two weeks fig 2 for two of the sampling points a and c higher methane yields were obtained from the deeper sediments e g 250 more methane was produced from sample a 2 3m than from a 0 1m and 23 more methane was produced from sample c 4 5m than from c 0 1m however from sampling point b 35 higher methane yields were obtained from solid fractions of sedimented fibre from a depth or 0 1 m than from 3 4 m fig 2 the assays were continued until day 56 but 94 97 of the methane was produced in the first 30 d except for sample a 0 1m where 89 of the methane was produced in the first 30 d the highest methane yield 320 l ch4 kg vs on day 30 was obtained from the solid fractions of sedimented fibres originating from the deepest samples 4 6 m fig 2 while in other sampling points the methane yields were higher 180 320 l ch4 kg vs in sampling point a 0 1m the methane yield was only 80 l ch4 kg vs thus there is a large variation in the methane yields between individual samples originating from different sampling points and depths fig 2 however the sedimented fibre from sampling point a 0 1m differed from the others as it had a higher ts 21 6 in the beginning and consisted mainly of woody pieces while the other samples had a felt like structure and had based on visual observations been subjected more to biological degradation the digestates were characterized in the end of the assays table 4 the ph of the solid fractions of sedimented fibre samples did not change much during the assays from initial 7 1 7 5 to final 7 5 7 6 the measured ts and vs removals of the solid fibre samples with the inoculum s ts and vs subtracted on day 56 were 63 78 and 63 78 respectively the ts and vs removal was not dependent on the depth of the sedimented fibres no vfas were detected at the end of any of the assays 3 2 2 liquid fractions of sedimented fibres when studying the methane production from the liquid fractions of sedimented fibres the trends were similar to that of the solid fractions there was no clear trend between methane yields l ch4 kg cod and the depths of the samples again more methane was produced from deeper samples of the sampling point b while from sampling point c the highest methane yields were obtained from the middle layer 1 2 m fig 2 in addition methane production started fast and 80 of the methane produced in 30 d was produced in the first five days from the liquid fractions methane yields were the highest 280 20 l ch4 kg cod for sample b 5 6m while the average was 240 40 l ch4 kg cod the experiments were continued for 68 days but over 87 of the methane was produced in the first 30 d the digestates of the liquid fractions were characterized in the end of the assays table 4 the ph decreased during the experiments 68 d from 7 2 8 1 to 6 9 7 0 the cods decrease was in the range of 76 84 except for the sample a 2 3m that had cods decrease of 66 the final cods was 0 41 0 53 g l table 4 no vfas were detected at the end of the experiments indicating that not all the soluble cod was anaerobically biodegradable 3 2 3 total sedimented fibre samples as with solid and liquid fractions of sedimented fibres from sampling point b the methane yields from the total sedimented fibre samples increased with the sample collection depth as with solid sedimented fibre fractions over 80 of the methane produced in 30 d was produced during the first two weeks fig 2 the differences in the methane yields were considerable an average methane yield of 340 l ch4 kg vs was obtained from total sample at the depth of 5 6 m while from the depth of 0 1m 210 l ch4 kg vs was produced fig 2 the digestates of the total samples were characterized in the end of the assays table 4 the ph changed from 7 0 7 4 to 7 5 the ts and vs removals on day 56 were 59 62 and 61 65 respectively and no vfas were detected at the end of the experiment the experiment was continued until day 56 but 95 of the methane was produced in the first 30 d 3 3 comparison of methane yields from different sedimented fibre fractions methane production from the total solid and liquid fractions of sampling point b were compared by projecting the methane yields against the vs of the original total sample before solid liquid separation and against vs removal fig 3 most of the methane was produced from the solid fraction 95 9 98 4 of the sedimented fibres the liquid fractions resulted only in less than 4 of the methane obtained from the total samples fig 3 which corresponds to the vs content of the liquid fraction comparing the methane yields calculated against the vs removed fig 3b the sum of the solid and liquid fractions resulted in 79 97 of the methane yield of the total sample the differences between the methane yields of total samples and the sum of solid and liquid fraction can be explained by the i heterogenous sample ii small sample volume 0 1 l used for the incubations compared to the large original sample volume of the sedimented fibres 10 l and iii the high vs content of the total sedimented fibres ca 12 vs this is also supported by the large variation between the different sampling points on average the methane yields for total solid and liquid fractions were 400 110 340 100 and 7 5 l ch4 kg vsremoved respectively 4 discussion 4 1 characteristics of sedimented fibres the studied fibres have been accumulating over a period of 60 100 years from pulp mill with different pulping processes sulfite chemi thermomechanical pulping raw water intake systems and different wastewater treatment methods various processes have apparently occurred at the studied sediments in boreal conditions e g annual ice cover water flows and temperatures previous research on the on site degradation of sedimented fibres has suggested that more rapid hydrolysis of fibres occurs in anaerobic sediments that already contain high volumes of deposited fibres due to the enrichment of hydrolytic bacteria in the anaerobic sediments pearson 1980 furthermore it has also been proposed that the long term exposure of fibre discharges to sediments with restricted water exchange will eventually lead to the deoxygenation of the bottom waters as well as the elimination of the fauna pearson 1980 in the studied bay area of lake näsijärvi large volumes of fibres 1 5 million m3 have sedimented over a long period of time 60 100 years in a relatively small area ca 20 ha with apparently low water exchange during the sedimentation period the hydrolysis of the fibres has likely occurred in the sediments followed by a decrease in the activity of the fauna in addition the oxygen in the sediments is likely consumed in the beginning of the sedimentation period leading to anaerobic conditions the organic content of the sediment was high on average 95 vs ts 12 4 ts and 11 7 vs while vs ts ratios of 51 80 and 65 97 have been reported for pulp and paper mill primary sludge 1 5 6 5 ts and biosludge 1 0 2 0 ts respectively meyer and edwards 2014 thus the sedimented fibres have considerably higher vs ts content than the present pulp and paper mill sludge indicating the higher degradation potential of the sedimented fibres the sedimented fibres contained negligible concentrations of nutrients i e 2 9 4 7 mg n kg ts and 0 27 0 31 mg p kg ts the low nutrient concentrations indicate that a lack of nutrients may slow down the anaerobic treatment of sedimented fibres especially in continuous processes bayr and rintala 2012 reported nitrogen concentrations of 0 1 and 1 9 2 0 g l for primary sludge and biosludge respectively from pulp and paper mills in addition kinnunen et al 2015 reported phosphorous and nitrogen contents of 1 2 8 6 g p kg ts and 41 81 g n kg ts respectively for pulp and paper mill biosludge the low nitrogen content has been reported to limit methane production from primary sludge and biosludge of pulp and paper mills bayr and rintala 2012 and the low nitrogen content of the sedimented fibres will likely also affect continuous methane production from sedimented fibres 4 2 solid liquid separation of sedimented fibres the applied simple solid liquid separation of the sedimented fibres simulated mechanical dewatering e g using a screw press screw and filter presses are often used for dewatering sludge in municipal wastewater treatment plants as well as in the pulp and paper industry ojanen 2001 saunamäki 1997 mechanical dewatering in the pulp and paper industry is often enough to increase the solid content up to 30 40 ts before e g combustion of the sludge but usually requires addition of polymers and or thermal treatment before dewatering ojanen 2001 in this study some of the water was easily removed from the sedimented fibres without the addition of polymers and 40 of the water could be removed to obtain a ts and vs content of an average 19 5 vs and 18 4 vs 94 vs ts respectively while the potential for higher solid fraction ts was not attempted thus using a screw press to separate water from sedimented fibres should also be feasible at a larger scale and results in a solid fraction with a high vs ts content the total and soluble cod content of the separated liquid fractions was high on average 8 8 2 5 and 6 7 3 1 g l respectively and shows that the liquid fraction requires treatment before discharge the liquid fraction of sedimented fibres was biodegradable with a soluble cod removal of 66 84 indicating the potential for biological treatment processes 4 3 methane production potential from the sedimented fibres the results in this study show that by adding an inoculum and adjusting the ph near neutral which is optimal for methanogens significant anaerobic degradation of sedimented fibres 61 65 vs removal in total sedimented fibres takes place in the batch assays resulting in the production of methane batch incubations with sedimented fibres only without inoculum at a neutral ph indicated that there are no indigenous microorganisms in sedimented fibres that could convert fibres into methane results not shown from solid fractions and total samples the highest and average methane yields were 320 l ch4 kg vs 270 40 l ch4 kg vs and 340 l ch4 kg vs 250 80 l ch4 kg vs respectively from the liquid fractions the methane yields were at the highest and in average 280 l ch4 kg cod 240 40 l ch4 kg cod compared to typical methane yields from pulp and paper industry primary sludge biosludge or their mixture table 5 the results from this study were higher in addition the vs removal was considerably higher for total and solid fractions of sedimented fibres compared to primary sludge and or biosludge from pulp and paper industry table 5 the present methane yields are in the same range as obtained in the typical sewage sludge digesters e g 260 l ch4 kg vs luostarinen et al 2009 in the batch assays of this study the methane production started fast and 80 of the methane was produced during the first two weeks for comparison in similar type of batch assays it took 55 days bayr et al 2013 and 40 days karlsson et al 2011 to reach ca 80 of the methane yield from pulp and paper mill ca 110 ml ch4 g vs and kraft pulp mill ca 190 ml ch4 g vs biosludge respectively the fast methane production in batch assays can be attributed to optimized conditions i e a ph adjustment to neutral 7 8 and the addition of microorganisms as well as nutrients with inoculum digestate from anaerobic treatment of municipal sewage sludge the high methane yields are surprising compared to the methane yields of primary sludge and biosludge from the pulp and paper industry table 5 suggesting that the long storage of the fibres in the sediments has likely resulted in the microbial hydrolysis of the fibres pearson 1980 enabling faster anaerobic degradation in the batch assays of this study it has been reported for example that lignin derived from hardwood can be partly biodegraded in anoxic sediments in the long term almost 300 d studies benner et al 1984 furthermore meriläinen et al 2001 suggested that resin acids wood components that are inhibitory for anaerobic digestion meyer and edwards 2014 can be microbially degraded in the long term and or may be discharged to the receiving water bodies these factors among others may have resulted in better degradation and biomethane production from sedimented fibres the results suggest that the studied sedimented fibres can be biologically treated as such without pretreatment or after mechanical solid liquid separation dewatering both solid and liquid fractions contain biologically anaerobically degradable organics and serve as a good feedstock for anaerobic bioprocessing e g solids in continuously stirred tank reactors and liquids in upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors different reactor configurations should be considered for treating the different fractions as solid liquid separation would considerably decrease the volume of the solid fraction that contains most of the methane potential 4 4 extrapolation of the methane production to practice there are approximately 1 5 million m3 sedimented fibres originating from the pulp and paper industry in the studied bay area in lake näsijärvi finland as the average methane yield for the solid fractions of the sedimented fibres was similar to the methane yield of total samples 250 l ch4 kg vs the anaerobic treatment of the solid fractions after solid liquid separation may be attractive and would result in smaller volumes to be treated in this case however the treatment of liquid fraction also has to be considered in table 6 the methane production potentials of the total solid and liquid fractions of the sedimented fibres in the practical scale are given based on the methane yields obtained in the laboratory assays from the samples analysed in this study it can be estimated that the organic matter content vs of the total samples is around 12 thus there are 0 19 million m3 sedimented fibres as vs based on these values and assuming a density of 1000 kg m3 for the sedimented fibres the overall methane production potential of the total sedimented fibres is 44 million m3 as a comparison the overall methane production potential from the biowaste and the sludge from municipal wastewater treatment plants and septic tanks in the city of tampere and the surrounding area pirkanmaa region 500 000 inhabitants is estimated to be ca 5 6 million m3 year mönkäre et al 2016 thus the methane production potential from sedimented fibres is 7 8 times higher than the yearly methane production potential of biowaste and municipal sludge in the pirkanmaa region anaerobic treatment of the sedimented fibres in the studied bay area of lake näsijärvi finland could generate income which to certain extent could compensate for the treatment and remediation costs in solid liquid separation on average 56 of the volume end up in the solid fraction resulting in a volume of solid fraction of 0 84 million m3 corresponding to 0 16 million m3 sedimented fibere as vs thus the methane production potential of the solid sedimented fibres is 39 million m3 table 6 in addition solid liquid separation of the sedimented fibres would result in a large volume of liquid 0 66 million m3 that has on average a total and soluble cod concentrations of 8 8 2 5 and 6 7 3 1 g l respectively with an average methane yield of 240 40 l ch4 kg cod the liquid fraction has a methane production potential of 1 4 million m3 table 6 a typical domestic wastewater contains 0 34 1 02 g cod l depending on the strength of the wastewater metcalf and eddy 2014 the design load of the new centralized regional sewage treatment plant under construction in tampere finland is ca 7700 t bod year in 2020 tampere water 2007 the liquid fraction of sedimented fibres would result in an overall load of 5800 t cod table 6 assuming a bod cod ratio of 0 5 this would convert to an overall load of ca 2900 t bod which is a bit over 30 of the annual design load of the regional sewage treatment plant in tampere however it is likely that the remediation of the sedimented fibres will take several years and thus the wastewater load would also be generated over many years the cod concentrations of the different pulp and paper mill wastewaters applicable for anaerobic treatment typically range from 0 7 to 25 g l meyer and edwards 2014 thus wastewater treatment technologies suitable for pulp and paper mill wastewaters could also be used to treat the liquid fractions of sedimented fibres examples of such processes include anaerobic digestion in anaerobic filters upflow anaerobic sludge bed reactors and anaerobic membrane bioreactors kamali et al 2016 treating solid and liquid fractions separately would enable the treatment of the solid fraction with longer hrts while the liquid fraction could be treated anaerobically in reactors enabling shorter hrts and offering the possibility to consider e g the combination of a leach bed reactor and an upflow anaerobic sludge bed reactor the sedimented fibres in lake näsijärvi originating from the pulp and paper industry are not unique for example the pulp and paper industry has resulted in lake pollution and sedimented fibres all over the world including the nordic countries canada and china guo et al 2016 jackson 2016 ratia et al 2013 since many of the old industrial sites have been situated close to large cities problems arise when the water bodies are transformed into recreational grounds thus dredging the sedimented fibres from the lakes and treating them will become increasingly important in the future further studies on the treatment of the total sedimented fibres using different reactor configurations and process conditions are ongoing with the aim to provide information for the technical feasibility of different systems and to make cost analyses in addition the digestates of the reactors will be characterized to develop the use of the digestates 5 conclusions in this study it was reported for the first time that the anaerobic degradation of old sedimented fibres result in the production of methane with high methane yields 250 80 l ch4 kg vs when the sedimented fibres are separated to solid and liquid fractions the solid fraction ca 56 of the original volume has the highest methane production potential 230 60 ch4 kg vsoriginal however the liquid fraction still contains a high amount of cod 8 8 2 5 g l that requires treatment before discharge at the site under investigation there is methane production potential up to approximately 40 million m3 acknowledgement this project was funded by the city of tampere the authors would like to thank the lifeguard of hiedanranta reijo väliharju from the city of tampere for his support during the project ramboll finland oy for providing the sedimented fibre samples and leena ojanen for her help in the laboratory 
19731,since the 1980s the pulp and paper industry in finland has resulted in the accumulation of fibres in lake sediments one such site in lake näsijärvi contains approximately 1 5 million m3 sedimented fibres in this study the methane production potential of the sedimented fibres on average 13 total solids ts was determined in batch assays furthermore the methane production from solid on average 20 ts and liquid fractions of sedimented fibres after solid liquid separation was studied the sedimented fibres resulted in fast methane production and high methane yields of 250 80 l ch4 kg volatile solids vs the main part ca 90 of the methane potential was obtained from the solid fraction of the sedimented fibres in addition the vs removal from the total and solid sedimented fibres was high 61 65 and 63 78 respectively the liquid fraction also contained a large amount of organics on average 8 8 g cod l treatment of which also has to be considered the estimations of the methane

digestion methane 1 introduction paper production is a globally growing industry with an annual global production that has increased from ca 240 to 409 million tons of paper and board from 1990 to 2016 finnish forest industries 2017 in finland pulp and papermaking started in the 1870s when a sulfite pulp process was introduced enabling the use of different raw materials and the production of different paper grades in the beginning of the 20th century 1890 1913 the production of pulp and paper further increased due to the exports to russia kuisma 1993 currently the pulp and paper industry in finland is the 5th largest pulp and paper making country in the world with investments in pulp and biorefineries e g biofuels with decreasing paper production the pulp and paper industry utilizes vast amounts of water as much as 200 1000 m3 paper ton in the beginning of 20th century kamali et al 2016 and thus pulp and paper mills are often situated next to water bodies such as lakes or seas in the 1970s the wastewater treatment of the pulp and paper industry in finland was comprised of some mechanical treatment and aerated lagoons junna and ruonala 1991 while in the 1980s activated sludge plants were introduced drastically decreasing the wastewater discharges rintala et al 1988 along with intensified research presented e g in iwa forest industry wastewaters conferences e g water science and technology 1985 17 1 thus for decades most of the wastewaters were discharged to the near by water bodies without any treatment during the decades of wastewater discharge various compounds accumulated in the sediments near pulp and paper mills including pulp fibres as the major material in addition heavy metals organic chlorine compounds and resin acids were accumulating kähkönen et al 1998 leppänen and oikari 1999 poole et al 1977 depending on the pulp and paper manufacturing processes used in the mills and later on the applied wastewater treatment process as well in the recipient waters the pulp fibres settle down rapidly poole et al 1977 and in time can be broken down by microbial activity into organics such as sugars or organic acids resulting in oxygen depletion and gas generation e g ch4 h2s in sediments pearson 1980 today the fibre rich sediments originating from the activities of the pulp and paper industry can be found from various locations worldwide including the nordic countries canada and china guo et al 2016 jackson 2016 ratia et al 2013 these polluted sediments are often located near cities and prevent the recreational use of water areas in addition they can cause long term environmental effects on the water bodies such as oxygen depletion eutrophication the release of detrimental compounds from the sediment and toxicity towards aquatic organisms lindholm lehto et al 2015 meriläinen et al 2000 one option initially considered for treating fibre sediments is anaerobic digestion ad as it may provide potential for both energy recovery and further use of the digestate for example primary sludge in thermophilic conditions resulted in methane yields of 230 ml ch4 g vs in batch assays and 190 240 ml ch4 g vs in continuously stirred tank reactor cstr with hydraulic retention times hrts of 16 30 d bayr and rintala 2012 the anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge was from mechanical or chemical pulp mills in batch assays resulted in methane yields of 43 155 ml ch4 g vs karlsson et al 2011 the relatively low methane yields from pulp and paper mill sludges in many studies are due to the incomplete hydrolysis of lignocellulosic constituents present in the sludge the low nutrient content and the presence of detrimental compounds kamali et al 2016 meyer and edwards 2014 to accommodate the increasing population the city of tampere finland is building a new district of 90 ha along the banks of lake näsijärvi on the site of an old pulp mill the bay area near the old pulp mill received effluents from a sulfite pulp mill from the 1910s to the 1980s and has approximately 1 5 million m3 of sedimented fibre in the bay that forms a layer up to 10 m height in this study the objective was to assess the methane production potential of the sedimented fibers in the bay area and to initially evaluate the potential role of ad in the treatment and utilization of the fibres for this purpose sedimented fibres were collected from the bottom of the lake and their anaerobic degradability was determined altogether nine samples from three different sampling points and depths were collected the solid and liquid separation efficiency of the sedimented fibres was determined and the methane production potential from the solid and liquid fractions as well as from the original total sedimented fibres were determined in addition the anaerobic degradation of the sedimented fibres were examined finally the practical scale methane potential of the sedimented fibres in the studied bay in lake näsijärvi was assessed based on the laboratory batch results 2 materials and methods 2 1 sedimented fibres and inoculum sedimented fibre samples were collected from three different sampling points a b c at three different depths of the fibre sediment containing area ca 20 ha in lake näsijärvi tampere finland near the old pulp and paper mill the sampling points were chosen to give a representative understanding of the sedimented fibres due to heterogeneous nature of the sedimented fibres especially at different depths sampling depths table 1 were chosen based on the estimated total depth of the sedimented fibre layer ranging between 0 and 10 m so that they would represent the top middle and bottom sections of the layer samples from each sampling point were taken with an excavator bucket from a sampling ferry autiola and holopainen 2016 the samples were transported to the laboratory and stored at 6 c until used before the experiments each sample was homogenized by mixing for 1 min using a concrete mixer attached to a power drill after mixing samples for total ts and volatile solids vs analysis were taken different samples for solid liquid separation and total samples for determining the biomethane potential were used digested mesophilic municipal sewage sludge from viinikanlahti sewage treatment plant tampere finland was used as the inoculum for the experiments determining biomethane potential bmp 2 2 solid liquid separation for the bmp determination liquid and solid fractions from 5 l of sedimented fibres were separated by removing liquid from the total samples with a juice press simulating a screw press in a smaller scale that had a volume of 12 l diameter 360 mm height 600 mm and where the pressure was realized with a lever arm the amount of water to be removed was determined based on the ts content 9 3 21 6 of the total sample so that for the resulting dry residue ts was approximately 20 for sample a 0 1 m the ts was already above 20 and thus no water was removed ts and vs were determined for the dry and liquid fractions in addition the total and soluble chemical oxygen demand codtot and cods were determined for liquid fractions 2 3 bmp batch assays liquid and solid fractions of the sedimented fibres were both analysed for their bmp separately in addition the bmp of the total sedimented fibre samples without solid liquid separation from sampling point b was determined for solid and total samples bmp was determined in duplicates in 1 l glass bottles containing 350 ml inoculum and sedimented fibre samples at a ratio of 2 0 g vssubstrate g vsinoculum 67 ml of 42 g l nahco3 final concentration 4 g l was added to each bottle as a buffer and the liquid volume was adjusted to 700 ml with distilled water for liquid fractions of sedimented fibres the bmp was determined in triplicates in 120 ml serum glass bottles containing 30 ml of inoculum liquid fibre samples the final total cod concentration was 5 4 9 6 g l and was dependent on the sample and 6 ml of 42 g l nahco3 to have a final concentration of 4 g l distilled water was added to reach a total liquid volume of 60 ml control samples inoculum only were prepared by replacing the substrate with distilled water both in 1 l and 120 ml glass bottles the cumulative methane production of the inoculum was excluded from the cumulative methane production of the samples the methane yields are given as the average value of the parallel samples the initial ph of the batch bottle contents was between 7 0 and 8 1 headspaces were flushed with n2 gas for 3 min after sealing to ensure anaerobic conditions the 1 l glass bottles were placed in a water bath at 35 c and connected to aluminum gas bags supel inert foil gas sampling bags supelco usa for collection of the produced gas the 120 ml serum bottles were placed in a static incubator at 35 c the content and volume of the gas were analysed 1 3 times a week at the end of the assay ph ts and vs cods and volatile fatty acids vfas were determined 2 4 analyses and calculations the methane yields in solid and liquid fibre fractions in sampling point b were also calculated against the g vs of the total sedimented fibre sample l

the gas bag was connected with tubing to an air tight water column that was opened from the bottom the gas from the gas bags replaced a certain mass of water from the water column and the mass of the replaced water was weighed and converted to a volume at stp for the 120 ml serum bottles the volume of methane was calculated based on the percentage of ch4 in the headspace where the overpressure was accounted for and released when the ch4 content increased above 90 angelidaki et al 2009 all measurements were performed at room temperature 20 c and atmospheric pressure 1 atm air temperature and

autiola and holopainen 2016 the mass balances of the solid and liquid fractions after solid liquid separation fig 1 show that most of the ts and vs end up in the solid fraction that comprises of 46 70 of the volume of the total sample the ts and vs for the total and solid fractions of sedimented fibres and of the inoculum and cods for the liquid fractions of sedimented fibres are presented in table 2 ts for the total samples was between 9 3 and 13 9 except for a 0 1m that had a ts of 21 6 after solid liquid separation the ts of the solid fractions was in the range of 17 4 21 1 which is close to the aimed ts value of 20 both for total and solid samples the vs ts ratio was over 93 except for sample a 2 3m that had a vs ts ratio of 87 the liquid fractions contained codt in the range of 5 5 13 9 g l of which the soluble cod was 42 92 2 3 12 7 g l table 2 the total 7 1 9 0 g l and soluble 5 4 6 2 g l cod in the liquid fractions at different depths from sampling points a and c were similar while there were large variations in the total 5 5 13 9 g l and soluble 2 3 12 7 g l cod for sampling point c table 2 the nitrogen and phosphorous in four of the total samples and in two of the pore water samples as well as the organic acids in the pore water samples of two of the samples were determined the total nitrogen in the four total samples a 2 3m b 3 4m b 5 6m and c 4 5m varied between 2 9 and 4 7 g kg ts and the phosphorous between 0 27 and 0 31 g kg ts in the pore water the total vfa content varied between 2 4 and 6 4 g l table 3 the concentrations of organic acids increased while the concentrations of total nitrogen decreased with sampling depth autiola and holopainen 2016 3 2 methane production potential 3 2 1 solid fractions of sedimented fibres methane production from the solid fractions of sedimented fibres started in less than one week and 80 of the methane produced in 30 d was produced in the first two weeks fig 2 for two of the sampling points a and c higher methane yields were obtained from the deeper sediments e g 250 more methane was produced from sample a 2 3m than from a 0 1m and 23 more methane was produced from sample c 4 5m than from c 0 1m however from sampling point b 35 higher methane yields were obtained from solid fractions of sedimented fibre from a depth or 0 1 m than from 3 4 m fig 2 the assays were continued until day 56 but 94 97 of the methane was produced in the first 30 d except for sample a 0 1m where 89 of the methane was produced in the first 30 d the highest methane yield 320 l ch4 kg vs on day 30 was obtained from the solid fractions of sedimented fibres originating from the deepest samples 4 6 m fig 2 while in other sampling points the methane yields were higher 180 320 l ch4 kg vs in sampling point a 0 1m the methane yield was only 80 l ch4 kg vs thus there is a large variation in the methane yields between individual samples originating from different sampling points and depths fig 2 however the sedimented fibre from sampling point a 0 1m differed from the others as it had a higher ts 21 6 in the beginning and consisted mainly of woody pieces while the other samples had a felt like structure and had based on visual observations been subjected more to biological degradation the digestates were characterized in the end of the assays table 4 the ph of the solid fractions of sedimented fibre samples did not change much during the assays from initial 7 1 7 5 to final 7 5 7 6 the measured ts and vs removals of the solid fibre samples with the inoculum s ts and vs subtracted on day 56 were 63 78 and 63 78 respectively the ts and vs removal was not dependent on the depth of the sedimented fibres no vfas were detected at the end of any of the assays 3 2 2 liquid fractions of sedimented fibres when studying the methane production from the liquid fractions of sedimented fibres the trends were similar to that of the solid fractions there was no clear trend between methane yields l ch4 kg cod and the depths of the samples again more methane was produced from deeper samples of the sampling point b while from sampling point c the highest methane yields were obtained from the middle layer 1 2 m fig 2 in addition methane production started fast and 80 of the methane produced in 30 d was produced in the first five days from the liquid fractions methane yields were the highest 280 20 l ch4 kg cod for sample b 5 6m while the average was 240 40 l ch4 kg cod the experiments were continued for 68 days but over 87 of the methane was produced in the first 30 d the digestates of the liquid fractions were characterized in the end of the assays table 4 the ph decreased during the experiments 68 d from 7 2 8 1 to 6 9 7 0 the cods decrease was in the range of 76 84 except for the sample a 2 3m that had cods decrease of 66 the final cods was 0 41 0 53 g l table 4 no vfas were detected at the end of the experiments indicating that not all the soluble cod was anaerobically biodegradable 3 2 3 total sedimented fibre samples as with solid and liquid fractions of sedimented fibres from sampling point b the methane yields from the total sedimented fibre samples increased with the sample collection depth as with solid sedimented fibre fractions over 80 of the methane produced in 30 d was produced during the first two weeks fig 2 the differences in the methane yields were considerable an average methane yield of 340 l ch4 kg vs was obtained from total sample at the depth of 5 6 m while from the depth of 0 1m 210 l ch4 kg vs was produced fig 2 the digestates of the total samples were characterized in the end of the assays table 4 the ph changed from 7 0 7 4 to 7 5 the ts and vs removals on day 56 were 59 62 and 61 65 respectively and no vfas were detected at the end of the experiment the experiment was continued until day 56 but 95 of the methane was produced in the first 30 d 3 3 comparison of methane yields from different sedimented fibre fractions methane production from the total solid and liquid fractions of sampling point b were compared by projecting the methane yields against the vs of the original total sample before solid liquid separation and against vs removal fig 3 most of the methane was produced from the solid fraction 95 9 98 4 of the sedimented fibres the liquid fractions resulted only in less than 4 of the methane obtained from the total samples fig 3 which corresponds to the vs content of the liquid fraction comparing the methane yields calculated against the vs removed fig 3b the sum of the solid and liquid fractions resulted in 79 97 of the methane yield of the total sample the differences between the methane yields of total samples and the sum of solid and liquid fraction can be explained by the i heterogenous sample ii small sample volume 0 1 l used for the incubations compared to the large original sample volume of the sedimented fibres 10 l and iii the high vs content of the total sedimented fibres ca 12 vs this is also supported by the large variation between the different sampling points on average the methane yields for total solid and liquid fractions were 400 110 340 100 and 7 5 l ch4 kg vsremoved respectively 4 discussion 4 1 characteristics of sedimented fibres the studied fibres have been accumulating over a period of 60 100 years from pulp mill with different pulping processes sulfite chemi thermomechanical pulping raw water intake systems and different wastewater treatment methods various processes have apparently occurred at the studied sediments in boreal conditions e g annual ice cover water flows and temperatures previous research on the on site degradation of sedimented fibres has suggested that more rapid hydrolysis of fibres occurs in anaerobic sediments that already contain high volumes of deposited fibres due to the enrichment of hydrolytic bacteria in the anaerobic sediments pearson 1980 furthermore it has also been proposed that the long term exposure of fibre discharges to sediments with restricted water exchange will eventually lead to the deoxygenation of the bottom waters as well as the elimination of the fauna pearson 1980 in the studied bay area of lake näsijärvi large volumes of fibres 1 5 million m3 have sedimented over a long period of time 60 100 years in a relatively small area ca 20 ha with apparently low water exchange during the sedimentation period the hydrolysis of the fibres has likely occurred in the sediments followed by a decrease in the activity of the fauna in addition the oxygen in the sediments is likely consumed in the beginning of the sedimentation period leading to anaerobic conditions the organic content of the sediment was high on average 95 vs ts 12 4 ts and 11 7 vs while vs ts ratios of 51 80 and 65 97 have been reported for pulp and paper mill primary sludge 1 5 6 5 ts and biosludge 1 0 2 0 ts respectively meyer and edwards 2014 thus the sedimented fibres have considerably higher vs ts content than the present pulp and paper mill sludge indicating the higher degradation potential of the sedimented fibres the sedimented fibres contained negligible concentrations of nutrients i e 2 9 4 7 mg n kg ts and 0 27 0 31 mg p kg ts the low nutrient concentrations indicate that a lack of nutrients may slow down the anaerobic treatment of sedimented fibres especially in continuous processes bayr and rintala 2012 reported nitrogen concentrations of 0 1 and 1 9 2 0 g l for primary sludge and biosludge respectively from pulp and paper mills in addition kinnunen et al 2015 reported phosphorous and nitrogen contents of 1 2 8 6 g p kg ts and 41 81 g n kg ts respectively for pulp and paper mill biosludge the low nitrogen content has been reported to limit methane production from primary sludge and biosludge of pulp and paper mills bayr and rintala 2012 and the low nitrogen content of the sedimented fibres will likely also affect continuous methane production from sedimented fibres 4 2 solid liquid separation of sedimented fibres the applied simple solid liquid separation of the sedimented fibres simulated mechanical dewatering e g using a screw press screw and filter presses are often used for dewatering sludge in municipal wastewater treatment plants as well as in the pulp and paper industry ojanen 2001 saunamäki 1997 mechanical dewatering in the pulp and paper industry is often enough to increase the solid content up to 30 40 ts before e g combustion of the sludge but usually requires addition of polymers and or thermal treatment before dewatering ojanen 2001 in this study some of the water was easily removed from the sedimented fibres without the addition of polymers and 40 of the water could be removed to obtain a ts and vs content of an average 19 5 vs and 18 4 vs 94 vs ts respectively while the potential for higher solid fraction ts was not attempted thus using a screw press to separate water from sedimented fibres should also be feasible at a larger scale and results in a solid fraction with a high vs ts content the total and soluble cod content of the separated liquid fractions was high on average 8 8 2 5 and 6 7 3 1 g l respectively and shows that the liquid fraction requires treatment before discharge the liquid fraction of sedimented fibres was biodegradable with a soluble cod removal of 66 84 indicating the potential for biological treatment processes 4 3 methane production potential from the sedimented fibres the results in this study show that by adding an inoculum and adjusting the ph near neutral which is optimal for methanogens significant anaerobic degradation of sedimented fibres 61 65 vs removal in total sedimented fibres takes place in the batch assays resulting in the production of methane batch incubations with sedimented fibres only without inoculum at a neutral ph indicated that there are no indigenous microorganisms in sedimented fibres that could convert fibres into methane results not shown from solid fractions and total samples the highest and average methane yields were 320 l ch4 kg vs 270 40 l ch4 kg vs and 340 l ch4 kg vs 250 80 l ch4 kg vs respectively from the liquid fractions the methane yields were at the highest and in average 280 l ch4 kg cod 240 40 l ch4 kg cod compared to typical methane yields from pulp and paper industry primary sludge biosludge or their mixture table 5 the results from this study were higher in addition the vs removal was considerably higher for total and solid fractions of sedimented fibres compared to primary sludge and or biosludge from pulp and paper industry table 5 the present methane yields are in the same range as obtained in the typical sewage sludge digesters e g 260 l ch4 kg vs luostarinen et al 2009 in the batch assays of this study the methane production started fast and 80 of the methane was produced during the first two weeks for comparison in similar type of batch assays it took 55 days bayr et al 2013 and 40 days karlsson et al 2011 to reach ca 80 of the methane yield from pulp and paper mill ca 110 ml ch4 g vs and kraft pulp mill ca 190 ml ch4 g vs biosludge respectively the fast methane production in batch assays can be attributed to optimized conditions i e a ph adjustment to neutral 7 8 and the addition of microorganisms as well as nutrients with inoculum digestate from anaerobic treatment of municipal sewage sludge the high methane yields are surprising compared to the methane yields of primary sludge and biosludge from the pulp and paper industry table 5 suggesting that the long storage of the fibres in the sediments has likely resulted in the microbial hydrolysis of the fibres pearson 1980 enabling faster anaerobic degradation in the batch assays of this study it has been reported for example that lignin derived from hardwood can be partly biodegraded in anoxic sediments in the long term almost 300 d studies benner et al 1984 furthermore meriläinen et al 2001 suggested that resin acids wood components that are inhibitory for anaerobic digestion meyer and edwards 2014 can be microbially degraded in the long term and or may be discharged to the receiving water bodies these factors among others may have resulted in better degradation and biomethane production from sedimented fibres the results suggest that the studied sedimented fibres can be biologically treated as such without pretreatment or after mechanical solid liquid separation dewatering both solid and liquid fractions contain biologically anaerobically degradable organics and serve as a good feedstock for anaerobic bioprocessing e g solids in continuously stirred tank reactors and liquids in upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors different reactor configurations should be considered for treating the different fractions as solid liquid separation would considerably decrease the volume of the solid fraction that contains most of the methane potential 4 4 extrapolation of the methane production to practice there are approximately 1 5 million m3 sedimented fibres originating from the pulp and paper industry in the studied bay area in lake näsijärvi finland as the average methane yield for the solid fractions of the sedimented fibres was similar to the methane yield of total samples 250 l ch4 kg vs the anaerobic treatment of the solid fractions after solid liquid separation may be attractive and would result in smaller volumes to be treated in this case however the treatment of liquid fraction also has to be considered in table 6 the methane production potentials of the total solid and liquid fractions of the sedimented fibres in the practical scale are given based on the methane yields obtained in the laboratory assays from the samples analysed in this study it can be estimated that the organic matter content vs of the total samples is around 12 thus there are 0 19 million m3 sedimented fibres as vs based on these values and assuming a density of 1000 kg m3 for the sedimented fibres the overall methane production potential of the total sedimented fibres is 44 million m3 as a comparison the overall methane production potential from the biowaste and the sludge from municipal wastewater treatment plants and septic tanks in the city of tampere and the surrounding area pirkanmaa region 500 000 inhabitants is estimated to be ca 5 6 million m3 year mönkäre et al 2016 thus the methane production potential from sedimented fibres is 7 8 times higher than the yearly methane production potential of biowaste and municipal sludge in the pirkanmaa region anaerobic treatment of the sedimented fibres in the studied bay area of lake näsijärvi finland could generate income which to certain extent could compensate for the treatment and remediation costs in solid liquid separation on average 56 of the volume end up in the solid fraction resulting in a volume of solid fraction of 0 84 million m3 corresponding to 0 16 million m3 sedimented fibere as vs thus the methane production potential of the solid sedimented fibres is 39 million m3 table 6 in addition solid liquid separation of the sedimented fibres would result in a large volume of liquid 0 66 million m3 that has on average a total and soluble cod concentrations of 8 8 2 5 and 6 7 3 1 g l respectively with an average methane yield of 240 40 l ch4 kg cod the liquid fraction has a methane production potential of 1 4 million m3 table 6 a typical domestic wastewater contains 0 34 1 02 g cod l depending on the strength of the wastewater metcalf and eddy 2014 the design load of the new centralized regional sewage treatment plant under construction in tampere finland is ca 7700 t bod year in 2020 tampere water 2007 the liquid fraction of sedimented fibres would result in an overall load of 5800 t cod table 6 assuming a bod cod ratio of 0 5 this would convert to an overall load of ca 2900 t bod which is a bit over 30 of the annual design load of the regional sewage treatment plant in tampere however it is likely that the remediation of the sedimented fibres will take several years and thus the wastewater load would also be generated over many years the cod concentrations of the different pulp and paper mill wastewaters applicable for anaerobic treatment typically range from 0 7 to 25 g l meyer and edwards 2014 thus wastewater treatment technologies suitable for pulp and paper mill wastewaters could also be used to treat the liquid fractions of sedimented fibres examples of such processes include anaerobic digestion in anaerobic filters upflow anaerobic sludge bed reactors and anaerobic membrane bioreactors kamali et al 2016 treating solid and liquid fractions separately would enable the treatment of the solid fraction with longer hrts while the liquid fraction could be treated anaerobically in reactors enabling shorter hrts and offering the possibility to consider e g the combination of a leach bed reactor and an upflow anaerobic sludge bed reactor the sedimented fibres in lake näsijärvi originating from the pulp and paper industry are not unique for example the pulp and paper industry has resulted in lake pollution and sedimented fibres all over the world including the nordic countries canada and china guo et al 2016 jackson 2016 ratia et al 2013 since many of the old industrial sites have been situated close to large cities problems arise when the water bodies are transformed into recreational grounds thus dredging the sedimented fibres from the lakes and treating them will become increasingly important in the future further studies on the treatment of the total sedimented fibres using different reactor configurations and process conditions are ongoing with the aim to provide information for the technical feasibility of different systems and to make cost analyses in addition the digestates of the reactors will be characterized to develop the use of the digestates 5 conclusions in this study it was reported for the first time that the anaerobic degradation of old sedimented fibres result in the production of methane with high methane yields 250 80 l ch4 kg vs when the sedimented fibres are separated to solid and liquid fractions the solid fraction ca 56 of the original volume has the highest methane production potential 230 60 ch4 kg vsoriginal however the liquid fraction still contains a high amount of cod 8 8 2 5 g l that requires treatment before discharge at the site under investigation there is methane production potential up to approximately 40 million m3 acknowledgement this project was funded by the city of tampere the authors would like to thank the lifeguard of hiedanranta reijo väliharju from the city of tampere for his support during the project ramboll finland oy for providing the sedimented fibre samples and

19732,remarkable atrazine degradation in the s iv autoxidation process catalyzed by fe2 mn2 fe2 mn2 sulfite was demonstrated in this study competitive kinetic experiments alcohol inhibiting methods and electron spin resonance esr experiments proved that sulfur radicals were not the major oxidation species mn iii was demonstrated to be the primary active species in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process based on the comparison of oxidation selectivity moreover the inhibiting effect of the mn iii hydrolysis and the s iv autoxidation in the presence of organic contaminants indicated the existence of three mn iii consumption routes in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process the absence of hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical was interpreted by the competitive dynamics method the oxidation capacity of the fe2 mn2 sulfite was independent of the initial ph 4 0 6 0 because the fast decay of s iv decreased initial ph below 4 0 rapidly the rate of atz degradation was independent of the dissolved oxygen do because that the major do consumption process was not the rate determining step during the production of so5 phosphate and bicarbonate were confirmed to have greater inhibitory effects than other environmental factors because of their strong ph buffering capacity and complexing capacity for fe3 the proposed acetylation degradation pathway of atz showed the application of the fe2 mn2 sulfite process in the research of contaminants degradation pathways this work investigated the characteristics of the fe2 mn2 sulfite process in the presence of organic contaminants which might promote the development of mn iii oxidation technology graphical abstract image 1 keywords fe2 mn2 catalysis process mn iii oxidation sulfur radicals atrazine acetylation degradation pathway 1 introduction recently soluble mn iii was found in the endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs degradation process during permanganate oxidation jiang et al 2012 the appearance of mn iii accelerated the edcs degradation process due to its strong oxidation capacity very recently sun established a permanganate bisulfite pm bs process to produce a mass of mn iii in a short time within 200 ms sun et al 2015 which was an efficient method to activate kmno4 and fully take advantage of the strong oxidation capacity of mn iii existing in the form of hydroxo mn3 mn iii sulfur complex or other types of intermediates gao et al 2017 hu et al 2017 although other works about the implication of mn iii on organic pollutant oxidation have rarely been reported sun s work has revealed the prospects of mn iii for application in organic contaminants oxidation however the fast mn iii production in the pm bs system made the detection of intermediate products at various time intervals difficult during the mn iii oxidation process therefore it is necessary to establish a mn iii slow release technology to research the intermediate products transformations in the mn iii oxidation process the manganese ii catalyzed autoxidation of the s iv played a crucial role in the formation of acid rain and the flue gas desulfurization fgd process due to the strong catalytic activity of the mn iii ii redox reaction connick and zhang 1996 since mnhso3 being oxidized to mnso3 by o2 is an energy unfavorable reaction berglund et al 1993 berglund indicated that sulfur radicals which initiated the mn iii ii redox reaction were provided by trace fe iii and fe ii in water reaction 1 5 table 1 connick and zhang indicated that the stability constant of mnhso3 was more than 500 fold weaker than 3 104 m 1 connick and zhang 1996 which meant that most of mn ii existed in the form of mn2 with the presence of so5 that was offered by the fe iii ii redox reaction mn2 was rapidly oxidized to mn iii which obtained a strong oxidation capacity for sulfite reaction 6 table 1 then the mn iii ii redox reaction occurred in the s iv autoxidation process reaction 7 table 1 additional mn iii and fe iii experiments were conducted to verify this mechanism fronaeus et al 1998 experimental results showed that the appearance of mn iii and fe iii greatly accelerated the autoxidation rate of s iv in the mn2 sulfite system as a complicated process that simultaneously produces mn iii and sulfur radicals the fe2 mn2 sulfite process has not been studied thoroughly for its effects on the organic contaminants oxidation capacity thus far since no additional oxidation reagents are needed except o2 the fe2 mn2 sulfite process might be regarded as a cost efficient oxidation method additionally the study of the atz degradation pathways in fe2 mn2 sulfite could improve the understanding of the contaminants transformations because the fe2 mn2 sulfite widely exists in the atmosphere and natural water atrazine is often used as the probe for both ho and so4 due to its similar rate constants towards ho and so4 k 1 k 2 3 0 109 m 1s 1 table s1 yang et al 2015 in this work rapid atrazine degradation illustrated the great oxidation capacity of fe2 mn2 sulfite competitive kinetic experiments alcohol inhibiting methods electron spin resonance esr experiments and the comparison of the oxidation selectivity between the fe2 mn2 sulfite and the pm bs processes were used to determine the major oxidation species in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process then inhibiting effects on the mn iii hydrolysis and the s iv autoxidation were considered to investigate the interaction between sulfite h2o and organic contaminants next the effects of the initial ph dissolved oxygen anions and humic acid ha were evaluated as the common environmental factors finally the atrazine degradation pathways in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process was proposed by the quantitative analysis of the intermediate products 2 materials and methods 2 1

identification of major oxidation species 3 1 1 performance of atz degradation in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process compared with the fe2 sulfite and mn2 sulfite process atz degradation was accelerated greatly in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process with lower dosages of fe2 and mn2 fig 1 a additionally the synergy of fe2 and mn2 significantly shortened the induction period with increasing fe2 dosages especially when fe2 0 10 μm the degradation of atz followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics further experiments showed that the degradation rates varied with different types of contaminants in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process fig 1b which demonstrated that significant oxidation selectivity existed in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process 3 1 2 competition dynamics experiments the organics such as atz nb phenol and 4 bp were selected as the model organic contaminants to investigate the major active species in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process smx has a higher rate constant than atz towards so4 k 5 k 2 table s1 mahdi ahmed et al 2012 but the k obs of smx degradation was much smaller than that of atz additionally competition dynamics experiments showed the value of k1 ln c 0 c a t z ln c 0 c s m x k o b s a t z k o b s s m x 4 25 fig s2a and the value of k2 ln c 0 c a t z ln c 0 c s m x k o b s a t z k o b s s m x 3 70 fig s2b therefore the average value of k 3 98 did not match the ratio between the 2 s order kinetic constants for the reaction of atz and smx with sulfate radical k so 4 atz k so 4 smx k 2 k 5 0 34 table s1 which suggested that so4 was not the dominant oxidation species 3 1 3 alcohol inhibiting effect additionally alcohol inhibition methods were adopted for identifying the major oxidation species fig 2 a tba is an effective quencher for ho k 6 6 108 m 1s 1 table s1 neta et al 1988 but not for so4 k 7 4 105 m 1s 1 table s1 guan et al 2011 thus tba was widely used to distinguish the contribution of ho and so4 the decrease of atz removal in the presence of 1000 fold tba was only 9 which proved that ho was not the major oxidation species the rate constants of so5 towards organic contaminants are usually 105 107 m 1s 1 k 12 105 107 m 1s 1 table s1 huie and neta 1985 neta and huie 1985 whereas the rate constants of so5 towards 1 hexanol is less than 103 m 1s 1 k 11 103 m 1s 1 table s1 huie et al 1989 the oxidation capacity of so5 should not be inhibited completely by 5 mm 1 hexanol k 12 a t z k 11 1 h e x a n o l 10 5 m 1 s 1 5 10 6 m 10 3 m 1 s 1 5 10 3 m 0 1 0 05 table s1 however further experimental results illustrated that atz removal decreased to less than 5 in the presence of 5 mm 1 hexanol fig 2a which proved that so5 was not the major oxidation species for organic contaminants 3 1 4 esr experiments to gain further evidence for our assumption esr experiments were employed the characteristic signal of dmpo so3 an 14 7 g ah 15 9 g mottley and mason 1988 was observed by esr in fig 3 a as the concentration of dmpo decreased to 25 mm the characteristic signal of dmpo so4 an 1 38 mt ah 1 02 mt ah 0 14 mt ah 0 08 mt and dmpo ho adducts an 1 49 mt ah 1 49 mt zou et al 2013 could not be confirmed with less dmpo more so3 was oxidized to so5 corresponding characteristic signals of dmpo so4 and dmpo ho adducts were detected in the cr vi sulfite process with 25 mm dmpo jiang et al 2015 the results in this work provided powerful evidence that neither so4 nor ho was the dominant oxidation species in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process 3 1 5 comparison of oxidation selectivity between the pm bs and the fe2 mn2 sulfite processes the pm bs system as an efficient method for producing mn iii sun et al 2015 was also introduced in this work compared with the pm bs process higher atz removal was obtained in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process moreover fig 2a and b revealed that both the pm bs and the fe2 mn2 sulfite processes shared coincident oxidation selectivity for contaminants 4 bp smx nb and atz and scavengers tba meoh and 1 hexanol a preliminary conclusion could be obtained that mn iii was the dominant oxidation species in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process 3 2 proposed mechanism 3 2 1 the initiation of the mn iii ii redox reaction both the production rate of fe iii species fig s3 and degradation rate of atz fig 1a grew with an increase of fe2 0 which suggested that fe iii played an important role in the initial period because feso3 offered the original so3 reaction 4 table 1 guo et al 2013 fig 3b illustrated that the so3 signal intensity of fe2 mn2 sulfite was the much higher than that of the mn2 sulfite process which suggested that the fe iii ii redox reaction could be regarded as an initiator for the production of mn iii 3 2 2 the hydrolysis of mn iii mn iii was regarded as a strong levis acid and even in acidic solution the hydrolysis is considerable biedermann and palombari 1978 in the absence of organic contaminants 4 63 μm mno2 was yielded from 50 μm fe2 mn2 catalysis of the s iv autoxidation process fig 4 a with the increase of atz mn iii hydrolysis was inhibited significantly fig 4a and only less than 1 5 μm mno2 was produced in the presence of 5 μm atz suggesting that more than 67 of hydrolysis was inhibited in addition the inhibitory effect with the same concentration of organic contaminants increased according to the order of nb smx 4 bp atz which was the same as the increasing order of the observed rate constants of model contaminants degradations table 2 suggesting that the degradation of organic pollutant was a competition reaction for mn iii hydrolysis considering h2o 55 56 m which was much more than the organic contaminants concentration the rate constant of mn iii hydrolysis k c should be significantly lower than the rate constant of organic contaminants oxidation k b which was in agreement with the prior study sisley and jordan 2006 despite that the detailed conditions ph and mn2 were different from this work additionally when fe2 0 mn2 0 10 μm the production of mno2 was less than the limitation of the abts method without any organic contaminant not given however the degradation ratio of 5 μm atz was up to 98 3 in 180 s which indicated that mno2 was not the direct oxidation species for organic contaminants 3 2 3 the autoxidation of s iv similar to mn iii hydrolysis the inhibition of s iv autoxidation process was aggravated according to the order of nb smx 4 bp atz fig 4b and the observed rate constants of s iv decay are provided in table 2 the inhibitory effect of 5 μm contaminant nb smx 4 bp and atz to the generation of mn iii could be neglected due to the high rate constant of reaction 6 k 5 108 m 1s 1 table 1 the decrease of the s iv autoxidation rate constant in the presence of 5 μm contaminant could be considered as a powerful evidence of the competitive relationship between the contaminants degradation process and the s iv autoxidation process therefore it was easy to understand that s iv autoxidation process played a special role in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process on the one hand the s iv autoxidation supplied so5 as the driving force for mn iii ii redox reaction on the other hand the s iv autoxidation was inhibited by the degradation of organic pollutant as a competition reaction 3 2 4 the proposed production mechanism and consumption routes for mn iii in summary a proposed mechanism of mn iii production and consumption could be described as shown in fig 5 the fe2 sulfite process supplied so5 which could drive the mn iii ii redox powerfully in the initial period of the oxidation process in the presence of organic pollutant mn iii obtained three consumption routes which included the s iv autoxidation process route a k a organic contaminant degradation process route b k b and mn iii hydrolysis route c k c both the mn iii hydrolysis and s iv autoxidation processes were inhibited in the presence of organic contaminants especially the hydrolysis taking into consideration the concentrations of h2o mnhso3 and the contaminants the corresponding rate constant rankings should be k a and k b k c three consumption routes were in competition as they consumed mn iii simultaneously 3 2 5 the absence of hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical there were two possible sources of hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical in the fe2 mn2 sulfite system 1 the hso3 was oxidized to so4 by so5 reaction 8 table 1 2 pms hso5 would be formed when so5 oxidized mn ii to mn iii reaction 6 table 1 in the presence of fe2 pms would decompose into hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical reaction 10 table the absence of hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical in the fe2 mn2 sulfite system was explained as follows 1 in the beginning of reaction period the hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical generated from the reaction 8 table 1 were captured by 1 mm sulfite completely k 1 a t z k 14 h s o 3 3 0 10 9 m 1 s 1 5 10 6 m 4 5 10 9 m 1 s 1 1 0 10 3 m 0 3 table s1 k 2 a t z k 10 h s o 3 3 0 10 9 m 1 s 1 5 10 6 m 3 2 10 8 m 1 s 1 1 0 10 3 m 4 7 table s1 after the beginning period the ph from 6 0 fast decreased to approximately 3 9 fig 6 a berglund reported that the rate constant of reaction 6 k 5 108 m 1s 1 table 1 was four orders of magnitude larger than that of reaction 8 k 7 1 2 104 m 1s 1 table 1 at ph values of 1 0 4 0 berglund et al 1993 thus the reason that the absence of so4 was explained by the fact that mn ii outcompeted sulfite for so5 reaction 6 vs reaction 8 2 similar to the above interpretation the hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical generated from the reaction 10 table 1 were captured by 1 mm sulfite completely in the beginning of reaction period additionally the concentration of fe ii decreased to less than 0 5 μm after the beginning period fig s3 which meant that k 9 fe ii 3 104 m 1s 1 0 5 10 6 m 0 015 s 1 reaction 10 table 1 ling et al 2017 meanwhile the value range of k 8 hso3 was 1 18 s 1 to 1 34 s 1 based on the stoichiometric ratio of reaction 9 in table 1 the calculation process was provided in text s3 therefore hso5 was consumed by sulfite completely because reaction 10 was suppressed by reaction 9 after the beginning period k 9 f e i i k 8 h s o 3 0 015 s 1 1 18 s 1 1 3 table 1 in conclusion the oxidation capacity of the fe2 mn2 sulfite system was independent of the hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical 3 3 influencing factors 3 3 1 effect of the initial ph the sulfite autoxidation process and contaminant oxidation in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process were independent of the initial ph from the initial ph values of 4 0 6 0 fig 6b which was in accordance with previous studies about the mn2 sulfite process berglund and elding 1995 grgić et al 1991 with the rapid s iv autoxidation the mass of h decreased the initial ph promptly reaction 7 in table 1 is a h production process after 20 s the ph from 6 0 decreased to approximately 3 9 and the final ph was 3 2 which meant that the real environmental ph was almost below 4 0 except for the initial period according to the stoichiometric ratio of reaction 7 table 1 0 8 mm s iv autoxidation would decrease ph to 3 1 considering the influence of the h consumption process reaction 6 table 1 the theoretical concentration of h matched the final ph 3 2 which was greatly lower than the final ph 4 0 of the pm bs process sun et al 2015 although initial ph influenced the initial oxidation rate of atz the rapid decrease of ph could reduce the differences of mn iii hydrolysis in different ph values therefore the k obs of organic contaminants degradation and the s iv autoxidation were almost the same with initial ph values from 4 0 to 6 0 fig 6a 3 3 2 effect of dissolved oxygen as the only additional oxidation reagent do might be an important factor influencing the degradation rate of organic contaminants since the concentration of do 9 mg l in the reaction solution was smaller than that of sulfite 1 mm and the rapid autoxidation of sulfite would deplete do in a short time continuous aeration was adopted to investigate the relationship between the do and the degradation rates of organic contaminants previous studies illustrated that the rate determining step in the so5 production process was the formation of so3 rather than so3 oxidation process reaction 5 table 1 which was the major o2 consumption process brandt et al 1994 the experimental results showed that there was no significance difference in k obs between do 5 mg l and 9 mg l fig 6b which further confirmed the results of the previous study 3 3 3 effect of anions fig 6c illustrated that anions suppressed atz degradation in the following order sulfate chloride bicarbonate phosphate which was the same as different inorganic anions influencing order in the fenton system lu et al 1997 siedlecka et al 2007 because of the important role of fe iii in the fenton and fe2 mn2 sulfite systems fig s4 showed that h2po4 obtained a stronger fe iii complexing capacity than cl and so4 2 from a ph of 3 0 to a ph of 6 0 in addition hpo4 2 h2po4 and hco3 h2co3 2 had a strong buffering capacity fig s5 demonstrated that after the beginning of the reaction the ph of the buffer solution decreased much more slowly than that of the unbuffered one which led to the strong hydrolysis of mn iii hence bicarbonate and phosphate obtained much greater inhibition than sulfate and chloride 3 3 4 effect of ha as a type of common dissolved organic matter ha did not obtain a certain complexing capacity for fe3 fe2 kang and choi 2008 wang et al 2012 but it did consume mn iii simultaneously when the concentration of ha was less than 2 mg c l 1 the removal of atz decreased slightly however when the concentration of ha was more than 2 mg c l 1 the removal of atz decreased sharply even so the removal of atz reached up to 58 3 as the concentration of ha increased to 10 mg c l 1 fig 6d it demonstrated that the low concentration of ha had difficulty competing with atz in contrast when the concentration of ha was more than 2 mg c l 1 the complexing effect and competition effect of ha were obvious in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process however ha could not be considered as a major inhibiting factor compared with h2po4 and hco3 3 3 5 degradation efficiency in real water two different real water samples were used to elucidate the performance of the fe2 mn2 sulfite process fig s6 the degradation of atz decreased from 98 31 to 45 73 for surface water and to 27 84 for underground water respectively in 180 s table s2 showed that the bicarbonate concentration of the groundwater sample was up to 5 07 mm which contained a strong buffering capacity hence the inhibition effect of underground water was significantly stronger than that of surface water 3 4 proposed atz degradation pathway as a process that could produce the mn iii continuously the fe2 mn2 sulfite process was suitable to quantitatively analyze the intermediate products in the mn iii oxidation process by sampling during the reaction time hence the degradation pathway of atz in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process was studied in this work table s3 demonstrated five main types of atz degradation products were detected in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process which was much less than the types of products more than ten types detected in aops ji et al 2015 khan et al 2014 kong et al 2016 moreover the dechlorination products were not generated during the degradation process which was in agreement with previous work about atz degradation pathway hu et al 2017 however atz dechlorination products were detected in both the ozone oxidation process and aops acero et al 2000 kong et al 2016 hence our preliminary conclusion that mn iii was the major oxidation species in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process was corroborated by the above analysis of degradation products the following three points in intermediate products analysis were noteworthy 1 the ratios of dealkylation products and acetylation products all increased during the reaction time when atz 0 5 μm fig s7d fig s8a and fig s8b 2 the ratio of dealkylation products decreased with the increase of atz 0 fig s7d whereas the concentration of the acetylation product cdit 4 acetamido 2 chloro 6 isopropylamino s triazine increased rapidly with the increasing of atz 0 fig s8a however the other acetylation product cdat 4 acetamido 6 amino 2 chloro s triazine increased slowly fig s8b 3 fig s7a and fig s7b demonstrated that the ratios of dea atz 0 and dia atz 0 climbed up to the maximum and then declined significantly when atz 0 5 μm in summary it would be reasonable to obtain the following hypothesis there were two simultaneous atz degradation routes in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process scheme 1 in hu s paper a dealkylation mechanism was offered as route i with the electron abundant amino groups which has a high tendency for electron transfer reactions welhouse and bleam 1993 and atz could be degraded via an intramolecular β elimination mechanism after binding with mn iii hu et al 2017 furthermore dea and dia would be degraded to product v deia the nonredox reaction in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process was a also major degradation pathway the ratio of dealkylation products was more than 50 when atz 0 5 μm in this work the major difference was when atz 0 5 μm and the ratio of dealkylation products decreased sharply to 35 4 whereas the concentration of cdit grew significantly this indicated that the major route of atz degradation changed to the acetylation process route ii scheme 1 which suggested that single electron transfer set occurred after the formation of atz mn iii complex due to the activity of α c that belongs to the n ethyl ji et al 2015 r1 radical was generated from the set process oxygen as an electrophilic reagent was capable of reacting with r1 to generate intermediate r2 then two molecules of r2 lost one molecule hydrogen peroxide to form product i cdit cdit was difficult to oxidize due to the existence of acetyl acero et al 2000 thus the concentration of the further oxidation product iv cdat grew slowly additionally since the hydrolysis of acetyl compounds is slow in weakly acidic aqueous solution the conversions of product i to ii and product iv to v could in fact be neglected in other words the relationships of the five products could be described as shown in scheme s1 and dealkylation products containing dea dia and deia came mainly from route i acetylation product cdit basically came from route ii and cdat was partially generated from route ii the reason that route ii was not proposed in previous studies might be ascribed to the remarkable difference in the mn iii concentration between the pm bs and fe2 mn2 sulfite process it was reported that the concentration of mn iii reached up to 10 5 m within 200 ms and the rate constants of organic contaminants towards mn iii were determined to be 105 106 m 1s 1 sun et al 2016 the k obs of atz degradation was 2 26 10 2 s 1 in this work which meant that the concentration of mn iii was approximately 10 8 10 7 m in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process the concentration of mn iii produced in fe2 mn2 sulfite process was much less than that of the pm bs process compared with β elimination it is difficult for set to occur however the seriously insufficient concentration forced mn iii to demonstrate its oxidation capacity by capturing one electron from the α c of n ethyl then the subsequent reactions occurred 4 conclusion in this work we shed light on the involvement of mn iii in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process which could be utilized for the oxidation of organic contaminants due to the ubiquity of sulfite although bicarbonate and phosphate significantly decreased the atz removal the fe2 mn2 sulfite process still deserves further study as a slow release method of mn iii the following conclusions can be summarized 1 significant atz degradation was observed in the fe2 mn2 sulfite system relative dynamic experiments suggested that sulfur radicals and hydroxyl radical were not the major reactive oxidation species mn iii was confirmed to be the major reactive species by the oxidation selectivity comparison between the pm bs and fe2 mn2 sulfite systems 2 the inhibition of mn iii hydrolysis and the decrease of the s iv autoxidation rate constant in the presence of organic contaminants illustrated that mn iii obtained three consumption routes in the fe2 mn2 sulfite system which included the s iv autoxidation process route a organic contaminant degradation process route b and the mn iii hydrolysis route c 3 the degradation efficiency of the fe2 mn2 sulfite system was influenced by the concentrations of ha and the anions especially hpo4 2 h2po4 and hco3 h2co3 2 obviously suppressed the atz transformation in the fe2 mn2 sulfite system 4 the proposed atz acetylation process proved the existence of a single electron transfer process which suggested that the single electron transfer process and β elimination process coexisted in the atz degradation process during

19732,remarkable atrazine degradation in the s iv autoxidation process catalyzed by fe2 mn2 fe2 mn2 sulfite was demonstrated in this study competitive kinetic experiments alcohol inhibiting methods and electron spin resonance esr experiments proved that sulfur radicals were not the major oxidation species mn iii was demonstrated to be the primary active species in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process based on the comparison of oxidation selectivity moreover the inhibiting effect of the mn iii hydrolysis and the s iv autoxidation in the presence of organic contaminants indicated the existence of three mn iii consumption routes in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process the absence of hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical was interpreted by the competitive dynamics method the oxidation capacity of the fe2 mn2 sulfite was independent of the initial ph 4 0 6 0 because the fast decay of s iv decreased initial ph below 4 0 rapidly the rate of atz degradation was independent of the dissolved oxygen do because that the major do consumption process was not the rate determining step during the production of so5 phosphate and bicarbonate were confirmed to have greater inhibitory effects than other environmental factors because of their strong ph buffering capacity and complexing capacity for fe3 the proposed acetylation degradation pathway of atz showed the application of the fe2 mn2 sulfite process in the research of contaminants degradation pathways this work investigated the characteristics of the fe2 mn2 sulfite process in the presence of organic contaminants which might promote the development of mn iii oxidation technology graphical abstract image 1 keywords fe2 mn2 catalysis process mn iii oxidation sulfur radicals atrazine acetylation degradation pathway 1 introduction recently soluble mn iii was found in the endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs degradation process during permanganate oxidation jiang et al 2012 the appearance of mn iii accelerated the edcs degradation process due to its strong oxidation capacity very recently sun established a permanganate bisulfite pm bs process to produce a mass of mn iii in a short time within 200 ms sun et al 2015 which was an efficient method to activate kmno4 and fully take advantage of the strong oxidation capacity of mn iii existing in the form of hydroxo mn3 mn iii sulfur complex or other types of intermediates gao et al 2017 hu et al 2017 although other works about the implication of mn iii on organic pollutant oxidation have rarely been reported sun s work has revealed the prospects of mn iii for application in organic contaminants oxidation however the fast mn iii production in the pm bs system made the detection of intermediate products at various time intervals difficult during the mn iii oxidation process therefore it is necessary to establish a mn iii slow release technology to research the intermediate products transformations in the mn iii oxidation process the manganese ii catalyzed autoxidation of the s iv played a crucial role in the formation of acid rain and the flue gas desulfurization fgd process due to the strong catalytic activity of the mn iii ii redox reaction connick and zhang 1996 since mnhso3 being oxidized to mnso3 by o2 is an energy unfavorable reaction berglund et al 1993 berglund indicated that sulfur radicals which initiated the mn iii ii redox reaction were provided by trace fe iii and fe ii in water reaction 1 5 table 1 connick and zhang indicated that the stability constant of mnhso3 was more than 500 fold weaker than 3 104 m 1 connick and zhang 1996 which meant that most of mn ii existed in the form of mn2 with the presence of so5 that was offered by the fe iii ii redox reaction mn2 was rapidly oxidized to mn iii which obtained a strong oxidation capacity for sulfite reaction 6 table 1 then the mn iii ii redox reaction occurred in the s iv autoxidation process reaction 7 table 1 additional mn iii and fe iii experiments were conducted to verify this mechanism fronaeus et al 1998 experimental results showed that the appearance of mn iii and fe iii greatly accelerated the autoxidation rate of s iv in the mn2 sulfite system as a complicated process that simultaneously produces mn iii and sulfur radicals the fe2 mn2 sulfite process has not been studied thoroughly for its effects on the organic contaminants oxidation capacity thus far since no additional oxidation reagents are needed except o2 the fe2 mn2 sulfite process might be regarded as a cost efficient oxidation method additionally the study of the atz degradation pathways in fe2 mn2 sulfite could improve the understanding of the contaminants transformations because the fe2 mn2 sulfite widely exists in the atmosphere and natural water atrazine is often used as the probe for both ho and so4 due to its similar rate constants towards ho and so4 k 1 k 2 3 0 109 m 1s 1 table s1 yang et al 2015 in this work rapid atrazine degradation illustrated the great oxidation capacity of fe2 mn2 sulfite competitive kinetic experiments alcohol inhibiting methods electron spin resonance esr experiments and the comparison of the oxidation selectivity between the fe2 mn2 sulfite and the pm bs processes were used to determine the major oxidation species in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process then inhibiting effects on the mn iii hydrolysis and the s iv autoxidation were considered to investigate the interaction between sulfite h2o and organic contaminants next the effects of the initial ph dissolved oxygen anions and humic acid ha were evaluated as the common environmental factors finally the atrazine degradation pathways in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process was proposed by the quantitative analysis of the intermediate products 2 materials and methods 2 1

identification of major oxidation species 3 1 1 performance of atz degradation in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process compared with the fe2 sulfite and mn2 sulfite process atz degradation was accelerated greatly in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process with lower dosages of fe2 and mn2 fig 1 a additionally the synergy of fe2 and mn2 significantly shortened the induction period with increasing fe2 dosages especially when fe2 0 10 μm the degradation of atz followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics further experiments showed that the degradation rates varied with different types of contaminants in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process fig 1b which demonstrated that significant oxidation selectivity existed in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process 3 1 2 competition dynamics experiments the organics such as atz nb phenol and 4 bp were selected as the model organic contaminants to investigate the major active species in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process smx has a higher rate constant than atz towards so4 k 5 k 2 table s1 mahdi ahmed et al 2012 but the k obs of smx degradation was much smaller than that of atz additionally competition dynamics experiments showed the value of k1 ln c 0 c a t z ln c 0 c s m x k o b s a t z k o b s s m x 4 25 fig s2a and the value of k2 ln c 0 c a t z ln c 0 c s m x k o b s a t z k o b s s m x 3 70 fig s2b therefore the average value of k 3 98 did not match the ratio between the 2 s order kinetic constants for the reaction of atz and smx with sulfate radical k so 4 atz k so 4 smx k 2 k 5 0 34 table s1 which suggested that so4 was not the dominant oxidation species 3 1 3 alcohol inhibiting effect additionally alcohol inhibition methods were adopted for identifying the major oxidation species fig 2 a tba is an effective quencher for ho k 6 6 108 m 1s 1 table s1 neta et al 1988 but not for so4 k 7 4 105 m 1s 1 table s1 guan et al 2011 thus tba was widely used to distinguish the contribution of ho and so4 the decrease of atz removal in the presence of 1000 fold tba was only 9 which proved that ho was not the major oxidation species the rate constants of so5 towards organic contaminants are usually 105 107 m 1s 1 k 12 105 107 m 1s 1 table s1 huie and neta 1985 neta and huie 1985 whereas the rate constants of so5 towards 1 hexanol is less than 103 m 1s 1 k 11 103 m 1s 1 table s1 huie et al 1989 the oxidation capacity of so5 should not be inhibited completely by 5 mm 1 hexanol k 12 a t z k 11 1 h e x a n o l 10 5 m 1 s 1 5 10 6 m 10 3 m 1 s 1 5 10 3 m 0 1 0 05 table s1 however further experimental results illustrated that atz removal decreased to less than 5 in the presence of 5 mm 1 hexanol fig 2a which proved that so5 was not the major oxidation species for organic contaminants 3 1 4 esr experiments to gain further evidence for our assumption esr experiments were employed the characteristic signal of dmpo so3 an 14 7 g ah 15 9 g mottley and mason 1988 was observed by esr in fig 3 a as the concentration of dmpo decreased to 25 mm the characteristic signal of dmpo so4 an 1 38 mt ah 1 02 mt ah 0 14 mt ah 0 08 mt and dmpo ho adducts an 1 49 mt ah 1 49 mt zou et al 2013 could not be confirmed with less dmpo more so3 was oxidized to so5 corresponding characteristic signals of dmpo so4 and dmpo ho adducts were detected in the cr vi sulfite process with 25 mm dmpo jiang et al 2015 the results in this work provided powerful evidence that neither so4 nor ho was the dominant oxidation species in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process 3 1 5 comparison of oxidation selectivity between the pm bs and the fe2 mn2 sulfite processes the pm bs system as an efficient method for producing mn iii sun et al 2015 was also introduced in this work compared with the pm bs process higher atz removal was obtained in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process moreover fig 2a and b revealed that both the pm bs and the fe2 mn2 sulfite processes shared coincident oxidation selectivity for contaminants 4 bp smx nb and atz and scavengers tba meoh and 1 hexanol a preliminary conclusion could be obtained that mn iii was the dominant oxidation species in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process 3 2 proposed mechanism 3 2 1 the initiation of the mn iii ii redox reaction both the production rate of fe iii species fig s3 and degradation rate of atz fig 1a grew with an increase of fe2 0 which suggested that fe iii played an important role in the initial period because feso3 offered the original so3 reaction 4 table 1 guo et al 2013 fig 3b illustrated that the so3 signal intensity of fe2 mn2 sulfite was the much higher than that of the mn2 sulfite process which suggested that the fe iii ii redox reaction could be regarded as an initiator for the production of mn iii 3 2 2 the hydrolysis of mn iii mn iii was regarded as a strong levis acid and even in acidic solution the hydrolysis is considerable biedermann and palombari 1978 in the absence of organic contaminants 4 63 μm mno2 was yielded from 50 μm fe2 mn2 catalysis of the s iv autoxidation process fig 4 a with the increase of atz mn iii hydrolysis was inhibited significantly fig 4a and only less than 1 5 μm mno2 was produced in the presence of 5 μm atz suggesting that more than 67 of hydrolysis was inhibited in addition the inhibitory effect with the same concentration of organic contaminants increased according to the order of nb smx 4 bp atz which was the same as the increasing order of the observed rate constants of model contaminants degradations table 2 suggesting that the degradation of organic pollutant was a competition reaction for mn iii hydrolysis considering h2o 55 56 m which was much more than the organic contaminants concentration the rate constant of mn iii hydrolysis k c should be significantly lower than the rate constant of organic contaminants oxidation k b which was in agreement with the prior study sisley and jordan 2006 despite that the detailed conditions ph and mn2 were different from this work additionally when fe2 0 mn2 0 10 μm the production of mno2 was less than the limitation of the abts method without any organic contaminant not given however the degradation ratio of 5 μm atz was up to 98 3 in 180 s which indicated that mno2 was not the direct oxidation species for organic contaminants 3 2 3 the autoxidation of s iv similar to mn iii hydrolysis the inhibition of s iv autoxidation process was aggravated according to the order of nb smx 4 bp atz fig 4b and the observed rate constants of s iv decay are provided in table 2 the inhibitory effect of 5 μm contaminant nb smx 4 bp and atz to the generation of mn iii could be neglected due to the high rate constant of reaction 6 k 5 108 m 1s 1 table 1 the decrease of the s iv autoxidation rate constant in the presence of 5 μm contaminant could be considered as a powerful evidence of the competitive relationship between the contaminants degradation process and the s iv autoxidation process therefore it was easy to understand that s iv autoxidation process played a special role in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process on the one hand the s iv autoxidation supplied so5 as the driving force for mn iii ii redox reaction on the other hand the s iv autoxidation was inhibited by the degradation of organic pollutant as a competition reaction 3 2 4 the proposed production mechanism and consumption routes for mn iii in summary a proposed mechanism of mn iii production and consumption could be described as shown in fig 5 the fe2 sulfite process supplied so5 which could drive the mn iii ii redox powerfully in the initial period of the oxidation process in the presence of organic pollutant mn iii obtained three consumption routes which included the s iv autoxidation process route a k a organic contaminant degradation process route b k b and mn iii hydrolysis route c k c both the mn iii hydrolysis and s iv autoxidation processes were inhibited in the presence of organic contaminants especially the hydrolysis taking into consideration the concentrations of h2o mnhso3 and the contaminants the corresponding rate constant rankings should be k a and k b k c three consumption routes were in competition as they consumed mn iii simultaneously 3 2 5 the absence of hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical there were two possible sources of hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical in the fe2 mn2 sulfite system 1 the hso3 was oxidized to so4 by so5 reaction 8 table 1 2 pms hso5 would be formed when so5 oxidized mn ii to mn iii reaction 6 table 1 in the presence of fe2 pms would decompose into hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical reaction 10 table the absence of hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical in the fe2 mn2 sulfite system was explained as follows 1 in the beginning of reaction period the hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical generated from the reaction 8 table 1 were captured by 1 mm sulfite completely k 1 a t z k 14 h s o 3 3 0 10 9 m 1 s 1 5 10 6 m 4 5 10 9 m 1 s 1 1 0 10 3 m 0 3 table s1 k 2 a t z k 10 h s o 3 3 0 10 9 m 1 s 1 5 10 6 m 3 2 10 8 m 1 s 1 1 0 10 3 m 4 7 table s1 after the beginning period the ph from 6 0 fast decreased to approximately 3 9 fig 6 a berglund reported that the rate constant of reaction 6 k 5 108 m 1s 1 table 1 was four orders of magnitude larger than that of reaction 8 k 7 1 2 104 m 1s 1 table 1 at ph values of 1 0 4 0 berglund et al 1993 thus the reason that the absence of so4 was explained by the fact that mn ii outcompeted sulfite for so5 reaction 6 vs reaction 8 2 similar to the above interpretation the hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical generated from the reaction 10 table 1 were captured by 1 mm sulfite completely in the beginning of reaction period additionally the concentration of fe ii decreased to less than 0 5 μm after the beginning period fig s3 which meant that k 9 fe ii 3 104 m 1s 1 0 5 10 6 m 0 015 s 1 reaction 10 table 1 ling et al 2017 meanwhile the value range of k 8 hso3 was 1 18 s 1 to 1 34 s 1 based on the stoichiometric ratio of reaction 9 in table 1 the calculation process was provided in text s3 therefore hso5 was consumed by sulfite completely because reaction 10 was suppressed by reaction 9 after the beginning period k 9 f e i i k 8 h s o 3 0 015 s 1 1 18 s 1 1 3 table 1 in conclusion the oxidation capacity of the fe2 mn2 sulfite system was independent of the hydroxyl radical and sulfate radical 3 3 influencing factors 3 3 1 effect of the initial ph the sulfite autoxidation process and contaminant oxidation in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process were independent of the initial ph from the initial ph values of 4 0 6 0 fig 6b which was in accordance with previous studies about the mn2 sulfite process berglund and elding 1995 grgić et al 1991 with the rapid s iv autoxidation the mass of h decreased the initial ph promptly reaction 7 in table 1 is a h production process after 20 s the ph from 6 0 decreased to approximately 3 9 and the final ph was 3 2 which meant that the real environmental ph was almost below 4 0 except for the initial period according to the stoichiometric ratio of reaction 7 table 1 0 8 mm s iv autoxidation would decrease ph to 3 1 considering the influence of the h consumption process reaction 6 table 1 the theoretical concentration of h matched the final ph 3 2 which was greatly lower than the final ph 4 0 of the pm bs process sun et al 2015 although initial ph influenced the initial oxidation rate of atz the rapid decrease of ph could reduce the differences of mn iii hydrolysis in different ph values therefore the k obs of organic contaminants degradation and the s iv autoxidation were almost the same with initial ph values from 4 0 to 6 0 fig 6a 3 3 2 effect of dissolved oxygen as the only additional oxidation reagent do might be an important factor influencing the degradation rate of organic contaminants since the concentration of do 9 mg l in the reaction solution was smaller than that of sulfite 1 mm and the rapid autoxidation of sulfite would deplete do in a short time continuous aeration was adopted to investigate the relationship between the do and the degradation rates of organic contaminants previous studies illustrated that the rate determining step in the so5 production process was the formation of so3 rather than so3 oxidation process reaction 5 table 1 which was the major o2 consumption process brandt et al 1994 the experimental results showed that there was no significance difference in k obs between do 5 mg l and 9 mg l fig 6b which further confirmed the results of the previous study 3 3 3 effect of anions fig 6c illustrated that anions suppressed atz degradation in the following order sulfate chloride bicarbonate phosphate which was the same as different inorganic anions influencing order in the fenton system lu et al 1997 siedlecka et al 2007 because of the important role of fe iii in the fenton and fe2 mn2 sulfite systems fig s4 showed that h2po4 obtained a stronger fe iii complexing capacity than cl and so4 2 from a ph of 3 0 to a ph of 6 0 in addition hpo4 2 h2po4 and hco3 h2co3 2 had a strong buffering capacity fig s5 demonstrated that after the beginning of the reaction the ph of the buffer solution decreased much more slowly than that of the unbuffered one which led to the strong hydrolysis of mn iii hence bicarbonate and phosphate obtained much greater inhibition than sulfate and chloride 3 3 4 effect of ha as a type of common dissolved organic matter ha did not obtain a certain complexing capacity for fe3 fe2 kang and choi 2008 wang et al 2012 but it did consume mn iii simultaneously when the concentration of ha was less than 2 mg c l 1 the removal of atz decreased slightly however when the concentration of ha was more than 2 mg c l 1 the removal of atz decreased sharply even so the removal of atz reached up to 58 3 as the concentration of ha increased to 10 mg c l 1 fig 6d it demonstrated that the low concentration of ha had difficulty competing with atz in contrast when the concentration of ha was more than 2 mg c l 1 the complexing effect and competition effect of ha were obvious in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process however ha could not be considered as a major inhibiting factor compared with h2po4 and hco3 3 3 5 degradation efficiency in real water two different real water samples were used to elucidate the performance of the fe2 mn2 sulfite process fig s6 the degradation of atz decreased from 98 31 to 45 73 for surface water and to 27 84 for underground water respectively in 180 s table s2 showed that the bicarbonate concentration of the groundwater sample was up to 5 07 mm which contained a strong buffering capacity hence the inhibition effect of underground water was significantly stronger than that of surface water 3 4 proposed atz degradation pathway as a process that could produce the mn iii continuously the fe2 mn2 sulfite process was suitable to quantitatively analyze the intermediate products in the mn iii oxidation process by sampling during the reaction time hence the degradation pathway of atz in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process was studied in this work table s3 demonstrated five main types of atz degradation products were detected in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process which was much less than the types of products more than ten types detected in aops ji et al 2015 khan et al 2014 kong et al 2016 moreover the dechlorination products were not generated during the degradation process which was in agreement with previous work about atz degradation pathway hu et al 2017 however atz dechlorination products were detected in both the ozone oxidation process and aops acero et al 2000 kong et al 2016 hence our preliminary conclusion that mn iii was the major oxidation species in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process was corroborated by the above analysis of degradation products the following three points in intermediate products analysis were noteworthy 1 the ratios of dealkylation products and acetylation products all increased during the reaction time when atz 0 5 μm fig s7d fig s8a and fig s8b 2 the ratio of dealkylation products decreased with the increase of atz 0 fig s7d whereas the concentration of the acetylation product cdit 4 acetamido 2 chloro 6 isopropylamino s triazine increased rapidly with the increasing of atz 0 fig s8a however the other acetylation product cdat 4 acetamido 6 amino 2 chloro s triazine increased slowly fig s8b 3 fig s7a and fig s7b demonstrated that the ratios of dea atz 0 and dia atz 0 climbed up to the maximum and then declined significantly when atz 0 5 μm in summary it would be reasonable to obtain the following hypothesis there were two simultaneous atz degradation routes in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process scheme 1 in hu s paper a dealkylation mechanism was offered as route i with the electron abundant amino groups which has a high tendency for electron transfer reactions welhouse and bleam 1993 and atz could be degraded via an intramolecular β elimination mechanism after binding with mn iii hu et al 2017 furthermore dea and dia would be degraded to product v deia the nonredox reaction in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process was a also major degradation pathway the ratio of dealkylation products was more than 50 when atz 0 5 μm in this work the major difference was when atz 0 5 μm and the ratio of dealkylation products decreased sharply to 35 4 whereas the concentration of cdit grew significantly this indicated that the major route of atz degradation changed to the acetylation process route ii scheme 1 which suggested that single electron transfer set occurred after the formation of atz mn iii complex due to the activity of α c that belongs to the n ethyl ji et al 2015 r1 radical was generated from the set process oxygen as an electrophilic reagent was capable of reacting with r1 to generate intermediate r2 then two molecules of r2 lost one molecule hydrogen peroxide to form product i cdit cdit was difficult to oxidize due to the existence of acetyl acero et al 2000 thus the concentration of the further oxidation product iv cdat grew slowly additionally since the hydrolysis of acetyl compounds is slow in weakly acidic aqueous solution the conversions of product i to ii and product iv to v could in fact be neglected in other words the relationships of the five products could be described as shown in scheme s1 and dealkylation products containing dea dia and deia came mainly from route i acetylation product cdit basically came from route ii and cdat was partially generated from route ii the reason that route ii was not proposed in previous studies might be ascribed to the remarkable difference in the mn iii concentration between the pm bs and fe2 mn2 sulfite process it was reported that the concentration of mn iii reached up to 10 5 m within 200 ms and the rate constants of organic contaminants towards mn iii were determined to be 105 106 m 1s 1 sun et al 2016 the k obs of atz degradation was 2 26 10 2 s 1 in this work which meant that the concentration of mn iii was approximately 10 8 10 7 m in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process the concentration of mn iii produced in fe2 mn2 sulfite process was much less than that of the pm bs process compared with β elimination it is difficult for set to occur however the seriously insufficient concentration forced mn iii to demonstrate its oxidation capacity by capturing one electron from the α c of n ethyl then the subsequent reactions occurred 4 conclusion in this work we shed light on the involvement of mn iii in the fe2 mn2 sulfite process which could be utilized for the oxidation of organic contaminants due to the ubiquity of sulfite although bicarbonate and phosphate significantly decreased the atz removal the fe2 mn2 sulfite process still deserves further study as a slow release method of mn iii the following conclusions can be summarized 1 significant atz degradation was observed in the fe2 mn2 sulfite system relative dynamic experiments suggested that sulfur radicals and hydroxyl radical were not the major reactive oxidation species mn iii was confirmed to be the major reactive species by the oxidation selectivity comparison between the pm bs and fe2 mn2 sulfite systems 2 the inhibition of mn iii hydrolysis and the decrease of the s iv autoxidation rate constant in the presence of organic contaminants illustrated that mn iii obtained three consumption routes in the fe2 mn2 sulfite system which included the s iv autoxidation process route a organic contaminant degradation process route b and the mn iii hydrolysis route c 3 the degradation efficiency of the fe2 mn2 sulfite system was influenced by the concentrations of ha and the anions especially hpo4 2 h2po4 and hco3 h2co3 2 obviously suppressed the atz transformation in the fe2 mn2 sulfite system 4 the proposed atz acetylation process proved the existence of a single electron transfer process which suggested that the single electron transfer process and β elimination process coexisted in the atz degradation process during

19733,wastewater treatment plants wwtps are acting as routes of microplastics mps to the environment hence the urgent need to examine mps in wastewaters and different types of sludge through sampling campaigns covering extended periods of time in this study the efficiency of a municipal wwtp to remove mps from wastewater was studied by collecting wastewater and sludge samples once in every two weeks during a 3 month sampling campaign the wwtp was operated based on the conventional activated sludge cas process and a pilot scale membrane bioreactor mbr the microplastic particles and fibers from both water and sludge samples were identified by using an optical microscope fourier transform infrared ftir microscope and raman microscope overall the retention capacity of microplastics in the studied wwtp was found to be 98 3 most of the mp fraction was removed before the activated sludge process the efficiency of an advanced membrane bioreactor mbr technology was also examined the main related finding is that mbr permeate contained 0 4 mp l in comparison with the final effluent of the cas process 1 0 mp l according to this study both microplastic fibers and particles are discharged

and fate of microplastics mps in aquatic environment have been accelerating worldwide especially during the last decade andrady 2011 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 considering the increase in plastic production plasticseurope 2016 and consequently the risk of small plastic particles contaminating our environment microplastics may be discharged to the environment from plastic industries e g via leakages and transportation accidents other sources include the tear and wear of plastic items the use of personal care products fendall and sewell 2009 and washing of synthetic textiles browne et al 2011 one important reason for the urgent need to promote research studies on microplastics is their partly unknown potential to cause ecotoxicological issues in the environment andrady 2011 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 in this context microplastics may act as vectors for harmful additives and contaminants teuten et al 2009 and they have the potential to be transferred within the planktonic food web setälä et al 2014 which might affect the environmental fate of numerous toxic substances research efforts on the behavior and impact of microplastics in aquatic environment seem to be versatile which makes comparative studies challenging hidalgo ruz et al 2012 underwood et al 2017 for instance the classification of microplastics by size differs between studies but usually the upper size limit is set to 5 mm arthur et al 2009 the lower size limit of studied microplastics often follows the mesh size of neuston net starting from 300 μm arthur et al 2009 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 as the increasing amount of microplastics found in the environment have been noticed to belong to even smaller size range klein et al 2015 ziajahromi et al 2017 the lower size limit was decreased below 50 μm carr et al 2016 talvitie et al 2015 2017a and even to the range of nanoplastics da costa et al 2016 microplastics have also been isolated from environmental samples by using variable approaches hidalgo ruz et al 2012 and then identified either visually or using more reliable identification analyses andrady 2011 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 some results are based on a visual identification only mason et al 2016 michielssen et al 2016 talvitie et al 2015 some have identified all particles and fibers with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir or raman spectroscopy browne et al 2011 murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2017a ziajahromi et al 2017 and others have relied on a combined methodology of identification by defining possible microplastics visually and then analyzing only part of them carr et al 2016 magnusson and norén 2014 mintenig et al 2017 even though the abundance of microplastics in the marine environment has been studied quite extensively for the last few decades hidalgo ruz et al 2012 the special case of wastewater treatment plants wwtp as a route of microplastics have started to gain more attention only during recent years carr et al 2016 dris et al 2015 magnusson and norén 2014 mahon et al 2017 mason et al 2016 michielssen et al 2016 mintenig et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2015 2017b still only few research investigations have focused on the removal efficiency of microplastics in wwtps and studied microplastics in other wwtp matrices than final effluent carr et al 2016 mintenig et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2017a first studies have shown that microplastics are effectively removed from wastewater and most of the particles end up in the sludge magnusson and norén 2014 michielssen et al 2016 talvitie et al 2015 2017a even though the removal efficiency of microplastics in wwtps is found to be around 99 carr et al 2016 magnusson and norén 2014 murphy et al 2016 microplastics are continuously being discharged from wwtps to recipient waters on the other hand if most of the microplastics are transferred to wwtp sludge which can be further used in green construction and as a fertilizer in fields sludge might act as a significant route of microplastics to the environment talvitie et al 2017a zubris and richards 2005 furthermore most of the researchers have based their results on wastewater or sludge samples collected only for a short period of time murphy et al 2016 collected water and sludge samples from different stages of a large secondary wwtp within couple of days mintenig et al 2017 studied effluents and sludge from several wwtps in germany and each sample was collected during one day carr et al 2016 studied wastewater and sludge samples from different stages of several wwtps in the united states and samples were collected for maximum 12 days during less than one and a half months talvitie et al 2017a collected sludge and water samples for microlitter studies either once or thrice during one week from different stages of wwtp in finland in this regard our research group and many scientists in the field are emphasizing upon the necessity to analyze microplastic pollution from wwtps for a longer time period to reveal the temporal variation in microplastic concentrations magnusson and norén 2014 murphy et al 2016 ziajahromi et al 2017 in this context the aim of this study was to investigate the efficiency of a wwtp based on conventional activated sludge cas process to remove microplastics from wastewater the abundance of microplastic particles and fibers was monitored in 1 the pretreated influent after primary screening throughout the different stages of the conventional treatment i e 2 effluents from primary clarification and 3 activated sludge process as well as in 4 the digested sludge 5 final effluent and 6 the recipient water body close to the outlet of treated wastewater furthermore the efficiency of a pilot scale membrane bioreactor mbr incorporated with the wwtp was examined by sampling permeate and sludge with the purpose of comparing the removal efficiencies of all the treatment processes operating in the plant overall this study was carried out for 3 months with sampling campaigns every two weeks to our knowledge this is the first study to monitor the occurrence of microplastic particles and fibers in wwtps over several months and thus to provide reliable assessment about the efficiency of wwtp to remove microplastics 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of wwtp and mbr pilot plant in this study wastewater and sludge samples were collected from the municipal wwtp kenkäveronniemi wwtp located near the city center of mikkeli finland the wwtp treats approximately 10 000 m3 of municipal wastewater daily and its treatment processes include screening with step screen and 6 mm sieve grit separation primary clarification biological treatment with activated sludge final sedimentation and disinfection during the sampling campaign sludge volume index svi of the activated sludge was approximately 62 ml g total suspended solids ss for effluent was approximately 10 3 mg l and ss removal efficiency 98 6 according to the wwtp s monitoring records effluent waters from wwtp are discharged into the nearby launialanselkä basin lake saimaa via a 110 meter effluent pipe a pilot scale membrane bioreactor artas ltd turkey operating in mikkeli wwtp since 2014 is able to treat around 3 m3 of wastewater per day the mbr pilot plant consists of an anaerobic tank an aerobic tank and a membrane filtration tank with a submerged mbr unit the pore size of the submerged flat sheet membrane units is 0 4 μm kubota corporation japan detailed information about the setup operating conditions and water treatment efficiency of mbr pilot is available in gurung et al 2016 2017 2 2 sample collection samples were collected from kenkäveronniemi wwtp every two weeks between 10th of october 2016 and 2nd of january 2017 samples were collected on mondays between 8 and 12 a m preliminary sampling tests were carried out before the actual sampling campaign in order to optimize the sampling methods and mitigate potential sample contamination during the in site operations samples transfer and laboratory analyses water samples with a volume of 4 0 30 0 l were collected from influent water after 6 mm screen in the beginning of the grit separation basin after the primary clarification and after the disinfection fig s1 permeate from mbr pilot plant and lake water from the nearby shore about 100 m from the effluent outlet were also studied it has to be noted that in the present investigation focusing the efficiency of the wwtp to remove mps the nearby lake water was sampled only to estimate the amount of mps in close proximity to the discharge location of treated wastewater hence the reported concentrations are neither representing the average mps concentration in the recipient lake nor being correlated with the one discharged from the wwtp samples were collected with a 10 l stainless steel bucket attached to a metal wire and poured to a cascade of two test sieves with mesh sizes of 0 25 and 5 0 mm materials retained on the 0 25 mm sieve were rinsed with distilled water to previously weighed glass beakers with the help of a metal funnel equipment was rinsed three times with distilled water to ensure that all particles were transferred properly distilled water was stored in a 10 l polyethylene container and in polyethylene squirt bottles all samples were collected with same set of equipment and sampling was started from points with presumably smallest mp concentrations to decrease the possibility of cross contamination sludge samples 150 200 ml were collected with a 10 l stainless steel bucket or a 0 25 l stainless steel cup from activated sludge after the aeration basin mbr sludge and digested sludge samples were immediately poured to glass flasks with the help of a metal funnel all vessels were sealed with aluminum foil and rubber bands transferred to the laboratory and stored at 4 c and dark until further treatments to assess possible contamination field blank samples were treated exactly in the same manner as the other samples by using distilled water instead of wastewater and sludge furthermore for water blank samples the cascade of sieves were rinsed with distilled water and the 0 25 mm test sieve was rinsed to previously weighed glass beakers for sludge blank samples a small amount of distilled water was poured to glass flasks with the help of a metal funnel field blank samples were subjected to the before mentioned treatments 2 3 sample pretreatment 2 3 1 water and wastewater water samples were treated according to the method proposed by masura et al 2015 with some adjustments no density separation was performed in order to avoid the loss of any high density microplastics shim et al 2016 such as polyester with density of 1 24 2 3 g cm3 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 furthermore as cellulose fibers density 1 5 g cm3 are one of the most abundant non plastic groups in wwtp samples density separation would not have been suitable for separating them from microplastics due to the overlapping densities of these polymers first the sieved samples were placed in 75 c drying oven for at least 40 h until totally dry then the dried samples 0 15 0 06 g dw were weighed to determine the required amount of chemicals for the subsequent wet peroxide oxidation wpo the oxidation process was carried out by adding 20 ml of aqueous 0 05 m fe ii solution and 20 ml of 30 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to the dried samples mixture was left to settle down for 5 min in room temperature and then the beaker was covered with a watch glass the mixture was agitated and heated up to 75 c using hotplate with magnetic stirrer depending on the organic matter content in water the oxidative reaction frequently overflowed the beaker in this case small amount of distilled water was added to cool down the reaction for the influent samples 40 ml of h2o2 were initially added then another 20 ml of h2o2 were supplemented after 20 min in order to promote the degradation of the organic matter the wpo reaction was conducted for additional 30 min after additions of h2o2 or distilled water samples were let to cool down and vacuum filtrated through gridded membrane filters sartorius cellulose nitrate filter porosity 0 8 μm with glass fiber filters vwr grade 696 porosity 1 5 μm at the bottom for mechanical support filters were placed in petri dishes and let dry for at least 24 h at room temperature while being loosely covered with aluminum foil to avoid potential contamination suitability of wpo treatment for mps was tested with commercial pet and ps beads before sampling campaign and no visible deformations were noticed in treated microplastics due to the large amount of cellulose fibers probably originating mainly from decomposed toilet papers caught in influent samples samples of 0 25 g dw corresponding to 0 8 3 0 l were treated with wpo masura et al 2015 along with cellulase enzymes using the method proposed by champagne and li 2009 these samples were transferred with a metallic spatula into glass beakers treated with wpo sieved using a 38 μm mesh size sieve and rinsed to glass flasks with a small amount of distilled water samples were sealed with foil and stored in the absence of light at 4 c enzymatic degradation was proceeded by adding 250 mg of cellulase aspergillus niger 0 8 activity units per mg to 250 mg dw of influent sample corresponding to an enzyme loading of 800 activity units g substrate next 12 5 ml of sodium citrate buffer ph 4 8 was added to the samples which were then placed in a temperature controlled shaker at 40 c with 160 rpm for 24 h with varying weights of the influent samples the amount of enzymes and buffer solution were adjusted to correspond the before mentioned ratios 2 3 2 sludge sludge samples were treated with the method described by murphy et al 2016 sludge samples were mixed thoroughly with glass stirring rod after which subsamples 0 1 g dw were poured to glass petri dishes and dried at 45 c for 18 h with pierced foil cover the dry weights of samples were estimated on a basis of water contents in each sludge type the target wet weights of subsamples for activated sludge digested sludge and mbr sludge were 20 g 3 g and 10 g respectively 2 4 examination and identification of microplastics 2 4 1 optical microscopy all samples were visually examined under digital optical microscope zeiss stereo discovery v8 with axiocam 503 color with maximum magnification of 50 all possible microplastics and all particles and fibers without a clear organic origin seeds cellulose fibers from toilet paper were collected with tweezers placed on a paper in another petri dish and analyzed via successive magnifications all collected particles and fibers still including both plastic and non plastic material were subjected to a second round of visual identification in which all recovered particles and fibers were photographed and measured for the largest dimension using the built in zen 2 3 software particles and fibers approx 5200 altogether were classified visually in 54 groups according to the helicity of the fibers and shapes of cross section e g round oval or flat and end of fibers such as clear cut tapered or frayed as well as hardness and luster of fragments norén 2007 representative samples of each group were collected on a microscope slide and further examined using an optical microscope zeiss axioscope a1 with a magnification up to 1000 and later with ftir and or raman a small amount of distilled water was added to influent samples to avoid the static electricity of dry cellulose fibers during examination for the dried sludge samples small amount of distilled water was added to break up the sludge material and then each sample was cautiously examined using tweezers three times altogether murphy et al 2016 as a slight improvement to this method the first two examinations were conducted with white background and the third examination with black background i e under the glass dish such approach helped recovering microplastics with different colors more easily 2 4 2 ftir microscopy and raman spectroscopy representative samples of most of the above mentioned groups see section 2 4 1 were analyzed with fourier transform infrared ftir microscopy and or micro raman spectroscopy in order to confirm their plastic or non plastic nature the same approach was also discussed by shim et al 2017 to generate more reliable results than a single analytical method for minimizing the chance for false negative microplastics lenz et al 2015 representatives of all classified particles and fibers e g cellulose were confirmed with spectroscopic methods only particles which were visually identified to clearly consist of organic or other non plastic compounds such as alga sand and glass were excluded from the ftir and raman analyses thus on average 2 to 3 particles or fibers were examined with ftir microscope and micro raman for each group corresponding to 1 3 and 1 4 of all collected particles and fibers representative samples of most abundant groups i e supposed plastic and other materials were first analyzed with ftir microscope spotlight 200i ft ir microscope system equipped with spectrum two perkin elmer in the reflectance mode 24 scans were taken to produce the spectra with wavelengths between 600 and 4000 cm 1 and with the spectral resolution of 4 cm 1 spectra were compared to the spectra libraries supplied by perkinelmer for the micro raman spectroscopy horiba jobin yvon labram hr the analyses were carried out using the green laser 514 53 nm and labspec 5 software with spectra covering a wavelength range between 200 and 3000 cm 1 reference libraries of ftir and raman spectra for different polymers and natural fibers were collected from various sources crawford and quinn 2017 frère et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 2 5 contamination control in the present work a serious consideration was given to the risk of contamination hidalgo ruz et al 2012 murphy et al 2016 thus nitrile gloves and 100 cotton clothes were worn as topmost clothes when collecting or treating the samples only glass and metal dishes were used plastic caps were replaced with aluminum foil and all vessels were covered whenever possible filters and petri dishes were always examined under the optical microscope before the use in order to remove all visible particles and fibers laboratory benches were wiped with cellulose tissue and distilled water thrice before samples were treated one field blank sample for both water and sludge were collected during each sampling to estimate the amount of contamination during sampling and sample preparation all used pe containers and bottles were examined not to act as a source of contamination by filtering stored distilled water once during the sampling campaign with three replicates for each container 3 results and discussion 3 1 contamination despite the efforts to decrease contamination on average 4 4 1 4 and 0 1 0 1 microplastics were counted from field blank samples for water and sludge respectively as blank samples were not conducted with a known volume of distilled water contamination is presented as number of mps per sample highest level of contamination was measured for the first sampling event some evidence of cross contamination such as shells of planktonic organisms were found from field blank samples collected after lake water sampling however the origin of the microplastics contamination could not be assessed without separate control samples for each preparation step challenges related to contamination and sample pretreatment are discussed more detailed in supporting information si 3 2 determination of polymer types different polymers were detected after the recovery of microplastic fibers mpfs and particles mpps from wastewater sludge and lake water samples as illustrated in fig 1 and table 1 the list includes polyester pes polyethylene pe polyamide pa and polypropylene pp these polymers were frequently identified and confirmed with ftir microscope and micro raman spectroscopy microscopic images are shown in fig 2 the proportion of different polymers varied only little between different sampling dates when microplastics from all sampling points were considered during the whole sampling campaign polyester fibers accounted for 96 3 of the mpfs being equivalent to 79 1 of the total amount of mps collected from all of the samples most of the rest mpfs were made of polyamide 3 1 of all mpfs microplastic fibers are usually described to be equally thick with three dimensional bending norén 2007 which differs them from cellulose based fibers with ribbon like appearance dyachenko et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 in this study also polyester fibers with flat cotton like appearance were found fig 2d for the mpps polyethylene was the most abundant polymer that accounted for 63 9 of mpps i e 11 4 of the total mps rest of the collected mpps 36 1 were identified to consist of polyethylene polyester and polypropylene the results of this study are in accordance with previous studies conducted in wwtps ziajahromi et al 2017 reported pet fibers and pe particles as most abundant microplastics in effluents of different wwtps polyester was detected most frequently also in the final effluents of a scottish 28 murphy et al 2016 and an australian wwtp 67 browne et al 2011 dull and unevenly shaped polyethylene fragments were present in treated wastewater effluent similarly with the observations of talvitie et al 2017a the same team indicated that these fragments were most probably originated from cleansing scrubs interestingly in the current study this kind of pe fragments were mostly collected from final effluent and even lake samples but less frequently from influent or sludge samples the reason for not finding pe fragments from influent flow could be related to the diurnal variation in the wastewater flow together with the hydraulic retention time in wwtp processes such observation suggests that at least part of these cosmetics originated fragments are passing through the treatment processes in the studied wwtp murphy et al 2016 did not found any pe microbeads in the effluent of secondary wwtp in scotland rather it was noticed that pe beads were efficiently removed together with grease from the surface of the wastewater based on these few studies the fate of pe fragments tend to vary with the various removal processes in wwtps along with microplastics and despite the rigorous oxidation treatment substantial amounts of organic particles and fibers were abundant in both sludge and wpo treated wastewater samples thus among this group of non plastic compounds many colorful cotton fibers with flat cross section and either twisted or straight appearance were extracted from most of the samples also white or nearly transparent flat cellulose fibers mainly originating from toilet papers together with sand grains and glass fragments were also present in many of the samples altogether from the initial 42 groups that were analyzed with either ftir or raman spectroscopy 22 were excluded as they contained organic compounds e g cotton cellulose chitin for further studies staining could be utilized in separation between plastics and other materials ziajahromi et al 2017 it is also worth noting that the spectra from ftir and raman analyses of most of the analyzed samples did not provide full match with the references which could be caused by attached organic material different additives used in plastics lenz et al 2015 or the thermochemical treatments applied during the sample preparations if some particle or fiber was not identifiable with available analysis other representative from the same group was analyzed instead furthermore the spectra libraries usually consist of spectra for pure substances thus spectra obtained from environmental samples are expected to have low congruity compared to reference spectra murphy et al 2016 3 3 efficiency of wwtp to remove mps in the current study mps concentrations varied between 0 1 and 124 7 mp l in water samples and between 8 2 and 301 4 mps g dw in sludge samples highest average concentrations of microplastics were counted for influent samples and digested sludge 57 6 12 4 mp l and 170 9 28 7 mps g dw respectively table 2 reported mps concentrations in wwtp effluents have varied between 0 and 91 mp l table 3 browne et al 2011 carr et al 2016 dyachenko et al 2017 leslie et al 2017 magnusson and norén 2014 mason et al 2016 michielssen et al 2016 mintenig et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2015 2017b ziajahromi et al 2017 in this study final effluents had mps concentration of 1 0 0 4 mp l on average which is consistent with other previous reports browne et al 2011 ziajahromi et al 2017 the large variation in previous results is mainly caused by different types of wastewaters and processes used in studied wwtps mahon et al 2017 together with different size limitations and sampling preparation and identification methods underwood et al 2017 even though ziajahromi et al 2017 reported the decreasing concentrations of microplastics in wwtp effluents as the number of treatment steps is increased most studies did not show similar trends for example one of the highest reported mpps concentration around 8 6 mpp l was reported by talvitie et al 2015 for effluent from the tertiary treatment murphy et al 2016 reported microplastic concentrations of approximately 2 mp in 2 5 g of centrifuged sludge talvitie et al 2017a reported 186 7 26 0 microlitter g of dried sludge after centrifugation they also found out that 20 of microlitter are returned to the wastewater flow via reject water in the current study approximately 170 9 28 7 and 27 3 4 7 mp g dw were counted for digested and mbr sludge respectively noting that our samples were collected before centrifugation and in case of the mbr sludge before any digestion according to the results of the present study the kenkäveronniemi wwtp had a mps removal efficiency of 98 3 table 2 for microplastic particles and fibers the removal efficiencies were 89 8 and 99 1 respectively removal efficiencies of total microplastics were in accordance with recent studies conducted in lysekil sweden 99 9 magnusson and norén 2014 the county of los angeles usa 99 9 carr et al 2016 and glasgow uk 98 4 murphy et al 2016 only one comparative research study of 7 wwtps conducted in netherlands reported removal efficiencies as low as 72 leslie et al 2017 in most related investigations the majority of microplastics was removed in the beginning of the wastewater treatment process during mechanical and chemical pretreatments solids skimming and sludge settling processes carr et al 2016 talvitie et al 2017a therefore effluent filters were found to have only minimal effect on the removal of mps from wastewaters carr et al 2016 as far as the present study is concerned 99 0 of mps were removed already before the aeration process which is consistent with other studies involving cas process in addition it was found that mbr technology was more efficient 99 4 in removing mps from wastewaters compared to the cas process on average mbr permeate contained lower concentrations of microplastics 0 4 0 1 mp l than the final effluent from the main cas process 1 0 0 4 mp l the average inflow of wastewater during sampling days was 10 766 501 m3 and 10 540 425 m3 of final effluent and 87 3 5 5 m3 of digested sludge were released consequently in the light of mps concentrations approximately 1 0 107 and 4 6 108 microplastics were discharged daily with the final effluent and digested sludge from the kenkäveronniemi wwtp respectively when comparing the amount of discharged mps to the amount of mps channeled to the plant with the influent flow 6 2 108 mps d a fraction of the microplastic flux 1 5 108 mps d seems to be trapped within the wwtp this could be related to their possible entrapment with solid materials from grit separation and grease from primary clarification murphy et al 2016 although the wastewater treatment process is basically a linear concept nonetheless some recycled flows do exist within wwtps these flows include reject water from the sludge dewatering water from rinsing of removed solids and grease floating materials from the primary sedimentation and waste activated sludge was all of these flows are concentrated in the beginning of the process and thus collected influent samples consist of both incoming screened wastewater and returning flows the main remark in this regard is that the results of this study do not represent the differences between raw influent and treated effluent but differences of the mps concentrations between different stages of the wwtp process and ultimately the mps concentrations discharged with the final effluent as for the lake water samples collected from nearby the effluent outlet the analysis revealed microplastics concentrations of 0 3 0 1 mp l previously only 0 0008 0 003 mp l were counted from the surface waters of two italian lakes when using mesh size of 300 μm fischer et al 2016 in comparison with the mps concentrations reported for other water bodies nearby the discharge of wwtp effluents the concentrations of the present study were considerably higher for example mps concentrations of 0 001 0 002 mp l were reported for seawater collected 20 200 meters from the wwtp effluent outlet in sweden using mesh size of 300 μm magnusson and norén 2014 in current study the lake water was sampled only to estimate the amount of mps in close proximity to the discharge location of treated wastewater hence the reported concentrations are neither representing the average mps concentration in the recipient lake nor being correlated with the one discharged from the wwtp other possible sources of mps in lake water include e g stormwater littering and atmospheric fallout dris et al 2015 which are not further discussed here overall microplastics concentrations were slightly higher in final effluent than in the effluent from primary clarifier especially for microplastic particles this might be caused by the more turbulent flow of the effluent from primary clarifier compared to the more stable flow at the sampling point of the final effluent besides since most of the particles were polyethylene and they are normally floating in water density 0 92 0 97 g cm3 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 particles might have concentrated to the upper layer of the final effluent flow where samples were collected 3 4 occurrence and distribution of mps 3 4 1 distribution by type fig 3 clearly shows that mpfs were most abundant types of microplastics in the wastewater and sludge of the studied wwtp for instance the highest occurrence of mpfs in relation to mpps was in the sludge fractions with highest occurrence of 94 in the activated sludge and then in the initial effluent 92 even at the lowest the fibers were accounted for 53 and 50 of all counted mps in final effluent and lake water respectively the same tendency i e predominance of mpfs over mpps was also reported in the literature for both wastewater effluents leslie et al 2017 mason et al 2016 michielssen et al 2016 talvitie et al 2015 ziajahromi et al 2017 and the environment browne et al 2011 since there are hardly any plastic industry in the studied area and no stormwater runoffs are conducted to the wwtp most of the microplastics are originated from households and different municipal services in this context the high amounts of plastic fibers indicates the high impact of laundry and textile handling activities on the microplastic emissions another less studied route of mps to the wwtp could be infiltration of sewer system 3 4 2 size distribution as shown in fig 4 64 of all recovered microplastics from the samples were smaller than 1 mm half of which were also smaller than 0 5 mm talvitie et al 2017a reported that depending on the studied stage of the wwtp process only 20 of the collected microlitter were larger than 300 μm the difference is due to the different sampling methods since they collected mps with smaller mesh size 20 μm than was used in this study 250 μm consequently if smaller sized mps would have been caught with finer mesh sizes similarly in the current study the amount of recovered mps would have been higher in present study the main size of mps in final effluent is between 0 5 and 1 mm although mbr process is more efficient than cas to remove microplastics the proportion of the smallest sized mps 0 25 mm is at its highest value in mbr permeate fig 4 equally about one fourth of the mps collected from lake samples were smaller than 0 25 mm which highlights the importance of including smaller sized mp fractions to future studies large mps in mbr permeate might have caused by contamination in the open tank from where permeate was collected because the dimensions and shapes of fibers and some particles are not symmetrical a fraction of mps might pass through the mesh of the sieves even though one of their dimensions would be longer than the mesh size as a result the number of mps mostly fibers counted from the samples reflects only the retained fraction of the microplastics magnusson 2014 on the other hand samples might also have fibers and particles with smaller dimensions than the mesh size if they are entangled together or attached to larger particles while sieving castro et al 2016 overall the risk of losing small sized mps is higher if 250 μm mesh size is used and the proportion of small microplastics would be much larger if smaller mesh size would have been used klein et al 2015 ziajahromi et al 2017 3 4 3 spatiotemporal variations of mps concentrations microplastics concentrations varied substantially during the sampling campaign in both water and sludge samples fig 5 with similar patterns when concentrations of mpfs and mpps were observed separately therefore the mps concentrations in wwtps reported for single sampling events do not give reliable set of data based on which the microplastics pollution issue could be properly assessed and dealt with in order to collect more representative samples and including diurnal variation in the approximation of microplastic concentrations in wwtp automatic composite sampling could be used talvitie et al 2017a up until now most research studies were conducted within a timeframe of days nonetheless few other studies pointed out this high variation of mps concentrations in wastewaters within weeks and seasons mintenig et al 2017 talvitie et al 2017a the sampling campaign of this investigations was conducted between the second week of october and the first week of january in order to assess the occurrence of mps in wastewaters during the autumn and winter seasons in nordic environment based on the presented results of this study the authors emphasize the need to extend the monitoring campaign to cover the spring and summer seasons in order to have an estimate of the annual variation of mps in wastewater and the respective ability of wwtps to effectively deal with such seasonal variation in addition to the seasonal variation there might be diurnal variation in the mp concentrations in the influent this was not taken into account in the sampling and calculations of the removal efficiency of mps in the studied wwtp which might have added some uncertainty in the reported results thus for long term sampling campaigns considering the hydraulic retention time in different process parts should be taken into account for more reliable assessments 4 conclusions the results of the 3 month sampling campaign show that 98 3 of incoming microplastics were removed during the treatment process of the studied wwtp according to the mps occurrence data microplastic fibers 82 are posing a more severe problem than microplastic particles 18 hence the need to put more focus on the occurrence and fate of mpfs in wastewaters and receiving water bodies furthermore this study contributed to the research effort assessing the occurrence and temporal variations of mps within wwtps and the efficiency of conventional activated sludge process and advanced mbr technology to remove microplastics in this regard it was found that mbr process had a slightly better removal efficiency of microplastics 99 4 compared to the overall cas based process 98 3 of all analyzed polymers polyester mostly pet was revealed to be most abundant in collected samples by constituting 79 of the entire mp load and being present in all studied stages of the wwtp the high variation in the determined mps concentrations highlights the importance of conducting several sampling events when studying microplastics in media of variable contents in the current study grab sampling covering separated time frames sampling locations and contamination might have caused uncertainties to the reported results overall in this field of microplastic research standardized protocols have to be developed because of the high amount of uncertainties during sampling sample treatment and characterization and in order to provide reliable methods and generate comparable set of data between researchers another important issue is the urgent need for more reliable ways of identifying plastic particles and fibers from non plastics especially with increasing quantities of identified particles and fibers the applicability of staining and imaging database of confirmed microplastics have already been studied but more research should be conducted to optimize them and find out the most suitable and effective method for microplastics identification funding this work was supported by maa ja vesitekniikan tuki ry mvtt conflicts of interest none acknowledgments maa ja vesitekniikan

19733,wastewater treatment plants wwtps are acting as routes of microplastics mps to the environment hence the urgent need to examine mps in wastewaters and different types of sludge through sampling campaigns covering extended periods of time in this study the efficiency of a municipal wwtp to remove mps from wastewater was studied by collecting wastewater and sludge samples once in every two weeks during a 3 month sampling campaign the wwtp was operated based on the conventional activated sludge cas process and a pilot scale membrane bioreactor mbr the microplastic particles and fibers from both water and sludge samples were identified by using an optical microscope fourier transform infrared ftir microscope and raman microscope overall the retention capacity of microplastics in the studied wwtp was found to be 98 3 most of the mp fraction was removed before the activated sludge process the efficiency of an advanced membrane bioreactor mbr technology was also examined the main related finding is that mbr permeate contained 0 4 mp l in comparison with the final effluent of the cas process 1 0 mp l according to this study both microplastic fibers and particles are discharged

and fate of microplastics mps in aquatic environment have been accelerating worldwide especially during the last decade andrady 2011 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 considering the increase in plastic production plasticseurope 2016 and consequently the risk of small plastic particles contaminating our environment microplastics may be discharged to the environment from plastic industries e g via leakages and transportation accidents other sources include the tear and wear of plastic items the use of personal care products fendall and sewell 2009 and washing of synthetic textiles browne et al 2011 one important reason for the urgent need to promote research studies on microplastics is their partly unknown potential to cause ecotoxicological issues in the environment andrady 2011 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 in this context microplastics may act as vectors for harmful additives and contaminants teuten et al 2009 and they have the potential to be transferred within the planktonic food web setälä et al 2014 which might affect the environmental fate of numerous toxic substances research efforts on the behavior and impact of microplastics in aquatic environment seem to be versatile which makes comparative studies challenging hidalgo ruz et al 2012 underwood et al 2017 for instance the classification of microplastics by size differs between studies but usually the upper size limit is set to 5 mm arthur et al 2009 the lower size limit of studied microplastics often follows the mesh size of neuston net starting from 300 μm arthur et al 2009 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 as the increasing amount of microplastics found in the environment have been noticed to belong to even smaller size range klein et al 2015 ziajahromi et al 2017 the lower size limit was decreased below 50 μm carr et al 2016 talvitie et al 2015 2017a and even to the range of nanoplastics da costa et al 2016 microplastics have also been isolated from environmental samples by using variable approaches hidalgo ruz et al 2012 and then identified either visually or using more reliable identification analyses andrady 2011 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 some results are based on a visual identification only mason et al 2016 michielssen et al 2016 talvitie et al 2015 some have identified all particles and fibers with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir or raman spectroscopy browne et al 2011 murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2017a ziajahromi et al 2017 and others have relied on a combined methodology of identification by defining possible microplastics visually and then analyzing only part of them carr et al 2016 magnusson and norén 2014 mintenig et al 2017 even though the abundance of microplastics in the marine environment has been studied quite extensively for the last few decades hidalgo ruz et al 2012 the special case of wastewater treatment plants wwtp as a route of microplastics have started to gain more attention only during recent years carr et al 2016 dris et al 2015 magnusson and norén 2014 mahon et al 2017 mason et al 2016 michielssen et al 2016 mintenig et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2015 2017b still only few research investigations have focused on the removal efficiency of microplastics in wwtps and studied microplastics in other wwtp matrices than final effluent carr et al 2016 mintenig et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2017a first studies have shown that microplastics are effectively removed from wastewater and most of the particles end up in the sludge magnusson and norén 2014 michielssen et al 2016 talvitie et al 2015 2017a even though the removal efficiency of microplastics in wwtps is found to be around 99 carr et al 2016 magnusson and norén 2014 murphy et al 2016 microplastics are continuously being discharged from wwtps to recipient waters on the other hand if most of the microplastics are transferred to wwtp sludge which can be further used in green construction and as a fertilizer in fields sludge might act as a significant route of microplastics to the environment talvitie et al 2017a zubris and richards 2005 furthermore most of the researchers have based their results on wastewater or sludge samples collected only for a short period of time murphy et al 2016 collected water and sludge samples from different stages of a large secondary wwtp within couple of days mintenig et al 2017 studied effluents and sludge from several wwtps in germany and each sample was collected during one day carr et al 2016 studied wastewater and sludge samples from different stages of several wwtps in the united states and samples were collected for maximum 12 days during less than one and a half months talvitie et al 2017a collected sludge and water samples for microlitter studies either once or thrice during one week from different stages of wwtp in finland in this regard our research group and many scientists in the field are emphasizing upon the necessity to analyze microplastic pollution from wwtps for a longer time period to reveal the temporal variation in microplastic concentrations magnusson and norén 2014 murphy et al 2016 ziajahromi et al 2017 in this context the aim of this study was to investigate the efficiency of a wwtp based on conventional activated sludge cas process to remove microplastics from wastewater the abundance of microplastic particles and fibers was monitored in 1 the pretreated influent after primary screening throughout the different stages of the conventional treatment i e 2 effluents from primary clarification and 3 activated sludge process as well as in 4 the digested sludge 5 final effluent and 6 the recipient water body close to the outlet of treated wastewater furthermore the efficiency of a pilot scale membrane bioreactor mbr incorporated with the wwtp was examined by sampling permeate and sludge with the purpose of comparing the removal efficiencies of all the treatment processes operating in the plant overall this study was carried out for 3 months with sampling campaigns every two weeks to our knowledge this is the first study to monitor the occurrence of microplastic particles and fibers in wwtps over several months and thus to provide reliable assessment about the efficiency of wwtp to remove microplastics 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of wwtp and mbr pilot plant in this study wastewater and sludge samples were collected from the municipal wwtp kenkäveronniemi wwtp located near the city center of mikkeli finland the wwtp treats approximately 10 000 m3 of municipal wastewater daily and its treatment processes include screening with step screen and 6 mm sieve grit separation primary clarification biological treatment with activated sludge final sedimentation and disinfection during the sampling campaign sludge volume index svi of the activated sludge was approximately 62 ml g total suspended solids ss for effluent was approximately 10 3 mg l and ss removal efficiency 98 6 according to the wwtp s monitoring records effluent waters from wwtp are discharged into the nearby launialanselkä basin lake saimaa via a 110 meter effluent pipe a pilot scale membrane bioreactor artas ltd turkey operating in mikkeli wwtp since 2014 is able to treat around 3 m3 of wastewater per day the mbr pilot plant consists of an anaerobic tank an aerobic tank and a membrane filtration tank with a submerged mbr unit the pore size of the submerged flat sheet membrane units is 0 4 μm kubota corporation japan detailed information about the setup operating conditions and water treatment efficiency of mbr pilot is available in gurung et al 2016 2017 2 2 sample collection samples were collected from kenkäveronniemi wwtp every two weeks between 10th of october 2016 and 2nd of january 2017 samples were collected on mondays between 8 and 12 a m preliminary sampling tests were carried out before the actual sampling campaign in order to optimize the sampling methods and mitigate potential sample contamination during the in site operations samples transfer and laboratory analyses water samples with a volume of 4 0 30 0 l were collected from influent water after 6 mm screen in the beginning of the grit separation basin after the primary clarification and after the disinfection fig s1 permeate from mbr pilot plant and lake water from the nearby shore about 100 m from the effluent outlet were also studied it has to be noted that in the present investigation focusing the efficiency of the wwtp to remove mps the nearby lake water was sampled only to estimate the amount of mps in close proximity to the discharge location of treated wastewater hence the reported concentrations are neither representing the average mps concentration in the recipient lake nor being correlated with the one discharged from the wwtp samples were collected with a 10 l stainless steel bucket attached to a metal wire and poured to a cascade of two test sieves with mesh sizes of 0 25 and 5 0 mm materials retained on the 0 25 mm sieve were rinsed with distilled water to previously weighed glass beakers with the help of a metal funnel equipment was rinsed three times with distilled water to ensure that all particles were transferred properly distilled water was stored in a 10 l polyethylene container and in polyethylene squirt bottles all samples were collected with same set of equipment and sampling was started from points with presumably smallest mp concentrations to decrease the possibility of cross contamination sludge samples 150 200 ml were collected with a 10 l stainless steel bucket or a 0 25 l stainless steel cup from activated sludge after the aeration basin mbr sludge and digested sludge samples were immediately poured to glass flasks with the help of a metal funnel all vessels were sealed with aluminum foil and rubber bands transferred to the laboratory and stored at 4 c and dark until further treatments to assess possible contamination field blank samples were treated exactly in the same manner as the other samples by using distilled water instead of wastewater and sludge furthermore for water blank samples the cascade of sieves were rinsed with distilled water and the 0 25 mm test sieve was rinsed to previously weighed glass beakers for sludge blank samples a small amount of distilled water was poured to glass flasks with the help of a metal funnel field blank samples were subjected to the before mentioned treatments 2 3 sample pretreatment 2 3 1 water and wastewater water samples were treated according to the method proposed by masura et al 2015 with some adjustments no density separation was performed in order to avoid the loss of any high density microplastics shim et al 2016 such as polyester with density of 1 24 2 3 g cm3 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 furthermore as cellulose fibers density 1 5 g cm3 are one of the most abundant non plastic groups in wwtp samples density separation would not have been suitable for separating them from microplastics due to the overlapping densities of these polymers first the sieved samples were placed in 75 c drying oven for at least 40 h until totally dry then the dried samples 0 15 0 06 g dw were weighed to determine the required amount of chemicals for the subsequent wet peroxide oxidation wpo the oxidation process was carried out by adding 20 ml of aqueous 0 05 m fe ii solution and 20 ml of 30 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to the dried samples mixture was left to settle down for 5 min in room temperature and then the beaker was covered with a watch glass the mixture was agitated and heated up to 75 c using hotplate with magnetic stirrer depending on the organic matter content in water the oxidative reaction frequently overflowed the beaker in this case small amount of distilled water was added to cool down the reaction for the influent samples 40 ml of h2o2 were initially added then another 20 ml of h2o2 were supplemented after 20 min in order to promote the degradation of the organic matter the wpo reaction was conducted for additional 30 min after additions of h2o2 or distilled water samples were let to cool down and vacuum filtrated through gridded membrane filters sartorius cellulose nitrate filter porosity 0 8 μm with glass fiber filters vwr grade 696 porosity 1 5 μm at the bottom for mechanical support filters were placed in petri dishes and let dry for at least 24 h at room temperature while being loosely covered with aluminum foil to avoid potential contamination suitability of wpo treatment for mps was tested with commercial pet and ps beads before sampling campaign and no visible deformations were noticed in treated microplastics due to the large amount of cellulose fibers probably originating mainly from decomposed toilet papers caught in influent samples samples of 0 25 g dw corresponding to 0 8 3 0 l were treated with wpo masura et al 2015 along with cellulase enzymes using the method proposed by champagne and li 2009 these samples were transferred with a metallic spatula into glass beakers treated with wpo sieved using a 38 μm mesh size sieve and rinsed to glass flasks with a small amount of distilled water samples were sealed with foil and stored in the absence of light at 4 c enzymatic degradation was proceeded by adding 250 mg of cellulase aspergillus niger 0 8 activity units per mg to 250 mg dw of influent sample corresponding to an enzyme loading of 800 activity units g substrate next 12 5 ml of sodium citrate buffer ph 4 8 was added to the samples which were then placed in a temperature controlled shaker at 40 c with 160 rpm for 24 h with varying weights of the influent samples the amount of enzymes and buffer solution were adjusted to correspond the before mentioned ratios 2 3 2 sludge sludge samples were treated with the method described by murphy et al 2016 sludge samples were mixed thoroughly with glass stirring rod after which subsamples 0 1 g dw were poured to glass petri dishes and dried at 45 c for 18 h with pierced foil cover the dry weights of samples were estimated on a basis of water contents in each sludge type the target wet weights of subsamples for activated sludge digested sludge and mbr sludge were 20 g 3 g and 10 g respectively 2 4 examination and identification of microplastics 2 4 1 optical microscopy all samples were visually examined under digital optical microscope zeiss stereo discovery v8 with axiocam 503 color with maximum magnification of 50 all possible microplastics and all particles and fibers without a clear organic origin seeds cellulose fibers from toilet paper were collected with tweezers placed on a paper in another petri dish and analyzed via successive magnifications all collected particles and fibers still including both plastic and non plastic material were subjected to a second round of visual identification in which all recovered particles and fibers were photographed and measured for the largest dimension using the built in zen 2 3 software particles and fibers approx 5200 altogether were classified visually in 54 groups according to the helicity of the fibers and shapes of cross section e g round oval or flat and end of fibers such as clear cut tapered or frayed as well as hardness and luster of fragments norén 2007 representative samples of each group were collected on a microscope slide and further examined using an optical microscope zeiss axioscope a1 with a magnification up to 1000 and later with ftir and or raman a small amount of distilled water was added to influent samples to avoid the static electricity of dry cellulose fibers during examination for the dried sludge samples small amount of distilled water was added to break up the sludge material and then each sample was cautiously examined using tweezers three times altogether murphy et al 2016 as a slight improvement to this method the first two examinations were conducted with white background and the third examination with black background i e under the glass dish such approach helped recovering microplastics with different colors more easily 2 4 2 ftir microscopy and raman spectroscopy representative samples of most of the above mentioned groups see section 2 4 1 were analyzed with fourier transform infrared ftir microscopy and or micro raman spectroscopy in order to confirm their plastic or non plastic nature the same approach was also discussed by shim et al 2017 to generate more reliable results than a single analytical method for minimizing the chance for false negative microplastics lenz et al 2015 representatives of all classified particles and fibers e g cellulose were confirmed with spectroscopic methods only particles which were visually identified to clearly consist of organic or other non plastic compounds such as alga sand and glass were excluded from the ftir and raman analyses thus on average 2 to 3 particles or fibers were examined with ftir microscope and micro raman for each group corresponding to 1 3 and 1 4 of all collected particles and fibers representative samples of most abundant groups i e supposed plastic and other materials were first analyzed with ftir microscope spotlight 200i ft ir microscope system equipped with spectrum two perkin elmer in the reflectance mode 24 scans were taken to produce the spectra with wavelengths between 600 and 4000 cm 1 and with the spectral resolution of 4 cm 1 spectra were compared to the spectra libraries supplied by perkinelmer for the micro raman spectroscopy horiba jobin yvon labram hr the analyses were carried out using the green laser 514 53 nm and labspec 5 software with spectra covering a wavelength range between 200 and 3000 cm 1 reference libraries of ftir and raman spectra for different polymers and natural fibers were collected from various sources crawford and quinn 2017 frère et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 2 5 contamination control in the present work a serious consideration was given to the risk of contamination hidalgo ruz et al 2012 murphy et al 2016 thus nitrile gloves and 100 cotton clothes were worn as topmost clothes when collecting or treating the samples only glass and metal dishes were used plastic caps were replaced with aluminum foil and all vessels were covered whenever possible filters and petri dishes were always examined under the optical microscope before the use in order to remove all visible particles and fibers laboratory benches were wiped with cellulose tissue and distilled water thrice before samples were treated one field blank sample for both water and sludge were collected during each sampling to estimate the amount of contamination during sampling and sample preparation all used pe containers and bottles were examined not to act as a source of contamination by filtering stored distilled water once during the sampling campaign with three replicates for each container 3 results and discussion 3 1 contamination despite the efforts to decrease contamination on average 4 4 1 4 and 0 1 0 1 microplastics were counted from field blank samples for water and sludge respectively as blank samples were not conducted with a known volume of distilled water contamination is presented as number of mps per sample highest level of contamination was measured for the first sampling event some evidence of cross contamination such as shells of planktonic organisms were found from field blank samples collected after lake water sampling however the origin of the microplastics contamination could not be assessed without separate control samples for each preparation step challenges related to contamination and sample pretreatment are discussed more detailed in supporting information si 3 2 determination of polymer types different polymers were detected after the recovery of microplastic fibers mpfs and particles mpps from wastewater sludge and lake water samples as illustrated in fig 1 and table 1 the list includes polyester pes polyethylene pe polyamide pa and polypropylene pp these polymers were frequently identified and confirmed with ftir microscope and micro raman spectroscopy microscopic images are shown in fig 2 the proportion of different polymers varied only little between different sampling dates when microplastics from all sampling points were considered during the whole sampling campaign polyester fibers accounted for 96 3 of the mpfs being equivalent to 79 1 of the total amount of mps collected from all of the samples most of the rest mpfs were made of polyamide 3 1 of all mpfs microplastic fibers are usually described to be equally thick with three dimensional bending norén 2007 which differs them from cellulose based fibers with ribbon like appearance dyachenko et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 in this study also polyester fibers with flat cotton like appearance were found fig 2d for the mpps polyethylene was the most abundant polymer that accounted for 63 9 of mpps i e 11 4 of the total mps rest of the collected mpps 36 1 were identified to consist of polyethylene polyester and polypropylene the results of this study are in accordance with previous studies conducted in wwtps ziajahromi et al 2017 reported pet fibers and pe particles as most abundant microplastics in effluents of different wwtps polyester was detected most frequently also in the final effluents of a scottish 28 murphy et al 2016 and an australian wwtp 67 browne et al 2011 dull and unevenly shaped polyethylene fragments were present in treated wastewater effluent similarly with the observations of talvitie et al 2017a the same team indicated that these fragments were most probably originated from cleansing scrubs interestingly in the current study this kind of pe fragments were mostly collected from final effluent and even lake samples but less frequently from influent or sludge samples the reason for not finding pe fragments from influent flow could be related to the diurnal variation in the wastewater flow together with the hydraulic retention time in wwtp processes such observation suggests that at least part of these cosmetics originated fragments are passing through the treatment processes in the studied wwtp murphy et al 2016 did not found any pe microbeads in the effluent of secondary wwtp in scotland rather it was noticed that pe beads were efficiently removed together with grease from the surface of the wastewater based on these few studies the fate of pe fragments tend to vary with the various removal processes in wwtps along with microplastics and despite the rigorous oxidation treatment substantial amounts of organic particles and fibers were abundant in both sludge and wpo treated wastewater samples thus among this group of non plastic compounds many colorful cotton fibers with flat cross section and either twisted or straight appearance were extracted from most of the samples also white or nearly transparent flat cellulose fibers mainly originating from toilet papers together with sand grains and glass fragments were also present in many of the samples altogether from the initial 42 groups that were analyzed with either ftir or raman spectroscopy 22 were excluded as they contained organic compounds e g cotton cellulose chitin for further studies staining could be utilized in separation between plastics and other materials ziajahromi et al 2017 it is also worth noting that the spectra from ftir and raman analyses of most of the analyzed samples did not provide full match with the references which could be caused by attached organic material different additives used in plastics lenz et al 2015 or the thermochemical treatments applied during the sample preparations if some particle or fiber was not identifiable with available analysis other representative from the same group was analyzed instead furthermore the spectra libraries usually consist of spectra for pure substances thus spectra obtained from environmental samples are expected to have low congruity compared to reference spectra murphy et al 2016 3 3 efficiency of wwtp to remove mps in the current study mps concentrations varied between 0 1 and 124 7 mp l in water samples and between 8 2 and 301 4 mps g dw in sludge samples highest average concentrations of microplastics were counted for influent samples and digested sludge 57 6 12 4 mp l and 170 9 28 7 mps g dw respectively table 2 reported mps concentrations in wwtp effluents have varied between 0 and 91 mp l table 3 browne et al 2011 carr et al 2016 dyachenko et al 2017 leslie et al 2017 magnusson and norén 2014 mason et al 2016 michielssen et al 2016 mintenig et al 2017 murphy et al 2016 talvitie et al 2015 2017b ziajahromi et al 2017 in this study final effluents had mps concentration of 1 0 0 4 mp l on average which is consistent with other previous reports browne et al 2011 ziajahromi et al 2017 the large variation in previous results is mainly caused by different types of wastewaters and processes used in studied wwtps mahon et al 2017 together with different size limitations and sampling preparation and identification methods underwood et al 2017 even though ziajahromi et al 2017 reported the decreasing concentrations of microplastics in wwtp effluents as the number of treatment steps is increased most studies did not show similar trends for example one of the highest reported mpps concentration around 8 6 mpp l was reported by talvitie et al 2015 for effluent from the tertiary treatment murphy et al 2016 reported microplastic concentrations of approximately 2 mp in 2 5 g of centrifuged sludge talvitie et al 2017a reported 186 7 26 0 microlitter g of dried sludge after centrifugation they also found out that 20 of microlitter are returned to the wastewater flow via reject water in the current study approximately 170 9 28 7 and 27 3 4 7 mp g dw were counted for digested and mbr sludge respectively noting that our samples were collected before centrifugation and in case of the mbr sludge before any digestion according to the results of the present study the kenkäveronniemi wwtp had a mps removal efficiency of 98 3 table 2 for microplastic particles and fibers the removal efficiencies were 89 8 and 99 1 respectively removal efficiencies of total microplastics were in accordance with recent studies conducted in lysekil sweden 99 9 magnusson and norén 2014 the county of los angeles usa 99 9 carr et al 2016 and glasgow uk 98 4 murphy et al 2016 only one comparative research study of 7 wwtps conducted in netherlands reported removal efficiencies as low as 72 leslie et al 2017 in most related investigations the majority of microplastics was removed in the beginning of the wastewater treatment process during mechanical and chemical pretreatments solids skimming and sludge settling processes carr et al 2016 talvitie et al 2017a therefore effluent filters were found to have only minimal effect on the removal of mps from wastewaters carr et al 2016 as far as the present study is concerned 99 0 of mps were removed already before the aeration process which is consistent with other studies involving cas process in addition it was found that mbr technology was more efficient 99 4 in removing mps from wastewaters compared to the cas process on average mbr permeate contained lower concentrations of microplastics 0 4 0 1 mp l than the final effluent from the main cas process 1 0 0 4 mp l the average inflow of wastewater during sampling days was 10 766 501 m3 and 10 540 425 m3 of final effluent and 87 3 5 5 m3 of digested sludge were released consequently in the light of mps concentrations approximately 1 0 107 and 4 6 108 microplastics were discharged daily with the final effluent and digested sludge from the kenkäveronniemi wwtp respectively when comparing the amount of discharged mps to the amount of mps channeled to the plant with the influent flow 6 2 108 mps d a fraction of the microplastic flux 1 5 108 mps d seems to be trapped within the wwtp this could be related to their possible entrapment with solid materials from grit separation and grease from primary clarification murphy et al 2016 although the wastewater treatment process is basically a linear concept nonetheless some recycled flows do exist within wwtps these flows include reject water from the sludge dewatering water from rinsing of removed solids and grease floating materials from the primary sedimentation and waste activated sludge was all of these flows are concentrated in the beginning of the process and thus collected influent samples consist of both incoming screened wastewater and returning flows the main remark in this regard is that the results of this study do not represent the differences between raw influent and treated effluent but differences of the mps concentrations between different stages of the wwtp process and ultimately the mps concentrations discharged with the final effluent as for the lake water samples collected from nearby the effluent outlet the analysis revealed microplastics concentrations of 0 3 0 1 mp l previously only 0 0008 0 003 mp l were counted from the surface waters of two italian lakes when using mesh size of 300 μm fischer et al 2016 in comparison with the mps concentrations reported for other water bodies nearby the discharge of wwtp effluents the concentrations of the present study were considerably higher for example mps concentrations of 0 001 0 002 mp l were reported for seawater collected 20 200 meters from the wwtp effluent outlet in sweden using mesh size of 300 μm magnusson and norén 2014 in current study the lake water was sampled only to estimate the amount of mps in close proximity to the discharge location of treated wastewater hence the reported concentrations are neither representing the average mps concentration in the recipient lake nor being correlated with the one discharged from the wwtp other possible sources of mps in lake water include e g stormwater littering and atmospheric fallout dris et al 2015 which are not further discussed here overall microplastics concentrations were slightly higher in final effluent than in the effluent from primary clarifier especially for microplastic particles this might be caused by the more turbulent flow of the effluent from primary clarifier compared to the more stable flow at the sampling point of the final effluent besides since most of the particles were polyethylene and they are normally floating in water density 0 92 0 97 g cm3 hidalgo ruz et al 2012 particles might have concentrated to the upper layer of the final effluent flow where samples were collected 3 4 occurrence and distribution of mps 3 4 1 distribution by type fig 3 clearly shows that mpfs were most abundant types of microplastics in the wastewater and sludge of the studied wwtp for instance the highest occurrence of mpfs in relation to mpps was in the sludge fractions with highest occurrence of 94 in the activated sludge and then in the initial effluent 92 even at the lowest the fibers were accounted for 53 and 50 of all counted mps in final effluent and lake water respectively the same tendency i e predominance of mpfs over mpps was also reported in the literature for both wastewater effluents leslie et al 2017 mason et al 2016 michielssen et al 2016 talvitie et al 2015 ziajahromi et al 2017 and the environment browne et al 2011 since there are hardly any plastic industry in the studied area and no stormwater runoffs are conducted to the wwtp most of the microplastics are originated from households and different municipal services in this context the high amounts of plastic fibers indicates the high impact of laundry and textile handling activities on the microplastic emissions another less studied route of mps to the wwtp could be infiltration of sewer system 3 4 2 size distribution as shown in fig 4 64 of all recovered microplastics from the samples were smaller than 1 mm half of which were also smaller than 0 5 mm talvitie et al 2017a reported that depending on the studied stage of the wwtp process only 20 of the collected microlitter were larger than 300 μm the difference is due to the different sampling methods since they collected mps with smaller mesh size 20 μm than was used in this study 250 μm consequently if smaller sized mps would have been caught with finer mesh sizes similarly in the current study the amount of recovered mps would have been higher in present study the main size of mps in final effluent is between 0 5 and 1 mm although mbr process is more efficient than cas to remove microplastics the proportion of the smallest sized mps 0 25 mm is at its highest value in mbr permeate fig 4 equally about one fourth of the mps collected from lake samples were smaller than 0 25 mm which highlights the importance of including smaller sized mp fractions to future studies large mps in mbr permeate might have caused by contamination in the open tank from where permeate was collected because the dimensions and shapes of fibers and some particles are not symmetrical a fraction of mps might pass through the mesh of the sieves even though one of their dimensions would be longer than the mesh size as a result the number of mps mostly fibers counted from the samples reflects only the retained fraction of the microplastics magnusson 2014 on the other hand samples might also have fibers and particles with smaller dimensions than the mesh size if they are entangled together or attached to larger particles while sieving castro et al 2016 overall the risk of losing small sized mps is higher if 250 μm mesh size is used and the proportion of small microplastics would be much larger if smaller mesh size would have been used klein et al 2015 ziajahromi et al 2017 3 4 3 spatiotemporal variations of mps concentrations microplastics concentrations varied substantially during the sampling campaign in both water and sludge samples fig 5 with similar patterns when concentrations of mpfs and mpps were observed separately therefore the mps concentrations in wwtps reported for single sampling events do not give reliable set of data based on which the microplastics pollution issue could be properly assessed and dealt with in order to collect more representative samples and including diurnal variation in the approximation of microplastic concentrations in wwtp automatic composite sampling could be used talvitie et al 2017a up until now most research studies were conducted within a timeframe of days nonetheless few other studies pointed out this high variation of mps concentrations in wastewaters within weeks and seasons mintenig et al 2017 talvitie et al 2017a the sampling campaign of this investigations was conducted between the second week of october and the first week of january in order to assess the occurrence of mps in wastewaters during the autumn and winter seasons in nordic environment based on the presented results of this study the authors emphasize the need to extend the monitoring campaign to cover the spring and summer seasons in order to have an estimate of the annual variation of mps in wastewater and the respective ability of wwtps to effectively deal with such seasonal variation in addition to the seasonal variation there might be diurnal variation in the mp concentrations in the influent this was not taken into account in the sampling and calculations of the removal efficiency of mps in the studied wwtp which might have added some uncertainty in the reported results thus for long term sampling campaigns considering the hydraulic retention time in different process parts should be taken into account for more reliable assessments 4 conclusions the results of the 3 month sampling campaign show that 98 3 of incoming microplastics were removed during the treatment process of the studied wwtp according to the mps occurrence data microplastic fibers 82 are posing a more severe problem than microplastic particles 18 hence the need to put more focus on the occurrence and fate of mpfs in wastewaters and receiving water bodies furthermore this study contributed to the research effort assessing the occurrence and temporal variations of mps within wwtps and the efficiency of conventional activated sludge process and advanced mbr technology to remove microplastics in this regard it was found that mbr process had a slightly better removal efficiency of microplastics 99 4 compared to the overall cas based process 98 3 of all analyzed polymers polyester mostly pet was revealed to be most abundant in collected samples by constituting 79 of the entire mp load and being present in all studied stages of the wwtp the high variation in the determined mps concentrations highlights the importance of conducting several sampling events when studying microplastics in media of variable contents in the current study grab sampling covering separated time frames sampling locations and contamination might have caused uncertainties to the reported results overall in this field of microplastic research standardized protocols have to be developed because of the high amount of uncertainties during sampling sample treatment and characterization and in order to provide reliable methods and generate comparable set of data between researchers another important issue is the urgent need for more reliable ways of identifying plastic particles and fibers from non plastics especially with increasing quantities of identified particles and fibers the applicability of staining and imaging database of confirmed microplastics have already been studied but more research should be conducted to optimize them and find out the most suitable and effective method for microplastics identification funding this work was supported by maa ja vesitekniikan tuki ry mvtt conflicts of interest none acknowledgments maa ja vesitekniikan

and groundwater at an alkaline ph petri et al 2011 persulfate activation by naturally occurring subsurface minerals has also been investigated ahmad et al 2010 documented that the major iron oxide minerals goethite hematite and ferrihydrite do not activate persulfate manganese oxides can activate persulfate but only at concentrations that are significantly higher than those found in native soils and subsurface solids ahmad et al 2010 liu et al 2014 some reduced minerals such as pyrite activate persulfate but reduced minerals are not common in the subsurface most trace minerals do not activate persulfate and many scavenge reactive oxygen species teel et al 2011 several innovative heterogeneous persulfate activators have recently been investigated including metal treated biochar

been shown to activate persulfate ahmad et al 2013 fang et al 2013b however the som content of the subsurface is usually low and cannot be relied upon for persulfate activation organic activation with an external carbon source may provide a pathway that is more reliable than base and transition metal activation preliminary results from our laboratory demonstrate that glucose which is inexpensive and non toxic may activate persulfate the purpose of this research was to investigate the potential for glucose to activate persulfate and to evaluate the conditions that effectively promote its

2 m persulfate 5 mm glucose and a molar ratio of sodium hydroxide persulfate ranging from 0 1 to 2 1 the initial concentration of the probe compounds was 1 mm for nitrobenzene and 2 μm for hexachloroethane due to lower water solubility control experiments were conducted in parallel using deionized water in place of sodium hydroxide persulfate and glucose in addition positive control systems were established in parallel containing persulfate and sodium hydroxide without glucose to distinguish between base activation and glucose activation of persulfate all reactions were conducted at 20 2 c at each time point a set of vials was shake extracted with n hexane and the extracts were analyzed for nitrobenzene by gas chromatography flame ionization detection and for hexachloroethane by gas chromatography electron capture detection in addition sodium persulfate was quantified at each time point by iodometric titration 2 4 effect of glucose and persulfate concentrations on hydroxyl

data are listed in supplemental tables s1 s4 trials 1 through 8 were used to quantify the rate of probe compound loss while trials 9 through 13 were replicates center points used to quantify precision the experimental data were analyzed by least squares linear regression to develop equations for nitrobenzene and hexachloroethane loss rate constants stepwise regression was used for the selection of response surface model terms with all terms in the final model significant at p 0 05 response surfaces representing first order rate constants for the loss of nitrobenzene and hexachloroethane were

ionization detector fid and fitted with a 15 m 0 53 mm spb 5 capillary column the injector and detector port temperatures were 200 c and 250 c respectively the initial oven temperature was 60 c the

statistical software was used to calculate the variances between the experimental data sets and rate constants results from the triplicate reactions at each time point were averaged error bars represent the standard error of the mean 3 results and discussion 3 1 rates of persulfate decomposition persulfate decomposition in basic persulfate systems with and without the addition of glucose at six sodium hydroxide persulfate molar ratios 0 1 to 2 1 is shown in fig 1 in systems without glucose fig 1a persulfate decomposition was undetectable over 8 h at all sodium hydroxide persulfate molar ratios these rates are consistent with persulfate half lives in the range of weeks in the subsurface reported during base activated persulfate isco watts and teel 2006 persulfate decomposition in the presence of 5 mm glucose with the same sodium hydroxide persulfate molar ratios is shown in fig 1b persulfate decomposition was undetectable in control systems with no base addition however persulfate decomposition rates in glucose activated systems increased as a function of sodium hydroxide dose with 2 5 12 15 and 19 persulfate loss over 8 h using sodium hydroxide persulfate molar ratios of 0 1 1 0 25 1 0 5 1 1 1 and 2 1 respectively these results demonstrate that glucose promotes the decomposition of persulfate even in systems containing small masses of sodium hydroxide suggesting that glucose may initiate the generation of reactive oxygen species from persulfate 3 2 generation of hydroxyl radical using the hydroxyl radical probe nitrobenzene relative rates of hydroxyl radical generation were evaluated with and without the addition of glucose fig 2 using the same sodium hydroxide persulfate molar ratios shown in fig 1 nitrobenzene loss in systems without glucose fig 2a was undetectable in the control system containing no base persulfate or glucose as well as in the system containing 0 1 1 sodium hydroxide persulfate nitrobenzene loss in systems without glucose increased slightly as a function of increasing sodium hydroxide persulfate molar ratio with 26 of the nitrobenzene lost at 2 1 sodium hydroxide persulfate fig 2a these results are consistent with increasing base catalyzed hydrolysis of persulfate and increasing hydroperoxide concentrations both of which are required for base activation of persulfate equations 4 and 5 nitrobenzene loss in parallel systems with the addition of 5 mm glucose is shown in fig 2b nitrobenzene loss was 6 in glucose persulfate systems with no base addition 0 1 molar ratio of sodium hydroxide persulfate with the addition of 0 1 1 0 25 1 0 5 1 1 1 and 2 1 molar ratios of sodium hydroxide persulfate nitrobenzene losses were 20 37 61 95 and 98 respectively these results demonstrate that 5 mm glucose significantly increases the activation of persulfate to generate hydroxyl radical compared to base activation alone and that only relatively small masses of base are required for rapid nitrobenzene loss in the presence of glucose furthermore the results of fig 2 indicate that a moderate degree of persulfate activation occurs in the presence of glucose even without base addition at circumneutral ph 3 3 generation of reductants nucleophiles hexachloroethane was used as a probe compound to evaluate relative rates of reductant nucleophile generation in persulfate systems with and without the addition of 5 mm glucose fig 3 with the same sodium hydroxide persulfate molar ratios used to evaluate hydroxyl radical generation hexachloroethane loss was undetectable over 5 h in the control system containing no base persulfate or glucose and ranged from 0 5 to 7 at sodium hydroxide persulfate molar ratios from 0 1 to 2 1 in systems with no added glucose fig 3a these results demonstrate that even at a sodium hydroxide persulfate molar ratio of 2 1 there is minimal base activation of persulfate to generate reductants nucleophiles in contrast significant hexachloroethane loss occurred in the systems with added glucose fig 3b with 16 hexachloroethane loss over 5 h in glucose persulfate systems with no added base 0 1 sodium hydroxide persulfate molar ratio and 99 loss over 30 min in the glucose persulfate system with a 2 1 sodium hydroxide persulfate molar ratio the results of fig 3 demonstrate that glucose activated persulfate provides a robust system for the destruction of chlorinated organic contaminants 3 4 effect of sodium hydroxide concentration on persulfate activation with and without glucose addition first order rate constants for persulfate decomposition nitrobenzene loss and hexachloroethane loss as a function of the sodium hydroxide dose in 0 2 m persulfate systems with and without added glucose are shown in fig 4 the sodium hydroxide dosages shown in fig 4 range from 0 0 4 m which were the actual concentrations of sodium hydroxide used in figs 1 3 to achieve 0 1 2 1 sodium hydroxide persulfate molar ratios in the presence of 0 2 m persulfate persulfate decomposition fig 4a hydroxyl radical generation fig 4b and reductant nucleophile generation rates fig 4c increased linearly in glucose persulfate systems with increasing sodium hydroxide dose r2 0 99 all rates shown in fig 4a c in the glucose persulfate systems were significantly greater than rates in systems without glucose at the highest sodium hydroxide persulfate ratio persulfate decomposition rates were 150 fold greater nitrobenzene loss rates were 15 fold greater and hexachloroethane loss rates were 65 fold greater than in systems without added glucose the results of fig 4 demonstrate that persulfate decomposition hydroxyl radical generation and reductant nucleophile generation rates in glucose activated persulfate systems are all strongly correlated with the basicity of the system however even at relatively low concentrations of sodium hydroxide hydroxyl radical and reductant nucleophile generation rates in glucose persulfate systems are much greater than in parallel without glucose and are sufficiently effective for isco applications the activator of persulfate in base activated systems is hydroperoxide anion which is generated through the base catalyzed hydrolysis of persulfate hydroperoxide anion rapidly reduces persulfate eq 5 however its conjugate acid hydrogen peroxide does not furman et al 2010 6 o3s o o so3 h2o2 no reaction similarly anionic moieties appear to be necessary for activation of persulfate by organic compounds for example phenoxides activate persulfate but phenols do not ahmad et al 2013 the mechanism of glucose activation is likely parallel to that of phenoxides an electron is transferred from glucose to persulfate initiating its activation and glucose is oxidized to products that may also activate persulfate 7 o3s o o so3 glucose so4 2 so4 product the pka of glucose is 12 3 and its anionic form may be the major form of glucose that activates persulfate however some functional groups such as carbonyl oxygens accept a partial negative charge which may promote persulfate activation at circumneutral ph elloy et al 2014 3 5 effect of glucose and persulfate concentrations on hydroxyl radical generation central composite rotatable design experiments using nitrobenzene as a probe compound were conducted at ph 6 5 and ph 12 5 to evaluate the interactive effects of glucose and persulfate concentrations on persulfate activation to generate hydroxyl radical persulfate concentrations were 0 1 0 5 m and glucose concentrations were 10 50 mm ph 6 5 and 1 5 mm ph 12 5 rates of nitrobenzene loss for each trial are listed in tables s1 and s2 the resulting regression equations eqs s1 s2 were used to generate response surfaces fig 5 a and b with a three dimensional surface representing the model rate constants for nitrobenzene loss at varying glucose and persulfate concentrations the response surface for nitrobenzene systems at ph 6 5 fig 5a demonstrates that the rate of nitrobenzene loss increased with increasing persulfate concentration at all glucose concentrations however the rate of nitrobenzene loss decreased slightly as a function of glucose concentration at all persulfate concentrations which may be due to scavenging of hydroxyl radical by the higher concentrations of glucose koh 1 5 109 buxton et al 1988 the results demonstrate a relatively low but still effective rate of hydroxyl radical generation at circumneutral ph in the presence of glucose the data of fig 5a are significant because the most commonly used persulfate activation method alkaline activation becomes insignificant at ph 10 furman et al 2010 at ph 12 5 fig 5b the rate of nitrobenzene loss increased as a function of persulfate concentration at all glucose concentrations at 2 0 mm glucose the rate of nitrobenzene loss also increased as a function of the glucose concentration these results indicate that the addition of glucose to base activated persulfate systems can rapidly increase persulfate activation and contaminant destruction by hydroxyl radical which may prevent the stalling often seen with base activated persulfate isco in the field petri et al 2011 3 6 effect of glucose and persulfate concentrations on nucleophile reductant generation under the same conditions used to evaluate nitrobenzene loss central composite rotatable design experiments were also conducted using hexachloroethane as a probe compound to investigate the interactive effect of glucose and persulfate concentrations to generate reductants nucleophiles hexachloroethane loss rate constants for each trial are listed in tables s3 and s4 the resulting regression equations eqs s3 s4 were used to generate response surfaces fig 6 a and b with a three dimensional surface representing the model rate constants for hexachloroethane loss at varying glucose and persulfate concentrations the response surface for hexachloroethane systems at ph 6 5 fig 6a demonstrates that the rate of hexachloroethane loss at all glucose concentrations increased with increasing persulfate concentrations up to 0 4 m persulfate and then decreased slightly up to 0 5 m persulfate at all persulfate concentrations rates of hexachloroethane loss increased slightly with increasing glucose concentration at ph 12 5 fig 6b the rate of hexachloroethane loss increased with persulfate concentration for all glucose concentrations and also increased with glucose concentration for all persulfate concentrations these results indicate that the addition of glucose to activated persulfate systems increases the generation of reductants nucleophiles in both neutral and basic systems and only low mm concentrations of glucose are needed to promote the generation of reductants nucleophiles the trends in hydroxyl radical generation as a function of persulfate concentration and glucose concentration fig 5 vs nucleophile reductant generation fig 6 are different because of the different pathways involved hydroxyl radical is generated through equations 2 and 3 from the sulfate radical produced in equation 7 alkyl radicals the likely reactive species responsible for hexachloroethane loss would be generated by a one electron transfer from glucose the results of this research demonstrate that glucose activation has significant advantages for isco remediation of contaminated groundwater compared to base activation of persulfate persulfate activation by base is relatively slow with typical persulfate half lives of 1 4 weeks in the subsurface and base activation often stalls in the field petri et al 2011 two moles of sulfuric acid are generated for every mole of persulfate decomposed so the ph of base activated persulfate systems decreases as the reaction proceeds as a result base activation becomes negligible in the subsurface as the ph decreases to 10 2 ph units lower than the pka of hydroperoxide the activator in base activated persulfate systems furman et al 2010 however with glucose addition persulfate activation can be increased significantly and can potentially be more easily controlled by using the most effective glucose concentration and ph in the feed tank used for injections to the subsurface these optimal process conditions would be determined by bench and pilot scale treatability studies although glucose activation of persulfate is most effective at basic ph regimes it provides more flexibility and process chemistry control than base activation alone because of the buffering capacity of subsurface solids and groundwater large masses of sodium hydroxide e g 4 1 molar ratios of sodium hydroxide persulfate are often injected during persulfate isco treatments to prevent stalling of persulfate activation such high sodium hydroxide concentrations are corrosive and hazardous to field personnel and furthermore can mobilize native toxic metals sorbed to subsurface solids kaur and crimi 2014 glucose activation combined with no or much smaller dosages of sodium hydroxide can provide more effective activation of persulfate than base activation alone without the potentially harmful effects of massive sodium hydroxide additions there are several advantages of persulfate activation by glucose compared to current activation technologies 1 it is an activation pathway that is more effective at near neutral ph regimes compared to base activation without glucose and avoids the need for adding large masses of sodium hydroxide 2 minimal concentrations of glucose 1 5 mm are required for persulfate activation 3 glucose is nontoxic and serves as a carbon and energy source for follow on treatment of the degradation products by natural attenuation in summary glucose activation of persulfate has significant advantages over current activation pathways and can potentially provide more effective cleanup of contaminated soils and groundwater 4 conclusions the activation of persulfate by mm concentrations of glucose showed that glucose activates persulfate to generate hydroxyl radical and nucleophiles reductants persulfate activation by glucose was highly correlated with increases in ph however glucose activation was also significant at neutral ph so ph adjustment may not be necessary in the subsurface central composite rotatable design experiments showed that glucose activation of persulfate is sensitive to both persulfate dose and glucose dose minimizing or eliminating sodium hydroxide addition to the subsurface may be achieved with glucose activation of persulfate glucose activation of persulfate provides more options and flexibility for optimization of

peroxide hydroperoxide anion base activated persulfate isco requires the addition of large masses of sodium hydroxide both to offset sulfuric acid generated during persulfate decomposition petri et al 2011 and to overcome the natural buffering capacity of the subsurface such large masses of sodium hydroxide are expensive create potential safety hazards in the field and can leave the treated soil and groundwater at an alkaline ph petri et al 2011 persulfate activation by naturally occurring subsurface minerals has also been investigated ahmad et al 2010 documented that the major iron oxide minerals goethite hematite and ferrihydrite do not activate persulfate manganese oxides can activate persulfate but only at concentrations that are significantly higher than those found in native soils and subsurface solids ahmad et al 2010 liu et al 2014 some reduced minerals such as pyrite activate persulfate but reduced minerals are not common in the subsurface most trace minerals do not activate persulfate and many scavenge reactive oxygen species teel et al 2011 several innovative heterogeneous persulfate activators have recently been investigated including metal treated biochar fang et al 2015 metal oxides ores and bimetallic particles ayoub and ghauch 2014 jo et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 yuan et al 2015 iron modified diatomite da silva rackov et al 2016 metal containing nanoparticles al shamsi and thomson 2013 fang et al 2013a ahmad et al 2015 sun et al 2016 yan et al 2016 and carbon nanotubes with feng et al 2015 cheng et al 2016 and without duan et al 2015 lee et al 2015 metal constituents however use of these particulate based activators is not feasible for activated persulfate injections to the subsurface activation of persulfate in field applications has been problematic to date mineral and iron ii activation is often ineffective and base activation often stalls in the field when the ph drops below 10 5 tsitonaki et al 2010 soil organic matter som also activates persulfate teel et al 2016 likely through the phenoxide and quinone moieties that are present in the som structure organic compounds that make up som such as phenoxide and quinones have been shown to activate persulfate ahmad et al 2013 fang et al 2013b however the som content of the subsurface is usually low and cannot be relied upon for persulfate activation organic activation with an external carbon source may provide a pathway that is more reliable than base and transition metal activation preliminary results from our laboratory demonstrate that glucose which is inexpensive and non toxic may activate persulfate the purpose of this research was to investigate the potential for glucose to activate persulfate and to evaluate the conditions that effectively promote its activation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals sodium persulfate and hexachloroethane were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo glucose sodium hydroxide potato starch and nitrobenzene were

ahmad et al 2012 2 3 general reaction procedures reactions were conducted in triplicate in 20 ml borosilicate vials capped with polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe lined septa each vial contained 10 ml of 0 2 m persulfate 5 mm glucose and a molar ratio of sodium hydroxide persulfate ranging from 0 1 to 2 1 the initial concentration of the probe compounds was 1 mm for nitrobenzene and 2 μm for hexachloroethane due to lower water solubility control experiments were conducted in parallel using deionized water in place of sodium hydroxide persulfate and glucose in addition positive control systems were established in parallel containing persulfate and sodium hydroxide without glucose to distinguish between base activation and glucose activation of persulfate all reactions were conducted at 20 2 c at each time point a set of vials was shake extracted with n hexane and the extracts were analyzed for nitrobenzene by gas chromatography flame ionization detection and for hexachloroethane by gas chromatography electron capture detection in addition sodium persulfate was quantified at each time point by iodometric titration 2 4 effect of glucose and persulfate concentrations on hydroxyl radical and reductant nucleophile generation central composite rotatable designs cochran and cox 1992 were used to investigate the interactive effect of glucose and persulfate concentrations on the generation of oxidants measured by nitrobenzene loss or reductants nucleophiles measured by hexachloroethane loss at ph 6 5 and ph 12 5 the design included two variables each at five levels with five center points for statistical validity hogg and ledolter 1992 cochran and cox 1992 and four star points set at a factor of 1 414 on the far end of the coded scale to achieve complete rotatability box

constants for nitrobenzene and hexachloroethane loss were calculated by plotting the natural log of concentration vs time until 90 loss was achieved the conditions for each trial and the resulting data are listed in supplemental tables s1 s4 trials 1 through 8 were used to quantify the rate of probe compound loss while trials 9 through 13 were replicates center points used to quantify precision the experimental data were analyzed by least squares linear regression to develop equations for nitrobenzene and hexachloroethane loss rate constants stepwise regression was used for the selection of response surface model terms with all terms in the final model significant at p 0 05 response surfaces representing first order rate constants for the loss of nitrobenzene and hexachloroethane were developed using minitab 17 statistical software 2 5 analytical procedures hexane extracts containing nitrobenzene were analyzed using a hewlett packard 5890 gas chromatograph gc equipped with a flame ionization detector fid and fitted with a 15 m 0 53 mm spb 5 capillary column the injector and detector port temperatures were 200 c and 250 c respectively the initial oven temperature was 60 c the program rate was 30 c min and the final temperature was 180 c for hexachloroethane analysis the gc was equipped with an electron capture detector ecd fitted with a 30 m 0 53 mm equity 5 capillary column the injector and detector port temperatures were 220 c and 270 c respectively the initial oven temperature was 100 c the program rate was 30 c min and the final temperature was 240 c sodium persulfate concentrations were determined by iodometric titration with 0 01 n sodium thiosulfate kolthoff and stenger 1947 initial system ph was determined using a fisher accumet ph meter minitab 17 statistical software was used to calculate the variances between the experimental data sets and rate constants results from the triplicate reactions at each time point were averaged error bars represent the standard error of the mean 3 results and discussion 3 1 rates of persulfate decomposition persulfate decomposition in basic persulfate systems with and without the addition of glucose at six sodium hydroxide persulfate molar ratios 0 1 to 2 1 is shown in fig 1 in systems without glucose fig 1a persulfate decomposition was undetectable over 8 h at all sodium hydroxide persulfate molar ratios these rates are consistent with persulfate half lives in the range of weeks in the subsurface reported during base activated persulfate isco watts and teel 2006 persulfate decomposition in the presence of 5 mm glucose with the same sodium hydroxide persulfate molar ratios is shown in fig 1b persulfate decomposition was undetectable in control systems with no base addition however persulfate decomposition rates in glucose activated systems increased as a function of sodium hydroxide dose with 2 5 12 15 and 19 persulfate loss over 8 h using sodium hydroxide persulfate molar ratios of 0 1 1 0 25 1 0 5 1 1 1 and 2 1 respectively these results demonstrate that glucose promotes the decomposition of persulfate even in systems containing small masses of sodium hydroxide suggesting that glucose may initiate the generation of reactive oxygen species from persulfate 3 2 generation of hydroxyl radical using the hydroxyl radical probe nitrobenzene relative rates of hydroxyl radical generation were evaluated with and without the addition of glucose fig 2 using the same sodium hydroxide persulfate molar ratios shown in fig 1 nitrobenzene loss in systems without glucose fig 2a was undetectable in the control system containing no base persulfate or glucose as well as in the system containing 0 1 1 sodium hydroxide persulfate nitrobenzene loss in systems without glucose increased slightly as a function of increasing sodium hydroxide persulfate molar ratio with 26 of the nitrobenzene lost at 2 1 sodium hydroxide persulfate fig 2a these results are consistent with increasing base catalyzed hydrolysis of persulfate and increasing hydroperoxide concentrations both of which are required for base activation of persulfate equations 4 and 5 nitrobenzene loss in parallel systems with the addition of 5 mm glucose is shown in fig 2b nitrobenzene loss was 6 in glucose persulfate systems with no base addition 0 1 molar ratio of sodium hydroxide persulfate with the addition of 0 1 1 0 25 1 0 5 1 1 1 and 2 1 molar ratios of sodium hydroxide persulfate nitrobenzene losses were 20 37 61 95 and 98 respectively these results demonstrate that 5 mm glucose significantly increases the activation of persulfate to generate hydroxyl radical compared to base activation alone and that only relatively small masses of base are required for rapid nitrobenzene loss in the presence of glucose furthermore the results of fig 2 indicate that a moderate degree of persulfate activation occurs in the presence of glucose even without base addition at circumneutral ph 3 3 generation of reductants nucleophiles hexachloroethane was used as a probe compound to evaluate relative rates of reductant nucleophile generation in persulfate systems with and without the addition of 5 mm glucose fig 3 with the same sodium hydroxide persulfate molar ratios used to evaluate hydroxyl radical generation hexachloroethane loss was undetectable over 5 h in the control system containing no base persulfate or glucose and ranged from 0 5 to 7 at sodium hydroxide persulfate molar ratios from 0 1 to 2 1 in systems with no added glucose fig 3a these results demonstrate that even at a sodium hydroxide persulfate molar ratio of 2 1 there is minimal base activation of persulfate to generate reductants nucleophiles in contrast significant hexachloroethane loss occurred in the systems with added glucose fig 3b with 16 hexachloroethane loss over 5 h in glucose persulfate systems with no added base 0 1 sodium hydroxide persulfate molar ratio and 99 loss over 30 min in the glucose persulfate system with a 2 1 sodium hydroxide persulfate molar ratio the results of fig 3 demonstrate that glucose activated persulfate provides a robust system for the destruction of chlorinated organic contaminants 3 4 effect of sodium hydroxide concentration on persulfate activation with and without glucose addition first order rate constants for persulfate decomposition nitrobenzene loss and hexachloroethane loss as a function of the sodium hydroxide dose in 0 2 m persulfate systems with and without added glucose are shown in fig 4 the sodium hydroxide dosages shown in fig 4 range from 0 0 4 m which were the actual concentrations of sodium hydroxide used in figs 1 3 to achieve 0 1 2 1 sodium hydroxide persulfate molar ratios in the presence of 0 2 m persulfate persulfate decomposition fig 4a hydroxyl radical generation fig 4b and reductant nucleophile generation rates fig 4c increased linearly in glucose persulfate systems with increasing sodium hydroxide dose r2 0 99 all rates shown in fig 4a c in the glucose persulfate systems were significantly greater than rates in systems without glucose at the highest sodium hydroxide persulfate ratio persulfate decomposition rates were 150 fold greater nitrobenzene loss rates were 15 fold greater and hexachloroethane loss rates were 65 fold greater than in systems without added glucose the results of fig 4 demonstrate that persulfate decomposition hydroxyl radical generation and reductant nucleophile generation rates in glucose activated persulfate systems are all strongly correlated with the basicity of the system however even at relatively low concentrations of sodium hydroxide hydroxyl radical and reductant nucleophile generation rates in glucose persulfate systems are much greater than in parallel without glucose and are sufficiently effective for isco applications the activator of persulfate in base activated systems is hydroperoxide anion which is generated through the base catalyzed hydrolysis of persulfate hydroperoxide anion rapidly reduces persulfate eq 5 however its conjugate acid hydrogen peroxide does not furman et al 2010 6 o3s o o so3 h2o2 no reaction similarly anionic moieties appear to be necessary for activation of persulfate by organic compounds for example phenoxides activate persulfate but phenols do not ahmad et al 2013 the mechanism of glucose activation is likely parallel to that of phenoxides an electron is transferred from glucose to persulfate initiating its activation and glucose is oxidized to products that may also activate persulfate 7 o3s o o so3 glucose so4 2 so4 product the pka of glucose is 12 3 and its anionic form may be the major form of glucose that activates persulfate however some functional groups such as carbonyl oxygens accept a partial negative charge which may promote persulfate activation at circumneutral ph elloy et al 2014 3 5 effect of glucose and persulfate concentrations on hydroxyl radical generation central composite rotatable design experiments using nitrobenzene as a probe compound were conducted at ph 6 5 and ph 12 5 to evaluate the interactive effects of glucose and persulfate concentrations on persulfate activation to generate hydroxyl radical persulfate concentrations were 0 1 0 5 m and glucose concentrations were 10 50 mm ph 6 5 and 1 5 mm ph 12 5 rates of nitrobenzene loss for each trial are listed in tables s1 and s2 the resulting regression equations eqs s1 s2 were used to generate response surfaces fig 5 a and b with a three dimensional surface representing the model rate constants for nitrobenzene loss at varying glucose and persulfate concentrations the response surface for nitrobenzene systems at ph 6 5 fig 5a demonstrates that the rate of nitrobenzene loss increased with increasing persulfate concentration at all glucose concentrations however the rate of nitrobenzene loss decreased slightly as a function of glucose concentration at all persulfate concentrations which may be due to scavenging of hydroxyl radical by the higher concentrations of glucose koh 1 5 109 buxton et al 1988 the results demonstrate a relatively low but still effective rate of hydroxyl radical generation at circumneutral ph in the presence of glucose the data of fig 5a are significant because the most commonly used persulfate activation method alkaline activation becomes insignificant at ph 10 furman et al 2010 at ph 12 5 fig 5b the rate of nitrobenzene loss increased as a function of persulfate concentration at all glucose concentrations at 2 0 mm glucose the rate of nitrobenzene loss also increased as a function of the glucose concentration these results indicate that the addition of glucose to base activated persulfate systems can rapidly increase persulfate activation and contaminant destruction by hydroxyl radical which may prevent the stalling often seen with base activated persulfate isco in the field petri et al 2011 3 6 effect of glucose and persulfate concentrations on nucleophile reductant generation under the same conditions used to evaluate nitrobenzene loss central composite rotatable design experiments were also conducted using hexachloroethane as a probe compound to investigate the interactive effect of glucose and persulfate concentrations to generate reductants nucleophiles hexachloroethane loss rate constants for each trial are listed in tables s3 and s4 the resulting regression equations eqs s3 s4 were used to generate response surfaces fig 6 a and b with a three dimensional surface representing the model rate constants for hexachloroethane loss at varying glucose and persulfate concentrations the response surface for hexachloroethane systems at ph 6 5 fig 6a demonstrates that the rate of hexachloroethane loss at all glucose concentrations increased with increasing persulfate concentrations up to 0 4 m persulfate and then decreased slightly up to 0 5 m persulfate at all persulfate concentrations rates of hexachloroethane loss increased slightly with increasing glucose concentration at ph 12 5 fig 6b the rate of hexachloroethane loss increased with persulfate concentration for all glucose concentrations and also increased with glucose concentration for all persulfate concentrations these results indicate that the addition of glucose to activated persulfate systems increases the generation of reductants nucleophiles in both neutral and basic systems and only low mm concentrations of glucose are needed to promote the generation of reductants nucleophiles the trends in hydroxyl radical generation as a function of persulfate concentration and glucose concentration fig 5 vs nucleophile reductant generation fig 6 are different because of the different pathways involved hydroxyl radical is generated through equations 2 and 3 from the sulfate radical produced in equation 7 alkyl radicals the likely reactive species responsible for hexachloroethane loss would be generated by a one electron transfer from glucose the results of this research demonstrate that glucose activation has significant advantages for isco remediation of contaminated groundwater compared to base activation of persulfate persulfate activation by base is relatively slow with typical persulfate half lives of 1 4 weeks in the subsurface and base activation often stalls in the field petri et al 2011 two moles of sulfuric acid are generated for every mole of persulfate decomposed so the ph of base activated persulfate systems decreases as the reaction proceeds as a result base activation becomes negligible in the subsurface as the ph decreases to 10 2 ph units lower than the pka of hydroperoxide the activator in base activated persulfate systems furman et al 2010 however with glucose addition persulfate activation can be increased significantly and can potentially be more easily controlled by using the most effective glucose concentration and ph in the feed tank used for injections to the subsurface these optimal process conditions would be determined by bench and pilot scale treatability studies although glucose activation of persulfate is most effective at basic ph regimes it provides more flexibility and process chemistry control than base activation alone because of the buffering capacity of subsurface solids and groundwater large masses of sodium hydroxide e g 4 1 molar ratios of sodium hydroxide persulfate are often injected during persulfate isco treatments to prevent stalling of persulfate activation such high sodium hydroxide concentrations are corrosive and hazardous to field personnel and furthermore can mobilize native toxic metals sorbed to subsurface solids kaur and crimi 2014 glucose activation combined with no or much smaller dosages of sodium hydroxide can provide more effective activation of persulfate than base activation alone without the potentially harmful effects of massive sodium hydroxide additions there are several advantages of persulfate activation by glucose compared to current activation technologies 1 it is an activation pathway that is more effective at near neutral ph regimes compared to base activation without glucose and avoids the need for adding large masses of sodium hydroxide 2 minimal concentrations of glucose 1 5 mm are required for persulfate activation 3 glucose is nontoxic and serves as a carbon and energy source for follow on treatment of the degradation products by natural attenuation in summary glucose activation of persulfate has significant advantages over current activation pathways and can potentially provide more effective cleanup of contaminated soils and groundwater 4 conclusions the activation of persulfate by mm concentrations of glucose showed that glucose activates persulfate to generate hydroxyl radical and nucleophiles reductants persulfate activation by glucose was highly correlated with increases in ph however glucose activation was also significant at neutral ph so ph adjustment may not be necessary in the subsurface central composite rotatable design experiments showed that glucose activation of persulfate is sensitive to both persulfate dose and glucose dose minimizing or eliminating sodium hydroxide addition to the subsurface may be achieved with glucose activation of persulfate glucose activation of persulfate provides more options and flexibility for optimization of
