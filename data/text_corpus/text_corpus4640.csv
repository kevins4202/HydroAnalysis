23200,during the hydrodynamic analysis of the incident wave with the floating breakwater the viscous effect for example the vortex generation and the energy dissipation is one of the issues which affects the proper estimation of the wave protection performance traditional potential flow simulation is unable to solve the vortex dissipation in this paper the viscous flow simulation of wave body interactions is carried out for a rectangular and inverted π type fixed floating breakwater fb the numerical accuracy of the viscous model is confirmed by comparison of the wave transmission and reflection coefficients between the viscous flow potential flow and experimental results furthermore the vorticity field on these two types of fb are discussed and compared respectively further the characteristics like the vortex evolution the flow pattern and the vorticity magnitude around the inverted π type fixed fb is analyzed in detail finally an l type floating breakwater is designed and the sensitivity analysis of the principle dimensions on its wave protection property is performed it has been demonstrated that l type floating breakwater has better comprehensive performance than rectangular and inverted π type floating breakwater under the same length of the protruding plate keywords fixed floating breakwater viscous dissipation vorticity field l type floating breakwater configuration improvement of fb 1 introduction floating breakwater is a special type of breakwater which is suited for deep sea floating breakwater can be divided into four general categories they are box pontoon mat and tethered float mccartney 1985 the wave elimination principle is to reflect the incident wave and taking advantage of motion and frictional damping to dissipate energy of the wave based on these types of breakwater many scholars have dedicated their efforts to improve and optimize the hydrodynamic performance of the fb mani 1991 proposed y type floating breakwater the configuration is a combination of square box and cylinder when the wave induces the motions of the fb the cylinder below the square box disturbs the path of water particle to reduce the wave transmission gesraha 2006 proposed a floating breakwater which is a rectangular breakwater combined with two vertical plates in his research he indicated that the two plates of breakwater can increase added mass and damping of breakwater while at the same time break the path of water particle in contrast with rectangular breakwater breakwater has better performance patil et al 2012 proposed a multi layer moored floating pipe breakwater and provided a numerical model to predict the wave transmission coefficient accurately matsunaga et al 2002 gave a review of a steel floating breakwater with truss structure it uses the forward truss to break the incident waves and the rear square box to block the broken waves finally good wave attenuation effect is obtained neelamani et al 2002 developed a type breakwater and carried out an experimental study on the hydrodynamic performance of the physical model ji et al 2015 presented a new type of floating breakwater which consists of two parts the horizontal rigid cylinders and a flexible mesh cage containing a number of suspending balls that are intended to absorb the wave energy and convert it into mechanical energy wang et al 2015 studied the wave dissipation efficiency of the new curtain type flexible floating breakwater cffb by experimental method in which a floating plate structure was set on the breakwater which can effectively improve the performance of cffb duan et al 2017 studied a new f type floating breakwater where numerical simulation and experimental study were performed to analyze the wave reflection transmission coefficients of the proposed fb the result indicated that the f type floating breakwater has good effect on wave protection yang 2015 in his study of the inverted π type fb conducted a potential flow calculation and experimental research to get the hydrodynamic performance of the floating breakwater at fixed condition in his paper the inverted π structure is used as a basic configuration for further numerical analysis and configuration improvement model experiments and numerical simulation are two main methods for the optimization and configuration of floating breakwater the non viscous flow methods especially the potential flow method is the most frequently used method for numerical simulation with an advantage of high computational efficiency it can provide satisfactory result since fluid viscosity has small effect on the performance of breakwater zheng et al 2004 presented an analytical solution for the diffracted and radiation potential including sway heave and roll by a rectangular body under the action of normal incident waves koutandos et al 2004 studied the hydrodynamic behavior of fixed and heave motion floating breakwaters using a boussinesq model coupled with a 2dv elliptic solver the calculated results were in good agreement with experimental results this solver had been validated which has the ability to predict the pressure field beneath the floating structure and the vertical force acting on it elchahal et al 2006 set up an analytical model to compute the pressure produced by interaction between waves and vertical breakwaters in which wave pressure was expressed in a linear form besides an extension to the structural analysis which was based on the mechanics of continuous medium for the stress distribution inside the fixed breakwater and on the frame theory for the floating breakwater was studied diamantoulaki et al 2008 carried out numerical analysis of the flexible floating breakwaters based on a three dimensional hydrodynamic formulation of the floating body michailides et al 2012 conducted linear hydroelastic analysis in frequency domain with a radiation diffraction 3d hydrodynamic model in recent years viscous flow based computational fluid dynamics cfd methods are getting widely used for analysis of breakwater although viscous flow calculation method spends more computing time it can simulate the effect of fluid viscosity and provide more accurate results cannoo et al 2008 presented a code for breakwater problems rans equations is the basic control equations and volume of fluid approach is used for free surface modeling dentale et al 2014 provides some results of a new procedure to analyze the hydrodynamic aspects of the interactions between maritime emerged breakwaters and waves rans equations were solved by flow 3d software the calculated results were in good agreement with experimental results gope et al 2016 investigated the performance of semi circular breakwater during overtopping using cfd method turbulence parameters and dynamic pressure were calculated tsai 2016 carried out a numerical simulation of the effect of breakwater on the propagation of solitary waves using a cfd method based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations coupled with the renormalization group rng turbulent model the simulation results showed that the run up of the solitary waves on the sloping terrain was significantly reduced with increasing breakwater height in addition lagrangian particle method is also used to study the interaction between waves and breakwaters meringolo et al 2015 adopted sph method to analyze wave pressures and reflection coefficient the detailed flow field at the free surface is well shown by this method in addition many researchers adopted both numerical method and experimental measurement to study the hydrodynamics of the various types of fb structures yang 2015 applied the potential flow model to study the wave reflection transmission coefficients of inverted π type fb it was found that the potential flow model predicted the transmission coefficient quite well but on the other hand it overestimates the experimental results for the wave reflection coefficient during the experiments it was observed that there was significant vortex generation and related wave breaking phenomenon on the seaward side of the breakwater which cannot be predicted by the potential flow model vortex generation around the breakwater is an important characteristic jung et al 2004 investigated wave interactions with a fixed rectangular structure experimentally using particle image velocimetry piv the generation and evolution of vortices and turbulent kinetic energy on both sides of the structure were captured well in the experiments the vorticity and turbulent kinetic energy were proved to be stronger at the seaward side than those at the leeward side koftis et al 2006 studied wave interactions with a fixed floating breakwater fb both numerically and experimentally for velocity at selected locations and pressure distribution around the structure the calculated results were in good agreement with experimental results the effect of the relative draft and the influence of the vertical plate at seaward side of fb on the hydrodynamic characteristics wave transmission coefficient velocity vorticity and turbulence kinetic energy were analyzed in this paper viscous cfd method is used to analyze the performance of the fixed inverted π floating breakwater the interaction process between the incoming waves and the fixed inverted π type and the rectangular box type fb are studied through the comparative analysis of potential flow viscous flow and experimental data it is confirmed that the viscous effect of horizontal plates has an effect on the wave absorbing performance of breakwaters the hydrodynamic characteristics vorticity vortex kinematics and flow pattern for the protruding plate on the inverted π type fb is carried out by comparing the vortex magnitude at the seaward side of the breakwater and that of the leeward side of the breakwater it is found that the horizontal protruding plate on the seaward side of the breakwater plays a greater role in the dissipation of wave energy therefore a breakwater structure with a horizontal protruding plate installed on the seaward side of the breakwater is proposed which is named l type floating breakwater simulations are carried out to determine the performance of l type floating breakwater the wave reflection transmission coefficients at different relative draft and protruding plate were studied in order to study the hydrodynamic performance of l type breakwater 2 numerical model setting and calculation conditions 2 1 the basic fb structures for numerical analysis in this paper two types of floating breakwater are used and are shown in fig 1 the basic configurations and dimensions are described to facilitate the comparison with previous experiments of yang z 2015 for the inverted π structure two horizontal protruding plates are attached in the seaward and leeward side of the fb respectively in the numerical analysis the floating breakwater is fixed on the free surface without any degree of freedom the breakwater utilizes combined dimensioning technique whereby the scaling factor is 1 10 compared with the full scale breakwater the width is b 1 65 m the height is d 1 m the draft d 2d 3 0 66 m for inverted π structure the length of the single protruding plate l is 0 25b 0 4125 m 2 2 the numerical model and wave conditions the

relative proportion of fluid in each cell and its value is always between zero and one in this work the governing equations with the above described computational domain and simulation setup are solved by a commercially available finite volume software fluent16 0 in particular piso method is used for velocity pressure coupling for spatial interpolation least squares cell based scheme is used for gradient term second order upwind scheme is used for pressure term first order upwind scheme is used for turbulent term temporal discretization is a first order implicit scheme the two dimensional wave flume is established in fluent the computational domain is shown in fig 2 there are two kinds of global length lf of the wave flume for cases whose wave length is short lf 30 m and l1 20 175 m for cases whose wave length is longer lf 50 m and l1 40 175 m at the rightmost side of the computational domain a wave absorbing domain is set whose length l2 is 5 m the height of computational domain is 4 m the water depth h is 2 m on the top half of the computational domain is air the structured mesh is used in the computational domain the grid is evenly distributed in the whole computational domain at the vicinity of the water surface the mesh densities are increased to better capture the wave elevation in majority of the region the ratio of horizontal grid length to vertical grid height dx dy is equal to 1 close to the free surface the mesh size in the horizontal and vertical direction is about 1 100 of the wave length 1 60 of the wave height respectively the created mesh around the inverted π structure is shown in fig 3 in this paper the piston type numerical wave maker is used to generate the incident wave the wave maker is forced to perform the sinusoidal motions to simulate the regular harmonic waves the udf user defined function method in fluent is used to realize the reciprocating motion of numerical wave maker in order to model the harmonic piston type wave maker the sliding mesh method is used before performing the hydrodynamic analysis of the floating breakwater in waves the wave generation quality is checked the numerical wave maker generates a wave whose wave length is 5 851 m wave height is 160 mm wave steepness is about 0 0273 and the validation is carried out by comparison between the simulated wave and the linear airy wave elevation the comparison is shown in fig 4 within the stable range of 20 s 40 s the average simulated wave height is 160 5 mm the relative difference compared with the linear wave theory is 0 31 which demonstrates that the generated wave is quite good and the acceptable mesh quality is achieved in order to determine an appropriate mesh size the incident wave interactions with the rectangular floating structure in fig 1 is selected to carry out mesh independence check the selected wave length is 5 851 m wave height is 160 mm the transmitted wave heights at different cell numbers are simulated in the process of changing the number of grids the density relation of each part of the grid remains the same results of mesh independence check are shown in table 1 it is seen that the obtained results have a good convergence with the increase of the total cell numbers in this paper in order to improve the calculation efficiency while the accuracy is guaranteed the mesh setting case 3 is adopted in the operation region of the floating breakwater the water depth in the full scale is assumed to be 20 m the characteristic wave period is between 5s and 8s in the numerical model the water depth is 2 m and consequently the wave period is between 1 6s and 2 4s five instances of calculated conditions are selected close to the characteristic wave period by solving the linear dispersion equation in finite water depth the wave length is determined the simulated wave height is between 1 25 of wave length and 1 36 of wave length for the longer wave length condition the wave height is properly reduced to avoid the occurrence of wave overtopping the simulated five wave conditions are listed in table 2 in the viscous flow analysis for the wave interaction with the floating breakwater the high performance clusters have been used each computation node has two cpus and 64 g memories inside each node is used to run one computational cases it takes about 12 cpu hours for running one simulation on the average the simulation time step is 0 005 s the total numerical simulation time is 40 s 3 numerical results and discussions in this paper the two point method goda and suzuki 1976 is used as wave separation method using this method the incident wave and the reflected wave are separated thus the wave reflection coefficient is obtained transmission coefficient is obtained by the transmitted wave height fig 5 shows the arrangement of probes probe 3 is used to measure the transmission wave height the distance δxb between probe 3 and breakwater is 1 m following the two point method wave probes 1 2 are arranged in the seaward side of the breakwater δl is the distance between probe 1 and probe 2 while δx is the distance between probe 2 and the seaward side of the breakwater according to the requirement of the two point method δl λ should be within the range of 0 05 0 45 while δx λ should be larger than 0 2 0 25 for the five wave conditions in this paper five different probe positions are selected to measure the wave as shown in the table 3 the wave transmission and reflection coefficients are typical parameters to evaluate the breakwater which are defined as follows 7 k t h t h i 8 k r h r h i where ht is the transmitted wave height hr is the reflected wave height hi is the incident wave height during the process of interaction between waves and breakwater transmission coefficient reflection coefficient and dissipation coefficient kd satisfy the following function 9 k t 2 k r 2 k d 2 1 transmission and reflection coefficients of the five wave conditions are calculated and compared with experimental and potential flow results from yang 2015 in the potential results the hydrodynamic analysis of the fixed inverted type floating breakwater is studied using the two dimensional linear potential theory the eigenfunction expansion method is used to solve the potential flow figs 6 7 present the comparisons between cfd simulations potential flow and experimental results from the comparisons the cfd simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental results but the potential flow results overestimate the wave reflection coefficients in the process of interaction between the wave and breakwater a vortex will be produced at the edge of the breakwater evidently the vortex dissipates the wave energy the cfd results can reasonably reproduce the wave energy dissipation procedure during the incident wave interaction with the breakwater and present close results with the model test on the contrary the influence of viscous energy dissipation is not taken into account in potential flow theory because the viscosity of fluid is neglected this is the main reason why potential flow theory results are larger than the experimental and cfd results for reflection coefficients the influence of energy dissipation can be expressed by dissipation coefficient as shown in fig 8 obviously the energy dissipation of the inverted π structure is much larger than that of the rectangular structure while it is also interesting to find that the transmission coefficients from the potential flow theory are quite similar with the model test the reasons can be analyzed from the following aspects firstly in the range of the wave lengths corresponding to b λlarger than 0 2 the wave reflection is relatively larger and quite a lot of wave energy is distributed in the upper part of the structures and reflected by the breakwater the vortex shedding effect in the seaward side of the breakwater mainly dissipate the reflected wave energy and the transmitted wave energy are not dissipated too much by the vortex shedding at the leeward of the breakwater therefore the wave transmission coefficient have a relatively good agreement with the experimental data subsequently it will be shown that the vortex strength and the wave energy dissipation at the leeward side is relatively weak and these also supports a better agreement of the wave transmission coefficient from potential flow results secondly in the range of the wave lengths corresponding to b λ smaller than 0 2 as the wave transmission effect becomes stronger the wave energy dissipation at the leeward side becomes relatively larger and potential flow theory overestimate the experimental result due to lack of modeling the viscous dissipation effect in order to investigate the wave energy dissipation characteristics during the incident wave interaction with the fixed floating breakwater the viscous fluid field especially the vortex shedding effect is discussed in the subsequent paragraphs based on the viscous cfd simulations the vorticity is obtained by calculating the curl of the velocity field as shown in the following formula below 10 ω u j x i u i x j where u and v stand for the horizontal and vertical fluid velocity respectively the introduction of the vorticity in eq 10 is used here to study the characteristics of its generation evolution and fluid dissipation property during interaction of wave with the floating breakwater for rectangular and inverted π structures at b λ 0 189 condition the vorticity field at different time instants of a period is shown in figs 9 and 10 the black line represents free surface the velocity field at seaward side of the inverted π structures at the same time instants with fig 10 is also presented in fig 11 it is observed from figs 9 10 that when the incident wave interacts with the breakwater the flow field around the breakwater produces vortices under the periodical wave action the vortices alternately generate and move away at the corner of the rectangular floating structure as well as at the upper and the lower sides of the protruding plate of the inverted π structure fig 10 a and b and fig 11 a and b provides the vorticity field and velocity field at the time instants that the wave crest is at the seaward side of the structure from fig 11 a it can be seen that the fluid is moving upward and one evident vortex flow pattern exists around the upward protruding plate the vortex intends to induce the water flow toward the fb structure from the flow pattern it means that the wave is rising toward the maximum crest while from fig 11 b it is seen that the fluid is moving downward and one small vortex is generated at the edge of the plate accordingly it means that the wave is moving downward and abandons its maximum crest fig 10 c and d and fig 11 c and d provides the vorticity field and velocity field at the time instants that the wave trough is at the seaward side of the structure from fig 11 c it can be seen that the flow pattern above the plate is similar with that of fig 11 b while the flow pattern downward the fb is in the opposite direction compared with that of fig 11 b based on the flow pattern in fig 11 c it is assumed that the wave is moving downward and reaches the minimum trough position from fig 11 d it is seen that the fluid around the plate is moving upward again and the wave is leaving from its minimum trough position based on the above analysis it is found that the new vortices are generated at two typical time instants corresponding to fig 10 b and fig 10 d respectively for the current inverted π structure the time instant in fig 10 b corresponds to a wave leaving from its maximum crest position at the seaward side of the fb while time instants in fig 10 d corresponds to a wave leaving from its minimum trough position the former generated vortices that are about 33 higher than the latter meanwhile it is also found from figs 9 and 10 that the vorticity on seaward side of the breakwater is evidently larger than that on leeward side in fig 10 b the maximum vorticity at the seaward side of fb is about 8 times larger than that at the leeward side while in fig 10 d it is about 6 times larger it can be concluded that the vortex strength and the wave energy dissipation effect at the leeward side is quite smaller compared with that at the seaward side of the fb if we make a comparison of the vortices magnitude between figs 9 and 10 for these two types of the floating breakwaters it is found that the inverted π floating structure has larger positive negative vorticity compared with those of the rectangular structures the protruding plate definitely strengthens the interaction between the wave and the structures and dissipates more wave energy especially at the seaward side of the structure therefore it is understood from figs 6 7 that the inverted π floating structure generally has lower wave refection wave transmission coefficients than those of the rectangular structures 4 the proposal of l type floating breakwater from the previous study on the vorticity simulation of inverted π structure during the process of wave propagation the vortices are evident on the seaward side of the breakwater but the vortices are relatively weak on the leeward side of the breakwater it is considered from a viscous point of view that strong vortices on the seaward side of the incident wave of the breakwater dissipate more wave energy and reduce the wave transmission following the above findings the protruding plate at the leeward side of the breakwater is removed the l type breakwater is proposed and shown in fig 12 the comparison of l type structure and inverted π structure is carried out by simulation of the wave interaction with the fixed breakwater the dimension of box and draft of l type structure are the same with inverted π structure conditions in fig 1 where l b equals to 0 25 three wave conditions conditions 1 2 3 in table 3 are selected to study the effect of l type breakwater fig 13 shows the comparison of the wave transmission reflection coefficients of l and inverted π structures for the wave reflection coefficients since the protruding plate configuration at the seaward side of l type breakwater and inverted π structure is the same the wave reflection coefficient of the two structures is almost the same however wave transmission coefficients of the l type structure is a little larger than that of inverted π structure the difference between the two structures decreases with the increase of b λ when b λ is greater than 0 3 the transmission coefficients of the two structures are almost the same this indicates that the protruding plate at the leeward side of inverted π structure has less contribution to wave dissipation so it is reasonable to use l type structure in order to reduce the construction cost in the following graph the comparison of l type breakwater and inverted π structure in different plate length is carried out to demonstrate the property of l type breakwater in fig 14 transmission coefficients of inverted π structure for l b 0 125 are given it is compared with l type structure for l b 0 175 and l b 0 25 to analyze the advantage of l type breakwater for cost saving the underwater displacement volume of inverted π structure when l b 0 125 is equal to that of l type structure when l b 0 25 from fig 14 it s seen that the transmission coefficient of l type floating structure is smaller than inverted π structure under the same displacement volume which means that l type breakwater has better wave dissipation performance besides transmission coefficients of inverted π structure for l b 0 125 is similar to that of l type structure when l b 0 175 in this condition underwater area of inverted π structure is 0 405 b2 the draft of floating structure is 0 4 b thickness of protruding plate is 0 02b while it is 0 4035b2 for l type structure which means l type breakwater has better economic performance under the same wave protection performance fig 15 shows the variation of wave transmission and reflection coefficient with draft in two wave conditions for l type breakwater transmission coefficient decreases with the draft especially for the relatively longer wave condition b λ 0 146 it is reduced by about 19 it s also found that the wave reflection coefficient increases with draft it is increased by 17 3 and 6 6 for the two wave conditions b λ 0 146 and 0 272 respectively fig 16 shows the influence of the protruding plate length on the wave transmission coefficients five different l b varrying from 0 0 to 0 25 are selected it is seen that the width of the protruding plate has a significant effect on improving the performance of breakwater for wave protection as the length of the protruding plate increases the transmission coefficient reduces significantly it is reduced by about 60 at b λ 0 272 for l b varrying from 0 0 to 0 25 although the positive effect of increasing the length of the protruding plate exists for the l type breakwater it should be noted that with an increase in the length of the protruding plate the hydrodynamic moment is going to get larger due to the asymmetrical configuration of the l type breakwater from the stability point of view it is not helpful for mooring of the floating breakwater even though it is fixed therefore the length of the protruding plate can not increase without limitation this issue needs further consideration and the hydrodynamic analysis on the hydrodynamic loads is necessary for this problem 5 conclusions in this paper cfd method is used to study the hydrodynamic analysis of the rectangular structure and inverted π fixed floating breakwater during the wave interactions with the structures the vorticity characteristics of these two structures are discussed then the l type breakwater is proposed and the sensitivity analysis about the principle dimensions on the performance improvement is carried out conclusions are as follows 1 for the wave reflection coefficients of the two structures there is a significant difference between the cfd and potential flow results by vorticity simulation it is found that this phenomenon is mainly caused by the vortices on seaward side of the breakwater which can influence the flow pattern around the breakwater and dissipate the wave energy 2 from the viscosity point of view it is seen that the vorticity magnitude of the inverted π structure is larger than that of the rectangular structure the vorticity field is also more evident which means that the vortices can dissipate the wave energy in a large extent through the analysis of the vortices evolution and the fluid velocity field in four time instants for the inverted π structure it is found that the new formation of the vortex at the edge of the seaward plate occurs when the wave along the seaward side of the fb is moving downward from its maximum crest position or moving upward from its minimum trough position the former scenario can generate stronger vorticity 3 the configuration optimization of inverted π floating breakwater is carried out and a new l type floating breakwater is proposed it is found that the width of the protruding plate has significant effect on improving the performance of the l type breakwater for wave protection throughout these research the l type breakwater has better wave dissipation ability under the same plate length compared with the inverted π structure and the l type breakwater has potentially better economic performance under the same wave protection performance acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the national natural science foundation grant no 51490671

further numerical analysis and configuration improvement model experiments and numerical simulation are two main methods for the optimization and configuration of floating breakwater the non viscous flow methods especially the potential flow method is the most frequently used method for numerical simulation with an advantage of high computational efficiency it can provide satisfactory result

method and experimental measurement to study the hydrodynamics of the various types of fb structures yang 2015 applied the potential flow model to study the wave reflection transmission coefficients of inverted π type fb it was found that the potential flow model predicted the transmission coefficient quite well but on the other hand it overestimates the experimental results for the wave reflection coefficient during the experiments it was observed that there was significant vortex generation and related wave breaking phenomenon on the seaward side of the breakwater which cannot be predicted by the potential flow model vortex generation around the breakwater is an important characteristic jung et al 2004 investigated wave interactions with a fixed rectangular structure experimentally using particle image velocimetry piv the generation and evolution of vortices and turbulent kinetic energy on both sides of the structure were captured well in the experiments the vorticity and turbulent kinetic energy were proved to be stronger at the seaward side than those at the leeward side koftis et al 2006 studied wave interactions with a fixed floating breakwater fb both numerically and experimentally for velocity at selected locations and pressure distribution around the structure the calculated results were in good agreement with experimental results the effect of the relative draft and the influence of the vertical plate at seaward side of fb on the hydrodynamic characteristics wave transmission coefficient velocity vorticity and turbulence kinetic energy were analyzed in this paper viscous cfd method is used to analyze the performance of the fixed inverted π floating breakwater the interaction process between the incoming waves and the fixed inverted π type and the rectangular box type fb are studied through the comparative analysis of potential flow viscous flow and experimental data it is confirmed that the viscous effect of horizontal plates has an effect on the wave absorbing performance of breakwaters the hydrodynamic characteristics vorticity vortex kinematics and flow pattern for the protruding plate on the inverted π type fb is carried out by comparing the vortex magnitude at the seaward side of the breakwater and that of the leeward side of the breakwater it is found that the horizontal protruding plate on the seaward side of the breakwater plays a greater role in the dissipation of wave energy therefore a breakwater structure with a horizontal protruding plate installed on the seaward side of the breakwater is proposed which is named l type floating breakwater simulations are carried out to determine the performance of l type floating breakwater the wave reflection transmission coefficients at different relative draft and protruding plate were studied in order to study the hydrodynamic performance of l type breakwater 2 numerical model setting and calculation conditions 2 1 the basic fb structures for numerical analysis in this paper two types of floating breakwater are used and are shown in fig 1 the basic configurations and dimensions are described to facilitate the comparison with previous experiments of yang z 2015 for the inverted π structure two horizontal protruding plates are attached in the seaward and leeward side of the fb respectively in the numerical analysis the floating breakwater is fixed on the free surface without any degree of freedom the breakwater utilizes combined dimensioning technique whereby the scaling factor is 1 10 compared with the full scale breakwater the width is b 1 65 m the height is d 1 m the draft d 2d 3 0 66 m for inverted π structure the length of the single protruding plate l is 0 25b 0 4125 m 2 2 the numerical model and wave conditions the

relative proportion of fluid in each cell and its value is always between zero and one in this work the governing equations with the above described computational domain and simulation setup are solved by a commercially available finite volume software fluent16 0 in particular piso method is used for velocity pressure coupling for spatial interpolation least squares cell based scheme is used for gradient term second order upwind scheme is used for pressure term first order upwind scheme is used for turbulent term temporal discretization is a first order implicit scheme the two dimensional wave flume is established in fluent the computational domain is shown in fig 2 there are two kinds of global length lf of the wave flume for cases whose wave length is short lf 30 m and l1 20 175 m for cases whose wave length is longer lf 50 m and l1 40 175 m at the rightmost side of the computational domain a wave absorbing domain is set whose length l2 is 5 m the height of computational domain is 4 m the water depth h is 2 m on the top half of the computational domain is air the structured mesh is used in the computational domain the grid is evenly distributed in the whole computational domain at the vicinity of the water surface the mesh densities are increased to better capture the wave elevation in majority of the region the ratio of horizontal grid length to vertical grid height dx dy is equal to 1 close to the free surface the mesh size in the horizontal and vertical direction is about 1 100 of the wave length 1 60 of the wave height respectively the created mesh around the inverted π structure is shown in fig 3 in this paper the piston type numerical wave maker is used to generate the incident wave the wave maker is forced to perform the sinusoidal motions to simulate the regular harmonic waves the udf user defined function method in fluent is used to realize the reciprocating motion of numerical wave maker in order to model the harmonic piston type wave maker the sliding mesh method is used before performing the hydrodynamic analysis of the floating breakwater in waves the wave generation quality is checked the numerical wave maker generates a wave whose wave length is 5 851 m wave height is 160 mm wave steepness is about 0 0273 and the validation is carried out by comparison between the simulated wave and the linear airy wave elevation the comparison is shown in fig 4 within the stable range of 20 s 40 s the average simulated wave height is 160 5 mm the relative difference compared with the linear wave theory is 0 31 which demonstrates that the generated wave is quite good and the acceptable mesh quality is achieved in order to determine an appropriate mesh size the incident wave interactions with the rectangular floating structure in fig 1 is selected to carry out mesh independence check the selected wave length is 5 851 m wave height is 160 mm the transmitted wave heights at different cell numbers are simulated in the process of changing the number of grids the density relation of each part of the grid remains the same results of mesh independence check are shown in table 1 it is seen that the obtained results have a good convergence with the increase of the total cell numbers in this paper in order to improve the calculation efficiency while the accuracy is guaranteed the mesh setting case 3 is adopted in the operation region of the floating breakwater the water depth in the full scale is assumed to be 20 m the characteristic wave period is between 5s and 8s in the numerical model the water depth is 2 m and consequently the wave period is between 1 6s and 2 4s five instances of calculated conditions are selected close to the characteristic wave period by solving the linear dispersion equation in finite water depth the wave length is determined the simulated wave height is between 1 25 of wave length and 1 36 of wave length for the longer wave length condition the wave height is properly reduced to avoid the occurrence of wave overtopping the simulated five wave conditions are listed in table 2 in the viscous flow analysis for the wave interaction with the floating breakwater the high performance clusters have been used each computation node has two cpus and 64 g memories inside each node is used to run one computational cases it takes about 12 cpu hours for running one simulation on the average the simulation time step is 0 005 s the total numerical simulation time is 40 s 3 numerical results and discussions in this paper the two point method goda and suzuki 1976 is used as wave separation method using this method the incident wave and the reflected wave are separated thus the wave reflection coefficient is obtained transmission coefficient is obtained by the transmitted wave height fig 5 shows the arrangement of probes probe 3 is used to measure the transmission wave height the distance δxb between probe 3 and breakwater is 1 m following the two point method wave probes 1 2 are arranged in the seaward side of the breakwater δl is the distance between probe 1 and probe 2 while δx is the distance between probe 2 and the seaward side of the breakwater according to the requirement of the two point method δl λ should be within the range of 0 05 0 45 while δx λ should be larger than 0 2 0 25 for the five wave conditions in this paper five different probe positions are selected to measure the wave as shown in the table 3 the wave transmission and reflection coefficients are typical parameters to evaluate the breakwater which are defined as follows 7 k t h t h i 8 k r h r h i where ht is the transmitted wave height hr is the reflected wave height hi is the incident wave height during the process of interaction between waves and breakwater transmission coefficient reflection coefficient and dissipation coefficient kd satisfy the following function 9 k t 2 k r 2 k d 2 1 transmission and reflection coefficients of the five wave conditions are calculated and compared with experimental and potential flow results from yang 2015 in the potential results the hydrodynamic analysis of the fixed inverted type floating breakwater is studied using the two dimensional linear potential theory the eigenfunction expansion method is used to solve the potential flow figs 6 7 present the comparisons between cfd simulations potential flow and experimental results from the comparisons the cfd simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental results but the potential flow results overestimate the wave reflection coefficients in the process of interaction between the wave and breakwater a vortex will be produced at the edge of the breakwater evidently the vortex dissipates the wave energy the cfd results can reasonably reproduce the wave energy dissipation procedure during the incident wave interaction with the breakwater and present close results with the model test on the contrary the influence of viscous energy dissipation is not taken into account in potential flow theory because the viscosity of fluid is neglected this is the main reason why potential flow theory results are larger than the experimental and cfd results for reflection coefficients the influence of energy dissipation can be expressed by dissipation coefficient as shown in fig 8 obviously the energy dissipation of the inverted π structure is much larger than that of the rectangular structure while it is also interesting to find that the transmission coefficients from the potential flow theory are quite similar with the model test the reasons can be analyzed from the following aspects firstly in the range of the wave lengths corresponding to b λlarger than 0 2 the wave reflection is relatively larger and quite a lot of wave energy is distributed in the upper part of the structures and reflected by the breakwater the vortex shedding effect in the seaward side of the breakwater mainly dissipate the reflected wave energy and the transmitted wave energy are not dissipated too much by the vortex shedding at the leeward of the breakwater therefore the wave transmission coefficient have a relatively good agreement with the experimental data subsequently it will be shown that the vortex strength and the wave energy dissipation at the leeward side is relatively weak and these also supports a better agreement of the wave transmission coefficient from potential flow results secondly in the range of the wave lengths corresponding to b λ smaller than 0 2 as the wave transmission effect becomes stronger the wave energy dissipation at the leeward side becomes relatively larger and potential flow theory overestimate the experimental result due to lack of modeling the viscous dissipation effect in order to investigate the wave energy dissipation characteristics during the incident wave interaction with the fixed floating breakwater the viscous fluid field especially the vortex shedding effect is discussed in the subsequent paragraphs based on the viscous cfd simulations the vorticity is obtained by calculating the curl of the velocity field as shown in the following formula below 10 ω u j x i u i x j where u and v stand for the horizontal and vertical fluid velocity respectively the introduction of the vorticity in eq 10 is used here to study the characteristics of its generation evolution and fluid dissipation property during interaction of wave with the floating breakwater for rectangular and inverted π structures at b λ 0 189 condition the vorticity field at different time instants of a period is shown in figs 9 and 10 the black line represents free surface the velocity field at seaward side of the inverted π structures at the same time instants with fig 10 is also presented in fig 11 it is observed from figs 9 10 that when the incident wave interacts with the breakwater the flow field around the breakwater produces vortices under the periodical wave action the vortices alternately generate and move away at the corner of the rectangular floating structure as well as at the upper and the lower sides of the protruding plate of the inverted π structure fig 10 a and b and fig 11 a and b provides the vorticity field and velocity field at the time instants that the wave crest is at the seaward side of the structure from fig 11 a it can be seen that the fluid is moving upward and one evident vortex flow pattern exists around the upward protruding plate the vortex intends to induce the water flow toward the fb structure from the flow pattern it means that the wave is rising toward the maximum crest while from fig 11 b it is seen that the fluid is moving downward and one small vortex is generated at the edge of the plate accordingly it means that the wave is moving downward and abandons its maximum crest fig 10 c and d and fig 11 c and d provides the vorticity field and velocity field at the time instants that the wave trough is at the seaward side of the structure from fig 11 c it can be seen that the flow pattern above the plate is similar with that of fig 11 b while the flow pattern downward the fb is in the opposite direction compared with that of fig 11 b based on the flow pattern in fig 11 c it is assumed that the wave is moving downward and reaches the minimum trough position from fig 11 d it is seen that the fluid around the plate is moving upward again and the wave is leaving from its minimum trough position based on the above analysis it is found that the new vortices are generated at two typical time instants corresponding to fig 10 b and fig 10 d respectively for the current inverted π structure the time instant in fig 10 b corresponds to a wave leaving from its maximum crest position at the seaward side of the fb while time instants in fig 10 d corresponds to a wave leaving from its minimum trough position the former generated vortices that are about 33 higher than the latter meanwhile it is also found from figs 9 and 10 that the vorticity on seaward side of the breakwater is evidently larger than that on leeward side in fig 10 b the maximum vorticity at the seaward side of fb is about 8 times larger than that at the leeward side while in fig 10 d it is about 6 times larger it can be concluded that the vortex strength and the wave energy dissipation effect at the leeward side is quite smaller compared with that at the seaward side of the fb if we make a comparison of the vortices magnitude between figs 9 and 10 for these two types of the floating breakwaters it is found that the inverted π floating structure has larger positive negative vorticity compared with those of the rectangular structures the protruding plate definitely strengthens the interaction between the wave and the structures and dissipates more wave energy especially at the seaward side of the structure therefore it is understood from figs 6 7 that the inverted π floating structure generally has lower wave refection wave transmission coefficients than those of the rectangular structures 4 the proposal of l type floating breakwater from the previous study on the vorticity simulation of inverted π structure during the process of wave propagation the vortices are evident on the seaward side of the breakwater but the vortices are relatively weak on the leeward side of the breakwater it is considered from a viscous point of view that strong vortices on the seaward side of the incident wave of the breakwater dissipate more wave energy and reduce the wave transmission following the above findings the protruding plate at the leeward side of the breakwater is removed the l type breakwater is proposed and shown in fig 12 the comparison of l type structure and inverted π structure is carried out by simulation of the wave interaction with the fixed breakwater the dimension of box and draft of l type structure are the same with inverted π structure conditions in fig 1 where l b equals to 0 25 three wave conditions conditions 1 2 3 in table 3 are selected to study the effect of l type breakwater fig 13 shows the comparison of the wave transmission reflection coefficients of l and inverted π structures for the wave reflection coefficients since the protruding plate configuration at the seaward side of l type breakwater and inverted π structure is the same the wave reflection coefficient of the two structures is almost the same however wave transmission coefficients of the l type structure is a little larger than that of inverted π structure the difference between the two structures decreases with the increase of b λ when b λ is greater than 0 3 the transmission coefficients of the two structures are almost the same this indicates that the protruding plate at the leeward side of inverted π structure has less contribution to wave dissipation so it is reasonable to use l type structure in order to reduce the construction cost in the following graph the comparison of l type breakwater and inverted π structure in different plate length is carried out to demonstrate the property of l type breakwater in fig 14 transmission coefficients of inverted π structure for l b 0 125 are given it is compared with l type structure for l b 0 175 and l b 0 25 to analyze the advantage of l type breakwater for cost saving the underwater displacement volume of inverted π structure when l b 0 125 is equal to that of l type structure when l b 0 25 from fig 14 it s seen that the transmission coefficient of l type floating structure is smaller than inverted π structure under the same displacement volume which means that l type breakwater has better wave dissipation performance besides transmission coefficients of inverted π structure for l b 0 125 is similar to that of l type structure when l b 0 175 in this condition underwater area of inverted π structure is 0 405 b2 the draft of floating structure is 0 4 b thickness of protruding plate is 0 02b while it is 0 4035b2 for l type structure which means l type breakwater has better economic performance under the same wave protection performance fig 15 shows the variation of wave transmission and reflection coefficient with draft in two wave conditions for l type breakwater transmission coefficient decreases with the draft especially for the relatively longer wave condition b λ 0 146 it is reduced by about 19 it s also found that the wave reflection coefficient increases with draft it is increased by 17 3 and 6 6 for the two wave conditions b λ 0 146 and 0 272 respectively fig 16 shows the influence of the protruding plate length on the wave transmission coefficients five different l b varrying from 0 0 to 0 25 are selected it is seen that the width of the protruding plate has a significant effect on improving the performance of breakwater for wave protection as the length of the protruding plate increases the transmission coefficient reduces significantly it is reduced by about 60 at b λ 0 272 for l b varrying from 0 0 to 0 25 although the positive effect of increasing the length of the protruding plate exists for the l type breakwater it should be noted that with an increase in the length of the protruding plate the hydrodynamic moment is going to get larger due to the asymmetrical configuration of the l type breakwater from the stability point of view it is not helpful for mooring of the floating breakwater even though it is fixed therefore the length of the protruding plate can not increase without limitation this issue needs further consideration and the hydrodynamic analysis on the hydrodynamic loads is necessary for this problem 5 conclusions in this paper cfd method is used to study the hydrodynamic analysis of the rectangular structure and inverted π fixed floating breakwater during the wave interactions with the structures the vorticity characteristics of these two structures are discussed then the l type breakwater is proposed and the sensitivity analysis about the principle dimensions on the performance improvement is carried out conclusions are as follows 1 for the wave reflection coefficients of the two structures there is a significant difference between the cfd and potential flow results by vorticity simulation it is found that this phenomenon is mainly caused by the vortices on seaward side of the breakwater which can influence the flow pattern around the breakwater and dissipate the wave energy 2 from the viscosity point of view it is seen that the vorticity magnitude of the inverted π structure is larger than that of the rectangular structure the vorticity field is also more evident which means that the vortices can dissipate the wave energy in a large extent through the analysis of the vortices evolution and the fluid velocity field in four time instants for the inverted π structure it is found that the new formation of the vortex at the edge of the seaward plate occurs when the wave along the seaward side of the fb is moving downward from its maximum crest position or moving upward from its minimum trough position the former scenario can generate stronger vorticity 3 the configuration optimization of inverted π floating breakwater is carried out and a new l type floating breakwater is proposed it is found that the width of the protruding plate has significant effect on improving the performance of the l type breakwater for wave protection throughout these research the l type breakwater has better wave dissipation ability under the same plate length compared with the inverted π structure and the l type breakwater has potentially better economic performance under the same wave protection performance acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the national natural science foundation grant no 51490671

23201,numerical investigations of hydrodynamic interactions between side by side barges in terms of gap free surface response and forcings are carried out using the analysis framework developed in part i the barges are assumed to be rigidly fixed two sets of investigations are carried out both covering a range of incident wave frequencies the first set examines the influence of gap width on free surface response between two rectangular barges with square bilge corners following the analysis framework a selected set of viscous simulations are carried out and the resulting flow field data are used to quantify the viscous losses through skin friction and vortex shedding these quantified losses are converted into dissipation coefficients for use in a modified linear potential flow code to investigate a larger set of loadcases compared to the viscous simulations gap free surface responses and forcings predicted using the code are compared with results from viscous simulations and discussed based on the results an efficient solution strategy for modelling side by side hydrodynamic interactions is proposed the second set of investigations studies the effect of bilge curvature on the hydrodynamic interactions between the two barges and demonstrates that the framework can also be used to study variations in hull geometric parameters keywords side by side hydrodynamics viscous effects dissipation potential flow gap resonance 1 introduction representing the effects of viscous dissipation is important when modelling hydrodynamic interaction between side by side vessels in part i chua et al 2017 an analysis framework combining i an approach for quantifying the amount of incident wave energy that is being transferred to other physical processes and ii a method for incorporating viscous dissipation into linear potential flow via modifications to the boundary conditions is developed these two items that make up the framework are described in the following paragraphs the reader is referred to part i for a more detailed discussion including a review of the literature on gap resonance between side by side vessels and damping mechanisms it is worth highlighting that the analysis framework has been developed so that appropriate damping coefficient values for various configurations of side by side vessels can be determined the development has been motivated in part by the observation made in the literature review that while some of the publications provide damping values based on the experimental or viscous cfd studies carried out the values may not be applicable for vessel configurations that are different from those investigated in the publications item i is developed by considering the balance of energy in a control volume defined by the vertical plane extending from the outer boundaries of the adjacent barges to the seabed which allows the viscous dissipation due to adjacent vessels of differing draughts to be captured in plan view the envelope of the control volume can be modified from the rectangular shape used in this paper for two rectangular barges to an arbitary form that encompasses the outer perimeter of the two vessels with non rectangular faired hull forms within the control volume part of the incident wave energy will be transferred or dissipated due to interaction with the adjacent barges through various physical processes namely wave scattering skin friction vortex shedding motions of floating bodies and any additional dissipation due to the presence of hull appendages compared to a similar hull form without those appendages the simple summation of these components is assumed to be equal to the change in wave energy as the incident wave field passes the control volume it should be highlighted that physical processes listed above cross interact with each other in the real world the simple summation assumption thus implies that these interactions are ignored this energy component approach can be thought of as an adaptation of the component roll damping method developed by japanese researchers in the 1970s and described in detail in himeno 1981 it should also be noted that energy dissipation through wave breaking is not included in the above list this omission is deemed reasonable firstly due to the fact that breaking of gap free surface have not been reported in the literature and secondly no breaking of free surface is observed in the viscous two phase volume of fluid simulations carried out as part of this research from the above list of energy components the first component wave scattering is excluded through the control volume definition the second skin friction and fourth body motions components can be calculated either directly using empirical and or analytical methods the last component additional dissipation due to appendages can be quantified by taking the difference between two sets of simulations one with the appendages and another without the simple summation assumption is used to calculate the third vortex shedding component in the following manner the net change in energy within the control volume over a few wave cycles is first calculated and the skin friction body motions and appendage dissipation components are subtracted away from that energy given that the control volume does not include any external free surface thus excluding the wave scattering component the residual value will be due to vortex shedding effects for item ii of the analysis framework the free surface and body boundary conditions of a conventional time domain linear potential flow model are modified through the addition of dissipation terms representing vortex shedding and skin friction effects respectively for reference the modified dynamic free surface and body boundary conditions are shown as equations 1 and 2 1 ϕ t g ζ ε ϕ and 2 ϕ s n ϕ w n σ ϕ t where ϕ represents the velocity potential t represents the time variable g represents the gravitational acceleration ζ represents the gap free surface elevation ε represents the dissipation coefficient used to account for vortex shedding effects the superscripts s and w are used to denote the scattered and incident velocity potential components n represents the normal vector and σ represents the body boundary dissipation coefficient the dissipation term in equation 1 has been derived by applying the helmholtz leray decomposition to split the primitive viscous flow variables from the navier stokes equations the terms containing the viscosity constant ν grouped together and re expressed as the dissipation term the dissipation term in equation 2 has been introduced by considering the boundary layer flow where the viscous frictional losses would be related to the dynamic pressure acting at the boundary layer s edge the development of the additional dissipation coefficient terms in the above two equations together with the equations used to calculate the coefficient values associated with the respective dissipation terms are presented in part i the equation used to calculate the vortex shedding dissipation coefficient is also shown here for reference as equation 3 3 ε ω 2 ε 2 2 w d g a p v i s c ρ g b g l ω 2 ζ 2 where ε represents the dissipation coefficient used to account for vortex shedding effects in the dynamic free surface boundary condition ω represents the incident wave frequency w d g a p v i s c represents the rate of work done against vortex shedding effects averaged over time and along and across the gap ρ represents the density of water b g represents the gap distance l represents the length of the gap and ζ represents the gap free surface oscillation amplitude averaged along and across the gap referring to the previous paragraph the amount of work done against vortex shedding effects which correspond to w d g a p v i s c can be calculated as the residual value after deducting away other viscous dissipation components the value of ε can be determined in an iterative manner using equation 3 given that the value of the remaining terms are known or can be calculated from the viscous simulations it may be noted at this point that equation 3 is similar to the expression developed in lu et al 2012 for calculating the artificial lid damping coefficient the body boundary dissipation coefficient used to account for skin friction effects on the wetted hull surfaces i e body boundaries also developed in part i is shown in the following equation 4 4 σ w d s k i n f r i c t s n s h t n t s c n c f p d c t s 2 a r e a c s where σ represents the body boundary dissipation coefficient w d s k i n f r i c represents the time averaged rate of skin friction losses obtained from a viscous simulation t represents the duration of viscous simulation over which work done is being computed with n t s being the number of time steps and subscript t being the time step index n s h represents the number of hull surfaces enclosed within the control volume for calculation of energy dissipation between the side by side vessels subscript s represents the hull surface index n c f represents the number of cell faces on the respective hull surfaces subscript c represents the cell face index p d represents the dynamic pressure field obtained from viscous simulations and a r e a represents the area of a cell face briefly the value of σ can be determined as follows the work done against skin friction corresponding to w d s k i n f r i c can be calculated from the viscous simulations using empirical formula relating the flow velocity to the skin friction forces and integrating the rate of work done against those forces with time the instantaneous values of p d at each cell can be obtained from the viscous simulations together with the value of the corresponding cell face area a r e a with these terms on the right hand side of equation 4 known σ can be directly calculated at this point it is worth recapitulating that the focus of part i is to describe in detail the development of the analysis framework including the methodology for incorporating the quantified viscous dissipation effects as coefficients into a modified potential flow solver given that the process to quantify the viscous dissipation effects uses outputs of viscous flow simulations validation of the viscous solver s ability to model free surface flows in narrow gaps is also carried out in part i here in part ii the focus is on the application of the framework to investigate the influence of different parameters on gap response and hydrodynamic interactions between side by side vessels two sets of investigations are carried out to demonstrate how the framework can be used study the influences of gap distances and hull geometry variations firstly the framework is applied to two fixed identical rectangular barges at various gap distances and across a range of incident wave frequencies to assess effect of gap distance the amount of incident wave energy that is being dissipated and the magnitude of the dissipation coefficients that are being used in the modified linear potential flow solver at the respective gap distances and incident wave frequencies are discussed together with the gap free surface responses and hydrodynamic forcings the analysis framework is subsequently used to model the interactions between two identical fixed barges with rounded bilge corners at the gap resonance incident wave frequencies similarly the responses and forcings predicted by the analysis framework are compared with the corresponding values from viscous simulations and discussed recommendations for efficient analyses spanning various parameters of a loadcase matrix are proposed based on the outputs from the investigations 2 hydrodynamic interaction of side by side rectangular barges at varying gap distances two identical rectangular barges in a side by side arrangement are modelled in three dimensions first using an openfoam viscous flow solver and subsequently using the modified linear potential flow solver with dissipation coefficients calculated from flow field data obtained in the viscous simulations while the numerical modelling carried out here is for vessels that are fixed in space it is worth reiterating that the proposed analysis framework may be applied to configurations with vessels that are free to move as is clear from the published literature it can be helpful to consider the fixed condition first on the way to understanding better the realistic problem of moving barges the reader is referred to part i for details on the viscous and modified linear potential flow solvers the calculation of the coefficients as well as details on how body motions and the resulting relative velocities can be taken into account the two barges are both of length 280 m beam 46 m and draught 16 5 m in a water depth of 50 m and are subjected to regular incident waves from beam seas four different gap distances 4 m 8 m 12 m and 18 m are modelled and the barges are fixed in space the configuration is based on the loadcases studied in sun et al 2010 where a frequency domain potential flow code is used to investigate the hydrodynamic interaction between the barges and incident regular waves loadcase matrices for the viscous and potential flow simulations are shown in tables 1 and 2 respectively at each gap distance the incident wave frequencies at which gap resonance responses occur predicted by using a frequency domain potential flow solver by sun et al 2010 are marked with an asterisk given the relative computational efficicency of the potential flow solver table 2 includes a larger number of loadcases than table 1 the efficiency gains can also be inferred from the fact that a cfd viscous flow loadcase matrix of 30 simulations is used to calculate the damping coefficients which is subsequently used to investigate 68 loadcases at various gap widths and incident wave frequencies in terms of computing time and resources the cfd simulations reported in our paper took 10 days to model the flow over 350s using 60 cpus on a cluster thus by reducing the number of cfd simulations substantial computational savings can be obtained it should be noted at this point that the number of viscous simulations may be reduced if the sole objective is to obtain viscous flow field data for the calculation of dissipation coefficients for use in a modified linear potential flow analysis in this investigation however free surface responses and forcings obtained from the viscous simulations are also used to validate the corresponding values from the modified potential flow and thus a larger loadcase matrix is required it should be further noted that existing industry practice uses a combination of frequency domain and dynamic time domain methods for evaluating global performance of floating structures in terms of computational effort the assembly and solution of the linear potential flow influence coefficient matrix can be carried out using a single core on a laptop in around 3 4 h comparable to the existing industry practice of calculating the frequency domain responses the solved coefficient matrix can subsequently be used for simulations across the across the full range of parameters the computational time and resources required for second step of the time domain potential flow solution is also comparable to the running of dynamic time domain analyses i e a few hours using a single core on a laptop 2 1 mesh setup in order to reduce computational resources the fore aft symmetry of the side by side configuration is used and only half of the domain is modelled in both the viscous and modified linear potential flow solvers the meshes used on both solvers are set up such that the side by side barges lie in the middle of the meshes with the origin of the axes system located at the intersection of the longitudinal and transverse planes of symmetry on the mean sea level the z axis points vertically upwards with z 0 m being the mean sea level the y axis points in the transverse direction with the wave and leeward also referred to as up and downwave barges located in regions where y 0 m and y 0 m respectively the x axis points down the longitudinal centreline of the gap with x 0 m being the symmetry plane and the gap opening located at x 140 0 m wave generation and absorption viscous wave damping modified potential flow zones are defined far field port starboard and forward of the barges to prevent the reflection of out going scattered waves a symmetry boundary condition is used on the mid ship plane for the meshes used in the viscous simulations the schematic mesh setup is shown in fig 1 a cell grading is used in the mesh regions away from where the barges are located with cells being stretched in the horizontal direction towards the inlet and outlet transverse boundaries to enhance the absorption of scattered waves in addition to the wave absorption provided by the numerical blending of the relaxation zones mesh independence studies are carried out at the widest and narrowest gap distances i e 18 m and 4 m and at the corresponding incident wave frequencies of gap resonance responses meshes of about 0 6 coarse 1 2 medium and 2 4 fine million cells are used and the gap free surface responses are plotted in fig 2 the gap free surface elevation is monitored along a vertical line located at a transverse distance of 0 05 m from the gap facing side shell of the upwave barge and at a longitudinal distance of 0 01 m away from the symmetry plane near the barges midships i e x 0 01 m y 8 95 m this numerical wave probe is located a small distance away from the symmetry plane and the side shell of the up wave barge respectively where the symmetry and no slip boundary conditions are being enforced in the viscous solver given that the maximum difference in gap resonant response between the medium and fine meshes is about 2 the former are used for simulations that produced the subsequent viscous results the mesh setup for the modified potential flow simulations is shown in fig 3 the inlet outlet and lateral far field zones correspond to the left right and bottom of the figure respectively similar to the viscous loadcases mesh independence checks are undertaken for the widest and narrowest gap distances incident waves with frequencies corresponding to the resonant conditions of each gap distances are applied for the 4 m gap distance meshes of 3782 elements and 7920 elements are used while at 18 m meshes of 4472 and 8892 elements are used the checks showed that the free surface elevations predicted using these two meshes are nearly identical at the 4 m gap and a slight difference of approximately 1 6 in the maximum free surface elevation values is observed for the 18 m gap based on these observations it was decided that the coarser mesh is sufficiently accurate for the subsequent modified potential flow simulations meshes at 8 m and 12 m gap distances are generated based on the 4 m and 18 m meshes with minor adjustments made for the different gap distances 2 2 calculation of energy components given that the two side by side barges are fixed in space and have simple rectangular hulls i e no appendages energy loss will only occur through skin friction and vortex shedding effects variation of these two dissipated energy components with incident wave frequencies is presented in sub section 2 2 1 these components are subsequently used to calculate the dissipation coefficients used in the modified potential flow solver and the two sets of results viscous and modified potential flow are compared in sub sections 2 3 1 to 2 3 5 2 2 1 dissipated energy components the rate of energy dissipation through skin friction and vortex shedding effects is shown in fig 4 a and b respectively calculated as described in part i the figures show that for both dissipation components the maximum values at each gap distance occur at the gap resonance incident wave frequencies this observation is consistent with the well established fact that the influence of viscous damping on responses due to fluid structure interaction is highest around the resonant frequencies the figures also show that the rate at which energy is lost through skin friction effects is several orders of magnitude approximately five orders of magnitude smaller than through vortex shedding as a qualitative comparison skin friction losses for rolling ships at full scale are about three orders of magnitude smaller than vortex shedding losses himeno 1981 the difference in orders of magnitude between the side by side barges and a rolling ship is likely to be due to the differences in flow characteristics between the resonant gap flow which occurs in the vicinity of two sharp bilge corners compared to the relatively faired hull forms of ships and the fact that the control volume defined here excludes the seaward side shell of the wave ward barge the leeward side shell of the leeward barge and the forward and aft ends of both barges which represent more than one third of the total wetted hull surface area while in the case of a rolling ship all wetted surfaces are included when calculating skin friction losses it can be observed from fig 4 a that the values of resonant skin friction energy dissipation rate are relatively constant with a peak value at 8 m gap distance this can be explained by referring to the gap free surface response results which will be presented in sub section 2 3 1 that the resonant gap free surface responses at 8 m and 18 m are only slightly higher than at 4 m and 12 m since the skin friction dissipation rate is defined as proportional to the cube of velocity which in turn is a product of amplitude and frequency at which the partially entrapped water volume oscillates inside the gap the slightly higher frequency compared to 18 m and amplitude compared to 4 m and 12 m at 8 m will result in the higher gap free surface response being scaled to the cube of these two quantities resulting in the peak fig 4 b shows that the rate of energy dissipation through vortex shedding increases with gap distance since the control volume is defined such that it encompass the two barges as well as the narrow gap between them larger gap distances effectively mean larger control volumes it is therefore appropriate to normalise the vortex shedding energy dissipation rate by the gap distance to facilitate quantitative comparison between the four gap distances the normalised value is referred to here as the vortex shedding dissipation density fig 4 c shows the variation of vortex shedding dissipation density at the four gap distances with incident wave frequencies it can be observed from the figure that the resonant dissipation density values increase with gap distance up to 8 m before decreasing slightly from 8 m to 4 m at the lower incident wave frequencies 0 30 0 40 rad s the vortex shedding energy dissipation density appears to be relatively independent of gap distance consistent with the well known fact that the viscous influence on responses due to fluid structure interaction is not significant away from resonance 2 2 2 modified potential flow dissipation coefficients the energy dissipation rates presented in the preceding sub section are used to determine the values of dissipation coefficients using the calculation process recapitulated in section 1 these coefficients can subsequently be used to incorporate skin friction and vortex shedding effects into the modified time domain linear potential flow solver presented in part i information on the modified potential flow solver will be briefly discussed in section 2 3 for reference variation of the vortex shedding dissipation coefficients with incident wave frequencies at four gap distances 4 m 8 m 12 m and 18 m are shown in fig 5 a to d from the figures it can be observed that the vortex shedding dissipation coefficient at each gap distance appears to fluctuate irregularly about a linear trend line with the fluctuations decreasing with increasing gap distance the fluctuations appear to be largest at a gap distance of 4 m where the vortex shedding coefficients vary from 0 026 to 0 054 at the same time the gradient of each of these trend lines increases with gap distance the most obvious change in gradient occurs when the gap distance increases from 4 m to 8 m where it changes from negative to positive between gap distances of 12 m and 18 m there is only a slight decrease in the trend line s gradient fig 6 shows that the skin friction dissipation coefficients peak at the gap resonant frequencies this is expected given that a larger response would induce higher elevation and velocity amplitudes and consequently larger skin friction losses the maximum peak value of skin friction dissipation coefficient occurs at 8 m consistent with the maximum rate of skin friction energy loss as shown in fig 4 a 2 3 simulations using modified potential flow solver with dissipation in part i a rankine source time domain linear potential flow solver implemented using the higher order boundary element method hobem is described together with adjustments necessary to incorporate the modified boundary conditions with additional dissipation terms in the subsequent sub sections here gap free surface responses and forcings on the two barges calculated using the modified potential solver referred to hereafter as the dissipative time domain dtd solver are compared with corresponding results from the viscous solver and the frequency domain potential flow results of sun et al 2010 recalling that the dtd loadcase matrix table 2 is larger than the viscous loadcases matrix table 1 the linear trend lines shown in fig 5 a to d are used to calculate the vortex shedding dissipation coefficient values via linear interpolation between two known data points skin friction dissipation coefficients are obtained using linear interpolation between two relevant viscous data points of fig 6 2 3 1 gap free surface response fig 7 shows the gap free surface responses from the viscous and dtd simulations non dimensionalised against the incident wave amplitude a against incident wave frequencies in the viscous simulations the free surface elevation is given at the position of the numerical wave probe described in section 2 1 in the dtd simulations the elevation is monitored at the same longitudinal coordinate x 0 01 m but the transverse monitoring location is slightly shifted to be on the side shell of the wave ward barge as an additional check dtd is used to calculate the fully inviscid resonant gap responses at each gap distance by setting the coefficient values to zero these data points are denoted as undamped dtd in the figure good agreement can be observed between these points and the results of sun et al 2010 obtained using a frequency domain potential flow solver thus providing verification of dtd for these undamped cases the figure also show consistency across all three solvers in terms of the incident wave frequencies at which primary resonant gap free surface responses occur results from both the viscous and dtd simulations suggest that the incident frequencies of gap resonant response decrease with increasing gap distance consistent with observations of sun et al 2010 in general fig 7 shows good agreement between the gap response magnitudes obtained using the viscous solver and those of dtd demonstrating the latter s likely ability to provide significant improvement over conventional linear potential flow in predicting gap free surface response over a range of frequencies providing one has estimates of the viscous dissipation coefficients at a much smaller number of frequencies fig 8 a d plot the instantaneous free surface elevation profiles as calculated by the viscous solver in one resonant oscillation cycle for each of the four gap distances due to length wise symmetry the responses are shown for only half of the barges from midship to the forward end for these plots the free surface elevations are sampled at 1 s intervals the longitudinal elevations are shown in the upper subplots while the transverse elevations sampled at three transverse planes across the gap are shown in the three lower subplots together with the longitudinal location of the transverse plane the approximate longitudinal location of these three planes are near midships at about halfway between the gap opening and midships and near the gap opening from the figures it can be observed that the gap free surface response shapes along the gap are the same for all gap distances with the largest response values occurring near midships the longitudinal response values decrease monotonically toward the gap openings in a manner similar to the sinusoidal first mode shapes identified in sun et al 2010 across the gap the free surface responses are generally uniform with small and relatively insignificant variations these transverse response shapes suggest that the gap water column oscillates vertically in a manner similar to a rigid body analogous to the piston mode mode 0 described in molin 2001 in the subsequent paragraphs the longitudinal and transverse response mode shapes will be designated as m n respectively following the definition used in sun et al 2010 fig 9 a d compare the dtd prediction of longitudinal gap free surface response envelopes of each gap distance at resonance with the corresponding output from the viscous solver the transverse response envelopes are not shown given the earlier observation that they are generally straight horizontal lines across the gap i e piston modes the figures show generally good agreement between the two solvers in terms of response envelopes for gap distances between 8 m and 18 m discrepancies between the response envelopes obtained from dtd and the viscous solver are more noticeable at the troughs than at the crest with dtd predicting lower troughs at 4 m gap distance the discrepancies are larger at the crest around midships and at the trough around the gap outlet with the viscous solver predicting a higher crest and a shallower trough the discrepancies are likely to be due to nonlinearities developing in the resonance gap free surface response similar to nonlinear waves where the peaks become steeper and the troughs become shallower than those of an airy wave this nonlinearity is allowed to develop in the viscous flow solver since no explicit boundary conditions are imposed on the free surface unlike the linearised free surface boundary conditions of the dtd which result in envelopes that are symmetric about the zero mean fig 10 plots the longitudinal and transverse free surface elevation profiles calculated using the viscous solver for the 8 m gap distance under excitation from incident waves of 0 70 rad s and sampled at a rate of 1hz a second resonant peak with the gap free surface response approximately 3 the incident wave amplitude is observed in the potential flow results of sun et al 2010 at this incident wave frequency the effect of viscous dissipation can be deduced from the fact that the viscous solver predicts a maximum free surface elevation of about 1 2 the incident wave amplitude this occurs at the around midships a second local maximum can be observed at approximately 90 m from amidships middle lower subplot where the largest free surface elevation at this location is approximately equal to the incident wave amplitude the response shapes suggest a response in the 3 0 mode fig 11 a and b plot the longitudinal and transverse free surface elevation profiles at gap distances of 4 m and 8 m under incident waves of 0 8 rad s referring to fig 7 these two loadcases are located close to the higher third frequency peaks for both gap distances the corresponding inviscid free surface responses at this frequency are both approximately 2 6 the incident wave amplitudes the plots suggest that the longitudinal responses at the two gap distances are of mode shape 5 0 in the transverse direction the responses are of piston modes the maximum free surface elevations at the 4 m and 8 m gap distances are approximately equal and have values around 0 9 the incident wave height respectively these responses are lower than those obtained by sun et al 2010 using potential flow once again indicating the dissipative influence of viscosity 2 3 2 sway forces fig 12 compares the sway forces obtained using the viscous solver and dtd against the frequency domain potential flow results of sun et al 2010 for the four gap distances the sway forces are normalised against ρ g a where ρ represents water density and g represents gravitational acceleration good agreement is observed between the three solvers in terms of the incident wave frequencies at which peak sway forcing occur for both wave and leeward barges respectively referred to as up and downwave boxes in the subsequent plots results from all three solvers indicate that resonant sway forcing frequencies increase with decreasing gap distances similarly to the free surface elevations there is also reasonably good agreement between the results from dtd and the viscous solver in terms of the sway forcing magnitudes on each of the two barges a slight over prediction of forcing on the upwave barge at incident wave frequencies higher than the resonant frequency of each gap distance can be observed across the same frequency range there is better agreement between the two sets of sway force predictions on the leeward barge downwave box compared to the wave ward barge upwave box in terms of peak values there is a slight under prediction of sway forces on the wave ward barge at 4 m gap distance and on the leeward barge at 18 m gap distance by the dtd there is also a small over prediction of sway forces on the leeward barge at 12 m gap distance the resonant peak sway forcing values obtained from the viscous solver and dtd show an opposite trend compared to the potential flow results of sun et al 2010 it can be seen from the figure that the former two solvers which account for viscous dissipation predict that the normalised resonant sway forcings decrease with gap distances for both barges in contrast the conventional potential flow results show an opposite trend that decreasing gap distance will increase sway forcing also the rate at which resonant peak sway forcings change with gap distance is different between the conventional potential flow results and the two solvers that account for viscous effects the rate of increase observed in the conventional potential flow predictions is faster than the rate of decrease observed in the results from the latter two solvers interestingly the sway force responses calculated using dtd at 8 m 12 m and 18 m gap distances show secondary resonant peaks at 0 69 rad s 0 67 rad s and 0 65 rad s consistent with the frequency domain potential flow results of sun et al 2010 however the dtd calculations for the 4 m gap distance did not show any peak in sway forcing at the incident wave frequency of 0 73 rad s unlike the frequency domain potential flow results a possible explanation may be that the secondary resonant peak at 4 m gap distance is shifted to a slightly different frequency due to viscous effects and there are insufficient data points from the viscous and dtd simulations to identify the shfited peak 2 3 3 heave forces fig 13 shows the variation of normalised heave forces against ρ g a with incident wave frequencies at the four gap distances calculated using the viscous solver and dtd together with the corresponding potential flow results of sun et al 2010 the figure shows reasonably good agreement between the heave forces obtained using dtd and the viscous solver for both the wave and leeward barges indicating that the viscous damping of heave forces has been captured by dtd this is evident from the significantly lower heave forcing values on the waveward upwave barge at the heave resonant frequencies predicted by sun et al 2010 similar damping effects acting on the troughs of the heave forcing curves of the upwave barges are also captured generally the inclusion of viscous effects results in the normalised heave forcings on the upwave barges decreasing with increasing incident wave frequencies amplitudes of normalised peak heave forces obtained using solvers with viscous dissipation i e dtd and the viscous solver decrease with gap distance in contrast with conventional potential flow predictions where the amplitudes increase with decreasing gap distance similar to the variation of resonant sway force response with gap distance at incident wave frequencies outside of resonance the normalised heave forces predicted by both the viscous solver and dtd agree well with those predicted using conventional potential flow across all four gap distances 2 3 4 roll moments fig 14 shows the normalised roll moments exerted on the barges obtained from the viscous solver and dtd against incident wave frequencies the figure only includes the conventional potential flow predictions of normalised roll moments at 18 m gap distance from sun et al 2010 in that paper potential flow predictions of roll moments at other gap distances were recognised to be unrealistically large due to the inviscid nature of potential flow models and were thus omitted the figure indicates generally good agreement between the roll moments obtained using the viscous solver and dtd at 18 m gap distance reasonably good agreement is also observed between the results from all three solvers 2 3 5 nonlinear sway and roll forcings at low incident wave frequencies it was observed from the viscous simulation results that nonlinear sway and roll forcings were induced at low incident wave frequencies this phenomenon is particularly obvious at an incident wave frequency of 0 30 rad s for a gap distance of 8 m fig 15 compares the time histories of sway forcings on the two adjacent barges for this loadcase with the corresponding differences in free surface elevations between the port and starboard sides of each barge note that the free surface elevation values are non dimensionalised against the incident wave amplitudes it can be observed from the figure that the time history of normalised sway forces is similar to the variation of arthwartship differences in free surface elevations indicating that horizontal forces exerted on the adjacent barges are dominated by the differences in hydrostatic head between the two sides of each barge fig 16 plots the normalised roll moments on the two barges at a gap distance of 8 m under excitation from incident waves of 0 30 rad s together with the athwartship differences in free surface elevations and the squares of relative tangential velocities on each of the barges in this figure the difference in free surface elevations is scaled by 1000 in addition to being non dimensionalised against incident wave amplitude similarly the square of tangential roll velocity has been multiplied by ρ g a and plotted against the right hand side vertical axis the scaling of these two quantities is carried out so that all three quantities can be shown on the same plot the relative tangential velocities are calculated by first taking the velocity components at a small distance from the up and downstream bilge corners of the wave and leeward barges taking the sum of squares of the lateral athwartship and vertical components and finally taking the difference between the up and downstream values of each barge it can be observed from the figure that the roll moments are influenced by both the athwartship differences in free surface elevations and the squares of relative tangential velocities on each of the barges 3 hydrodynamic loads and gap free surface responses on side by side barges with rounded bilge corners in order to verify that the proposed analysis framework can also be applied to study gap resonance when the bilge curvature is modified the hydrodynamic interactions between two side by side identical barges with rounded bilge corners are investigated at four bilge radius values this is carried out by using the fixed rectangular barges from the previous section and rounding off the bilge corners with the gap distance kept at a constant of 8 m for the investigations carried out in this section viscous simulations are first carried out across a range of incident wave frequencies to check that the incident wave frequencies at which resonant gap response occurs for each bilge radius are consistent with the values estimated using a semi empirical formula subsequently dissipation coefficients are calculated using the viscous flow field data for the gap resonant loadcases of each bilge radius modified potential flow simulations are carried out using these coefficient values and the resulting resonant gap free surface responses and forcings are compared with the corresponding outputs obtained using the viscous solver 3 1 viscous simulations 3 1 1 loadcases and mesh setup moradi et al 2015 investigated the influence of bilge corner radii on gap free surface response in two dimensions using openfoam and proposed a semi empirical relationship between the gap resonant frequency and the bilge radii the relationship shown in equation 5 for reference is used in this research to estimate the resonant incident wave frequencies of gap response 5 ω g a p g b g 0 05 r b d t 0 45 r t 0 45 r where ω g a p represents the incident wave frequency at which the lowest i e first gap resonance response occurs b g represents the gap distance r represents the radius of the bilge corners b represents the barges breadth d represents the water depth and t represents the barges draught table 3 shows the loadcases investigated in this research using the viscous flow solver described in part i the resonant gap response frequencies estimated using equation 5 are marked with an asterisk the computational domain shown in fig 1a is used with local refinement of cells around the curved bilge radii similar to section 2 mesh independence checks are carried out to determine the mesh size required to capture the gap resonance response it is found from the study that meshes of about 3 million cells would be sufficient these meshes are used for simulations that produced the subsequent viscous results 3 1 2 results and discussion fig 17 a plots the steady state gap free surface response amplitude non dimensionalised against the incident wave amplitude against incident wave frequencies location of the numerical wave probe remains unchanged from the earlier viscous simulations with rectangular barges the figure shows that the gap resonance frequencies increase monotonically with the radii of bilge corners it can also be observed that the resonant gap free surface response first increases as the bilge corner is rounded from a radius of 1 m to 4 m before decreasing as the radius is further rounded from 4 m to 6 m the maximum gap resonant response occurring at 4 m bilge radius corresponding to a bilge radius to breadth ratio of 0 087 is just under 8 times the incident wave amplitude the variation in the value of gap resonant response with bilge radius is consistent with the observations of moradi et al 2015 albeit with the following differences i in the present research the resonant response has a peak at a smaller bilge radius to breadth ratio 0 087 compared to 0 1 and ii the resonance gap free surface response amplitudes are approximately 70 smaller in the present research the increase in gap resonant response between bilge radii of 1 m to 4 m can be explained by the fact that rounder bilge corners reduce the adverse pressure gradients thus reducing the vortex shedding action resulting in a larger gap free surface response when the bilge radii are further increased to 6 m a decrease in gap resonance response is observed this may be due to an inviscid effect noted by sun et al 2010 based on their potential flow models of rectangular barges sharp bilge corners with the same length and breadth as those investigated in this research which relates to the influence of draught on gap response the authors observed that the magnitude of the lowest frequency peak first resonance peak increases significantly as the draught of the adjacent vessels increases at constant water depth suggesting that the increase may be associated with the greater degree of flow confinement due to deeper draughts in moradi et al 2015 it is found that an increase in bilge corner radius can be interpreted as a decrease in the effective draught meaning that the increase in bilge radius reduces the extent of flow confinement thus reducing the gap resonant response the relative influence of decreasing vortex shedding diminishes with increasing bilge corner radii as the bilge corners are rounded from radii of 4 m to 6 m the reduction in flow confinement effect becomes more dominant resulting in an overall decrease in resonant gap response in order to verify the influence of the flow confinement effect on gap resonant response the resonant load cases are modelled once more using conventional linear potential flow the variation of gap free surface responses with bilge radii is shown in fig 17 b it should be mentioned here that the value at 0 m radii sharp keel barges are extracted from the frequency domain potential calculations of sun et al 2010 the figure shows that resonant gap free surface response values decrease monotonically with increasing bilge radii these results demonstrate that the inviscid flow interaction effect acts in an opposite manner compared to the viscous vortex shedding action i e as the bilge corners become rounder viscous dissipation reduces thus increasing gap resonant response the inviscid effects also decrease with rounder bilge corners but act to increase the gap resonant responses this appears to be the first demonstration of the opposing influences of the inviscid confinement effect and vortex shedding action on gap resonant response however further investigations across a wider set of geometric and wave parameters will be necessary for this observation to be conclusively established 3 1 3 dissipated energy components at gap resonance the amount of incident wave energy dissipated via vortex shedding action and skin friction losses under gap resonance conditions are calculated using the approach presented in part i and plotted in fig 18 a and b as a visual reference the non dimensionalised gap free surface resonant responses are also included in the plots it can be seen from the figures that the largest rates of energy loss through vortex shedding action and skin friction occurred at bilge radii of 4 m which is where the gap free surface resonant response is the highest by substituting the calculated values of vortex shedding and skin friction energy loss into equations 3 and 4 dissipation coefficient values to be used in the modified potential flow solver are calculated and plotted in fig 19 a and b fig 19 a shows that the vortex shedding coefficient and the gap free surface resonant response are inversely related between bilge radii of 1 m to 4 m this observation is consistent with the fact that rounder bilge corners reduce the effect of vortex shedding action on gap free surface response resulting in an increase in the latter as the bilge corner is further rounded to 6 m the vortex shedding coefficient increases the apparent contradiction between increased roundness of the bilge and increase in vortex shedding coefficient from 4 m to 6 m can be explained by noting that the right hand side of equation 3 is linearly related to the energy loss component but has an inverse quadratic relationship with free surface elevation given that the viscous simulation results presented earlier showed that both vortex shedding energy loss and gap free surface response decrease by about 30 38 when the bilge radii were increased to 6 m it is therefore reasonable to expect that the effect of a decrease in gap free surface response will exceed the corresponding effect in energy loss through vortex shedding fig 19 b shows that the variation of skin friction dissipation coefficient with bilge radius generally follows that of the gap free surface response this is because higher gap responses imply that the gap water column oscillates at higher velocities thus increasing the skin friction coefficient values 3 2 modified potential flow simulations modified potential flow dtd simulations of resonant loadcases at the various bilge radii are carried out using the dissipation coefficient values plotted in fig 19 a and b the boundary element mesh used in the simulations of section 2 3 at 8 m gap distance is modified by rounding the sharp bilge corner to the radius of curvature being analysed with local refinement of elements made around the bilge radii mesh independence checks have been carried out to ensure that the meshes at each bilge radius are sufficiently fine to capture the gap free surface response fig 20 a and b compare the gap free surface responses and sway forcings obtained using the viscous solver with the corresponding values from dtd the respective maximum discrepancies between the dtd and viscous results are 4 3 and 4 9 this can be regarded as good agreement especially given the number of simplifying assumptions made in the analysis framework such as the use of time and spaced averaged energy loss values when calculating the dissipation coefficients in fig 21 a and b the peak values of normalised heave and roll forcings on the side by side barges at each set of bilge radii as predicted by dtd are compared with those from the viscous solver in line with the gap responses and swap forcings reasonably good agreement between the dtd and viscous results can similarly be observed with dtd over predicting the forcings on the upwave barge and under predicting them on the leeward barge the maximum discrepancy between the two sets of numerical predictions is 5 7 it should be noted that for the heave forces fig 21 a the data points have been obtained at the gap resonance frequencies which may not be the frequencies of maximum heave forcings fig 21 b shows that the differences in roll moments between the dtd and viscous results are smaller for the wave ward barge compared to the leeward barge similar to sway and heave the largest difference between the dtd and viscous results occur at bilge radii of 6 m 11 7 followed by 2 m 8 1 and 1 m 7 9 the occurrence of the largest percentage difference in results at 6 m bilge radii can be explained by the fact that the values of normalised roll forcings are roughly half of those at 1 m and 2 m bilge radii thus even with smaller differences in absolute normalised roll moment values the percentage differences will be higher the relatively large difference in roll forcings at 1 m and 2 m may also be due to the difference in gap free surface resonance response predictions observed earlier this is explained as follows firstly differences in gap free surface responses between dtd and viscous predictions will result in discrepancies in the hydrostatic forces and the associated centres of force secondly the velocity amplitudes at which the gap water column oscillates are also affected which in turn affect the dynamic loads acting at the submerged portions of the barges the larger difference in roll forcings at 1 m and 2 m bilge radii compared to 4 m and 6 m are likely to be due to a combination of these two effects 3 3 discussion on possible industry applications and limitations of proposed numerical analysis framework hydrodynamic analyses of side by side vessels is often carried out across a range of parameters such as gap distance hull forms and water depth the importance of including viscous dissipation when carrying out such parametric studies has been highlighted in the literature much of which is reviewed in part i in order to illustrate the advantage of using the proposed numerical analysis framework and as an example of how the analysis framework proposed in this research can be used to efficiently carry out such studies without the exclusion of viscous dissipation consider the trend lines of vortex shedding coefficients against incident wave frequencies shown in fig 5 for all four gap distances the gradients and vertical intercepts of the trend lines can be re plotted to show how these values vary with gap distance as shown in fig 22 these plots can subsequently be used to generate new relationships between the vortex shedding coefficients and the incident wave frequencies at intermediate gap distances not covered by viscous simulations although the relationships of skin friction coefficients with incident wave frequencies across the gap distances are nonlinear a three dimensional plane can be constructed based on the data points plotted in fig 6 so that coefficients at intermediate gap distances can be obtained via interpolation across this plane thus by carrying out a limited set of viscous simulations at certain gap distances and at selected incident wave frequencies relationships between the vortex shedding and skin friction coefficients and the environmental parameters for the relevant side by side configurations can be obtained these relationships can be used for the calculation of dissipation coefficients at intermediate points across the full range of parameters being studied the use of the modified dissipative potential flow model in combination with these estimated coefficients would be significantly more efficient when analysing a matrix of loadcases over a wide range of parameters compared with using a viscous solver for all the loadcases in the matrix this can be considered the main advantage of the proposed numerical analysis framework some simplifying assumptions have been made in the development of numerical analysis framework giving rise to limitations that should be noted these limitations also serve to provide the boundaries of applicability should this framework be used beyond its intended use at the early stages of a design cycle these limitations are discussed as follows no wave overturning and breaking it is worth reiterating that side by side operations are limited to benign operating conditions when incident waveheights are around 1 2 m from the viscous analysis carried out in this research and from published model test data e g molin et al 2009 the maximum gap responses range from about 3 to 5 times of the incident wave height under an incident wave height of 2 m this will result in a maximum gap response of up to 10 m since the length of the entrapped wave will be almost equal to the length of the gap around 300 m the wave steepness will only be around 1 30 notwithstanding the differences between ocean and partially entrapped gap wave systems this steepness value will be well within the bounds of a non breaking wave effect of vortex shedding on body motions not modelled the present research only looked into the energy dissipation effect of vortex shedding on the gap response by fixing the vessels in space as such the influence of vortex shedding on body motions has not been investigated and could be developed in a future work where the approach proposed in part i for splitting the total wave energy into components may be applied to study the appropriate allocation of energy to gap response reduction and to drive body motions viscous dissipation effects limited to first order terms the additional viscous dissipation terms in the modified potential flow solver are derived through consideration of the work done by the linear first order terms higher order effects are thus not accounted for in this regard it is recommended that additional terms based on work done against second or higher order effects should be developed in a future work linear responses the dtd model developed in this research uses linearised free surface boundary conditions that are unable to capture the development of nonlinear effects such as the steepening of wave crests and flattening of troughs this is thought to have resulted in slight discrepancies between the gap free surface envelope shapes predicted using dtd and the viscous solver 4 conclusion results presented in this paper demonstrated that the analysis framework developed in this research and presented in part i chua et al 2017 can be used to carry out hydrodynamic investigations into the gap free surface responses and forcings on side by side barges this is based on two sets of investigations using identical side by side barges with rectangular hull forms fixed in space and subjected to regular waves in the beam seas direction the first set of investigations concerns the influence of gap distance and incident wave frequencies on gap free surface response and forcings on the two barges following the framework presented in part i viscous simulations are first carried out and the flow field data obtained is used to calculate dissipation coefficients which are subsequently used in modified potential flow simulations the loadcase matrix for the latter simulations is larger than the former due to the relative computational efficiency of potential flow models the vortex shedding dissipation coefficients are fitted to linear trend lines through which coefficient values at other intermediate incident wave frequencies not analysed by viscous simulations can be obtained skin friction dissipation coefficients at those frequencies are calculated by directly interpolating between two viscous data points the good agreement in gap free surface response and forcings between the viscous and modified potential flow results obtained in this paper supports the proposed solution strategy where a limited set of viscous simulations is used to estimate the relationships between the coefficients and a certain parameter e g incident wave frequencies gap distances at intermediate parameter values interpolated coefficient values would be used in addition to the advantage of reducing reliance on model test data this solution strategy would be more cost effective than experiments or running the full matrix of loadcases using viscous simulations in the second set of investigations the analysis framework is applied to investigate the influence of bilge curvature on gap resonance similar good agreement between the viscous and modified potential flow results is obtained further demonstrating that the proposed analysis framework can be applied to hull with faired geometries an interesting observation made in these investigations is the different manner in which inviscid and viscous effects influence the gap free surface response increasing the radii of the bilge corners decreases the influence of viscous effects increasing the gap response at the same time the extent to which a given water volume is being confined due to the presence of side by side hulls is reduced and this inviscid flow confinement effect in turn acts to decrease gap free surface resonant response with increasing bilge corner radii based on the work carried out in this research some areas for future work have been identified and are listed as follows extension of the modified time domain dissipative potential flow model to include vessel motions such that energy dissipation through vessel motions can also be quantified and taken into account using the approach presented in part i for splitting the energy component investigation of the influence of relative wave directions such as in quartering seas and having one vessel at a slight angle to another extension of the framework to include second order effects investigation of scaling relations for the energy dissipation components and the corresponding modified potential flow dissipation coefficients lastly it should be noted that the viscous analyses described in section 2 have been carried out using a finite volume solver whose model scale predictions of gap response have been verified in part i with both experimental data and results from a different numerical solver based on the finite element method similarly calculations of gap resonant response between adjacent barges with sharp bilge corners at each of the four gap distances using the time domain potential model without the dissipative coefficients i e convential inviscid potential flow have also been compared with published results obtained using a frequency domain potential flow solver sun et al 2010 while these verifications give confidence that the analysis framework proposed here is able to better predict the gap responses and global forcings on the two adjacent fixed vessels the extension to moving bodies and direct comparisons with experiments should still be carried out methods to experimentally verify the energy lost through vortex shedding and skin friction effects should also be developed which in turn will help to either validate the use of the empirical kato s formula for calculating skin friction losses between side by side vessels

23201,numerical investigations of hydrodynamic interactions between side by side barges in terms of gap free surface response and forcings are carried out using the analysis framework developed in part i the barges are assumed to be rigidly fixed two sets of investigations are carried out both covering a range of incident wave frequencies the first set examines the influence of gap width on free surface response between two rectangular barges with square bilge corners following the analysis framework a selected set of viscous simulations are carried out and the resulting flow field data are used to quantify the viscous losses through skin friction and vortex shedding these quantified losses are converted into dissipation coefficients for use in a modified linear potential flow code to investigate a larger set of loadcases compared to the viscous simulations gap free surface responses and forcings predicted using the code are compared with results from viscous simulations and discussed based on the results an efficient solution strategy for modelling side by side hydrodynamic interactions is proposed the second set of investigations studies the effect of bilge curvature on the hydrodynamic interactions between the two barges and demonstrates that the framework can also be used to study variations in hull geometric parameters keywords side by side hydrodynamics viscous effects dissipation potential flow gap resonance 1 introduction representing the effects of viscous dissipation is important when modelling hydrodynamic interaction between side by side vessels in part i chua et al 2017 an analysis framework combining i an approach for quantifying the amount of incident wave energy that is being transferred to other physical processes and ii a method for incorporating viscous dissipation into linear potential flow via modifications to the boundary conditions is developed these two items that make up the framework are described in the following paragraphs the reader is referred to part i for a more detailed discussion including a review of the literature on gap resonance between side by side vessels and damping mechanisms it is worth highlighting that the analysis framework has been developed so that appropriate damping coefficient values for various configurations of side by side vessels can be determined the development has been motivated in part by the observation made in the literature review that while some of the publications provide damping values based on the experimental or viscous cfd studies carried out the values may not be applicable for vessel configurations that are different from those investigated in the publications item i is developed by considering the balance of energy in a control volume defined by the vertical plane extending from the outer boundaries of the adjacent barges to the seabed which allows the viscous dissipation due to adjacent vessels of differing draughts to be captured in plan view the envelope of the control volume can be modified from the rectangular shape used in this paper for two rectangular barges to an arbitary form that encompasses the outer perimeter of the two vessels with non rectangular faired hull forms within the control volume part of the incident wave energy will be transferred or dissipated due to interaction with the adjacent barges through various physical processes namely wave scattering skin friction vortex shedding motions of floating bodies and any additional dissipation due to the presence of hull appendages compared to a similar hull form without those appendages the simple summation of these components is assumed to be equal to the change in wave energy as the incident wave field passes the control volume it should be highlighted that physical processes listed above cross interact with each other in the real world the simple summation assumption thus implies that these interactions are ignored this energy component approach can be thought of as an adaptation of the component roll damping method developed by japanese researchers in the 1970s and described in detail in himeno 1981 it should also be noted that energy dissipation through wave breaking is not included in the above list this omission is deemed reasonable firstly due to the fact that breaking of gap free surface have not been reported in the literature and secondly no breaking of free surface is observed in the viscous two phase volume of fluid simulations carried out as part of this research from the above list of energy components the first component wave scattering is excluded through the control volume definition the second skin friction and fourth body motions components can be calculated either directly using empirical and or analytical methods the last component additional dissipation due to appendages can be quantified by taking the difference between two sets of simulations one with the appendages and another without the simple summation assumption is used to calculate the third vortex shedding component in the following manner the net change in energy within the control volume over a few wave cycles is first calculated and the skin friction body motions and appendage dissipation components are subtracted away from that energy given that the control volume does not include any external free surface thus excluding the wave scattering component the residual value will be due to vortex shedding effects for item ii of the analysis framework the free surface and body boundary conditions of a conventional time domain linear potential flow model are modified through the addition of dissipation terms representing vortex shedding and skin friction effects respectively for reference the modified dynamic free surface and body boundary conditions are shown as equations 1 and 2 1 ϕ t g ζ ε ϕ and 2 ϕ s n ϕ w n σ ϕ t where ϕ represents the velocity potential t represents the time variable g represents the gravitational acceleration ζ represents the gap free surface elevation ε represents the dissipation coefficient used to account for vortex shedding effects the superscripts s and w are used to denote the scattered and incident velocity potential components n represents the normal vector and σ represents the body boundary dissipation coefficient the dissipation term in equation 1 has been derived by applying the helmholtz leray decomposition to split the primitive viscous flow variables from the navier stokes equations the terms containing the viscosity constant ν grouped together and re expressed as the dissipation term the dissipation term in equation 2 has been introduced by considering the boundary layer flow where the viscous frictional losses would be related to the dynamic pressure acting at the boundary layer s edge the development of the additional dissipation coefficient terms in the above two equations together with the equations used to calculate the coefficient values associated with the respective dissipation terms are presented in part i the equation used to calculate the vortex shedding dissipation coefficient is also shown here for reference as equation 3 3 ε ω 2 ε 2 2 w d g a p v i s c ρ g b g l ω 2 ζ 2 where ε represents the dissipation coefficient used to account for vortex shedding effects in the dynamic free surface boundary condition ω represents the incident wave frequency w d g a p v i s c represents the rate of work done against vortex shedding effects averaged over time and along and across the gap ρ represents the density of water b g represents the gap distance l represents the length of the gap and ζ represents the gap free surface oscillation amplitude averaged along and across the gap referring to the previous paragraph the amount of work done against vortex shedding effects which correspond to w d g a p v i s c can be calculated as the residual value after deducting away other viscous dissipation components the value of ε can be determined in an iterative manner using equation 3 given that the value of the remaining terms are known or can be calculated from the viscous simulations it may be noted at this point that equation 3 is similar to the expression developed in lu et al 2012 for calculating the artificial lid damping coefficient the body boundary dissipation coefficient used to account for skin friction effects on the wetted hull surfaces i e body boundaries also developed in part i is shown in the following equation 4 4 σ w d s k i n f r i c t s n s h t n t s c n c f p d c t s 2 a r e a c s where σ represents the body boundary dissipation coefficient w d s k i n f r i c represents the time averaged rate of skin friction losses obtained from a viscous simulation t represents the duration of viscous simulation over which work done is being computed with n t s being the number of time steps and subscript t being the time step index n s h represents the number of hull surfaces enclosed within the control volume for calculation of energy dissipation between the side by side vessels subscript s represents the hull surface index n c f represents the number of cell faces on the respective hull surfaces subscript c represents the cell face index p d represents the dynamic pressure field obtained from viscous simulations and a r e a represents the area of a cell face briefly the value of σ can be determined as follows the work done against skin friction corresponding to w d s k i n f r i c can be calculated from the viscous simulations using empirical formula relating the flow velocity to the skin friction forces and integrating the rate of work done against those forces with time the instantaneous values of p d at each cell can be obtained from the viscous simulations together with the value of the corresponding cell face area a r e a with these terms on the right hand side of equation 4 known σ can be directly calculated at this point it is worth recapitulating that the focus of part i is to describe in detail the development of the analysis framework including the methodology for incorporating the quantified viscous dissipation effects as coefficients into a modified potential flow solver given that the process to quantify the viscous dissipation effects uses outputs of viscous flow simulations validation of the viscous solver s ability to model free surface flows in narrow gaps is also carried out in part i here in part ii the focus is on the application of the framework to investigate the influence of different parameters on gap response and hydrodynamic interactions between side by side vessels two sets of investigations are carried out to demonstrate how the framework can be used study the influences of gap distances and hull geometry variations firstly the framework is applied to two fixed identical rectangular barges at various gap distances and across a range of incident wave frequencies to assess effect of gap distance the amount of incident wave energy that is being dissipated and the magnitude of the dissipation coefficients that are being used in the modified linear potential flow solver at the respective gap distances and incident wave frequencies are discussed together with the gap free surface responses and hydrodynamic forcings the analysis framework is subsequently used to model the interactions between two identical fixed barges with rounded bilge corners at the gap resonance incident wave frequencies similarly the responses and forcings predicted by the analysis framework are compared with the corresponding values from viscous simulations and discussed recommendations for efficient analyses spanning various parameters of a loadcase matrix are proposed based on the outputs from the investigations 2 hydrodynamic interaction of side by side rectangular barges at varying gap distances two identical rectangular barges in a side by side arrangement are modelled in three dimensions first using an openfoam viscous flow solver and subsequently using the modified linear potential flow solver with dissipation coefficients calculated from flow field data obtained in the viscous simulations while the numerical modelling carried out here is for vessels that are fixed in space it is worth reiterating that the proposed analysis framework may be applied to configurations with vessels that are free to move as is clear from the published literature it can be helpful to consider the fixed condition first on the way to understanding better the realistic problem of moving barges the reader is referred to part i for details on the viscous and modified linear potential flow solvers the calculation of the coefficients as well as details on how body motions and the resulting relative velocities can be taken into account the two barges are both of length 280 m beam 46 m and draught 16 5 m in a water depth of 50 m and are subjected to regular incident waves from beam seas four different gap distances 4 m 8 m 12 m and 18 m are modelled and the barges are fixed in space the configuration is based on the loadcases studied in sun et al 2010 where a frequency domain potential flow code is used to investigate the hydrodynamic interaction between the barges and incident regular waves loadcase matrices for the viscous and potential flow simulations are shown in tables 1 and 2 respectively at each gap distance the incident wave frequencies at which gap resonance responses occur predicted by using a frequency domain potential flow solver by sun et al 2010 are marked with an asterisk given the relative computational efficicency of the potential flow solver table 2 includes a larger number of loadcases than table 1 the efficiency gains can also be inferred from the fact that a cfd viscous flow loadcase matrix of 30 simulations is used to calculate the damping coefficients which is subsequently used to investigate 68 loadcases at various gap widths and incident wave frequencies in terms of computing time and resources the cfd simulations reported in our paper took 10 days to model the flow over 350s using 60 cpus on a cluster thus by reducing the number of cfd simulations substantial computational savings can be obtained it should be noted at this point that the number of viscous simulations may be reduced if the sole objective is to obtain viscous flow field data for the calculation of dissipation coefficients for use in a modified linear potential flow analysis in this investigation however free surface responses and forcings obtained from the viscous simulations are also used to validate the corresponding values from the modified potential flow and thus a larger loadcase matrix is required it should be further noted that existing industry practice uses a combination of frequency domain and dynamic time domain methods for evaluating global performance of floating structures in terms of computational effort the assembly and solution of the linear potential flow influence coefficient matrix can be carried out using a single core on a laptop in around 3 4 h comparable to the existing industry practice of calculating the frequency domain responses the solved coefficient matrix can subsequently be used for simulations across the across the full range of parameters the computational time and resources required for second step of the time domain potential flow solution is also comparable to the running of dynamic time domain analyses i e a few hours using a single core on a laptop 2 1 mesh setup in order to reduce computational resources the fore aft symmetry of the side by side configuration is used and only half of the domain is modelled in both the viscous and modified linear potential flow solvers the meshes used on both solvers are set up such that the side by side barges lie in the middle of the meshes with the origin of the axes system located at the intersection of the longitudinal and transverse planes of symmetry on the mean sea level the z axis points vertically upwards with z 0 m being the mean sea level the y axis points in the transverse direction with the wave and leeward also referred to as up and downwave barges located in regions where y 0 m and y 0 m respectively the x axis points down the longitudinal centreline of the gap with x 0 m being the symmetry plane and the gap opening located at x 140 0 m wave generation and absorption viscous wave damping modified potential flow zones are defined far field port starboard and forward of the barges to prevent the reflection of out going scattered waves a symmetry boundary condition is used on the mid ship plane for the meshes used in the viscous simulations the schematic mesh setup is shown in fig 1 a cell grading is used in the mesh regions away from where the barges are located with cells being stretched in the horizontal direction towards the inlet and outlet transverse boundaries to enhance the absorption of scattered waves in addition to the wave absorption provided by the numerical blending of the relaxation zones mesh independence studies are carried out at the widest and narrowest gap distances i e 18 m and 4 m and at the corresponding incident wave frequencies of gap resonance responses meshes of about 0 6 coarse 1 2 medium and 2 4 fine million cells are used and the gap free surface responses are plotted in fig 2 the gap free surface elevation is monitored along a vertical line located at a transverse distance of 0 05 m from the gap facing side shell of the upwave barge and at a longitudinal distance of 0 01 m away from the symmetry plane near the barges midships i e x 0 01 m y 8 95 m this numerical wave probe is located a small distance away from the symmetry plane and the side shell of the up wave barge respectively where the symmetry and no slip boundary conditions are being enforced in the viscous solver given that the maximum difference in gap resonant response between the medium and fine meshes is about 2 the former are used for simulations that produced the subsequent viscous results the mesh setup for the modified potential flow simulations is shown in fig 3 the inlet outlet and lateral far field zones correspond to the left right and bottom of the figure respectively similar to the viscous loadcases mesh independence checks are undertaken for the widest and narrowest gap distances incident waves with frequencies corresponding to the resonant conditions of each gap distances are applied for the 4 m gap distance meshes of 3782 elements and 7920 elements are used while at 18 m meshes of 4472 and 8892 elements are used the checks showed that the free surface elevations predicted using these two meshes are nearly identical at the 4 m gap and a slight difference of approximately 1 6 in the maximum free surface elevation values is observed for the 18 m gap based on these observations it was decided that the coarser mesh is sufficiently accurate for the subsequent modified potential flow simulations meshes at 8 m and 12 m gap distances are generated based on the 4 m and 18 m meshes with minor adjustments made for the different gap distances 2 2 calculation of energy components given that the two side by side barges are fixed in space and have simple rectangular hulls i e no appendages energy loss will only occur through skin friction and vortex shedding effects variation of these two dissipated energy components with incident wave frequencies is presented in sub section 2 2 1 these components are subsequently used to calculate the dissipation coefficients used in the modified potential flow solver and the two sets of results viscous and modified potential flow are compared in sub sections 2 3 1 to 2 3 5 2 2 1 dissipated energy components the rate of energy dissipation through skin friction and vortex shedding effects is shown in fig 4 a and b respectively calculated as described in part i the figures show that for both dissipation components the maximum values at each gap distance occur at the gap resonance incident wave frequencies this observation is consistent with the well established fact that the influence of viscous damping on responses due to fluid structure interaction is highest around the resonant frequencies the figures also show that the rate at which energy is lost through skin friction effects is several orders of magnitude approximately five orders of magnitude smaller than through vortex shedding as a qualitative comparison skin friction losses for rolling ships at full scale are about three orders of magnitude smaller than vortex shedding losses himeno 1981 the difference in orders of magnitude between the side by side barges and a rolling ship is likely to be due to the differences in flow characteristics between the resonant gap flow which occurs in the vicinity of two sharp bilge corners compared to the relatively faired hull forms of ships and the fact that the control volume defined here excludes the seaward side shell of the wave ward barge the leeward side shell of the leeward barge and the forward and aft ends of both barges which represent more than one third of the total wetted hull surface area while in the case of a rolling ship all wetted surfaces are included when calculating skin friction losses it can be observed from fig 4 a that the values of resonant skin friction energy dissipation rate are relatively constant with a peak value at 8 m gap distance this can be explained by referring to the gap free surface response results which will be presented in sub section 2 3 1 that the resonant gap free surface responses at 8 m and 18 m are only slightly higher than at 4 m and 12 m since the skin friction dissipation rate is defined as proportional to the cube of velocity which in turn is a product of amplitude and frequency at which the partially entrapped water volume oscillates inside the gap the slightly higher frequency compared to 18 m and amplitude compared to 4 m and 12 m at 8 m will result in the higher gap free surface response being scaled to the cube of these two quantities resulting in the peak fig 4 b shows that the rate of energy dissipation through vortex shedding increases with gap distance since the control volume is defined such that it encompass the two barges as well as the narrow gap between them larger gap distances effectively mean larger control volumes it is therefore appropriate to normalise the vortex shedding energy dissipation rate by the gap distance to facilitate quantitative comparison between the four gap distances the normalised value is referred to here as the vortex shedding dissipation density fig 4 c shows the variation of vortex shedding dissipation density at the four gap distances with incident wave frequencies it can be observed from the figure that the resonant dissipation density values increase with gap distance up to 8 m before decreasing slightly from 8 m to 4 m at the lower incident wave frequencies 0 30 0 40 rad s the vortex shedding energy dissipation density appears to be relatively independent of gap distance consistent with the well known fact that the viscous influence on responses due to fluid structure interaction is not significant away from resonance 2 2 2 modified potential flow dissipation coefficients the energy dissipation rates presented in the preceding sub section are used to determine the values of dissipation coefficients using the calculation process recapitulated in section 1 these coefficients can subsequently be used to incorporate skin friction and vortex shedding effects into the modified time domain linear potential flow solver presented in part i information on the modified potential flow solver will be briefly discussed in section 2 3 for reference variation of the vortex shedding dissipation coefficients with incident wave frequencies at four gap distances 4 m 8 m 12 m and 18 m are shown in fig 5 a to d from the figures it can be observed that the vortex shedding dissipation coefficient at each gap distance appears to fluctuate irregularly about a linear trend line with the fluctuations decreasing with increasing gap distance the fluctuations appear to be largest at a gap distance of 4 m where the vortex shedding coefficients vary from 0 026 to 0 054 at the same time the gradient of each of these trend lines increases with gap distance the most obvious change in gradient occurs when the gap distance increases from 4 m to 8 m where it changes from negative to positive between gap distances of 12 m and 18 m there is only a slight decrease in the trend line s gradient fig 6 shows that the skin friction dissipation coefficients peak at the gap resonant frequencies this is expected given that a larger response would induce higher elevation and velocity amplitudes and consequently larger skin friction losses the maximum peak value of skin friction dissipation coefficient occurs at 8 m consistent with the maximum rate of skin friction energy loss as shown in fig 4 a 2 3 simulations using modified potential flow solver with dissipation in part i a rankine source time domain linear potential flow solver implemented using the higher order boundary element method hobem is described together with adjustments necessary to incorporate the modified boundary conditions with additional dissipation terms in the subsequent sub sections here gap free surface responses and forcings on the two barges calculated using the modified potential solver referred to hereafter as the dissipative time domain dtd solver are compared with corresponding results from the viscous solver and the frequency domain potential flow results of sun et al 2010 recalling that the dtd loadcase matrix table 2 is larger than the viscous loadcases matrix table 1 the linear trend lines shown in fig 5 a to d are used to calculate the vortex shedding dissipation coefficient values via linear interpolation between two known data points skin friction dissipation coefficients are obtained using linear interpolation between two relevant viscous data points of fig 6 2 3 1 gap free surface response fig 7 shows the gap free surface responses from the viscous and dtd simulations non dimensionalised against the incident wave amplitude a against incident wave frequencies in the viscous simulations the free surface elevation is given at the position of the numerical wave probe described in section 2 1 in the dtd simulations the elevation is monitored at the same longitudinal coordinate x 0 01 m but the transverse monitoring location is slightly shifted to be on the side shell of the wave ward barge as an additional check dtd is used to calculate the fully inviscid resonant gap responses at each gap distance by setting the coefficient values to zero these data points are denoted as undamped dtd in the figure good agreement can be observed between these points and the results of sun et al 2010 obtained using a frequency domain potential flow solver thus providing verification of dtd for these undamped cases the figure also show consistency across all three solvers in terms of the incident wave frequencies at which primary resonant gap free surface responses occur results from both the viscous and dtd simulations suggest that the incident frequencies of gap resonant response decrease with increasing gap distance consistent with observations of sun et al 2010 in general fig 7 shows good agreement between the gap response magnitudes obtained using the viscous solver and those of dtd demonstrating the latter s likely ability to provide significant improvement over conventional linear potential flow in predicting gap free surface response over a range of frequencies providing one has estimates of the viscous dissipation coefficients at a much smaller number of frequencies fig 8 a d plot the instantaneous free surface elevation profiles as calculated by the viscous solver in one resonant oscillation cycle for each of the four gap distances due to length wise symmetry the responses are shown for only half of the barges from midship to the forward end for these plots the free surface elevations are sampled at 1 s intervals the longitudinal elevations are shown in the upper subplots while the transverse elevations sampled at three transverse planes across the gap are shown in the three lower subplots together with the longitudinal location of the transverse plane the approximate longitudinal location of these three planes are near midships at about halfway between the gap opening and midships and near the gap opening from the figures it can be observed that the gap free surface response shapes along the gap are the same for all gap distances with the largest response values occurring near midships the longitudinal response values decrease monotonically toward the gap openings in a manner similar to the sinusoidal first mode shapes identified in sun et al 2010 across the gap the free surface responses are generally uniform with small and relatively insignificant variations these transverse response shapes suggest that the gap water column oscillates vertically in a manner similar to a rigid body analogous to the piston mode mode 0 described in molin 2001 in the subsequent paragraphs the longitudinal and transverse response mode shapes will be designated as m n respectively following the definition used in sun et al 2010 fig 9 a d compare the dtd prediction of longitudinal gap free surface response envelopes of each gap distance at resonance with the corresponding output from the viscous solver the transverse response envelopes are not shown given the earlier observation that they are generally straight horizontal lines across the gap i e piston modes the figures show generally good agreement between the two solvers in terms of response envelopes for gap distances between 8 m and 18 m discrepancies between the response envelopes obtained from dtd and the viscous solver are more noticeable at the troughs than at the crest with dtd predicting lower troughs at 4 m gap distance the discrepancies are larger at the crest around midships and at the trough around the gap outlet with the viscous solver predicting a higher crest and a shallower trough the discrepancies are likely to be due to nonlinearities developing in the resonance gap free surface response similar to nonlinear waves where the peaks become steeper and the troughs become shallower than those of an airy wave this nonlinearity is allowed to develop in the viscous flow solver since no explicit boundary conditions are imposed on the free surface unlike the linearised free surface boundary conditions of the dtd which result in envelopes that are symmetric about the zero mean fig 10 plots the longitudinal and transverse free surface elevation profiles calculated using the viscous solver for the 8 m gap distance under excitation from incident waves of 0 70 rad s and sampled at a rate of 1hz a second resonant peak with the gap free surface response approximately 3 the incident wave amplitude is observed in the potential flow results of sun et al 2010 at this incident wave frequency the effect of viscous dissipation can be deduced from the fact that the viscous solver predicts a maximum free surface elevation of about 1 2 the incident wave amplitude this occurs at the around midships a second local maximum can be observed at approximately 90 m from amidships middle lower subplot where the largest free surface elevation at this location is approximately equal to the incident wave amplitude the response shapes suggest a response in the 3 0 mode fig 11 a and b plot the longitudinal and transverse free surface elevation profiles at gap distances of 4 m and 8 m under incident waves of 0 8 rad s referring to fig 7 these two loadcases are located close to the higher third frequency peaks for both gap distances the corresponding inviscid free surface responses at this frequency are both approximately 2 6 the incident wave amplitudes the plots suggest that the longitudinal responses at the two gap distances are of mode shape 5 0 in the transverse direction the responses are of piston modes the maximum free surface elevations at the 4 m and 8 m gap distances are approximately equal and have values around 0 9 the incident wave height respectively these responses are lower than those obtained by sun et al 2010 using potential flow once again indicating the dissipative influence of viscosity 2 3 2 sway forces fig 12 compares the sway forces obtained using the viscous solver and dtd against the frequency domain potential flow results of sun et al 2010 for the four gap distances the sway forces are normalised against ρ g a where ρ represents water density and g represents gravitational acceleration good agreement is observed between the three solvers in terms of the incident wave frequencies at which peak sway forcing occur for both wave and leeward barges respectively referred to as up and downwave boxes in the subsequent plots results from all three solvers indicate that resonant sway forcing frequencies increase with decreasing gap distances similarly to the free surface elevations there is also reasonably good agreement between the results from dtd and the viscous solver in terms of the sway forcing magnitudes on each of the two barges a slight over prediction of forcing on the upwave barge at incident wave frequencies higher than the resonant frequency of each gap distance can be observed across the same frequency range there is better agreement between the two sets of sway force predictions on the leeward barge downwave box compared to the wave ward barge upwave box in terms of peak values there is a slight under prediction of sway forces on the wave ward barge at 4 m gap distance and on the leeward barge at 18 m gap distance by the dtd there is also a small over prediction of sway forces on the leeward barge at 12 m gap distance the resonant peak sway forcing values obtained from the viscous solver and dtd show an opposite trend compared to the potential flow results of sun et al 2010 it can be seen from the figure that the former two solvers which account for viscous dissipation predict that the normalised resonant sway forcings decrease with gap distances for both barges in contrast the conventional potential flow results show an opposite trend that decreasing gap distance will increase sway forcing also the rate at which resonant peak sway forcings change with gap distance is different between the conventional potential flow results and the two solvers that account for viscous effects the rate of increase observed in the conventional potential flow predictions is faster than the rate of decrease observed in the results from the latter two solvers interestingly the sway force responses calculated using dtd at 8 m 12 m and 18 m gap distances show secondary resonant peaks at 0 69 rad s 0 67 rad s and 0 65 rad s consistent with the frequency domain potential flow results of sun et al 2010 however the dtd calculations for the 4 m gap distance did not show any peak in sway forcing at the incident wave frequency of 0 73 rad s unlike the frequency domain potential flow results a possible explanation may be that the secondary resonant peak at 4 m gap distance is shifted to a slightly different frequency due to viscous effects and there are insufficient data points from the viscous and dtd simulations to identify the shfited peak 2 3 3 heave forces fig 13 shows the variation of normalised heave forces against ρ g a with incident wave frequencies at the four gap distances calculated using the viscous solver and dtd together with the corresponding potential flow results of sun et al 2010 the figure shows reasonably good agreement between the heave forces obtained using dtd and the viscous solver for both the wave and leeward barges indicating that the viscous damping of heave forces has been captured by dtd this is evident from the significantly lower heave forcing values on the waveward upwave barge at the heave resonant frequencies predicted by sun et al 2010 similar damping effects acting on the troughs of the heave forcing curves of the upwave barges are also captured generally the inclusion of viscous effects results in the normalised heave forcings on the upwave barges decreasing with increasing incident wave frequencies amplitudes of normalised peak heave forces obtained using solvers with viscous dissipation i e dtd and the viscous solver decrease with gap distance in contrast with conventional potential flow predictions where the amplitudes increase with decreasing gap distance similar to the variation of resonant sway force response with gap distance at incident wave frequencies outside of resonance the normalised heave forces predicted by both the viscous solver and dtd agree well with those predicted using conventional potential flow across all four gap distances 2 3 4 roll moments fig 14 shows the normalised roll moments exerted on the barges obtained from the viscous solver and dtd against incident wave frequencies the figure only includes the conventional potential flow predictions of normalised roll moments at 18 m gap distance from sun et al 2010 in that paper potential flow predictions of roll moments at other gap distances were recognised to be unrealistically large due to the inviscid nature of potential flow models and were thus omitted the figure indicates generally good agreement between the roll moments obtained using the viscous solver and dtd at 18 m gap distance reasonably good agreement is also observed between the results from all three solvers 2 3 5 nonlinear sway and roll forcings at low incident wave frequencies it was observed from the viscous simulation results that nonlinear sway and roll forcings were induced at low incident wave frequencies this phenomenon is particularly obvious at an incident wave frequency of 0 30 rad s for a gap distance of 8 m fig 15 compares the time histories of sway forcings on the two adjacent barges for this loadcase with the corresponding differences in free surface elevations between the port and starboard sides of each barge note that the free surface elevation values are non dimensionalised against the incident wave amplitudes it can be observed from the figure that the time history of normalised sway forces is similar to the variation of arthwartship differences in free surface elevations indicating that horizontal forces exerted on the adjacent barges are dominated by the differences in hydrostatic head between the two sides of each barge fig 16 plots the normalised roll moments on the two barges at a gap distance of 8 m under excitation from incident waves of 0 30 rad s together with the athwartship differences in free surface elevations and the squares of relative tangential velocities on each of the barges in this figure the difference in free surface elevations is scaled by 1000 in addition to being non dimensionalised against incident wave amplitude similarly the square of tangential roll velocity has been multiplied by ρ g a and plotted against the right hand side vertical axis the scaling of these two quantities is carried out so that all three quantities can be shown on the same plot the relative tangential velocities are calculated by first taking the velocity components at a small distance from the up and downstream bilge corners of the wave and leeward barges taking the sum of squares of the lateral athwartship and vertical components and finally taking the difference between the up and downstream values of each barge it can be observed from the figure that the roll moments are influenced by both the athwartship differences in free surface elevations and the squares of relative tangential velocities on each of the barges 3 hydrodynamic loads and gap free surface responses on side by side barges with rounded bilge corners in order to verify that the proposed analysis framework can also be applied to study gap resonance when the bilge curvature is modified the hydrodynamic interactions between two side by side identical barges with rounded bilge corners are investigated at four bilge radius values this is carried out by using the fixed rectangular barges from the previous section and rounding off the bilge corners with the gap distance kept at a constant of 8 m for the investigations carried out in this section viscous simulations are first carried out across a range of incident wave frequencies to check that the incident wave frequencies at which resonant gap response occurs for each bilge radius are consistent with the values estimated using a semi empirical formula subsequently dissipation coefficients are calculated using the viscous flow field data for the gap resonant loadcases of each bilge radius modified potential flow simulations are carried out using these coefficient values and the resulting resonant gap free surface responses and forcings are compared with the corresponding outputs obtained using the viscous solver 3 1 viscous simulations 3 1 1 loadcases and mesh setup moradi et al 2015 investigated the influence of bilge corner radii on gap free surface response in two dimensions using openfoam and proposed a semi empirical relationship between the gap resonant frequency and the bilge radii the relationship shown in equation 5 for reference is used in this research to estimate the resonant incident wave frequencies of gap response 5 ω g a p g b g 0 05 r b d t 0 45 r t 0 45 r where ω g a p represents the incident wave frequency at which the lowest i e first gap resonance response occurs b g represents the gap distance r represents the radius of the bilge corners b represents the barges breadth d represents the water depth and t represents the barges draught table 3 shows the loadcases investigated in this research using the viscous flow solver described in part i the resonant gap response frequencies estimated using equation 5 are marked with an asterisk the computational domain shown in fig 1a is used with local refinement of cells around the curved bilge radii similar to section 2 mesh independence checks are carried out to determine the mesh size required to capture the gap resonance response it is found from the study that meshes of about 3 million cells would be sufficient these meshes are used for simulations that produced the subsequent viscous results 3 1 2 results and discussion fig 17 a plots the steady state gap free surface response amplitude non dimensionalised against the incident wave amplitude against incident wave frequencies location of the numerical wave probe remains unchanged from the earlier viscous simulations with rectangular barges the figure shows that the gap resonance frequencies increase monotonically with the radii of bilge corners it can also be observed that the resonant gap free surface response first increases as the bilge corner is rounded from a radius of 1 m to 4 m before decreasing as the radius is further rounded from 4 m to 6 m the maximum gap resonant response occurring at 4 m bilge radius corresponding to a bilge radius to breadth ratio of 0 087 is just under 8 times the incident wave amplitude the variation in the value of gap resonant response with bilge radius is consistent with the observations of moradi et al 2015 albeit with the following differences i in the present research the resonant response has a peak at a smaller bilge radius to breadth ratio 0 087 compared to 0 1 and ii the resonance gap free surface response amplitudes are approximately 70 smaller in the present research the increase in gap resonant response between bilge radii of 1 m to 4 m can be explained by the fact that rounder bilge corners reduce the adverse pressure gradients thus reducing the vortex shedding action resulting in a larger gap free surface response when the bilge radii are further increased to 6 m a decrease in gap resonance response is observed this may be due to an inviscid effect noted by sun et al 2010 based on their potential flow models of rectangular barges sharp bilge corners with the same length and breadth as those investigated in this research which relates to the influence of draught on gap response the authors observed that the magnitude of the lowest frequency peak first resonance peak increases significantly as the draught of the adjacent vessels increases at constant water depth suggesting that the increase may be associated with the greater degree of flow confinement due to deeper draughts in moradi et al 2015 it is found that an increase in bilge corner radius can be interpreted as a decrease in the effective draught meaning that the increase in bilge radius reduces the extent of flow confinement thus reducing the gap resonant response the relative influence of decreasing vortex shedding diminishes with increasing bilge corner radii as the bilge corners are rounded from radii of 4 m to 6 m the reduction in flow confinement effect becomes more dominant resulting in an overall decrease in resonant gap response in order to verify the influence of the flow confinement effect on gap resonant response the resonant load cases are modelled once more using conventional linear potential flow the variation of gap free surface responses with bilge radii is shown in fig 17 b it should be mentioned here that the value at 0 m radii sharp keel barges are extracted from the frequency domain potential calculations of sun et al 2010 the figure shows that resonant gap free surface response values decrease monotonically with increasing bilge radii these results demonstrate that the inviscid flow interaction effect acts in an opposite manner compared to the viscous vortex shedding action i e as the bilge corners become rounder viscous dissipation reduces thus increasing gap resonant response the inviscid effects also decrease with rounder bilge corners but act to increase the gap resonant responses this appears to be the first demonstration of the opposing influences of the inviscid confinement effect and vortex shedding action on gap resonant response however further investigations across a wider set of geometric and wave parameters will be necessary for this observation to be conclusively established 3 1 3 dissipated energy components at gap resonance the amount of incident wave energy dissipated via vortex shedding action and skin friction losses under gap resonance conditions are calculated using the approach presented in part i and plotted in fig 18 a and b as a visual reference the non dimensionalised gap free surface resonant responses are also included in the plots it can be seen from the figures that the largest rates of energy loss through vortex shedding action and skin friction occurred at bilge radii of 4 m which is where the gap free surface resonant response is the highest by substituting the calculated values of vortex shedding and skin friction energy loss into equations 3 and 4 dissipation coefficient values to be used in the modified potential flow solver are calculated and plotted in fig 19 a and b fig 19 a shows that the vortex shedding coefficient and the gap free surface resonant response are inversely related between bilge radii of 1 m to 4 m this observation is consistent with the fact that rounder bilge corners reduce the effect of vortex shedding action on gap free surface response resulting in an increase in the latter as the bilge corner is further rounded to 6 m the vortex shedding coefficient increases the apparent contradiction between increased roundness of the bilge and increase in vortex shedding coefficient from 4 m to 6 m can be explained by noting that the right hand side of equation 3 is linearly related to the energy loss component but has an inverse quadratic relationship with free surface elevation given that the viscous simulation results presented earlier showed that both vortex shedding energy loss and gap free surface response decrease by about 30 38 when the bilge radii were increased to 6 m it is therefore reasonable to expect that the effect of a decrease in gap free surface response will exceed the corresponding effect in energy loss through vortex shedding fig 19 b shows that the variation of skin friction dissipation coefficient with bilge radius generally follows that of the gap free surface response this is because higher gap responses imply that the gap water column oscillates at higher velocities thus increasing the skin friction coefficient values 3 2 modified potential flow simulations modified potential flow dtd simulations of resonant loadcases at the various bilge radii are carried out using the dissipation coefficient values plotted in fig 19 a and b the boundary element mesh used in the simulations of section 2 3 at 8 m gap distance is modified by rounding the sharp bilge corner to the radius of curvature being analysed with local refinement of elements made around the bilge radii mesh independence checks have been carried out to ensure that the meshes at each bilge radius are sufficiently fine to capture the gap free surface response fig 20 a and b compare the gap free surface responses and sway forcings obtained using the viscous solver with the corresponding values from dtd the respective maximum discrepancies between the dtd and viscous results are 4 3 and 4 9 this can be regarded as good agreement especially given the number of simplifying assumptions made in the analysis framework such as the use of time and spaced averaged energy loss values when calculating the dissipation coefficients in fig 21 a and b the peak values of normalised heave and roll forcings on the side by side barges at each set of bilge radii as predicted by dtd are compared with those from the viscous solver in line with the gap responses and swap forcings reasonably good agreement between the dtd and viscous results can similarly be observed with dtd over predicting the forcings on the upwave barge and under predicting them on the leeward barge the maximum discrepancy between the two sets of numerical predictions is 5 7 it should be noted that for the heave forces fig 21 a the data points have been obtained at the gap resonance frequencies which may not be the frequencies of maximum heave forcings fig 21 b shows that the differences in roll moments between the dtd and viscous results are smaller for the wave ward barge compared to the leeward barge similar to sway and heave the largest difference between the dtd and viscous results occur at bilge radii of 6 m 11 7 followed by 2 m 8 1 and 1 m 7 9 the occurrence of the largest percentage difference in results at 6 m bilge radii can be explained by the fact that the values of normalised roll forcings are roughly half of those at 1 m and 2 m bilge radii thus even with smaller differences in absolute normalised roll moment values the percentage differences will be higher the relatively large difference in roll forcings at 1 m and 2 m may also be due to the difference in gap free surface resonance response predictions observed earlier this is explained as follows firstly differences in gap free surface responses between dtd and viscous predictions will result in discrepancies in the hydrostatic forces and the associated centres of force secondly the velocity amplitudes at which the gap water column oscillates are also affected which in turn affect the dynamic loads acting at the submerged portions of the barges the larger difference in roll forcings at 1 m and 2 m bilge radii compared to 4 m and 6 m are likely to be due to a combination of these two effects 3 3 discussion on possible industry applications and limitations of proposed numerical analysis framework hydrodynamic analyses of side by side vessels is often carried out across a range of parameters such as gap distance hull forms and water depth the importance of including viscous dissipation when carrying out such parametric studies has been highlighted in the literature much of which is reviewed in part i in order to illustrate the advantage of using the proposed numerical analysis framework and as an example of how the analysis framework proposed in this research can be used to efficiently carry out such studies without the exclusion of viscous dissipation consider the trend lines of vortex shedding coefficients against incident wave frequencies shown in fig 5 for all four gap distances the gradients and vertical intercepts of the trend lines can be re plotted to show how these values vary with gap distance as shown in fig 22 these plots can subsequently be used to generate new relationships between the vortex shedding coefficients and the incident wave frequencies at intermediate gap distances not covered by viscous simulations although the relationships of skin friction coefficients with incident wave frequencies across the gap distances are nonlinear a three dimensional plane can be constructed based on the data points plotted in fig 6 so that coefficients at intermediate gap distances can be obtained via interpolation across this plane thus by carrying out a limited set of viscous simulations at certain gap distances and at selected incident wave frequencies relationships between the vortex shedding and skin friction coefficients and the environmental parameters for the relevant side by side configurations can be obtained these relationships can be used for the calculation of dissipation coefficients at intermediate points across the full range of parameters being studied the use of the modified dissipative potential flow model in combination with these estimated coefficients would be significantly more efficient when analysing a matrix of loadcases over a wide range of parameters compared with using a viscous solver for all the loadcases in the matrix this can be considered the main advantage of the proposed numerical analysis framework some simplifying assumptions have been made in the development of numerical analysis framework giving rise to limitations that should be noted these limitations also serve to provide the boundaries of applicability should this framework be used beyond its intended use at the early stages of a design cycle these limitations are discussed as follows no wave overturning and breaking it is worth reiterating that side by side operations are limited to benign operating conditions when incident waveheights are around 1 2 m from the viscous analysis carried out in this research and from published model test data e g molin et al 2009 the maximum gap responses range from about 3 to 5 times of the incident wave height under an incident wave height of 2 m this will result in a maximum gap response of up to 10 m since the length of the entrapped wave will be almost equal to the length of the gap around 300 m the wave steepness will only be around 1 30 notwithstanding the differences between ocean and partially entrapped gap wave systems this steepness value will be well within the bounds of a non breaking wave effect of vortex shedding on body motions not modelled the present research only looked into the energy dissipation effect of vortex shedding on the gap response by fixing the vessels in space as such the influence of vortex shedding on body motions has not been investigated and could be developed in a future work where the approach proposed in part i for splitting the total wave energy into components may be applied to study the appropriate allocation of energy to gap response reduction and to drive body motions viscous dissipation effects limited to first order terms the additional viscous dissipation terms in the modified potential flow solver are derived through consideration of the work done by the linear first order terms higher order effects are thus not accounted for in this regard it is recommended that additional terms based on work done against second or higher order effects should be developed in a future work linear responses the dtd model developed in this research uses linearised free surface boundary conditions that are unable to capture the development of nonlinear effects such as the steepening of wave crests and flattening of troughs this is thought to have resulted in slight discrepancies between the gap free surface envelope shapes predicted using dtd and the viscous solver 4 conclusion results presented in this paper demonstrated that the analysis framework developed in this research and presented in part i chua et al 2017 can be used to carry out hydrodynamic investigations into the gap free surface responses and forcings on side by side barges this is based on two sets of investigations using identical side by side barges with rectangular hull forms fixed in space and subjected to regular waves in the beam seas direction the first set of investigations concerns the influence of gap distance and incident wave frequencies on gap free surface response and forcings on the two barges following the framework presented in part i viscous simulations are first carried out and the flow field data obtained is used to calculate dissipation coefficients which are subsequently used in modified potential flow simulations the loadcase matrix for the latter simulations is larger than the former due to the relative computational efficiency of potential flow models the vortex shedding dissipation coefficients are fitted to linear trend lines through which coefficient values at other intermediate incident wave frequencies not analysed by viscous simulations can be obtained skin friction dissipation coefficients at those frequencies are calculated by directly interpolating between two viscous data points the good agreement in gap free surface response and forcings between the viscous and modified potential flow results obtained in this paper supports the proposed solution strategy where a limited set of viscous simulations is used to estimate the relationships between the coefficients and a certain parameter e g incident wave frequencies gap distances at intermediate parameter values interpolated coefficient values would be used in addition to the advantage of reducing reliance on model test data this solution strategy would be more cost effective than experiments or running the full matrix of loadcases using viscous simulations in the second set of investigations the analysis framework is applied to investigate the influence of bilge curvature on gap resonance similar good agreement between the viscous and modified potential flow results is obtained further demonstrating that the proposed analysis framework can be applied to hull with faired geometries an interesting observation made in these investigations is the different manner in which inviscid and viscous effects influence the gap free surface response increasing the radii of the bilge corners decreases the influence of viscous effects increasing the gap response at the same time the extent to which a given water volume is being confined due to the presence of side by side hulls is reduced and this inviscid flow confinement effect in turn acts to decrease gap free surface resonant response with increasing bilge corner radii based on the work carried out in this research some areas for future work have been identified and are listed as follows extension of the modified time domain dissipative potential flow model to include vessel motions such that energy dissipation through vessel motions can also be quantified and taken into account using the approach presented in part i for splitting the energy component investigation of the influence of relative wave directions such as in quartering seas and having one vessel at a slight angle to another extension of the framework to include second order effects investigation of scaling relations for the energy dissipation components and the corresponding modified potential flow dissipation coefficients lastly it should be noted that the viscous analyses described in section 2 have been carried out using a finite volume solver whose model scale predictions of gap response have been verified in part i with both experimental data and results from a different numerical solver based on the finite element method similarly calculations of gap resonant response between adjacent barges with sharp bilge corners at each of the four gap distances using the time domain potential model without the dissipative coefficients i e convential inviscid potential flow have also been compared with published results obtained using a frequency domain potential flow solver sun et al 2010 while these verifications give confidence that the analysis framework proposed here is able to better predict the gap responses and global forcings on the two adjacent fixed vessels the extension to moving bodies and direct comparisons with experiments should still be carried out methods to experimentally verify the energy lost through vortex shedding and skin friction effects should also be developed which in turn will help to either validate the use of the empirical kato s formula for calculating skin friction losses between side by side vessels

23202,unstable hydrodynamic slug flow is extensively encountered in marine risers resulting in internal flow induced vibration which is quite different with the vortex induced vibration caused by a cross flow experiments were performed in an air water test loop to study the internal slug flow induced vibration of a free hanging flexible riser with aspect ratio the ratio of the length to the diameter of a riser of 158 a non intrusive technique of high speed imaging method was employed to record the vibration displacements of the riser model and the flow regime of two phase mixture in the riser simultaneously the results show that an in plane vibration is created by the internal slug flow and the responses along the two directions in the plane are interdependent to each other in the considered gas liquid ratio the ratio of air flow rate to water flow rate the second order mode dominates the response the hydrodynamic behaviors of slug flow including the gas liquid ratio liquid slug length and superficial velocity affect the local pressure fluctuation and hence influence the vibration amplitude the fluid structure interaction is reflected from the same frequencies presenting in the vibration and pressure fluctuation keywords flow induced vibration gas liquid two phase flow unstable hydrodynamic slug flow liquid slugs flexible riser 1 introduction gas liquid flow within transmission pipelines has been the topic of extensive investigations due to its fundamental and practical significance different steady flow regimes for the two phase flow in a horizontal or vertical pipe have been classified mandhane et al 1974 mishima and ishii 1984 among these flow regimes slug flow has attracted increasing attention because of its violent behavior and its extensive encounter in many engineering fields such as petroleum transportation heat exchangers and nuclear power generation miwa et al 2015 liu et al 2012 the fluctuating characteristics of slug flow including momentum pressure and void fraction fluctuations excite unstable hydrodynamic forces on pipes inducing the structural vibration this phenomenon is known as flow induced vibration fiv particularly resonance may occur when the predominant response frequency coincides with the natural frequency of piping system resulting in serious consequences like structural fatigue and failure therefore understanding slug flow induced vibration is indispensable for designing a safely operable piping system and avoiding the structural damage in the past few decades external flow induced vibration has been studied extensively williamson and govardhan 2004 jauvtis and williamson 2004 zhu and gao 2017 zhu et al 2018 for flow past a bluff body vortices shed alternately at either side of the bluff body give birth to the structural vibration called vortex induced vibration viv the mechanism of internal gas liquid two phase flow induced vibration could be quite different due to the differences in flow orientation and differences in fluid properties density viscosity and surface tension etc however there has been very few research performed on this subject to date pipe turning elements such as elbows and tees are considered as one of the major sources for causing vibration the change of flow direction causes the impact force of two phase mixture acting on the pipe surfaces miwa et al 2015 severe in plane vibration was observed by riverin and pettigrew 2007 for a u shaped piping element excited by internal two phase flow the amplitude and frequency of measured force fluctuation increased with velocity for a given volumetric quality cargnelutti et al 2009 conducted air water experiments on 6 mm elbows with radius of r d 2 7 and 4 2 where r is the curvature radius and d is the diameter they confirmed that the highest force occurs in slug flow regime the force fluctuating amplitude is several orders higher than that in single phase flows with similar velocities the maximum slug flow induced force acting on a 90 horizontal elbow was measured by tay and thorpe 2004 the tests revealed that the liquid viscosity and surface tension have no significant effect on the hydrodynamic force based on the experimental data few models were proposed to predict the force magnitude and its dominant frequency tay and thorpe 2004 riverin and pettigrew 2007 cargenlutti et al 2010 although the flow induced forces were discussed in above studies the structural vibration response displacement was not measured and analyzed until recently the vibration displacement of a horizontal pipe excited by internal slug flow at a fixed air superficial velocity was considered by al hashimy et al 2016 it was found that the vibration displacement increased gradually with increasing of water superficial velocity while the predominant frequency was reduced for the complicated flow behavior and limited number of experiments the internal slug fiv has not been thoroughly understood additionally the pipe vibration may in turn affect the internal two phase flow structures hibiki and ishii 1998 it is a complicated unsteady fluid structure interaction that still is an open topic in offshore oil and gas engineering risers are necessity for transporting multiphase hydrocarbons from subsea wellheads to central production platforms malekzadeh et al 2012 moreover flexible risers are often deployed as a free hanging catenary type the slug flow in such curved flexible risers with large aspect ratio the ratio of the length to the diameter of a riser l d where l is the riser length and d is its diameter may create more complicated vibrations the primary aim of this work is therefore to examine and explain the slug flow induced vibration of a free hanging flexible riser at different gas liquid ratio the ratio of air flow rate to water flow rate q g q l where q g and q l are air flow rate and water flow rate respectively through modelling experiments high speed imaging technology is employed to simultaneously record the two phase flow structure in the riser model and the vibration displacements of the riser the vibration response pressure fluctuation and liquid slug length are discussed the rest of this paper is organized in the following manner in sec 2 the experimental facilities and methods are presented the experimental results are then discussed in sec 3 finally major conclusions are drawn in sec 4 2 experimental facilities and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experiments were carried out in a test loop arranged in a re circulating water channel of state key laboratory of oil and gas reservoir geology and exploitation at southwest petroleum university swpu china the schematic of the test loop is depicted in fig 1 as mentioned in the above section the investigation on internal slug fiv is the objective of this study the external fiv will be considered in the further work the layout of test loop in the empty water flume is to facilitate future comparison as shown in fig 1 the test facility consists of four main parts the test loop fluid supply separation tank and measurement and control devices the test loop comprises a 20 m long horizontal pipeline followed by a 95 cm long l 60 cm high h flexible riser both the horizontal pipeline and flexible riser are made of transparent silica gel tube allowing visual observation of the flow behavior in the pipeline riser system the external and internal diameters of the pipeline riser system are d 6 mm and d i 4 mm respectively thus the aspect ratio l d of the riser is 158 the main parameters of the flexible riser model are listed in table 1 the riser hanged in air deployed as a catenary configuration in a vertical plane xoz plane the two ends of the riser were fixed at the flume floor and at a support frame respectively in order to facilitate the displacement analysis the origin of the coordinate system is located at the inlet of the riser the configuration of the stationary riser is expressed as 1 z x 0 4521 cosh 2 212 x 1 where x and z are the horizontal and vertical coordinates in xoz plane respectively dry air was supplied from a 20 l buffer vessel which was connected to a rotary compressor with a maximum flow rate of 1 2 l min at room temperature and atmospheric pressure condition 101325pa 293 15 k the volumetric flux of air flow was measured by a float flowmeter with a maximum measurement capacity of 1 2 l min and an accuracy of 1 a 0 5 m3 stainless steel tank was employed for water storage and gas liquid separation water was supplied by a centrifugal pump with a maximum flow rate of 1 5 l min a relatively constant volumetric flow rate can be achieved by manually adjusting the opening of control valves on the supply pipes the control valves were located directly downstream of the water pump or buffer vessel the water flow rate into the test loop was measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter with a maximum capacity of 1 5 l min and an accuracy of 0 5 the air flow rate ranges from 0 3 l min to 0 6 l min and the water flow rate is 0 306 0 6 l min the corresponding superficial air velocity v sg at standard conditions ranges from 0 398 m s to 0 796 m s and the superficial water velocity v sl is 0 406 0 796 m s thus the gas liquid ratio q g q l is from 0 5 to 1 827 which is commonly encountered in practice the experimental cases are summarized in table 2 where v m is the mixture velocity expressed as 2 v m q g q l a where q g and q l are the air and water flow rates respectively and a is the cross section area of the riser the air and water flow were gathered via a y junction mixer connected to the long horizontal pipeline a slug flow was formed before its entrance into the flexible riser then the riser discharged the two phase flow into the separator operating at atmospheric pressure in the separator air and water were separated by gravity then the gas was vented to the open air while the liquid flowed down to the storage tank two pressure transducers model ypt1000 t02 accuracy 0 1 were mounted at the riser base and at the top of the riser the pressure fluctuation was monitored with sampling frequency of 100 hz 2 2 measurement techniques and data processing methods strain gauges and accelerometers have been widely used in previous studies huera huarte and bearman 2009a 2009b lee and allen 2010 huera huarte et al 2014 chen et al 2015 to measure the vibration displacement of cylindrical structures however these instruments should be mounted on the structural surface bringing about a certain change in properties including mass stiffness and damping in our previous study on vortex induced vibration of a curved flexible riser zhu et al 2016 a non intrusive technique of high speed imaging method was proposed and successfully applied in recording the external fiv displacements furthermore high speed imaging method is often used to capture flow regimes in transparent pipes therefore the vibration displacements of the riser and the flow structure in the riser were monitored simultaneously by high speed cameras in the internal fiv experiments the water in the storage tank was dyed black by ink in order to clearly identify the liquid slugs in the riser one high speed camera model baumer hxg20 was pointed right at the riser plane recording the flow regime as well as the vibration displacement in the xoz plane another camera was placed under the riser to record the vibration displacement along the y direction as shown in fig 1 thirty three black markings with height of 4 mm and center to center spacing of 24 mm were marked along the riser length the displacements of the 33 markings along the riser were recorded by high speed cameras with sampling frequency of 100 frames per second the image size of each frame is 2048 1088 pixels with resolution of 3 02 pixels per mm the measuring apparatuses were calibrated prior to the experiments and the air and water were allowed to flow for about 20min prior to data acquisition in each test the image was recorded for 2min each camera stored 12000 pictures arrayed in time series the displacements of markings were extracted from the adjacent images by comparing the position of markings as shown in fig 2 the coordinate system in the recorded images was defined firstly then the displacement represented by each picture element was obtained by the means of pixel calibration i e the height of each marking in the images corresponded to the actual size of 4 mm zhu et al 2016 the moment invariants hu 1962 were employed to pick up the character of the images then the markings in each image were recognized after that the vibration response was easily got by converting the translational pixels to actual displacements finally time histories of vibration displacements were obtained via the image post processing of the time series of pictures 2 3 decay tests decay tests were performed prior to the fiv experiments in order to determine the natural frequency of the riser hanging in air and the system damping ratio as the riser transmits gas liquid two phase flow in experiments the system mass varies with the gas liquid ratio the riser fully filled with stationary water was used in the decay tests then the actual natural frequency in each gas liquid ratio is extrapolated according to the specific mass of fluid in the riser expressed as 3 f n n 2 l t m n 2 π 2 e i l 2 m where f n is the natural frequency n represents the vibration order number l is the riser length t is the tension of the riser e is the elastic modulus i is the inertial moment of the riser and m is the system mass including the riser mass and the mass of internal fluid the free attenuation response of the riser was recorded after imposing an initial displacement fig 3 plots the response of the riser midspan 17 marking the concerned parameters were achieved by fast fourier transform fft as listed in table 2 the first order and second order natural frequencies of the riser filled with stationary water are 1 6097 hz and 3 163 hz respectively and the system damping ratio the ratio of actual damping to critical damping is 0 01774 3 results and discussions 3 1 vibration response unlike the out of plane viv caused by external currents zhu et al 2016 it is observed from fig 4 b that the internal two phase fiv mainly occurs in the xoz plane and the lateral vibration along the y direction could be neglected which is consistent with the observation by riverin and pettigrew 2007 and al hashimy et al 2016 the flow orientation is the main cause the instantaneous vibration shape of the riser during one second at q g q l 1 322 is plotted in fig 4 a the dash line represents the initial position of the stationary riser when the two phase flow passes through the riser an obvious sag occurs due to the gravity of two phase fluid it is clearly seen that the instantaneous shape of the riser varies over time with different amplitudes along the length the figure eight response envelope illustrates the in plane vibration is dominated by the second order mode a node exhibiting the minima of the envelope is located at 21 marking a little lower than the midspan 17 marking since the flow direction of the two phase fluid varies along the riser length a centrifugal force is imposed on the riser extrados it is interesting to find that the node appears at the place where the curvature of the riser is the largest one indicating the maximum centrifugal force occurs there the vertical distance between the node and the initial position of the riser quantitatively depicts the sag of the flexible riser which is 1 41d in this case from the instantaneous shape of the riser we can observe the displacements in the two directions are interdependent to each other owing to the catenary configuration if the upper part of the riser above the node shown in fig 4 a has a positive displacement along the x axis the lower part below the node would move upwards along the z axis while the negative x directional displacement of the upper part is accompanied by the downward movement of the lower part therefore it is impossible for this flexible riser to vibrate in the first order i e the in plane vibration of curved riser at least is the second order it is confirmed from fig 4 b which plots the spanwise evolution of the vibration amplitude along the riser length both the horizontal amplitude and vertical amplitude have two peaks appearing at 12 marking and 26 marking respectively the peak value of horizontal amplitude at 12 marking is about 1 5 times larger than that in the z direction while the vertical amplitude at 26 marking is 2 3 times as large as the horizontal amplitude it is clearly seen that the intersection of the two curves in fig 4 b is just the node 21 marking the rms vibration amplitude of the node is not zero indicating that more than one mode participates in the vibration as shown in fig 5 due to the participant of multiple frequencies the riser undergoes non constant amplitude response three frequencies roughly double increased in sequence involve in the vibration and the values are very close to each other in the two directions it further indicates the responses along the two directions are related the pressure fluctuations of the two monitored points are depicted in the bottom row the pressures at the bottom and top of the riser mainly fluctuate in the same normalized frequency of f p d v m 0 0036 f p is the fluctuating frequency of pressure which is also the same as the minimum vibration frequency f osc d v m f osc is the vibration frequency it demonstrates the fluctuating characteristics of two phase flow affect the fiv miwa et al 2015 apart from the minimum frequency the two other frequencies are close to the first natural frequency f 1x d v m f 1z d v m 0 0091 and the second natural frequency f 2x d v m f 2z d v m 0 0186 respectively therefore the riser eventually vibrates in the second order although the vibration frequencies at different markings along the length are the same in the value the power spectral densities psd are different the marking undergoing the vigorous vibration shows the relatively large psd indicating the energy extracted from the slug flow is relatively great fig 6 depicts the trajectories of representative markings at q g q l 1 322 the vibration orbits are associated with the phase angle φ between the x direction response and the z direction response as the frequency ratio in the two directions is 1 1 the 180 π phase difference leads to the linear orbits of 7 marking 12 marking 15 marking 26 marking and 30 marking while the 225 5π 4 phase difference presenting in 3 marking 20 marking and 23 marking results in the elliptic trajectories jauvtis and williamson 2004 vandiver et al 2009 wu et al 2012 it is noted that the upper part of the riser is dominated by the horizontal vibration while the lower part dominated by the vertical vibration moreover the maximum horizontal displacement appearing at the upper part is larger than the maximum vertical displacement of the lower part it is attributed to the great impact momentum along the incoming flow direction x axis 3 2 flow characteristics since the vibration of riser is induced by the internal slug flow the flow characteristics including the pressure fluctuation and slug length may provide some hydrodynamic information to explain fiv fig 7 shows the pressure fluctuation of the two monitored points we can see the local fluctuation of pressure shows a certain periodicity due to the intermittently flow of slug bubble and liquid slug the phase difference between the two pressures varies over time indicating the instability of the two phase flow additionally the pressure difference between the riser base and the top of riser reflects the liquid holdup in the riser the variable pressure difference demonstrates the slug length varies over time as shown in fig 7 the pressure crests occur when the longest liquid slug passes through the riser on contrary the pressure troughs appear when the riser is occupied by short slugs the unstable nature of the two phase mixture generates periodic forces on the riser thus the riser experiences unstable vibration as shown in fig 8 the vibration amplitudes also fluctuate as the local pressure when the monitored pressures show the crests the maximum vibration amplitude appears in either x direction or z direction however the vibration amplitude becomes smaller at pressure troughs since the long liquid slug passes through the riser at pressure crests the impact force acting on the structure boundary is significantly increased resulting in the great amplitude response meanwhile the vibration of riser in turn influences the slug flow due to the vigorous response t 1 t 3 the internal long liquid slugs collapse into short slugs then the hydrodynamic force created by the slug flow becomes weaker leading to a small amplitude response t 4 t 11 in this case long liquid slugs are formed again in the riser t 12 t 14 consequently the response becomes stronger again therefore the evolution of two phase flow structure demonstrates the periodic fluid structure interaction in addition most part of the riser presents a 180 phase difference between the horizontal response and the vertical response it further illustrates the responses along the two directions depend on each other as stated in section 3 1 3 3 effect of the superficial air velocity fig 9 depicts the root mean square rms vibration amplitudes along the riser length at three different gas liquid ratios with the superficial water velocity fixed at 0 501 m s the positions of the markings are plotted in the right column of the figure it is seen that all the three cases exhibit the second order dominated response the geometric nonlinearity of the riser mainly contributes to the asymmetry distribution of rms amplitude along the span the maximum horizontal amplitude appears at the upper part while the maximum vertical amplitude occurs at the lower part as the gas liquid ratio increases the vibration amplitude increases gradually which is associated with the length of liquid slug and the variation in natural frequency as shown in fig 10 the maximum liquid slug length is reduced from 38 5d to 22d with increasing of gas liquid ratio from 1 059 to 1 322 the growth of air flow rate contributes to more lifting energy for liquid slugs increasing the movement speed of slug and disturbing the formation of longer slug as a result the mass of liquid slugs in the riser is reduced to an extent and hence the reduction of natural frequency as depicted in fig 11 there are three frequencies participate in the vibration the minima is the same as the dominant fluctuation frequency of internal fluid pressure fig 12 reflecting the direct influence of pressure oscillation the other two frequencies are mainly determined by the natural properties of the flexible riser one of them is less than the first order natural frequency and the other one is less than the second order natural frequency although the gap between the highest vibration frequency with the second order natural frequency is relatively large at q g q l 1 059 the response still presents the second order mode due to the specific curved deploy as stated above with the reduction of the frequency difference between the vibration frequency and the natural one the vibration amplitude is increased obviously it is seen from fig 12 that the pressure inside the riser is increased as the gas liquid ratio increases indicating the growth of lift force exerting on the liquid slugs apart from the dominant frequency due to the unstable flow the pressure fluctuation also exhibits higher frequencies same as the vibration frequencies it illustrates the vibration of riser in turn affects the internal two phase flow and excites the higher frequencies of pressure fluctuation 3 4 effect of the superficial water velocity as shown in fig 13 when the superficial air velocity is fixed at 0 663 m s the increase of water flow rate leads to a reduction in vibration amplitude although the response still exhibits the second order mode the gas liquid ratio is decreased as the liquid flow rate increases contrary to the trend with variation in gas flow rate the maximum liquid slug length and the natural frequency are increased as the water flow rate decreases as depicted in fig 14 it is mainly attributed to the increase of the superficial water flow velocity which gives rise to the increase of the migration speed of liquid slugs consequently the accumulation of liquid slug is affected the length of the longest liquid slug drops from 25 7d to 22d as the superficial water flow velocity increases from 0 406 m s to 0 501 m s q g q l reduces from 1 699 to 1 322 as a result the natural frequency has a slight rise with increasing of q g q l fig 15 shows the frequency spectra at three different q g q l with the superficial air velocity fixed at 0 663 m s the similar tri frequency response is observed with the minimum one coinciding with the dominant frequency of pressure fluctuation fig 16 and the other two frequencies close to the first and second natural frequencies respectively as the two higher vibration frequencies are close to the natural frequencies in the three cases the variation in response amplitude in fig 13 is not as obvious as that in fig 9 the second peak presented in the frequency spectrogram displayed in fig 16 is consistent with the first order frequency participating in vibration further indicating the fluid structure interaction 3 5 effect of gas liquid ratio as stated above the increase of gas flow rate may disturb the formation of liquid slug while the increase of liquid flow rate may affect the accumulation of liquid slug thus the liquid slug length and vibration amplitude are determined by the combination of the two flow rates fig 17 compares the rms amplitude along the riser length at ten different gas liquid ratios it is seen that the response of the riser is still dominated by the second order mode though the gas liquid ratio increases from 0 5 to 1 827 obvious fluctuations are presented in the amplitude values with increasing of gas liquid ratio as the gas liquid ratio increases the horizontal amplitude undergoes a first increase and reaches a peak value at q g q l 1 435 and then decreases as q g q l further increases to 1 543 after that a second rise occurs as q g q l further grows to 1 827 unlike the x direction response the vertical amplitude experiences two rises and drops and the first and second peaks occur at q g q l 1 435 and q g q l 1 699 respectively it indicates that the vibrations in the two directions are out of sync though the responses are happened in the same plane this phenomenon is similar to the viv of flexible riser versus the reduced velocity of cross flow zhu et al 2016 zhu and lin 2018 the variation of the maximum liquid slug length is plotted in fig 18 in spite of the ups and downs the slug length shows a downward trend as the gas liquid ratio increases it indicates the reduction of liquid flow rate could lead to a slight increase of slug length in some small q g q l range such as 0 827 q g q l 1 059 and 1 322 q g q l 1 699 but the slug length would change inversely when the q g q l grows exceed the range this phenomenon is attributed to the competition between the gas lifting force determined by the gas flow rate and the accumulation of liquid slug determined by the liquid flow rate this competition partly explains the fluctuation of vibration amplitude with variation in gas liquid ratio fig 19 shows the vibration frequencies of representative markings at different gas liquid ratios the vertical dash line represents the dominant frequency of pressure fluctuation the minimum vibration frequency is consist with the pressure fluctuation frequency further indicating the unstable internal flow excites the vibration and the response presents the same frequency as shown in fig 19 the dominant vibration frequency varies along the riser length illustrating the frequency competition this phenomenon is also observed in the viv tests of a curved flexible riser by vandiver et al 1996 and zhu et al 2016 both the geometric shape and flexibility of the riser contribute to the out of sync response along the length which is hard to observe from a rigid cylinder as q g q l grows the frequency experiences the same fluctuation as the vibration amplitude the eventual vibration amplitude is the result of the frequency competition the closer the dominant frequency to the natural one the larger the vibration amplitude 4 conclusions the internal slug flow induced vibration of a free hanging flexible riser is experimentally investigated the non intrusive high speed imaging technique allows to record the riser response and the two phase flow structure at the same time from the experimental results and discussions presented above following conclusions can be drawn 1 the internal slug flow mainly generates an in plane vibration which is dominated by the second order mode in the considered gas liquid ratio range the node of the second order response envelope occurs at the largest curvature of the riser the incoming flow direction leads to a larger horizontal displacement in the riser part above the node the responses along the two directions in the plane on which the riser is deployed are interdependent to each other but are out of sync with variation in the gas liquid ratio 2 the maximum response amplitude appears when the pressure reaches the peak with a consistent longest liquid slug passing through the riser the vigorous response leads to a collapse of long liquid slug and thereby a reduction in amplitude while a small amplitude is beneficial for the accumulation of long liquid slug additionally the pressure fluctuation frequency is observed in the vibration and the vibration frequencies also present in the pressure fluctuation these phenomena demonstrate the fluid structure interaction 3 as the gas liquid ratio increases the amplitude experiences ups and downs as a result of the competition between the lifting energy and the accumulation of liquid slug the out of sync response along the spanwise direction is observed due to the curved deploy and flexibility further extensive studies are still required to uncover the underlying physics and to examine the fiv response under a combined action of internal two phase flow and external currents additionally the need for full scale experiments remains though the results on a laboratory scale can enrich a database for developing models acknowledgements the research work was supported by national nature science foundation of china no 11502220 youth science technology

23202,unstable hydrodynamic slug flow is extensively encountered in marine risers resulting in internal flow induced vibration which is quite different with the vortex induced vibration caused by a cross flow experiments were performed in an air water test loop to study the internal slug flow induced vibration of a free hanging flexible riser with aspect ratio the ratio of the length to the diameter of a riser of 158 a non intrusive technique of high speed imaging method was employed to record the vibration displacements of the riser model and the flow regime of two phase mixture in the riser simultaneously the results show that an in plane vibration is created by the internal slug flow and the responses along the two directions in the plane are interdependent to each other in the considered gas liquid ratio the ratio of air flow rate to water flow rate the second order mode dominates the response the hydrodynamic behaviors of slug flow including the gas liquid ratio liquid slug length and superficial velocity affect the local pressure fluctuation and hence influence the vibration amplitude the fluid structure interaction is reflected from the same frequencies presenting in the vibration and pressure fluctuation keywords flow induced vibration gas liquid two phase flow unstable hydrodynamic slug flow liquid slugs flexible riser 1 introduction gas liquid flow within transmission pipelines has been the topic of extensive investigations due to its fundamental and practical significance different steady flow regimes for the two phase flow in a horizontal or vertical pipe have been classified mandhane et al 1974 mishima and ishii 1984 among these flow regimes slug flow has attracted increasing attention because of its violent behavior and its extensive encounter in many engineering fields such as petroleum transportation heat exchangers and nuclear power generation miwa et al 2015 liu et al 2012 the fluctuating characteristics of slug flow including momentum pressure and void fraction fluctuations excite unstable hydrodynamic forces on pipes inducing the structural vibration this phenomenon is known as flow induced vibration fiv particularly resonance may occur when the predominant response frequency coincides with the natural frequency of piping system resulting in serious consequences like structural fatigue and failure therefore understanding slug flow induced vibration is indispensable for designing a safely operable piping system and avoiding the structural damage in the past few decades external flow induced vibration has been studied extensively williamson and govardhan 2004 jauvtis and williamson 2004 zhu and gao 2017 zhu et al 2018 for flow past a bluff body vortices shed alternately at either side of the bluff body give birth to the structural vibration called vortex induced vibration viv the mechanism of internal gas liquid two phase flow induced vibration could be quite different due to the differences in flow orientation and differences in fluid properties density viscosity and surface tension etc however there has been very few research performed on this subject to date pipe turning elements such as elbows and tees are considered as one of the major sources for causing vibration the change of flow direction causes the impact force of two phase mixture acting on the pipe surfaces miwa et al 2015 severe in plane vibration was observed by riverin and pettigrew 2007 for a u shaped piping element excited by internal two phase flow the amplitude and frequency of measured force fluctuation increased with velocity for a given volumetric quality cargnelutti et al 2009 conducted air water experiments on 6 mm elbows with radius of r d 2 7 and 4 2 where r is the curvature radius and d is the diameter they confirmed that the highest force occurs in slug flow regime the force fluctuating amplitude is several orders higher than that in single phase flows with similar velocities the maximum slug flow induced force acting on a 90 horizontal elbow was measured by tay and thorpe 2004 the tests revealed that the liquid viscosity and surface tension have no significant effect on the hydrodynamic force based on the experimental data few models were proposed to predict the force magnitude and its dominant frequency tay and thorpe 2004 riverin and pettigrew 2007 cargenlutti et al 2010 although the flow induced forces were discussed in above studies the structural vibration response displacement was not measured and analyzed until recently the vibration displacement of a horizontal pipe excited by internal slug flow at a fixed air superficial velocity was considered by al hashimy et al 2016 it was found that the vibration displacement increased gradually with increasing of water superficial velocity while the predominant frequency was reduced for the complicated flow behavior and limited number of experiments the internal slug fiv has not been thoroughly understood additionally the pipe vibration may in turn affect the internal two phase flow structures hibiki and ishii 1998 it is a complicated unsteady fluid structure interaction that still is an open topic in offshore oil and gas engineering risers are necessity for transporting multiphase hydrocarbons from subsea wellheads to central production platforms malekzadeh et al 2012 moreover flexible risers are often deployed as a free hanging catenary type the slug flow in such curved flexible risers with large aspect ratio the ratio of the length to the diameter of a riser l d where l is the riser length and d is its diameter may create more complicated vibrations the primary aim of this work is therefore to examine and explain the slug flow induced vibration of a free hanging flexible riser at different gas liquid ratio the ratio of air flow rate to water flow rate q g q l where q g and q l are air flow rate and water flow rate respectively through modelling experiments high speed imaging technology is employed to simultaneously record the two phase flow structure in the riser model and the vibration displacements of the riser the vibration response pressure fluctuation and liquid slug length are discussed the rest of this paper is organized in the following manner in sec 2 the experimental facilities and methods are presented the experimental results are then discussed in sec 3 finally major conclusions are drawn in sec 4 2 experimental facilities and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experiments were carried out in a test loop arranged in a re circulating water channel of state key laboratory of oil and gas reservoir geology and exploitation at southwest petroleum university swpu china the schematic of the test loop is depicted in fig 1 as mentioned in the above section the investigation on internal slug fiv is the objective of this study the external fiv will be considered in the further work the layout of test loop in the empty water flume is to facilitate future comparison as shown in fig 1 the test facility consists of four main parts the test loop fluid supply separation tank and measurement and control devices the test loop comprises a 20 m long horizontal pipeline followed by a 95 cm long l 60 cm high h flexible riser both the horizontal pipeline and flexible riser are made of transparent silica gel tube allowing visual observation of the flow behavior in the pipeline riser system the external and internal diameters of the pipeline riser system are d 6 mm and d i 4 mm respectively thus the aspect ratio l d of the riser is 158 the main parameters of the flexible riser model are listed in table 1 the riser hanged in air deployed as a catenary configuration in a vertical plane xoz plane the two ends of the riser were fixed at the flume floor and at a support frame respectively in order to facilitate the displacement analysis the origin of the coordinate system is located at the inlet of the riser the configuration of the stationary riser is expressed as 1 z x 0 4521 cosh 2 212 x 1 where x and z are the horizontal and vertical coordinates in xoz plane respectively dry air was supplied from a 20 l buffer vessel which was connected to a rotary compressor with a maximum flow rate of 1 2 l min at room temperature and atmospheric pressure condition 101325pa 293 15 k the volumetric flux of air flow was measured by a float flowmeter with a maximum measurement capacity of 1 2 l min and an accuracy of 1 a 0 5 m3 stainless steel tank was employed for water storage and gas liquid separation water was supplied by a centrifugal pump with a maximum flow rate of 1 5 l min a relatively constant volumetric flow rate can be achieved by manually adjusting the opening of control valves on the supply pipes the control valves were located directly downstream of the water pump or buffer vessel the water flow rate into the test loop was measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter with a maximum capacity of 1 5 l min and an accuracy of 0 5 the air flow rate ranges from 0 3 l min to 0 6 l min and the water flow rate is 0 306 0 6 l min the corresponding superficial air velocity v sg at standard conditions ranges from 0 398 m s to 0 796 m s and the superficial water velocity v sl is 0 406 0 796 m s thus the gas liquid ratio q g q l is from 0 5 to 1 827 which is commonly encountered in practice the experimental cases are summarized in table 2 where v m is the mixture velocity expressed as 2 v m q g q l a where q g and q l are the air and water flow rates respectively and a is the cross section area of the riser the air and water flow were gathered via a y junction mixer connected to the long horizontal pipeline a slug flow was formed before its entrance into the flexible riser then the riser discharged the two phase flow into the separator operating at atmospheric pressure in the separator air and water were separated by gravity then the gas was vented to the open air while the liquid flowed down to the storage tank two pressure transducers model ypt1000 t02 accuracy 0 1 were mounted at the riser base and at the top of the riser the pressure fluctuation was monitored with sampling frequency of 100 hz 2 2 measurement techniques and data processing methods strain gauges and accelerometers have been widely used in previous studies huera huarte and bearman 2009a 2009b lee and allen 2010 huera huarte et al 2014 chen et al 2015 to measure the vibration displacement of cylindrical structures however these instruments should be mounted on the structural surface bringing about a certain change in properties including mass stiffness and damping in our previous study on vortex induced vibration of a curved flexible riser zhu et al 2016 a non intrusive technique of high speed imaging method was proposed and successfully applied in recording the external fiv displacements furthermore high speed imaging method is often used to capture flow regimes in transparent pipes therefore the vibration displacements of the riser and the flow structure in the riser were monitored simultaneously by high speed cameras in the internal fiv experiments the water in the storage tank was dyed black by ink in order to clearly identify the liquid slugs in the riser one high speed camera model baumer hxg20 was pointed right at the riser plane recording the flow regime as well as the vibration displacement in the xoz plane another camera was placed under the riser to record the vibration displacement along the y direction as shown in fig 1 thirty three black markings with height of 4 mm and center to center spacing of 24 mm were marked along the riser length the displacements of the 33 markings along the riser were recorded by high speed cameras with sampling frequency of 100 frames per second the image size of each frame is 2048 1088 pixels with resolution of 3 02 pixels per mm the measuring apparatuses were calibrated prior to the experiments and the air and water were allowed to flow for about 20min prior to data acquisition in each test the image was recorded for 2min each camera stored 12000 pictures arrayed in time series the displacements of markings were extracted from the adjacent images by comparing the position of markings as shown in fig 2 the coordinate system in the recorded images was defined firstly then the displacement represented by each picture element was obtained by the means of pixel calibration i e the height of each marking in the images corresponded to the actual size of 4 mm zhu et al 2016 the moment invariants hu 1962 were employed to pick up the character of the images then the markings in each image were recognized after that the vibration response was easily got by converting the translational pixels to actual displacements finally time histories of vibration displacements were obtained via the image post processing of the time series of pictures 2 3 decay tests decay tests were performed prior to the fiv experiments in order to determine the natural frequency of the riser hanging in air and the system damping ratio as the riser transmits gas liquid two phase flow in experiments the system mass varies with the gas liquid ratio the riser fully filled with stationary water was used in the decay tests then the actual natural frequency in each gas liquid ratio is extrapolated according to the specific mass of fluid in the riser expressed as 3 f n n 2 l t m n 2 π 2 e i l 2 m where f n is the natural frequency n represents the vibration order number l is the riser length t is the tension of the riser e is the elastic modulus i is the inertial moment of the riser and m is the system mass including the riser mass and the mass of internal fluid the free attenuation response of the riser was recorded after imposing an initial displacement fig 3 plots the response of the riser midspan 17 marking the concerned parameters were achieved by fast fourier transform fft as listed in table 2 the first order and second order natural frequencies of the riser filled with stationary water are 1 6097 hz and 3 163 hz respectively and the system damping ratio the ratio of actual damping to critical damping is 0 01774 3 results and discussions 3 1 vibration response unlike the out of plane viv caused by external currents zhu et al 2016 it is observed from fig 4 b that the internal two phase fiv mainly occurs in the xoz plane and the lateral vibration along the y direction could be neglected which is consistent with the observation by riverin and pettigrew 2007 and al hashimy et al 2016 the flow orientation is the main cause the instantaneous vibration shape of the riser during one second at q g q l 1 322 is plotted in fig 4 a the dash line represents the initial position of the stationary riser when the two phase flow passes through the riser an obvious sag occurs due to the gravity of two phase fluid it is clearly seen that the instantaneous shape of the riser varies over time with different amplitudes along the length the figure eight response envelope illustrates the in plane vibration is dominated by the second order mode a node exhibiting the minima of the envelope is located at 21 marking a little lower than the midspan 17 marking since the flow direction of the two phase fluid varies along the riser length a centrifugal force is imposed on the riser extrados it is interesting to find that the node appears at the place where the curvature of the riser is the largest one indicating the maximum centrifugal force occurs there the vertical distance between the node and the initial position of the riser quantitatively depicts the sag of the flexible riser which is 1 41d in this case from the instantaneous shape of the riser we can observe the displacements in the two directions are interdependent to each other owing to the catenary configuration if the upper part of the riser above the node shown in fig 4 a has a positive displacement along the x axis the lower part below the node would move upwards along the z axis while the negative x directional displacement of the upper part is accompanied by the downward movement of the lower part therefore it is impossible for this flexible riser to vibrate in the first order i e the in plane vibration of curved riser at least is the second order it is confirmed from fig 4 b which plots the spanwise evolution of the vibration amplitude along the riser length both the horizontal amplitude and vertical amplitude have two peaks appearing at 12 marking and 26 marking respectively the peak value of horizontal amplitude at 12 marking is about 1 5 times larger than that in the z direction while the vertical amplitude at 26 marking is 2 3 times as large as the horizontal amplitude it is clearly seen that the intersection of the two curves in fig 4 b is just the node 21 marking the rms vibration amplitude of the node is not zero indicating that more than one mode participates in the vibration as shown in fig 5 due to the participant of multiple frequencies the riser undergoes non constant amplitude response three frequencies roughly double increased in sequence involve in the vibration and the values are very close to each other in the two directions it further indicates the responses along the two directions are related the pressure fluctuations of the two monitored points are depicted in the bottom row the pressures at the bottom and top of the riser mainly fluctuate in the same normalized frequency of f p d v m 0 0036 f p is the fluctuating frequency of pressure which is also the same as the minimum vibration frequency f osc d v m f osc is the vibration frequency it demonstrates the fluctuating characteristics of two phase flow affect the fiv miwa et al 2015 apart from the minimum frequency the two other frequencies are close to the first natural frequency f 1x d v m f 1z d v m 0 0091 and the second natural frequency f 2x d v m f 2z d v m 0 0186 respectively therefore the riser eventually vibrates in the second order although the vibration frequencies at different markings along the length are the same in the value the power spectral densities psd are different the marking undergoing the vigorous vibration shows the relatively large psd indicating the energy extracted from the slug flow is relatively great fig 6 depicts the trajectories of representative markings at q g q l 1 322 the vibration orbits are associated with the phase angle φ between the x direction response and the z direction response as the frequency ratio in the two directions is 1 1 the 180 π phase difference leads to the linear orbits of 7 marking 12 marking 15 marking 26 marking and 30 marking while the 225 5π 4 phase difference presenting in 3 marking 20 marking and 23 marking results in the elliptic trajectories jauvtis and williamson 2004 vandiver et al 2009 wu et al 2012 it is noted that the upper part of the riser is dominated by the horizontal vibration while the lower part dominated by the vertical vibration moreover the maximum horizontal displacement appearing at the upper part is larger than the maximum vertical displacement of the lower part it is attributed to the great impact momentum along the incoming flow direction x axis 3 2 flow characteristics since the vibration of riser is induced by the internal slug flow the flow characteristics including the pressure fluctuation and slug length may provide some hydrodynamic information to explain fiv fig 7 shows the pressure fluctuation of the two monitored points we can see the local fluctuation of

since the long liquid slug passes through the riser at pressure crests the impact force acting on the structure boundary is significantly increased resulting in the great amplitude response meanwhile the vibration of riser in turn influences the slug flow due to the vigorous response t 1 t 3 the internal long liquid slugs collapse into short slugs then the hydrodynamic force created by the slug flow becomes weaker leading to a small amplitude response t 4 t 11 in this case long liquid slugs are formed again in the riser t 12 t 14 consequently the response becomes stronger again therefore the evolution of two phase flow structure demonstrates the periodic fluid structure interaction in addition most part of the riser presents a 180 phase difference between the horizontal response and the vertical response it further illustrates the responses along the two directions depend on each other as stated in section 3 1 3 3 effect of the superficial air velocity fig 9 depicts the root mean square rms vibration amplitudes along the riser length at three different gas liquid ratios with the superficial water velocity fixed at 0 501 m s the positions of the markings are plotted in the

vibration amplitude are determined by the combination of the two flow rates fig 17 compares the rms amplitude along the riser length at ten different gas liquid ratios it is seen that the response of the riser is still dominated by the second order mode though the gas liquid ratio increases from 0 5 to 1 827 obvious fluctuations are presented in the amplitude values with increasing of gas liquid ratio as the gas liquid ratio increases the horizontal amplitude undergoes a first increase and reaches a peak value at q g q l 1 435 and then decreases as q g q l further increases to 1 543 after that a second rise occurs as q g q l further grows to 1 827 unlike the x direction response the vertical amplitude experiences two rises and drops and the first and second peaks occur at q g q l 1 435 and q g q l 1 699 respectively it indicates that the vibrations in the two directions are out of sync though the responses are happened in the same plane this phenomenon is similar to the viv of flexible riser versus the reduced velocity of cross flow zhu et al 2016 zhu and lin 2018 the variation of the maximum liquid slug length is plotted in fig 18 in spite of the ups and downs the slug length shows a downward trend as the gas liquid ratio increases it indicates the reduction of liquid flow rate could lead to a slight increase of slug length in some small q g q l range such as 0 827 q g q l 1 059 and 1 322 q g q l 1 699 but the slug length would change inversely when the q g q l grows exceed the range this phenomenon is attributed to the competition between the gas lifting force determined by the gas flow rate and the accumulation of liquid slug determined by the liquid flow rate this competition partly explains the fluctuation of vibration amplitude with variation in gas liquid ratio fig 19 shows the vibration frequencies of representative markings at different gas liquid ratios the vertical dash line represents the dominant frequency of pressure fluctuation the minimum vibration frequency is consist with the pressure fluctuation frequency further indicating the unstable internal flow excites the vibration and the response presents the same frequency as shown in fig 19 the dominant vibration frequency varies along the riser length illustrating the frequency competition this phenomenon is also observed in the viv tests of a curved flexible riser by vandiver et al 1996 and zhu et al 2016 both the geometric shape and flexibility of the riser contribute to the out of sync response along the length which is hard to observe from a rigid cylinder as q g q l grows the frequency experiences the same fluctuation as the vibration amplitude the eventual vibration amplitude is the result of the frequency competition the closer the dominant frequency to the natural one the larger the vibration amplitude 4 conclusions the internal slug flow induced vibration of a free hanging flexible riser is experimentally investigated the non intrusive high speed imaging technique allows to record the riser response and the two phase flow structure at the same time from the experimental results and discussions presented above following conclusions can be drawn 1 the internal slug flow mainly generates an in plane vibration which is dominated by the second order mode in the considered gas liquid ratio range the node of the second order response envelope occurs at the largest curvature of the riser the incoming flow direction leads to a larger horizontal displacement in the riser part above the node the responses along the two directions in the plane on which the riser is deployed are interdependent to each other but are out of sync with variation in the gas liquid ratio 2 the maximum response amplitude appears when the pressure reaches the peak with a consistent longest liquid slug passing through the riser the vigorous response leads to a collapse of long liquid slug and thereby a reduction in amplitude while a small amplitude is beneficial for the accumulation of long liquid slug additionally the pressure fluctuation frequency is observed in the vibration and the vibration frequencies also present in the pressure fluctuation these phenomena demonstrate the fluid structure interaction 3 as the gas liquid ratio increases the amplitude experiences ups and downs as a result of the competition between the lifting energy and the accumulation of liquid slug the out of sync response along the spanwise direction is observed due to the curved deploy and flexibility further extensive studies are still required to uncover the underlying physics and to examine the fiv response under a combined action of internal two phase flow and external currents additionally the need for full scale experiments remains though the results on a laboratory scale can enrich a database for developing models acknowledgements the research work was supported by national nature science foundation of china no 11502220 youth science technology

with the rapid development of the underwater weapons in recent years the explosive charges can be exploded adjacent to the warships when such near field underwater explosion occurs the load to the structures are very complicated including the shock wave the cavitation collapse and the explosion bubble pulse and jet the warship protection to such load attracted more and more researchers interests one representative protection structure is the sandwich structure with the energy absorbing cores made of cellular or composite materials either plastered onto the wet face of the ship hull or substituting the ship hull directly fleck and deshpande 2004 xue and hutchinson 2003 liang et al 2007 chen et al 2009 dharmasena et al 2010 schiffer and tagarielli 2014 leblanc and shukla 2011 avachat and zhou 2016 yin et al 2016 jin et al 2017a 2017b abrate 2018 many researchers performed the shock mitigation effects of the sandwich structures subjected to near field underwater explosion dharmasena et al 2010 investigated the compressive response of rigidly supported stainless steel sandwich panels with five different core topologies subject to a planar impulsive load in water through a dyno crusher experiments and simulations the results indicate that despite considerable differences in core topology and dynamic deformation modes a simple foam like model replicates the dynamic response of rigidly supported sandwich panels leblanc et al 2016 conducted an experimental study with corresponding numerical simulations to evaluate the response of e glass epoxy composite plates including polyuria coating effects subjected to near field underwater explosion the experimental results show that neglecting a weight penalty associated with the additional material the transient response of the plate is improved by using a thicker plate or applying a polyurea coating fan et al 2016 performed a series of close in underwater blast tests on sandwich panels with honeycomb cores to investigate blast resistance of metallic sandwich panels the results provided further experimental evidence for the benefit of sandwich construction in terms of deformation resistance and secondary pressure wave intensity even at high blast magnitude young et al 2009 investigate the effects of fluid structure interaction and shock bubble interaction in the transient response of composite structures during early time underwater explosion by a two dimensional eulerian lagrangian numerical method the relative importance of different effects including the taylor s fluid structure interaction effect the bending stretching effect the core compression effect and the boundary effect are quantitatively and qualitatively discussed wang et al 2016 numerically studied the effects of the fluid solid interaction dynamics between underwater explosion bubble and corrugated sandwich plate where the bubble dynamics are modeled by vernon model it is demonstrated that the bubble jet load plays a more significant role than the shock wave load especially in near field underwater explosion although the above mentioned research discussed the load of near field underwater explosion most of them focused on the load of shock wave with the bubble pulse and jet neglected the only work considering the bubble jet by wang et al 2016 can hardly present the effects of deformation of sandwich structures on the bubble dynamics since the limitation of the vernon model actually the deformation of sandwich structures plays an important role on the bubble dynamics a well designed sandwich structure could reverse the direction of bubble jet chen et al 2015 which could significantly attenuate the damage to the structures however how to design the sandwich structure to achieve the mitigation of the loads of both the shock wave and the bubble jet is still unclear the interaction between the bubble and different boundaries are extensively investigated for decades generally the bubble will be attracted by the rigid boundary with the direction of the bubble jet towards the rigid boundary and repelled by the free surface with the direction of the bubble jet away from the free surface when in close proximity to the flexible boundary the bubble are behaved between the above two extreme situations which are of particular interest to the researchers in these years including the cavitation bubble gibson and black 1982 shima et al 1989 duncan et al 1996 brujan et al 2001 gong et al 2012 gong and klaseboer 2016 hsiao et al 2014 saleki haselghoubi and dadvand 2018 wang et al 2015 2018 vincent et al 2014 curtiss et al 2013 lind and phillips 2012 and the explosion bubble klaseboer et al 2005 brett and yiannakopolous 2008 hung and hwangfu 2010 hsiao and chahine 2015 gong and khoo 2015 zong et al 2015 liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 for the cavitation bubble the early research has demonstrated that the surface inertia surface stiffness rigid body motion and the distance between the bubble and the boundary are the main factors influencing the directions of the bubble jet gibson and black 1982 shima et al 1989 duncan et al 1996 brujan et al 2001 recently liu et al 2016 investigated the interaction between a bubble and an air backed plate with a circular hole using the incompressible potential theory coupled with the boundary element method bem the bubble and spike dynamics are discussed in detail wang et al 2018 discussed the acoustic bubble dynamics in a microvessel surrounded by elastic material using the potential flow theory coupled with the bem the bubble oscillation jet formation and penetration through the bubble and the deformation of the vessel wall in terms of the ultrasound amplitude and the vessel radius are analyzed for the explosion bubble most of the researchers focused on bubble jet induced damage on the structure klaseboer et al 2005 brett and yiannakopolous 2008 hsiao and chahine 2015 gong and khoo 2015 zong et al 2015 recently hung and hwangfu 2010 performed mini charge underwater explosion experiment to study the behavior of underwater explosion bubbles near different boundaries the relationship between bubble migration and the kelvin impulse surface inertia and surface stiffness was investigated the similarities and differences between explosion and cavitation bubbles were discussed in detail zhang et al 2017 conducted the underwater explosion experiment and developed fully coupled the bem and finite element method to study the nonlinear interaction between the underwater explosion bubble and structures the results demonstrate that by adjusting the material of the elastic plastic hollow spherical shell and the stand off distance the bubble will present diverse collapse and jet patterns to sum up for the cavitation bubble the load on the structure can be reduced by altering the bubble jet direction which can be obtained by adjusting the material parameters of the deformable structure however for the explosion bubble altering the bubble jet direction through the protection structures is still seldom studied in this paper as a preliminary study the sandwich structure is modeled by a moveable plate with a given velocity profile which conforms the general feature of the response of a sandwich structure to the high intensity load including the core crushing phase and bending and stretching phase fleck and deshpande 2004 liang et al 2007 the intrinsic relationships will be built between the parameters which determine the velocity profile and the explosion bubble behaviors the results are valuable for guiding the design of the protection structures the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the problem definition and simplification are given to present the physical background in section 3 the theoretical and numerical model are described to solve the problem we present the results and discussion in section 4 finally concluding remarks are given in section 5 2 problem definition and simplification when a charge detonates near the sandwich structure a strong shock wave is generated and crushes the cores the front face sheet exhibits a rapid acceleration due to the shock wave and a deceleration due to the core crushing and the bending and stretching of the sandwich structure the general responses of the sandwich structure could be split into three sequential steps stage i the one dimensional fluid structure interaction phase stage ii the core crushing phase stage iii the bending and stretching phase fleck and deshpande 2004 liang et al 2007 generally the front face sheets attain the maximum velocity in a very short period of time and the velocity and the displacement of the front face sheet in the bending and stretching phase are small compared with the core crushing phase if the back face sheet is fixed we neglect the accelerating process of the front face sheets and set the velocity to be zero in the bending and stretching phase for simplicity the response of sandwich structure is assumed to be a moveable plate with a given velocity profile as shown in fig 1 the problem is axisymmetric with the origin of the coordinate system locating at the initial center of the bubble the z direction perpendicular to the plate and x direction parallel to the plate as shown in fig 1 a the distance between the initial center of the bubble and the initial position of the plate is d the radius of the plate is l the mathematical expression of the velocity profile can be written by 1 v x t v 0 x ⅇ t t 0 e 2 t 2 t 0 0 t 2 t 0 where t 0 is a decaying constant and v 0 x 1 e 2 is the maximum velocity of the plate at the position x d the format of eq 1 is obtained by fitting the curves of one dimensional responses of sacrificial claddings to water blast jin et al 2017b according to taylor s analysis taylor 1963 the maximum velocity is proportional to the incident impulse the impulse generated by a tnt charge with weight w in kg at standoff distance d in meters is reid 1996 2 i 6 52 10 6 w 1 3 w 1 3 d 0 98 if we denote v m v 0 0 v 0 x can be given approximately by 3 v 0 x v m d d 2 x 2 0 98 3 theoretical and numerical model 3 1 basic equation for the fluid in the mid late fluid response of underwater explosion the fluid can be assumed to be inviscid irrotational and incompressible the assumptions result in a potential flow with velocity potential φ which is connected to the fluid velocity u by 4 u φ the incompressible condition leads to the laplace s equation 5 u 2 φ the equation of conservation of momentum can be integrated to yield bernoulli s equation 6 p l ρ φ t 1 2 φ 2 g z p where p is the pressure at infinity along z 0 fluid satisfies φ 0 and φ t 0 p l is the fluid pressure ρ is the fluid density and g is the acceleration due to the gravity at the bubble surface the continuity of the normal stresses leads to 7 p l p g p v where p g and p v are the non condensable gas and vapor partial pressure in the gas in this paper we neglect the effects of surface tension which is reasonable for the case of underwater explosion klaseboer et al 2005 by assuming that the non condensable gas is ideal and its expansion and compression processes are adiabatic the instantaneous pressure of the gas p g can be obtained by 8 p g p 0 v 0 v γ where p 0 is the initial pressure in the bubble and v 0 and v are the initial and instantaneous volume of the bubble γ is the specific heat ratio which is taken as 1 25 for explosion production of tnt klaseboer et al 2005 to relate the initial gas pressure to the weight of the charge the relationship in si units reads klaseboer et al 2005 9 p 0 1 39 10 5 w v 0 γ since the maximum bubble radius r m for tnt relating the weight of charge and explosion depth h can be expressed as reid 1996 10 r m 3 383 w 1 3 h 9 8 1 3 using rayleigh plesset equation for spherical oscillating bubbles rayleigh 1917 the initial radius of the bubble r0 can be obtained by 11 1 39 10 5 p p v 1 γ 1 3 w 4 π r m 3 γ 1 r 0 r m 3 γ 3 1 r 0 r m 3 0 the moving boundary follows the kinematic boundary condition which states that a fluid element on the surface will stay on it 12 φ n v s n where v s is the solid boundary velocity and n is the local unit normal vector pointing out of the fluid domain for different boundaries eq 12 can be transformed to 13 d r d t φ r on s b φ 0 r φ n φ n v s n r on s s where r is the position vector s b is the bubble surface s s is the surface of the solid boundary 3 2 numerical implementation the incompressible flow solver is based on the bem blake and gibson 1987 best and kucera 1992 wang et al 1996 klaseboer et al 2005 hsiao et al 2014 zhang and liu 2015 gong and klaseboer 2016 the laplace equation eq 5 is solved based on the green s theorem 14 ω φ 2 g g 2 φ d ω s n φ g g φ d s where ω is the domain of integration having elementary volume dω s is the boundary surface of ω with elementary surface ds φ is the harmonic in the fluid domain ω and g is green s function if g is selected to be harmonic everywhere but at some discrete points eq 14 can be simplified considerably for instance if 15 g 1 x y where x is a fixed point in the domain ω and y is a point on the boundary surface s eq 14 can be written by 16 λ φ x s φ y n g x y g x y ψ y d s where ψ φ n denotes the velocity component in the normal direction on the surface s and λ is the solid angle under which x sees the domain ω if x is a point in the fluid λ 4π if x is a point on a smooth portion of the boundary λ 2π if x is a point at a sharp corner on the boundary λ 4π by discretizing the surface s into elements and nodes eq 16 can be rewritten as a system of linear equations 17 h φ g ψ where g is the coefficient matrix representing the second term on the right hand side of eq 16 and h is the first term with the addition of the solid angle term on the left hand side φ and ψ are the column vectors of φ and ψ respectively when the surface is composed of different types of boundaries the unknown terms can be moved to the same side to make the equations solvable to generalize the analysis results the length pressure time velocity potential and velocity are normalized with respect to r m δp r m ρ δp 1 2 r m δp ρ 1 2 and δp ρ 1 2 where δp p p v is the reference pressure therefore the initial condition of the bubble motion is given by the strength parameter ε p 0 δp and the buoyancy parameter δ ρgr m δp 1 2 the lagrangian equation can be rewritten in dimensionless forms 18 d φ d t 1 ε v 0 v γ δ 2 z 1 2 u 2 r on s b d r d t u r on s b d r d t v r on s s where the overline variables indicate that the variables have been normalized and v is the dimensionless moveable boundary velocity to advance the solution in time eq 18 are solved by a third order runge kutta method the velocity potential and the position of the boundary at the new time step are obtained since the numerical solution of fredholm integral equation of the first kind which is used to calculate coefficient matrix g in eq 17 is susceptible to instability problems during the simulation the high frequency saw tooth instability may appear in the profile of the bubble boundary therefore a five point smoothing technique longuet higgins and cokelet 1976 is used to remove this instability in this paper on the other hand after updating the bubble boundary the nodes on the bubble may become too close to or too far away from each other especially during the process of jet formation which may also contribute to the numerical instabilities in present study to maintain the solution stable the re discretization procedure shervani tabar et al 2009 is used to remain the identical distances between the adjacent nodes 3 3 validation in order to verify the accuracy and precision of bem model we compare the results obtained by bem with the underwater explosion experiment by klaseboer et al 2005 in the experiment a tnt charge of 55 g is placed near a rigid vertical plate at a depth of 3 5 m the plate has a dimension of 1 5 m 1 5 m 0 05 m the standoff distance is 0 4 m 0 74 times the maximum bubble radius in the simulation the rigid plate is assumed to be circular and the gravity is ignored the convergent test of the bubble shape before the occurrence of the jet penetration is given in fig 2 where x and z are the coordinates in meters it indicates that the bubble element number n b 60 and the plate element number n s 41 can provide enough accuracy for the simulations the comparisons of the bubble shape evolutions between the simulations and the experiment are given in fig 3 since the axisymmetric model is assumed with the effects of buoyancy neglected the simulation results fail to capture asymmetric feature of the bubble shape in the experiment the oscillation time is 100 m s while it is 98 m s in the simulation despite this the bem simulations can still predict the bubble behaviors reasonably 4 results and discussions in this section the effects of the sandwich plate on the bubble behaviors are investigated the influences of the plate velocity profile the standoff distance and the scale of the sandwich plate are discussed in detail the tnt charge weight of 1 5 g exploding at a depth of 1 4 m is used in the simulations which is within the scope of the laboratory scale in this case r m 0 173 m ρ 1000 kg m3 g 10 m s2 p 1 14 105 pa and p v 2068 5 pa the corresponding strength parameter and nondimensional initial radius are ε 586 and r 0 0 0794 respectively 4 1 influence of the plate velocity profile the plate velocity profile is related to mechanical properties of the sandwich plate such as the core strength the mass and the stiffness of the face sheet in the simulation the standoff distance and the plate radius is taken as d 1 1 and l 1 5 respectively denote h x v 0 x t 0 1 3 e 2 and h m v m t 0 1 3 e 2 as the dimensionless core compression at point x d and 0 d which can be calculated by integrating eq 1 two situations are considered which fix h m and v m respectively we set h m 0 1 and v m 1 2 3 or 4 for situation 1 situation 2 corresponding to v m 3 and h m 0 05 0 15 0 25 or 0 35 4 1 1 situation 1 influence of v m v m is a parameter determined by the core strength the mass and the stiffness of the face sheet low core strength and low mass and stiffness of the face sheet will result in large v m fig 4 presents the pressure and velocity fields for v m 1 2 3 or 4 as seen in fig 4 a the pushing effects due to the motions of the plate which concave the bubble in the direction away from the plate are larger with increasing v m if v m is small e g v m 1 the water jet will be formed directing towards the plate with a high pressure and high velocity region developed below the bubble as shown in fig 4 b if v m 2 3 or 4 the bubble splits into two bubbles in the middle the splitting position is higher as v m increases the high pressure and high velocity region develop near the splitting positions in fig 5 the velocity of the plate center the kelvin impulse the migration of the bubble center and the bubble volume are compared for different v m the kelvin impulse i k is a dynamic concept which determines the gross bubble motion and defined as 19 i k ρ s b φ n d s the arrows in fig 5 represent the increasing directions of v m as v m increases the pushing effects due to the motions of the plate become larger and the kelvin impulse the maximum bubble volume and the bubble period decrease 4 1 2 situation 2 influence of h m h m is a parameter which is mainly determined by the core strength a low core strength corresponds to a large h m fig 6 shows the pressure and velocity fields for h m 0 05 0 15 0 25 or 0 35 similar to the effects of v m as seen in fig 6 a the pushing effects due to the motions of the plate which concave the bubble in the direction away from the plate are larger with increasing h m for h m 0 05 the water jet will be formed directing towards the plate with a high pressure and high velocity region developed below the bubble as shown in fig 6 b for h m 0 15 or 0 25 the bubble will split into multiple bubbles either in the middle or at the edge of the bubble for h m 0 35 the water jet will be formed directing away from the plate with the high pressure and high velocity region developed above the bubble fig 7 compares the velocity of the plate center the kelvin impulse the migration of the bubble center and the bubble volume for different h m as h m increases the attraction effects by the solid boundary become weaker and the kelvin impulse the maximum bubble volume and the bubble period decrease 4 2 influence of the standoff distance to discuss the influence of the standoff distance the standoff distance varies with the plate velocity profile and the plate radius unchanged we set l 1 5 h m 0 2 v m 2 and d 0 7 1 1 1 5 or 1 9 fig 8 illustrates the pressure and velocity fields for d 0 7 1 1 1 5 or 1 9 as seen in fig 8 a the pushing effects due to the motions of the plate which concave the bubble in the direction away from the plate are weaker with increasing d for d 1 9 the bubble almost keeps spherical which indicates that the boundary effects are small for d 0 7 or 1 1 the bubble splits into two bubbles in the middle with the high pressure and high velocity region developing near the splitting positions as shown in fig 8 b for d 1 5 or 1 9 the water jet will be formed directing away from the plate with the high pressure and high velocity region developed above the bubble in these cases the attraction effects by the solid boundary are very small and the bubble shapes are mainly determined by the pushing effects due to the motions of the plate fig 9 compares the velocity of the plate center the kelvin impulse the migration of the bubble center and the bubble volume for different d as d increases the maximum bubble volume and the bubble period increase the kelvin impulse and migration of the bubble center are a nonlinear function of d as shown in fig 9 b for t 0 3 the pushing effects due to the motions of the plate dominates the process and the kelvin impulse decreases with increasing d however for t 0 3 the attraction effects are large for d 0 7 resulting in a dramatic increase in the kelvin impulse 4 3 influence of the scale of the plate to discuss the influence of the scale of the plate the plate radius varies with the plate velocity profile and the standoff distance unchanged we set h m 0 2 v m 2 d 1 1 and l 0 5 1 0 1 5 or 2 0 fig 10 presents the pressure and velocity fields for l 0 5 1 0 1 5 or 2 0 as seen in fig 10 a the pushing effects due to the motions of the plate which concave the bubble in the direction away from the plate are stronger with increasing l for d 0 5 the bubble almost keeps spherical which indicates that the boundary effects are small the bubble splits into multiple bubbles either in the middle or at the edge of the bubble as shown in fig 10 b the high pressure and high velocity region develop near the splitting positions fig 11 compares the velocity of the plate center the kelvin impulse the migration of the bubble center and the bubble volume for different l as l increases the pushing effects due to the motions of the plate become stronger and the kelvin impulse the maximum bubble volume and the bubble period decrease 4 4 general bubble behaviors near a sandwich plate the key parameters relating the bubble behaviors to the properties of the sandwich plate are v m and h m in this section the general bubble behaviors are given as a function of v m and h m to provide an intuitive impression on how the motions of the plate influence the bubble behaviors fig 12 shows the effects of v m and h m on the bubble behaviors for d 0 7 and d 1 1 as shown in fig 12 three regimes are distinguished regime i corresponds to the jet directing towards the plate regime ii is a transition region in which the bubble will split into multiple bubbles or oscillate spherically without jet in regime iii the jet directs away from the plate generally if v m or h m is less than some threshold values the jet will direct towards the plate if h m is identical the sandwich plates with softer cores larger v m will alter the jet direction away from the plate regime ii is a transition phase between regime i and regime iii the momentum of the splitting bubbles can be directed either towards or away from the plate as for different standoff distances the maximum velocity partitioning regime i and regime ii is larger for d 0 7 and larger standoff distance will enlarge the region of regime ii the results indicate that the sandwich plate which can provide larger deformation and larger maximum deformation velocity is beneficial for altering the jet direction to direct away from the plate 5 conclusion the interaction between underwater explosion bubble and a moveable plate with basic characteristics of a sandwich structure is investigated through the bem the response of sandwich structures is assumed to be a moveable plate with a given velocity profile the velocity profile in the vertical direction of the plate has an exponential decaying form which is obtained by fitting the curves of one dimensional responses of sacrificial claddings to water blast the taylor s analysis is used to determine the relations of the maximum achievable velocity in the direction along the plate the effects of plate velocity profile the standoff distance and the scale of the plate on the bubble behaviors are presented within the scope of discussions the bubble volume and period are a decreasing function of v m h m and l and an increasing function of d the bubble behaviors near a sandwich plate are divided into three different regimes 1 jet directing towards the plate 2 the bubble will split into multiple bubbles or oscillate spherically without jet 3 jet directing away from the plate if the core of the sandwich plate is hard to compress or the thickness of the core is small the jet tends to directing towards the plate the sandwich plate which can provide larger deformation and larger maximum deformation velocity is beneficial for altering the jet direction to direct away from the plate the major limitation is that the current study decouples the response of the sandwich structure from the bubble load despite this the results are valuable for guiding the preliminary design of the protection structures a more detailed analysis which considers the full coupling process of underwater explosion bubble and the sandwich structure will be conducted in the near future declarations of interest none acknowledgements authors gratefully acknowledge the support for this work by project funded by china postdoctoral

with the rapid development of the underwater weapons in recent years the explosive charges can be exploded adjacent to the warships when such near field underwater explosion occurs the load to the structures are very complicated including the shock wave the cavitation collapse and the explosion bubble pulse and jet the warship protection to such load attracted more and more researchers interests one representative protection structure is the sandwich structure with the energy absorbing cores made of cellular or composite materials either plastered onto the wet face of the ship hull or substituting the ship hull directly fleck and deshpande 2004 xue and hutchinson 2003 liang et al 2007 chen et al 2009 dharmasena et al 2010 schiffer and tagarielli 2014 leblanc and shukla 2011 avachat and zhou 2016 yin et al 2016 jin et al 2017a 2017b abrate 2018 many researchers performed the shock mitigation effects of the sandwich structures subjected to near field underwater explosion dharmasena et al 2010 investigated the compressive response of rigidly supported stainless steel sandwich panels with five different core topologies subject to a planar impulsive load in water through a dyno crusher experiments and simulations the results indicate that despite considerable differences in core topology and dynamic deformation modes a simple foam like model replicates the dynamic response of rigidly supported sandwich panels leblanc et al 2016 conducted an experimental study with corresponding numerical simulations to evaluate the response of e glass epoxy composite plates including polyuria coating effects subjected to near field underwater explosion the experimental results show that neglecting a weight penalty associated with the additional material the transient response of the plate is improved by using a thicker plate or applying a polyurea coating fan et al 2016 performed a series of close in underwater blast tests on sandwich panels with honeycomb cores to investigate blast resistance of metallic sandwich panels the results provided further experimental evidence for the benefit of sandwich construction in terms of deformation resistance and secondary pressure wave intensity even at high blast magnitude young et al 2009 investigate the effects of fluid structure interaction and shock bubble interaction in the transient response of composite structures during early time underwater explosion by a two dimensional eulerian lagrangian numerical method the relative importance of different effects including the taylor s fluid structure interaction effect the bending stretching effect the core compression effect and the boundary effect are quantitatively and qualitatively discussed wang et al 2016 numerically studied the effects of the fluid solid interaction dynamics between underwater explosion bubble and corrugated sandwich plate where the bubble dynamics are modeled by vernon model it is demonstrated that the bubble jet load plays a more significant role than the shock wave load especially in near field underwater explosion although the above mentioned research discussed the load of near field underwater explosion most of them focused on the load of shock wave with the bubble pulse and jet neglected the only work considering the bubble jet by wang et al 2016 can hardly present the effects of deformation of sandwich structures on the bubble dynamics since the limitation of the vernon model actually the deformation of sandwich structures plays an important role on the bubble dynamics a well designed sandwich structure could reverse the direction of bubble jet chen et al 2015 which could significantly attenuate the damage to the structures however how to design the sandwich structure to achieve the mitigation of the loads of both the shock wave and the bubble jet is still unclear the interaction between the bubble and different boundaries are extensively investigated for decades generally the bubble will be attracted by the rigid boundary with the direction of the bubble jet towards the rigid boundary and repelled by the free surface with the direction of the bubble jet away from the free surface when in close proximity to the flexible boundary the bubble are behaved between the above two extreme situations which are of particular interest to the researchers in these years including the cavitation bubble gibson and black 1982 shima et al 1989 duncan et al 1996 brujan et al 2001 gong et al 2012 gong and klaseboer 2016 hsiao et al 2014 saleki haselghoubi and dadvand 2018 wang et al 2015 2018 vincent et al 2014 curtiss et al 2013 lind and phillips 2012 and the explosion bubble klaseboer et al 2005 brett and yiannakopolous 2008 hung and hwangfu 2010 hsiao and chahine 2015 gong and khoo 2015 zong et al 2015 liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 for the cavitation bubble the early research has demonstrated that the surface inertia surface stiffness rigid body motion and the distance between the bubble and the boundary are the main factors influencing the directions of the bubble jet gibson and black 1982 shima et al 1989 duncan et al 1996 brujan et al 2001 recently liu et al 2016 investigated the interaction between a bubble and an air backed plate with a circular hole using the incompressible potential theory coupled with the boundary element method bem the bubble and spike dynamics are discussed in detail wang et al 2018 discussed the acoustic bubble dynamics in a microvessel surrounded by elastic material using the potential flow theory coupled with the bem the bubble oscillation jet formation and penetration through the bubble and the deformation of the vessel wall in terms of the ultrasound amplitude and the vessel radius are analyzed for the explosion bubble most of the researchers focused on bubble jet induced damage on the structure klaseboer et al 2005 brett and yiannakopolous 2008 hsiao and chahine 2015 gong and khoo 2015 zong et al 2015 recently hung and hwangfu 2010 performed mini charge underwater explosion experiment to study the behavior of underwater explosion bubbles near different boundaries the relationship between bubble migration and the kelvin impulse surface inertia and surface stiffness was investigated the similarities and differences between explosion and cavitation bubbles were discussed in detail zhang et al 2017 conducted the underwater explosion experiment and developed fully coupled the bem and finite element method to study the nonlinear interaction between the underwater explosion bubble and structures the results demonstrate that by adjusting the material of the elastic plastic hollow spherical shell and the stand off distance the bubble will present diverse collapse and jet patterns to sum up for the cavitation bubble the load on the structure can be reduced by altering the bubble jet direction which can be obtained by adjusting the material parameters of the deformable structure however for the explosion bubble altering the bubble jet direction through the protection structures is still seldom studied in this paper as a preliminary study the sandwich structure is modeled by a moveable plate with a given velocity profile which conforms the general feature of the response of a sandwich structure to the high intensity load including the core crushing phase and bending and stretching phase fleck and deshpande 2004 liang et al 2007 the intrinsic relationships will be built between the parameters which determine the velocity profile and the explosion bubble behaviors the results are valuable for guiding the design of the protection structures the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the problem definition and simplification are given to present the physical background in section 3 the theoretical and numerical model are described to solve the problem we present the results and discussion in section 4 finally concluding remarks are given in section 5 2 problem definition and simplification when a charge detonates near the sandwich structure a strong shock wave is generated and crushes the cores the front face sheet exhibits a rapid acceleration due to the shock wave and a deceleration due to the core crushing and the bending and stretching of the sandwich structure the general responses of the sandwich structure could be split into three sequential steps stage i the one dimensional fluid structure interaction phase stage ii the core crushing phase stage iii the bending and stretching phase fleck and deshpande 2004 liang et al 2007 generally the front face sheets attain the maximum velocity in a very short period of time and the velocity and the displacement of the front face sheet in the bending and stretching phase are small compared with the core crushing phase if the back face sheet is fixed we neglect the accelerating process of the front face sheets and set the velocity to be zero in the bending and stretching phase for simplicity the response of sandwich structure is assumed to be a moveable plate with a given velocity profile as shown in fig 1 the problem is axisymmetric with the origin of the coordinate system locating at the initial center of the bubble the z direction perpendicular to the plate and x direction parallel to the plate as shown in fig 1 a the distance between the initial center of the bubble and the initial position of the plate is d the radius of the plate is l the mathematical expression of the velocity profile can be written by 1 v x t v 0 x ⅇ t t 0 e 2 t 2 t 0 0 t 2 t 0 where t 0 is a decaying constant and v 0 x 1 e 2 is the maximum velocity of the plate at the position x d the format of eq 1 is obtained by fitting the curves of one dimensional responses of sacrificial claddings to water blast jin et al 2017b according to taylor s analysis taylor 1963 the maximum velocity is proportional to the incident impulse the impulse generated by a tnt charge with weight w in kg at standoff distance d in meters is reid 1996 2 i 6 52 10 6 w 1 3 w 1 3 d 0 98 if we denote v m v 0 0 v 0 x can be given approximately by 3 v 0 x v m d d 2 x 2 0 98 3 theoretical and numerical model 3 1 basic equation for the fluid in the mid late fluid response of underwater explosion the fluid can be assumed to be inviscid irrotational and incompressible the assumptions result in a potential flow with velocity potential φ which is connected to the fluid velocity u by 4 u φ the incompressible condition leads to the laplace s equation 5 u 2 φ the equation of conservation of momentum can be integrated to yield bernoulli s equation 6 p l ρ φ t 1 2 φ 2 g z p where p is the pressure at infinity along z 0 fluid satisfies φ 0 and φ t 0 p l is the fluid pressure ρ is the fluid density and g is the acceleration due to the gravity at the bubble surface the continuity of the normal stresses leads to 7 p l p g p v where p g and p v are the non condensable gas and vapor partial pressure in the gas in this paper we neglect the effects of surface tension which is reasonable for the case of underwater explosion klaseboer et al 2005 by assuming that the non condensable gas is ideal and its expansion and compression processes are adiabatic the instantaneous pressure of the gas p g can be obtained by 8 p g p 0 v 0 v γ where p 0 is the initial pressure in the bubble and v 0 and v are the initial and instantaneous volume of the bubble γ is the specific heat ratio which is taken as 1 25 for explosion production of tnt klaseboer et al 2005 to relate the initial gas pressure to the weight of the charge the relationship in si units reads klaseboer et al 2005 9 p 0 1 39 10 5 w v 0 γ since the maximum bubble radius r m for tnt relating the weight of charge and explosion depth h can be expressed as reid 1996 10 r m 3 383 w 1 3 h 9 8 1 3 using rayleigh plesset equation for spherical oscillating bubbles rayleigh 1917 the initial radius of the bubble r0 can be obtained by 11 1 39 10 5 p p v 1 γ 1 3 w 4 π r m 3 γ 1 r 0 r m 3 γ 3 1 r 0 r m 3 0 the moving boundary follows the kinematic boundary condition which states that a fluid element on the surface will stay on it 12 φ n v s n where v s is the solid boundary velocity and n is the local unit normal vector pointing out of the fluid domain for different boundaries eq 12 can be transformed to 13 d r d t φ r on s b φ 0 r φ n φ n v s n r on s s where r is the position vector s b is the bubble surface s s is the surface of the solid boundary 3 2 numerical implementation the incompressible flow solver is based on the bem blake and gibson 1987 best and kucera 1992 wang et al 1996 klaseboer et al 2005 hsiao et al 2014 zhang and liu 2015 gong and klaseboer 2016 the laplace equation eq 5 is solved based on the green s theorem 14 ω φ 2 g g 2 φ d ω s n φ g g φ d s where ω is the domain of integration having elementary volume dω s is the boundary surface of ω with elementary surface ds φ is the harmonic in the fluid domain ω and g is green s function if g is selected to be harmonic everywhere but at some discrete points eq 14 can be simplified considerably for instance if 15 g 1 x y where x is a fixed point in the domain ω and y is a point on the boundary surface s eq 14 can be written by 16 λ φ x s φ y n g x y g x y ψ y d s where ψ φ n denotes the velocity component in the normal direction on the surface s and λ is the solid angle under which x sees the domain ω if x is a point in the fluid λ 4π if x is a point on a smooth portion of the boundary λ 2π if x is a point at a sharp corner on the boundary λ 4π by discretizing the surface s into elements and nodes eq 16 can be rewritten as a system of linear equations 17 h φ g ψ where g is the coefficient matrix representing the second term on the right hand side of eq 16 and h is the first term with the addition of the solid angle term on the left hand side φ and ψ are the column vectors of φ and ψ respectively when the surface is composed of different types of boundaries the unknown terms can be moved to the same side to make the equations solvable to generalize the analysis results the length pressure time velocity potential and velocity are normalized with respect to r m δp r m ρ δp 1 2 r m δp ρ 1 2 and δp ρ 1 2 where δp p p v is the reference pressure therefore the initial condition of the bubble motion is given by the strength parameter ε p 0 δp and the buoyancy parameter δ ρgr m δp 1 2 the lagrangian equation can be rewritten in dimensionless forms 18 d φ d t 1 ε v 0 v γ δ 2 z 1 2 u 2 r on s b d r d t u r on s b d r d t v r on s s where the overline variables indicate that the variables have been normalized and v is the dimensionless moveable boundary velocity to advance the solution in time eq 18 are solved by a third order runge kutta method the velocity potential and the position of the boundary at the new time step are obtained since the numerical solution of fredholm integral equation of the first kind which is used to calculate coefficient matrix g in eq 17 is susceptible to instability problems during the simulation the high frequency saw tooth instability may appear in the profile of the bubble boundary therefore a five point smoothing technique longuet higgins and cokelet 1976 is used to remove this instability in this paper on the other hand after updating the bubble boundary the nodes on the bubble may become too close to or too far away from each other especially during the process of jet formation which may also contribute to the numerical instabilities in present study to maintain the solution stable the re discretization procedure shervani tabar et al 2009 is used to remain the identical distances between the adjacent nodes 3 3 validation in order to verify the accuracy and precision of bem model we compare the results obtained by bem with the underwater explosion experiment by klaseboer et al 2005 in the experiment a tnt charge of 55 g is placed near a rigid vertical plate at a depth of 3 5 m the plate has a dimension of 1 5 m 1 5 m 0 05 m the standoff distance is 0 4 m 0 74 times the maximum bubble radius in the simulation the rigid plate is assumed to be circular and the gravity is ignored the convergent test of the bubble shape before the occurrence of the jet penetration is given in fig 2 where x and z are the coordinates in meters it indicates that the bubble element number n b 60 and the plate element number n s 41 can provide enough accuracy for the simulations the comparisons of the bubble shape evolutions between the simulations and the experiment are given in fig 3 since the axisymmetric model is assumed with the effects of buoyancy neglected the simulation results fail to capture asymmetric feature of the bubble shape in the experiment the oscillation time is 100 m s while it is 98 m s in the simulation despite this the bem simulations can still predict the bubble behaviors reasonably 4 results and discussions in this section the effects of the sandwich plate on the bubble behaviors are investigated the influences of the plate velocity profile the standoff distance and the scale of the sandwich plate are discussed in detail the tnt charge weight of 1 5 g exploding at a depth of 1 4 m is used in the simulations which is within the scope of the laboratory scale in this case r m 0 173 m ρ 1000 kg m3 g 10 m s2 p 1 14 105 pa and p v 2068 5 pa the corresponding strength parameter and nondimensional initial radius are ε 586 and r 0 0 0794 respectively 4 1 influence of the plate velocity profile the plate velocity profile is related to mechanical properties of the sandwich plate such as the core strength the mass and the stiffness of the face sheet in the simulation the standoff distance and the plate radius is taken as d 1 1 and l 1 5 respectively denote h x v 0 x t 0 1 3 e 2 and h m v m t 0 1 3 e 2 as the dimensionless core compression at point x d and 0 d which can be calculated by integrating eq 1 two situations are considered which fix h m and v m respectively we set h m 0 1 and v m 1 2 3 or 4 for situation 1 situation 2 corresponding to v m 3 and h m 0 05 0 15 0 25 or 0 35 4 1 1 situation 1 influence of v m v m is a parameter determined by the core strength the mass and the stiffness of the face sheet low core strength and low mass and stiffness of the face sheet will result in large v m fig 4 presents the pressure and velocity fields for v m 1 2 3 or 4 as seen in fig 4 a the pushing effects due to the motions of the plate which concave the bubble in the direction away from the plate are larger with increasing v m if v m is small e g v m 1 the water jet will be formed directing towards the plate with a high pressure and high velocity region developed below the bubble as shown in fig 4 b if v m 2 3 or 4 the bubble splits into two bubbles in the middle the splitting position is higher as v m increases the high pressure and high velocity region develop near the splitting positions in fig 5 the velocity of the plate center the kelvin impulse the migration of the bubble center and the bubble volume are compared for different v m the kelvin impulse i k is a dynamic concept which determines the gross bubble motion and defined as 19 i k ρ s b φ n d s the arrows in fig 5 represent the increasing directions of v m as v m increases the pushing effects due to the motions of the plate become larger and the kelvin impulse the maximum bubble volume and the bubble period decrease 4 1 2 situation 2 influence of h m h m is a parameter which is mainly determined by the core strength a low core strength corresponds to a large h m fig 6 shows the pressure and velocity fields for h m 0 05 0 15 0 25 or 0 35 similar to the effects of v m as seen in fig 6 a the pushing effects due to the motions of the plate which concave the bubble in the direction away from the plate are larger with increasing h m for h m 0 05 the water jet will be formed directing towards the plate with a high pressure and high velocity region developed below the bubble as shown in fig 6 b for h m 0 15 or 0 25 the bubble will split into multiple bubbles either in the middle or at the edge of the bubble for h m 0 35 the water jet will be formed directing away from the plate with the high pressure and high velocity region developed above the bubble fig 7 compares the velocity of the plate center the kelvin impulse the migration of the bubble center and the bubble volume for different h m as h m increases the attraction effects by the solid boundary become weaker and the kelvin impulse the maximum bubble volume and the bubble period decrease 4 2 influence of the standoff distance to discuss the influence of the standoff distance the standoff distance varies with the plate velocity profile and the plate radius unchanged we set l 1 5 h m 0 2 v m 2 and d 0 7 1 1 1 5 or 1 9 fig 8 illustrates the pressure and velocity fields for d 0 7 1 1 1 5 or 1 9 as seen in fig 8 a the pushing effects due to the motions of the plate which concave the bubble in the direction away from the plate are weaker with increasing d for d 1 9 the bubble almost keeps spherical which indicates that the boundary effects are small for d 0 7 or 1 1 the bubble splits into two bubbles in the middle with the high pressure and high velocity region developing near the splitting positions as shown in fig 8 b for d 1 5 or 1 9 the water jet will be formed directing away from the plate with the high pressure and high velocity region developed above the bubble in these cases the attraction effects by the solid boundary are very small and the bubble shapes are mainly determined by the pushing effects due to the motions of the plate fig 9 compares the velocity of the plate center the kelvin impulse the migration of the bubble center and the bubble volume for different d as d increases the maximum bubble volume and the bubble period increase the kelvin impulse and migration of the bubble center are a nonlinear function of d as shown in fig 9 b for t 0 3 the pushing effects due to the motions of the plate dominates the process and the kelvin impulse decreases with increasing d however for t 0 3 the attraction effects are large for d 0 7 resulting in a dramatic increase in the kelvin impulse 4 3 influence of the scale of the plate to discuss the influence of the scale of the plate the plate radius varies with the plate velocity profile and the standoff distance unchanged we set h m 0 2 v m 2 d 1 1 and l 0 5 1 0 1 5 or 2 0 fig 10 presents the pressure and velocity fields for l 0 5 1 0 1 5 or 2 0 as seen in fig 10 a the pushing effects due to the motions of the plate which concave the bubble in the direction away from the plate are stronger with increasing l for d 0 5 the bubble almost keeps spherical which indicates that the boundary effects are small the bubble splits into multiple bubbles either in the middle or at the edge of the bubble as shown in fig 10 b the high pressure and high velocity region develop near the splitting positions fig 11 compares the velocity of the plate center the kelvin impulse the migration of the bubble center and the bubble volume for different l as l increases the pushing effects due to the motions of the plate become stronger and the kelvin impulse the maximum bubble volume and the bubble period decrease 4 4 general bubble behaviors near a sandwich plate the key parameters relating the bubble behaviors to the properties of the sandwich plate are v m and h m in this section the general bubble behaviors are given as a function of v m and h m to provide an intuitive impression on how the motions of the plate influence the bubble behaviors fig 12 shows the effects of v m and h m on the bubble behaviors for d 0 7 and d 1 1 as shown in fig 12 three regimes are distinguished regime i corresponds to the jet directing towards the plate regime ii is a transition region in which the bubble will split into multiple bubbles or oscillate spherically without jet in regime iii the jet directs away from the plate generally if v m or h m is less than some threshold values the jet will direct towards the plate if h m is identical the sandwich plates with softer cores larger v m will alter the jet direction away from the plate regime ii is a transition phase between regime i and regime iii the momentum of the splitting bubbles can be directed either towards or away from the plate as for different standoff distances the maximum velocity partitioning regime i and regime ii is larger for d 0 7 and larger standoff distance will enlarge the region of regime ii the results indicate that the sandwich plate which can provide larger deformation and larger maximum deformation velocity is beneficial for altering the jet direction to direct away from the plate 5 conclusion the interaction between underwater explosion bubble and a moveable plate with basic characteristics of a sandwich structure is investigated through the bem the response of sandwich structures is assumed to be a moveable plate with a given velocity profile the velocity profile in the vertical direction of the plate has an exponential decaying form which is obtained by fitting the curves of one dimensional responses of sacrificial claddings to water blast the taylor s analysis is used to determine the relations of the maximum achievable velocity in the direction along the plate the effects of plate velocity profile the standoff distance and the scale of the plate on the bubble behaviors are presented within the scope of discussions the bubble volume and period are a decreasing function of v m h m and l and an increasing function of d the bubble behaviors near a sandwich plate are divided into three different regimes 1 jet directing towards the plate 2 the bubble will split into multiple bubbles or oscillate spherically without jet 3 jet directing away from the plate if the core of the sandwich plate is hard to compress or the thickness of the core is small the jet tends to directing towards the plate the sandwich plate which can provide larger deformation and larger maximum deformation velocity is beneficial for altering the jet direction to direct away from the plate the major limitation is that the current study decouples the response of the sandwich structure from the bubble load despite this the results are valuable for guiding the preliminary design of the protection structures a more detailed analysis which considers the full coupling process of underwater explosion bubble and the sandwich structure will be conducted in the near future declarations of interest none acknowledgements authors gratefully acknowledge the support for this work by project funded by china postdoctoral

23204,it is known that underwater sea soundscapes are produced by natural noise sources that occur on the water surface and subsurface water layers wind water splashes sprays and breaking waves produce a bubble layer which in turn produces downward directed sound radiation there are several additional sources that contribute to underwater noise levels mainly from commercial shipping and various anthropogenic sources both out at sea and in coastal areas recent research projects have investigated the effects of shipping traffic on the ambient soundscape in the baltic sea stressing the need for long term ambient soundscape monitoring using underwater noise measurements and modelling freely available underwater noise models allow for the evaluation of ambient noise levels produced on water surfaces as well as the creation of soundscape maps in this manuscript a simplistic underwater noise model is presented developed for evaluating and mapping the soundscape in shallow marine areas and for investigating the noise levels in different seasons keywords numerical modelling ambient underwater noise shipping baltic sea 1 introduction to compute shipping noise levels three parameters are generally required shipping density source levels of the ships and sound transmission losses urick 1983 a number of models exist for addressing underwater ambient noise etter 2012 however there has been a lack of simplistic analytical modelling tools developed for use by managers and for the assessment of the environmental status erbe et al 2012 in pursuing the need to model the soundscape of the shallow areas of the lithuanian baltic sea a simplistic underwater noise model for evaluating a soundscape in the shallow sea environment was developed the model is based on measurements obtained from vessel source spectra automatic identification system ais data hydro acoustic and geo acoustic information and environmental data such as bathymetry sediment types wind force and precipitation intensity the model consists of the three modules the first module determines the source sound pressure levels of the vessels from the ais data at each spatial location the second module computes the sound transmission losses from each vessel source taking hydro acoustical and geo acoustical factors into account the data are then stored in a spatial data grid composed of 100 100 m squared cells in each cell the noise footprint of all the surrounding and contributing sources are included the third module adds the noise contributions from the environmental factors wind and precipitation intensity to the sound pressure values acquired in each data cell in this paper the methods used for the development of the simplistic model and the first experimental results acquired within the lithuanian marine area are presented 2 methods and materials 2 1 ais data pre processing ais transmitted data carries information necessary for the identification and location of ships the position of the vessels their speed route and heading can be derived from this data viola et al 2017 for the purposes of the research ais data for 2015 was provided by the lithuanian maritime administration acquired at lithuanian marine area local ais receiver stations are installed at the nida klaipėda and šventoji locations 28 m 37 m and 39 m above sea level along the lithuanian baltic sea coast although some of the ais data are collected by ais receivers belonging to neighbouring countries at distances from the shore exceeding 65 75 km 35 40 nm the ais data were continuously stored on a server where actual data were only available for about 12 months the local station ais data records provided 7 453 284 separate ais data lines with a time resolution of 240 s for the period of 2015 the necessary vessel data were retrieved from available web based marine databases where the overall length of the ships loa gross tonnage gt and vessel types were of particular interest the ais records from coastal radio stations search and rescue aircraft navigation aids and other similar sources were rejected small sailing vessels less than 20 m were rejected on the assumption that they were wind powered the amount of rejected sailing vessels accounted for approximately less than 5 of the total vessels included in the ais data however large sailing vessels equipped with diesel engines were kept in the data set ship s data loa gt vessel type were assigned to the original ais data table to decrease computational time the ais data were further filtered reducing the time resolution of the individual ais readings to 960 s 2 2 ship noise source levels a number of ship source spectra models have been published i e ross 2005 wales and heitmeyer 2002

sound propagation modelling techniques which uses more conservative approximations comparing to models such as fast field program or ray program the uncertainties of acquired results increases up to 0

marine area in 2015 note that some vessels made more than one call and the average ship length was 131 51 m note size of the cells 100 100 m a highest ship source noise level was computed for a

average sound pressure levels in these areas revealed that noise levels considerably exceeds an average theoretical natural noise levels monthly natural average noise level equalled to 101 2 db re 1μpa2 during the period of january 2015 a summary of the acquired noise levels at the two different locations along with some of statistical properties are presented in table 2 the time series computed at the 1st square located away from the main shipping channel in the period of january 2015 are presented in fig 3 the maximal noise level at this location reached 164 1 db re 1μpa2 level showing close passage of the vessel to the sampling area and the average noise level reached the 134 8 db re 1μpa2 level median level 110 6 db re 1μpa2 confirming clear anthropogenic signatures in this area sound pressure time series were represented in the form of histograms for comparison of the ambient noise at two different locations inside and outside main shipping lanes histograms are presented in fig 4 the ambient noise as it found by number of investigators follows gaussian amplitude distribution in deep and shallow areas at least for the short time periods time periods lasting from seconds to minutes at longer time periods periods lasting from minutes to seasons of the year the variability of noise levels is added with relevance to biological shipping and wind noise fluctuations urick 1984 therefore the skewedness lack of symmetry of the acquired data represents the presence of high amplitude transients dekeling et al 2013 and the kurtosis represents roughness of noise that has possible effects on aquatic animals hawkins and popper 2016 the acquired data were tested for kurtosis where the test in the 1st square resulted in a kurtosis value of 2 6 normal gaussian distribution 3 while in the 2nd square a kurtosis resulted in a value of 2 9 platykurtic distributions the data were also tested for skewedness where the test resulted in values of 0 076 in the 1st square right skewed and 0 156 in the 2nd square left skewed confirming closer ship passages to the second location inside shipping channel 3 3 soundscape mapping modelled spatial noise data were rasterized and presented as the geographical soundscape surface map for the period of january 2015 fig 5 the soundscape map revealed noisiest area found throughout the territorial waters of lithuanian baltic sea area not exceeding 12 miles from the shore noisiest area at the territorial waters resulted due to highest shipping density in this area where main shipping lanes converge sound pressure levels in the entire area ranged from 101 85 to 144 49 db re 1μpa2 standard deviation 2 2213 db with the lowest values being the monthly average level of the natural ambient noise 4 discussion acquired ambient noise levels at two sites revealed different levels as these two survey locations were positioned at different areas in respect to the main shipping channels highest values were found within the 2nd square located in the shipping channel where the shipping lanes converge creating the densest traffic the results that were obtained can be roughly compared with the measurement results found within the swedish and polish baltic sea territories the broadband noise levels acquired during measurement campaigns at the stockholm archipelago august 2004 and gulf of gdansk regional project bias varied within 100 120 db re 1μpa2 in the summer seasons dalberg et al 2005 tegowski et al 2014 sigray et al 2016 a variation of the modelled levels in the lithuanian baltic sea area were slightly higher compared to the measured levels in other locations of the baltic sea these differences can be attributed to the different locations of measurement stations furthermore methodologies for the modelling might have differed from those applied in the measurements i e frequency range used this could also contribute to the difference between the modelling results and the measurements an input parameters and the noise mapping itself usually generates a certain amount of errors which as a result have an impact on the final noise mapping erbe et al 2015 as noted in the scientific literature while the ambient noise modelling is being completed the mean omnidirectional ambient noise levels may vary by up to 6 db depending on the processing and averaging techniques employed carey and evans 2011 different sound propagation modelling techniques as well at considerable distances generate some amount of uncertainties lee et al 1992 ainslie et al 2014 assuming these possible errors a calibration of the developed model using in situ measurements is crucial high resolution broadband data computations consisted of three relative computational steps computations of yearly source levels computations lasted for 48 h sound propagation computations of monthly data lasted for 120 h per 1 month data computations of spatial ambient noise levels and computations of the time series in two locations lasted for 36 h per 1 month data using a standard machine with cpu type intel core i7 3 60 ghz computational accuracy of the model i e ais data density and sound transmission loss range steps can be increased at the expense of the computational time and vice versa future developments of the model could employ spatial sound pressure levels i e the average sound pressure levels found within the relative areas of interest or throughout specific parts of these areas see fyhr and nikolopoulus 2016 model can be adjusted to compute noise levels within the one third octave bands see folegot et al 2016 the model s geo acoustical data for computations could be updated to account for different sediment data including hard bottom types along with sandy and muddy bottom coefficients it is notable that in the baltic sea areas the summer deep waveguide during the warm seasons develops below the seasonal thermocline thermocline depth 40 50 m as investigated the ducted sound propagation from distant sources in the deep summer wave guide take place klusek and lisimenka 2016 anthropogenic noise contribution in the summer waveguide can be computed using developed model by applying the ducted propagation scenario if the water column properties at the areas of interest are known however the lithuanian marine area occupies more than 50 of the territory having depths less than 50 m based on gis analysis where the ducted propagation of low frequency non wind dependent noise component possibly is highly attenuated due to cut off frequency phenomena 5 conclusions acquired broadband ambient noise levels varied between the two different locations one located in the shipping channel another remotely confirming that the highest noise levels found within the territorial sea area where the densest shipping traffic is found modelled ambient noise levels were roughly compared with the ambient noise levels measured in the baltic sea areas of the gulf of gdansk and the stockholm s archipelago sound pressure time series revealed slightly higher sound pressure levels in the lithuanian area where this difference can be attributed to the different locations of analysis and the different techniques involved for acquisition of the noise levels taking into consideration possible errors that can occur during the computational steps calibration of the developed model using the field measurements is crucial locally stored ship ais data as well shipping data available in online maritime databases and freely available mathematical

23204,it is known that underwater sea soundscapes are produced by natural noise sources that occur on the water surface and subsurface water layers wind water splashes sprays and breaking waves produce a bubble layer which in turn produces downward directed sound radiation there are several additional sources that contribute to underwater noise levels mainly from commercial shipping and various anthropogenic sources both out at sea and in coastal areas recent research projects have investigated the effects of shipping traffic on the ambient soundscape in the baltic sea stressing the need for long term ambient soundscape monitoring using underwater noise measurements and modelling freely available underwater noise models allow for the evaluation of ambient noise levels produced on water surfaces as well as the creation of soundscape maps in this manuscript a simplistic underwater noise model is presented developed for evaluating and mapping the soundscape in shallow marine areas and for investigating the noise levels in different seasons keywords numerical modelling ambient underwater noise shipping baltic sea 1 introduction to compute shipping noise levels three parameters are generally required shipping density source levels of the ships and sound transmission losses urick 1983 a number of models exist for addressing underwater ambient noise etter 2012 however there has been a lack of simplistic analytical modelling tools developed for use by managers and for the assessment of the environmental status erbe et al 2012 in pursuing the need to model the soundscape of the shallow areas of the lithuanian baltic sea a simplistic underwater noise model for evaluating a soundscape in the shallow sea environment was developed the model is based on measurements obtained from vessel source spectra automatic identification system ais data hydro acoustic and geo acoustic information and environmental data such as bathymetry sediment types wind force and precipitation intensity the model consists of the three modules the first module determines the source sound pressure levels of the vessels from the ais data at each spatial location the second module computes the sound transmission losses from each vessel source taking hydro acoustical and geo acoustical factors into account the data are then stored in a spatial data grid composed of 100 100 m squared cells in each cell the noise footprint of all the surrounding and contributing sources are included the third module adds the noise contributions from the environmental factors wind and precipitation intensity to the sound pressure values acquired in each data cell in this paper the methods used for the development of the simplistic model and the first experimental results acquired within the lithuanian marine area are presented 2 methods and materials 2 1 ais data pre processing ais transmitted data carries information necessary for the identification and location of ships the position of the vessels their speed route and heading can be derived from this data viola et al 2017 for the purposes of the research ais data for 2015 was provided by the lithuanian maritime administration acquired at lithuanian marine area local ais receiver stations are installed at the nida klaipėda and šventoji locations 28 m 37 m and 39 m above sea level along the lithuanian baltic sea coast although some of the ais data are collected by ais receivers belonging to neighbouring countries at distances from the shore exceeding 65 75 km 35 40 nm the ais data were continuously stored on a server where actual data were only available for about 12 months the local station ais data records provided 7 453 284 separate ais data lines with a time resolution of 240 s for the period of 2015 the necessary vessel data were retrieved from available web based marine databases where the overall length of the ships loa gross tonnage gt and vessel types were of particular interest the ais records from coastal radio stations search and rescue aircraft navigation aids and other similar sources were rejected small sailing vessels less than 20 m were rejected on the assumption that they were wind powered the amount of rejected sailing vessels accounted for approximately less than 5 of the total vessels included in the ais data however large sailing vessels equipped with diesel engines were kept in the data set ship s data loa gt vessel type were assigned to the original ais data table to decrease computational time the ais data were further filtered reducing the time resolution of the individual ais readings to 960 s 2 2 ship noise source levels a number of ship source spectra models have been published i e ross 2005 wales and heitmeyer 2002

sound propagation modelling techniques which uses more conservative approximations comparing to models such as fast field program or ray program the uncertainties of acquired results increases up to 0

contribution then is added to the time intervals obtained using equations 10 and 11 2 7 noise mapping and data statistics post processing acquired spatial underwater noise data broadband levels in 0 01 10 khz bands were interpolated see hatch et al 2008 using arcgis geostatistical analyst software using kernel interpolation uses non euclidean distance approach and illustrated as a geographical map esri 2017 the histograms of time series were plotted to visualize the statistics of modelled ambient noise time series as well the kurtosis and skewedness of the data sets were computed for analysis mathworks 2018 3 results 3 1 ship noise sources and sound propagation analysis of the shipping ais data revealed that a total number of 2413 different ships made calls in the lithuanian marine area in 2015 note that some vessels made more than one call and the average ship length was 131 51 m note size of the cells 100 100 m a highest ship source noise level was computed for a merchant vessel of 324 85 m sailing with a speed of 22 knots radiating a source level of 211 45 db re 1μpa2m2 an overall summary of the ships data used for noise modelling is presented in table 1 an example of the modelled ship noise source spectra of the mid size ro ro type vessel of 25 993 gt loa 198 99 m sailing at speed of 20 4 knots is presented in fig 1 computed ship noise source spectral levels had a broad peak at the low frequency bands of 10 400 hz with a 6 8 db roll off per decade in the higher frequency bands an example of a merchant vessel radiated broadband sound propagation having a source level of 160 35 db re 1μpa2m2 in the summer season spherical mode stripping sound propagation loss 300 m range steps with shoaling bathymetry from 46 6 to 8 1 m elevation angle α 0 08 presented in fig 2 middle size merchant ship radiated noise propagation computations revealed that significant noise levels are registered at the distances of above 3 5 km from noise source in low frequency bands 500hz at the shallow areas of lithuanian baltic sea 3 2 ambient noise levels and data statistics the ambient noise levels were acquired in two squares see section methods computed average sound pressure levels in these areas revealed that noise levels considerably exceeds an average theoretical natural noise levels monthly natural average noise level equalled to 101 2 db re 1μpa2 during the period of january 2015 a summary of the acquired noise levels at the two different locations along with some of statistical properties are presented in table 2 the time series computed at the 1st square located away from the main shipping channel in the period of january 2015 are presented in fig 3 the maximal noise level at this location reached 164 1 db re 1μpa2 level showing close passage of the vessel to the sampling area and the average noise level reached the 134 8 db re 1μpa2 level median level 110 6 db re 1μpa2 confirming clear anthropogenic signatures in this area sound pressure time series were represented in the form of histograms for comparison of the ambient noise at two different locations inside and outside main shipping lanes histograms are presented in fig 4 the ambient noise as it found by number of investigators follows gaussian amplitude distribution in deep and shallow areas at least for the short time periods time periods lasting from seconds to minutes at longer time periods periods lasting from minutes to seasons of the year the variability of noise levels is added with relevance to biological shipping and wind noise fluctuations urick 1984 therefore the skewedness lack of symmetry of the acquired data represents the presence of high amplitude transients dekeling et al 2013 and the kurtosis represents roughness of noise that has possible effects on aquatic animals hawkins and popper 2016 the acquired data were tested for kurtosis where the test in the 1st square resulted in a kurtosis value of 2 6 normal gaussian distribution 3 while in the 2nd square a kurtosis resulted in a value of 2 9 platykurtic distributions the data were also tested for skewedness where the test resulted in values of 0 076 in the 1st square right skewed and 0 156 in the 2nd square left skewed confirming closer ship passages to the second location inside shipping channel 3 3 soundscape mapping modelled spatial noise data were rasterized and presented as the geographical soundscape surface map for the period of january 2015 fig 5 the soundscape map revealed noisiest area found throughout the territorial waters of lithuanian baltic sea area not exceeding 12 miles from the shore noisiest area at the territorial waters resulted due to highest shipping density in this area where main shipping lanes converge sound pressure levels in the entire area ranged from 101 85 to 144 49 db re 1μpa2 standard deviation 2 2213 db with the lowest values being the monthly average level of the natural ambient noise 4 discussion acquired ambient noise levels at two sites revealed different levels as these two survey locations were positioned at different areas in respect to the main shipping channels highest values were found within the 2nd square located in the shipping channel where the shipping lanes converge creating the densest traffic the results that were obtained can be roughly compared with the measurement results found within the swedish and polish baltic sea territories the broadband noise levels acquired during measurement campaigns at the stockholm archipelago august 2004 and gulf of gdansk regional project bias varied within 100 120 db re 1μpa2 in the summer seasons dalberg et al 2005 tegowski et al 2014 sigray et al 2016 a variation of the modelled levels in the lithuanian baltic sea area were slightly higher compared to the measured levels in other locations of the baltic sea these differences can be attributed to the different locations of measurement stations furthermore methodologies for the modelling might have differed from those applied in the measurements i e frequency range used this could also contribute to the difference between the modelling results and the measurements an input parameters and the noise mapping itself usually generates a certain amount of errors which as a result have an impact on the final noise mapping erbe et al 2015 as noted in the scientific literature while the ambient noise modelling is being completed the mean omnidirectional ambient noise levels may vary by up to 6 db depending on the processing and averaging techniques employed carey and evans 2011 different sound propagation modelling techniques as well at considerable distances generate some amount of uncertainties lee et al 1992 ainslie et al 2014 assuming these possible errors a calibration of the developed model using in situ measurements is crucial high resolution broadband data computations consisted of three relative computational steps computations of yearly source levels computations lasted for 48 h sound propagation computations of monthly data lasted for 120 h per 1 month data computations of spatial ambient noise levels and computations of the time series in two locations lasted for 36 h per 1 month data using a standard machine with cpu type intel core i7 3 60 ghz computational accuracy of the model i e ais data density and sound transmission loss range steps can be increased at the expense of the computational time and vice versa future developments of the model could employ spatial sound pressure levels i e the average sound pressure levels found within the relative areas of interest or throughout specific parts of these areas see fyhr and nikolopoulus 2016 model can be adjusted to compute noise levels within the one third octave bands see folegot et al 2016 the model s geo acoustical data for computations could be updated to account for different sediment data including hard bottom types along with sandy and muddy bottom coefficients it is notable that in the baltic sea areas the summer deep waveguide during the warm seasons develops below the seasonal thermocline thermocline depth 40 50 m as investigated the ducted sound propagation from distant sources in the deep summer wave guide take place klusek and lisimenka 2016 anthropogenic noise contribution in the summer waveguide can be computed using developed model by applying the ducted propagation scenario if the water column properties at the areas of interest are known however the lithuanian marine area occupies more than 50 of the territory having depths less than 50 m based on gis analysis where the ducted propagation of low frequency non wind dependent noise component possibly is highly attenuated due to cut off frequency phenomena 5 conclusions acquired broadband ambient noise levels varied between the two different locations one located in the shipping channel another remotely confirming that the highest noise levels found within the territorial sea area where the densest shipping traffic is found modelled ambient noise levels were roughly compared with the ambient noise levels measured in the baltic sea areas of the gulf of gdansk and the stockholm s archipelago sound pressure time series revealed slightly higher sound pressure levels in the lithuanian area where this difference can be attributed to the different locations of analysis and the different techniques involved for acquisition of the noise levels taking into consideration possible errors that can occur during the computational steps calibration of the developed model using the field measurements is crucial locally stored ship ais data as well shipping data available in online maritime databases and freely available mathematical models allows to build the surface soundscape maps for shallow coastal areas where additional properties such as geo acoustical hydro acoustical and environmental data can be included acknowledgements
