5325,considering the climate change the role of edaphic drivers for the distribution of cold hardy conifers norway spruce picea abies l karst and scots pine pinus sylvestris l is crucial even though both species reach latitude 70on p abies forest line is located at exceptionally lower latitudes in fennoscandia compared to p sylvestris tree line hence the divergence in mafic basic and felsic acidic lithologies and thereby physicochemical properties of parent glacial tills may play a critical role in tree species distributions the objective of this study was to explore soil water content swc and nutrient regimes in finnish lapland by transecting the main lithological units mafic central lapland greenstone belt clgb in the south and felsic lapland granulite belt lgb in the north eight one ha in size plots were sampled at 10 m intervals for soil chemistry and texture and measured for swc gamma ray electrical conductivity temperature and matric potential in binary decision tree dt analysis soil physics explained the growth sites of p abies and p sylvestris with 97 accuracy the most important variable being swc the constraint for p sylvestris was swc 0 24 m3m 3 based to the soil chemistry dt 95 4 of the p abies and p sylvestris growth sites were correctly classified the most important variables were cr ti mn and p distribution of conifers follows lithology such that p abies occupies mesic wet tills derived from ultramafic and mafic rocks of the clgb whereas p sylvestris thrives only on dry and coarse textured often granitoid tills we argue that dry and nutrient poor tills of felsic garnet gneisses of the lgb constitute a dispersal barrier for p abies the above tree species specific constraints provide guidance for future dispersal models keywords picea abies pinus sylvestris soil water content geochemistry lithology 1 introduction understanding spatial variability in soil water content swc and nutrients is vitally important with respect to distribution of tree species and is an interest in future climate scenario modelling conducted in different spatial scales one of the intriguing questions is the position of the northern conifer forest and tree lines picea abies ssp obovata forms the coniferous tree limit reaching 66 20 69 25 n in eurasia and siberia whereas the tree limit of p sylvestris remains latitudes 64 30 66 macdonald et al 2000 payette et al 2002 in fennoscandia the northern limits of p abies and p sylvestris both reach latitude 70on but the forest line of p abies is located at significantly lower latitudes than that of p sylvestris macdonald et al 2000 sutinen et al 2005 even though p abies is regarded as a climax species in the aspen birch pine spruce successional sequence it is absent over large regions in the northern boreal forests of lapland whereas p sylvestris is a dominant species with birch betula pendula roth and b pubescens ehrh as a principal associate sutinen et al 2005 2007a this discrepancy has seldom been considered as a result of lithological contrasts mafic felsic the holocene spread of tree species and forest line fluctuations are considered predominantly to be associated with climate driven factors moe 1970 eronen and hyvärinen 1987 kremenetski et al 1999 barber et al 2000 macdonald et al 2000 kullman 2002 kultti et al 2006 payette et al 2002 kirdyanov et al 2003 giesecke and bennett 2004 körner and paulsen 2004 väliranta et al 2011 parducci et al 2012 tollefsrud et al 2015 on the other hand the temperature concept has been challenged by scherrer and guisan 2019 showing that soil properties are important ecological factors explaining species distributions furthermore reich et al 2018 demonstrated that swc plays an important role in photosynthesis of trees based on the radiocarbon 14c dates of subfossil logs p sylvestris spread northern fennoscandia 8 3 7 kyr bp and reached its maximum spreading 6 4 kyr bp followed by gradual retreat to its modern range limit eronen and hyvärinen 1987 payette et al 2002 sutinen et al 2007b evidenced by subfossil trunks the expansion of p abies to sites north of the modern treeline in eurasian russia occurred 9 8 kyr bp but the retreat of p abies to its current treeline position occurred 4 3 kyr bp kremenetski et al 1998 macdonald et al 2000 also p abies macrofossils well above the present alpine tree limit in the caledonian mountain range in central sweden mount åreskutan indicate that spruce has been a vital part in the forest spread during the late glacial and early holocene time period 8 14 kyr bp kullman 2002 another case of p abies ice free refugia between 22 000 and 17 700 years ago in andøya northern norway has been presented by parducci et al 2012 in addition isolated patches of p abies have remained since late glacial yielding ages of 10 100 10 750 cal bp north of the present treeline on the unglaciated terrains in ne european russia väliranta et al 2011 these observations challenge the conceptual migration model suggesting that front like advance of p abies reached its northernmost range limit as late as 3 3 3 kyr bp in fennoscandia moe 1970 kremenetski et al 1999 giesecke and bennett 2004 cf macdonald et al 2000 payette et al 2002 tollefsrud et al 2015 in addition no p abies trunks megafossils have been found beyond its tree limit on felsic lithologies e g sutinen et al 2007b and still today p abies is absent on tills with low swc and derived from felsic ganulitic rocks sutinen et al 2005 therefore the spread and the present forest line of p abies in northern fennoscandia may be constrained by the geological features and thereby soil physical and chemical properties swc and soil nutrients are two of the most important causative edaphic factors that control tree growth species composition and diversity on regional scale reimann et al 1998 richardson 1998 sutinen et al 2002a närhi et al 2011 2014 hence the regional variability in the swc and nutrient regimes are critical drivers for the species specific distribution and sometimes treeline and forest line positions as well sutinen et al 2005 2012 even though swc varies seasonally the pattern of spatial variability does not change with time when the observations are ranked according to the magnitude of the swc vachaud et al 1985 starks et al 2006 sutinen et al 2007c biswas and si 2011 brocca et al 2012 liwata et al 2014 he et al 2019 therefore swc is a crucial species specific driver in the northern boreal forests see reich et al 2018 scherrer and guisan 2019 with respect to climate change ipcc 2019 transpiration of p abies may be more vulnerable to low swc and photosynthesis activity of the boreal tree species is depending on the swc reich et al 2018 even though variations in the soil water availability and the length of the growing season are controlled along with temperature by the thickness of the snowpack and the timing of the snowmelt groisman and davies 2001 mcdonald et al 2004 sturm et al 2005 euskirchen et al 2006 sutinen et al 2007c hallinger et al 2010 liwata et al 2014 the role of hydrology has seldom been discussed with respect to distribution of conifers to tackle the unawareness of the importance of geology we focused on soil physics and geochemistry on p abies and p sylvestris growth sites across the major lithological units mafic central lapland greenstone belt clgb and felsic lapland granulite belt lgb in finnish lapland fig 1 to see differences between p abies and p sylvestris distribution with respect to swc and or geochemistry the electromagnetic em radar radiation and induction measurements of the soil dielectric ɛ gamma ray γ and electrical conductivity σ provided us a basis to assess physical soil driven factors including particle size and matric potential as contributors to the distribution of p abies and p sylvestris we also provided data on plant available water soluble nutrients and geochemical aqua regia elements through the clgb lgb transect we upscaled our analyses to the national airborne geophysics and geochemistry databases over northern finland it is hypothesised that i p sylvestris is only suited on well drained soils whereas ii p abies is absent on dry and acidic nutrient poor soils and hence p abies forest line at the edge of the clgb is geological not explained by climatic factors or the holocene spread history to show hydrological differences between the growth sites occupied by p sylvestris and p abies we provide iii inter seasonal swc monitoring data as well as iv simulation experiment of swc at two geologically contrasting sites 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area in finnish lapland 67 20 n and 68 49 n 25 45 e and 27 48 e fig 1 is characterized by gently undulating glacial terrain reaching 250 380 m a s l elevation but with a range of treeless granulite fells i e high altitude and strong relief features above forest line that reaches 450 718 m a s l the climate is cold and humid with a long term 1971 2000 annual mean temperature between 1 c and 2 c the average temperature of the coldest month january varying between 12 c and 14 c while that of the warmest month july between 14 and 16 c the length of the frost free period is 60 70 days and the growing season is about 75 days the annual mean precipitation varies between 500 and 550 mm with the maximum seasonal sum in summer and precipitation above 0 1 mm on approximately 200 days a year vajda and venäläinen 2003 summer precipitation exceeds evaporation by about 50 mm snow cover is present 200 220 days of the year and nearly 60 of the annual precipitation falls as snow and snowmelt is the major contributor to the runoff we transected from sw to ne and with eight study sites the main lithological units in finnish lapland mafic central lapland greenstone belt clgb and felsic lapland granulite belt lgb fig 1 table 1 lehtonen et al 1998 tuisku et al 2006 the lgb was thrust sw onto the clgb at ca 1 9 ga shearing and strongly deforming the rocks contributing to banded amphibolites migmatitic garnet biotite and arkosic gneisses tuisku et al 2006 the clgb is typified by mafic volcanic and ultramafic volcanogenic rocks komatite and sedimentary rocks volcanic rocks are located in the west and east and those are separated by metasedimentary rocks lehtonen et al 1998 a set of mafic and felsic rocks constitutes a basis for the contrasting geochemical and thereby soil nutritional and hydrological regimes reimann et al 1998 middleton et al 2011 sutinen et al 2019 across the p abies forest line at southern southwestern edge of the lgb sutinen et al 2005 the fine fraction content of parent tills may reach 50 in clgb but may be less than 30 in lgb hänninen 1997 it should be noted that the latest weichselian ice flow was from sw to ne sutinen et al 2005 närhi et al 2014 hence the glacial dispersal eventually has smoothened some of the lithological imprints tills are generally superimposing the bedrock as a 1 4 m thick veneer but the tops of the fells frequently are frost shattered bare rock with no or scarce vegetation the podzol spodosol is mainly a typic haplocryod sutinen et al 2002a with respect to geobotany carex globularis epilobium angustifolium equisetum sylvaticum geranium sylvaticum hylocomium splendens linnaea borealis luzula pilosa lycopodium annotinum melampyrum sylvaticum salix phylicifolia solidago virgaurea sorbus aucuparia l european rowan trientalis europaea are diagnostic species for clgb närhi et al 2011 on the other hand calluna vulgaris cetraria islandica cladina spp cladonia spp dicranum spp are typical species on dry sandy tills derived from felsic garnet gneisses of the lgb närhi et al 2011 field measurements and sampling was conducted on eight study sites fig 1 table 1 at each site a one hectar grid with 10 m micro site separation was established n 100 microsites soil physical properties including swc measured as dielectric permittivity ɛ gamma radiation γ soil electrical conductivity σ and temperature t were measured in june july 1995 at each micro site but soil samples were only collected on every 3rd micro site location resulting in 30 36 soil samples on each study site total n 305 to provide long term hydrological perspective for lithologically contrasting tills swc was monitored through 2007 2017 at three sites vuotso äältövittikko and vaalolehto table 1 in addition at vuotso and vaalolehto table 1 the soil matric potential ψ and ɛ were measured within controlled greenhouse experiments where precipitation simulation irrigation was applied such that 30 years minimum and maximum precipitation was applied 1971 2000 vajda and venäläinen 2003 on lithologically and texturally contrasting glacial tills in see table 1 upscaling the site scale observations to regional scale the geological survey of finland airborne geophysical airo et al 2014 and low density till geochemical data app 1 sample per km2 salminen and tarvainen 1995 were utilised 2 2 field measurement swc was determined with three measurement configurations of ɛ firstly using a sir 8 radar gssi north salem nh usa with a 100 mhz transmitter tx antenna and a 300 mhz receiver rx antenna using a constant 3 m separation between tx and rx hänninen 1997 this configuration rsad radar surface arrival detection relies on the principle of recording the time that the refracted em ground wave takes to travel from tx to rx and the travel time is governed by the ɛ ɛrsad properties of the soil hänninen 1997 the radar system is connected in an all terrain vehicle and the average speed of 4 km h was used during the measurements the depth range is top 50 cm of soil secondly as a point wise reference tdr time domain reflectometry trase model 6050x1 soil moisture equipment corp ca usa see brocca et al 2012 was used to measure the ɛ ɛtrase of the soil by determining the travel time and dissipation respectively of an electromagnetic pulse launched along parallel metallic 15 cm long probes inserted into the soil thirdly long term monitoring of ɛ was done with campbell cs615 and cs616 tdr probes soil temperature recorded with t107 probes sensors were installed horizontally to three 20 40 and 60 cm or 10 30 50 cm depths at each site having lateral shifts of 30 cm the measurements were automatically logged with cr1000 data loggers campbell scientific logan ut there are several empirical calibration formulas e g topp et al 1980 to the ratio between the ɛ and swc we applied the one by sutinen 1992 as follows swc 100 0 0132 0 0223 ɛ 2 72 10 4 ɛ2 1 87 10 6 ɛ3 swc is one of the major contributors to the intensity variations of gamma ray γ flux from glacial materials and a major part 90 of gamma radiation is emitted from the upper 30 cm of the soil grasty 1997 along with swc also soil texture i e sand silt and clay content bulk density soil organic matter content as well as mineralogy contribute to the gamma radiation heggemann et al 2017 hence the differentiation of the root zone soil water regimes under p sylvestris and p abies stands can be achieved with terrestrial and at landscape scale with airborne γ measurements grasty 1997 hyvönen et al 2003 sutinen et al 2005 the gamma ray flux from the glacial tills of stands dominated either by p sylvestris or p abies was measured with a portable gs 256 gamma spectrometer geophysica brno czech the spectral windows total counts γtot potassium γk uranium γu and thorium γth of the gs 256 are equal to those applied by the airborne gamma spectrometer of geological survey of finland hyvönen et al 2003 sutinen et al 2005 fig 2 a at each measuring point a 1 min counting time was applied in addition soil electrical conductivity σ and soil temperature t10 10 cm depth were measured at all micro sites the σ was obtained inductively with em31 device geonics ltd mississauga canada and t10 with a prima long meter amarel gmbh and co kreuzwertheim germany at the greenhouse experiments in vaalolehto and vuotsonkangas soil ψ see ceramic cup tensiometers in whalley et al 2013 was measured from mechanically piloted holes with thermolink porous ceramic sensor decagon devices inc pullman wa usa along with soil ɛtrase measurements a total of 220 microsites included 47 dry and 47 wet irrigation spots as we all 16 ambient spots for both lithologies 2 3 soil chemical and particle size analyses sampling for soil chemistry and particle size determination was conducted at a depth of 0 20 cm of the mineral soil for total and

mm and sedimentation method for determination of the finest fractions after digestion in hydrogen peroxide for removal of organic material see gee and bauder 1986 hillel 1998 2 4 statistical analyses decision trees dt provide an effective nonparametric method to identify important variables and interactions of large and complex datasets breiman et al 1983 binary classification trees were computed with the statistical software r version 2 12 r development core team 2011 package rpart version 3 1 terry et al 2011 the response variable being tree species p sylvestris p abies which was determined in situ by recognizing the tree species of the nearest 5 m distance from the micro site individual mature tree 40 y in case of clear cutting the tree species was determined based on a tree stump four different dts were constructed with different set of explanatory variables i grain size distribution ii soil chemistry iii physics and iv all soil variables combined the fourth dt total in table 3 was constructed to see which single parameter can best explain the distribution of p sylvestris and p abies the data was randomly divided into 50 training and 50 testing sets in the training phase of the dt for each split only one variable is chosen giving the best split at each node breiman et al 1983 from all possible binary splits of the data amongst each explanatory variable the splits with highest improvement to node purity are selected by the algorithm to avoid overfitting the trees were pruned by requiring minimum node size six and by using the highest complexity parameter required minimum improvement to overall node purity to split node with only minor classification error increase an overall agreement and kappa were calculated as accuracy measures from the testing data correlations between the soil variables were analyzed calculating the spearman rank correlation coefficient rs 3 results and discussion 3 1 grainsize the inserted grain size variables and their statistics are presented in table 3 grainsize dt predicted the growth sites occupied by p abies and p sylvestris with 91 overall accuracy kappa 0 789 fig 3 the most indicative variables being 06 mm 0 2 mm 0 6 mm and 2 mm the first bifurcation node in the grainsize dt was 0 06 mm 33 77 by spliting p abies into the soils with more fines the second bifurcation node indicates p abies to be adapted to sites with fine sand 75 14 the cumulative proportion of the fine fraction content i e silt and clay i e 0 06 mm fig 4 is generally higher for the growth sites of p abies thus agreeing with the previous studies showing the fine fraction content of parent tills may reach 50 in clgb but may be less than 30 in lgb e g hänninen 1997 although fine fraction content was explaining factor for p sylvestris and p abies growth sites in some cases the hydrology is controlled by the coarse fraction content 20 mm via by pass flow sutinen et al 2007c conventional particle size analysis and sand silt clay soil classification do not take into account the role of coarse fraction content hillel 1998 and therefore mapping of spatial distribution of swc can be more reliably carried out with ɛ reference based classification of the airborne γ data hyvönen et al 2003 3 2 soil water soil physical variables are summarized in table 2 the density histograms fig 4 demonstrate that swc obtained via rsad and tdr trase measurements and soil γtot via terrestrial gamma ray spectrometry hänninen 1997 hyvönen et al 2003 sutinen et al 2005 was strongly discriminating the growth sites occupied by p abies and p sylvestris swc was significantly greater in till of p abies stands on mafic clgb compared to that of p sylvestris stands in the felsic lgb proper see airborne γtot in fig 2 suggesting that soil moisture availability is one of the most important drivers for the distribution of p abies like several other studies sutinen et al 2002a hyvönen et al 2003 the present results demonstrate p abies is adapted to a much wider soil moisture regime swc 0 15 0 50 m3m 3 compared to that of p sylvestris swc 0 04 0 25 m3m 3 p abies seems to be able to grow even on saturated sites swc 0 44 m3m 3 but is absent on sites at the dry end of the soil moisture gradient swc 0 15 m3m 3 in accordance to our results the sporadic spruce trees stands beyond the northern forest line have been found to be associated with edaphically moist sites oksanen 1995 a good example of these sporadic sites is the palloaivi appinite fig 9 providing soil p resources along with sufficient amount of swc for p abies see locations in oksanen 1995 the soil physics dt revealed the ɛrsad and ɛtrase and soil γtot variables to be the most indicative physical variables and the p abies and p sylvestris growth sites were classified with 97 overall accuracy kappa 0 918 fig 5 table 3 the physics dt generates two branches ɛrsad 13 05 from the first bifurcation node fig 5 in this case and when the ɛ swc conversion by sutinen 1992 is applied the corresponding constraining swc 0 236 m3m 3 we consider that swc 0 24 m3m 3 is limiting factor particularly for p sylvestris picea abies has tolerance for wide range of swc up to swc 0 50 m3m 3 sutinen et al 2002a this numerical site characteristics is in agreement with previous findings indicating that p sylvestris is dominant tree species on drier habitats with coarse rocky and sandy soils richardson 1998 kremenetski et al 1999 macdonald et al 2000 sutinen et al 2002a similarly to the constraining swc for p sylvestris found here swc 0 24 m3m 3 figs 4 and 5 the experimental research has shown that long lasting 8 5 weeks soil saturation results in fatal hypoxia for p sylvestris seedlings repo et al 2017 it has been observed within forest management including site preparation that artificial regeneration with p sylvestris had failed on tills with swc 0 25 m3m 3 sutinen et al 2002b the stabilisation of the forest plantations in the northern boreal climatic zone needs up to 20 years in fennoscandia hansson and karlman 1997 yet p sylvestris diebacks can be seen at the age of more than 12 years sutinen et al 2002b site preparation such as marttiini ploughing is not able to change the soil water conditions rather the physical properties of glacial tills outweigh the impact of site preparations sutinen et al 2002b 2019 and hence time stability of soil water largely govern the site suitability for p sylvestris sutinen et al 2007c liwata et al 2014 see also hyvönen et al 2003 3 3 gamma ray assessment of swc in the soil physics dt the soil γtot forms the second bifurcation node explaining the growth sites by p abies and p sylvestris fig 5 since the attenuation of the gamma ray flux is due to swc grasty 1997 hyvönen et al 2003 sutinen et al 2005 the high γtot values are diagnostic to dry soils at p sylvestris sites and low values to mesic wet soils at p abies sites fig 4 soil water content as expressed with ɛrsad is significantly correlated to γtot rs 0 80 p 0 05 and γk rs 0 78 p 0 05 respectively our results are in accordance with hyvönen et al 2003 who found soil γk to be significantly greater under p sylvestris stands mean γk 1 58 compared those formed of p abies mean γk 1 06 regional distribution of soil moisture regimes as expressed with the airborne radiometric data is clearly associated with lithologies such that clgb is typified by low soil γtot and lg proper by high soil γtot fig 2a hence 60 80 km wide lgb figs 1 and 2 constitutes a regional barrier for p abies sutinen et al 2005 in a similar manner as dry and acidic soils for p glauca in canadian subarctic timoney et al 1993 in addition the high soil γtot in north westernmost finnish lapland the finnish arm location in fig 2a may indicate potential barrier for p abies as denoted by the lack of p abies megafossils at the pousujärvi site 68 51 n 21 10 e sutinen et al 2007b in the peat chrono stratigraphy the lowermost and the oldest subfossil log of betula ssp yielded an age of 8810 cal bp subfossil p sylvestris logs yielded 5730 5900 cal bp thus agreeing with the previous findings indicating presence of p sylvestris between 6000 4000 cal bp beyond its present treeline eronen and hyvärinen 1987 kultti et al 2006 in their review giesecke and bennett 2004 listed numerous sites with p abies pollen observations and one of them mukkavaara 68 92 n 21 00 e is close to pousujärvi site see location in fig 2a in spite of pollen dispersal in the area no subfossils of p abies were found at pousujärvi suggesting that p abies may not have spread into the north westernmost finnish lapland during the holocene sutinen et al 2007b 3 4 inter seasonal variability of swc based on the swc monitoring conducted in 2007 2017 fig 6 8 10 weeks long soil saturation swc 0 35 0 40 m3m 3 is common on fine grained tills at the vaalolehto and äältövittikko sites as well as other fine grained tills of the clgb sutinen et al 2007c liwata et al 2014 in contrast soil saturation is absent at sandy till at vuotso site fig 6 and other sandy granitoid tills such as those on the lgb sutinen et al 2007c liwata et al 2014 since majority 60 of the annual precipitation falls as snow and snowmelt is the most critical period for soil saturation such that one meter snowpack thickness results in ten weeks saturation for mafic tills of the clgb sutinen et al 2007c in addition to being a crucial factor with regard to winter soil temperature snowmelt contributes to the major part of the seasonal soil water in the northern hemisphere groisman and davies 2001 vajda et al 2006 sutinen et al 2007c and provides necessary soil water reserves for the initiation of root water uptake in late winter and early spring sutinen et al 2009 hence variability in snowpack thickness may be a critical driver for plant communities and tree species specific dispersion sturm et al 2005 hallinger et al 2010 swc varies seasonally due to climatic factors such as precipitation snowmelt as well as transpiration of forest canopy and vegetation groisman and davies 2001 euskirchen et al 2006 vajda et al 2006 sutinen et al 2007c 2009 the spatial variability of swc pattern however does not change with time when the observations are ranked according to the magnitude of the swc vachaud et al 1985 this so called time stability of swc applies not only to agricultural soils vachaud et al 1985 but also to forest soils through the boreal gradient sutinen et al 2007c liwata et al 2014 and large scale catchments brocca et al 2012 as well as to soils in high elevation mountain forests he et al 2019 liwata et al 2014 indicated the time stability phenomena including vaalolehto äältövittikko and vuotso sites fig 6 with spearman s rank correlation coefficient rs 0 94 0 95 p 0 05 during long term inter seasonal 2002 2010 automatic monitoring of swc trough boreal gradient 60 68 n in a similar manner sutinen et al 2007 demonstrated intra seasonal 2001 time stability of fine grained glacial till at äältövittikko site with rs 0 83 0 93 p 0 05 even if the precipitation in july 2001 was twice as high as the long term average preferential flow occurs through macro pores of living or decayed root systems and through by pass flow attributed to subsurface coarse fraction content 20 mm stoniness governing the hydraulic characteristics of a site sutinen et al 2007c 3 5 swc water holding capacity the measurements done in the microsites of the greenhouse irrigation experiment at litologically and texturally contrasting vuotso occupyied by p sylvestris and vaalolehto sites occupyied by p abies fig 7 table 1 demonstrated that soil ψ is diagnostic parameter for low swc drought glacial tills the soil ψ is less sensitive to high swcs which ɛ measurements tdr and or rsad can capture fig 7 hänninen 1997 sutinen et al 2007c see whalley et al 2013 the swc of sandy till at vuotso remained low swc 0 27 m3m 3 even with the highest precipitation i e simulated maximum for 30 years 1971 2000 vajda and venäläinen 2003 on the other hand the swc of fine grained till at vaalolehto site remained high swc 0 22 m3m 3 even for the minimum precipitation the ψ of the sandy till at vuotso from 7 to 33 kpa fig 7 differs markedly from silty till at vaalolehto 3 to 10 kpa suggesting that p sylvestris is able to tolerate drought better than p abies yet suffers hypoxia at high swcs repo et al 2017 see fig 6 vaalolehto hosted native p abies forest with an admixture of birch b pubescens until 1950 when the forest 1000 ha in size was clear cut and regenerated with p sylvestris several times between 1952 and 1977 in spite of site preparations and soil fertilizations and re plantings artificial regeneration had failed and the site hosts again p abies forest in our study a significant correlation rs 0 95 p 0 05 was observed between both ɛ methods i e ɛtrase and ɛrsad the mean ɛtrase acquired at two adjacent 15 cm depth measurements for each sampling point whereas ɛrsad represents roughly 50 cm dept top soil layer along 3 m long tx rx spacing for each point sutinen 1992 hänninen 1997 the targeted soil space of these methods is different and we regard rsad to be more viable for stony soils with coarse fraction 20 mm content that is not routinely measured in the particle size analyses e g hillel 1998 the soil ɛrsad weakly correlated rs 0 269 p 0 05 with the soil 0 0006 mm fraction rs 0 394 p 0 05 with 0 0002 mm and rs 0 262 p 0 05 with 0 006 mm fraction but not with other particle size fractions unconsolidated materials cover more than 30 of the continents and non stratified glacial till is probably the most widespread sediment type in the world flint 1971 particularly in the glaciated terrains of fennoscandian and canadian shield areas hence it is important to have knowledge of the spatial variability of swc in tills 3 6 swc and soil temperature in our study soil t10 was lower at the growth sites of p abies compared to those of p sylvestris fig 3 but t10 was not a strong splitting factor in the dts fig 5 however we found a significant correlation between swc ɛrsad rs 0 71 p 0 05 and t10 suggesting that p abies sites are higher in swc fig 4 in terms of climate change and temperature rise in future e g myneni et al 1997 hallinger et al 2010 net photosynthesis will probably increase at wettest p abies sites yet will reduce at driest p sylvestris sites see reich et al 2018 therefore the spread of p abies from mesic wet terrain of the clgb onto the dry lgb seems unlikely in future the increase in spring temperature has concomitantly resulted in circumpolar reduction of snow cover area and earlier spring greening myneni et al 1997 euskirchen et al 2006 ipcc 2019 the increase in summer temperature by about 2 c has resulted in the twentieth century advance of p abies treeline on the fertile tills derived from alkaline nepheline syenite rocks of the khibiny mountains in the kola peninsula kremenetski et al 1999 in a similar way new regeneration and tree establishment have been observed in the p abies treelines on mafic fells in northern finland sutinen et al 2012 but no evidence has been found to show new p abies recruitment on the dry acidic tills of felsic lgb proper soil temperature is profoundly attributed to inter annual and intra seasonal climatic events such as incident solar radiation freeze thaw cycles snow interaction and precipitation groisman and davies 2001 kirdyanov et al 2003 mcdonald et al 2004 sturm et al 2005 euskirchen et al 2006 sutinen et al 2007c 2009 hallinger et al 2010 liwata et al 2014 p sylvestris forest line follows the 12 c july isotherm as shown for treelines in eurasian subarctic macdonald et al 2000 kultti et al 2006 yet p abies forest line is not associated with climatic isotherms but follows 100 km the arc formed lgb proper fig 1 the annual average temperature range of the study area from 1 6 c to 2 1 c is well above the species specific temperature annual mean temperature niches of 2 4 c for p sylvestris and 2 3 c for p abies such that p abies is able to thrive at rather similarly high altitudes and low temperature conditions as does p sylvestris macdonald et al 2000 hence topoclimatic factors give no explanation for the present p abies forest line fig 1 it has been shown that reduced growth of p glauca in alaska during the twentieth century is linked to temperature induced drought stress barber et al 2000 lloyd and fastie 2002 inverse growth responses to temperature appear to be widespread even in the treeline conditions but growth declines of p glauca are most common in dry soils lloyd and fastie 2002 3 7 soil chemistry soil chemical variables are summarized in table 2 along with soil physical variables the chemistry dt

4 aqua regia digested concentrations were less significant in the dt analyses than nh4oac extracted however we found a significant spearman correlation between the two leaches aqua regia and plant available nh4oac for cr rs 0 68 p 0 05 and mn rs 0 57 p 0 05 but not for ti rs 0 08 p 0 05 or p rs 0 04 p 0 05 the spatial distribution on the above elements aqua regia leach as illustrated in fig 9 show a consistent trend i e high cr and low mn for p abies and low cr and low ti for p sylvestris with regard to lithology cr is associated with mafic and ultramafic rocks in general and particularly with clgb composed of mafic volcanic and ultramafic volcanogenic komatite rocks lehtonen et al 1998 fig 1 the cr content in felsic granitic rocks is low the ultramafic rocks are high in cr 600 2500 ppm compared to metavolcanites 67 150 ppm lehtonen et al 1998 cr content in felsic igneous and sedimentary rocks ranges from 5 to 120 ppm kabata pendias 2001 cr is commonly associated with cu ni co and pges and all are associated with mafic and ultramafic rocks reimann et al 1998 kabata pendias 2001 in our study a significant correlation between aqua regia cr and cu rs 0 74 p 0 05 ni rs 0 86 p 0

as cr ni and co are non essential to plants kabata pendias 2001 yet their spatial coexistence suggests that the distribution of p abies is associated with mafic and ultramafic lithologies middleton et al 2011 sutinen et al 2019 fig 9 changes in tree species distribution and vegetation coverage are generally associated with soil hydrology see fig 2 and fertility often measured by the soil σ sutinen et al 2002a närhi et al 2011 here we found the em 31 measured soil σ to be correlative with plant available nh4oac ca rs 0 3 p 0 05 mg rs 0 21 p 0 05 and with geochemical aqua regia elements mg rs 0 69 p 0 05 soil fertility generally refers to the content of macro nutrients primarily n and p and also to ca and mg that normally have a high positive correlation with ph however the soil ph is highly dependent on the soil profile such that ph values increase with the soil depth it is notable that the topsoil organic rich a horizon ph 3 5 4 2 provides an effective buffer for the inter seasonal

dt reveals that volumetric swc 0 24 m3m 3 explains the divergence in spatial distribution of p abies and p sylvestris in finnish lapland the bifurcation nodes in fig 10 indicate that p sylvestris only occupies dry swc 0 24 m3m 3 and acidic soils typically found on granites and on lgb in particular p abies thrives on wet mesic soils typically found on the clgb fig 1 the soils derived from these mafic volcanic and ultramafic volcanogenic komatite rocks lehtonen et al 1998 are also high in ti fig 9 4 conclusions new records on spatial and temporal variability of soil water content swc from the lithological mafic fesic gradient through central lapland greenstone belt clgb to lapland ganulite belt lgb indicate swc to be the most important driver for the distributions of northern boreal conifers p sylvestris and p abies taking into account both physical and chemical variables of the analyzed glacial tills following conclusions are drawn 1 the volumetric swc 0 24 m3m 3 is the edaphic constraint for p sylvestris this applies to natural distribution and spreading in finnish lapland as well as is the key issue in the forest regeneration 2 p abies is adapted on wide range of soil water regime swc 15 50 m3m 3 but appears vulnerable to low swcs and drought 3 lithology has pronounced impact on the nutrient status of the sites and nutrient availability boosts distribution of p abies on tills derived from mafic rocks such as the clgb 4 cold hardy p abies is absent on the dry and nutrient poor tills of the felsic lgb suggesting that climate driven factors cannot explain the

5325,considering the climate change the role of edaphic drivers for the distribution of cold hardy conifers norway spruce picea abies l karst and scots pine pinus sylvestris l is crucial even though both species reach latitude 70on p abies forest line is located at exceptionally lower latitudes in fennoscandia compared to p sylvestris tree line hence the divergence in mafic basic and felsic acidic lithologies and thereby physicochemical properties of parent glacial tills may play a critical role in tree species distributions the objective of this study was to explore soil water content swc and nutrient regimes in finnish lapland by transecting the main lithological units mafic central lapland greenstone belt clgb in the south and felsic lapland granulite belt lgb in the north eight one ha in size plots were sampled at 10 m intervals for soil chemistry and texture and measured for swc gamma ray electrical conductivity temperature and matric potential in binary decision tree dt analysis soil physics explained the growth sites of p abies and p sylvestris with 97 accuracy the most important variable being swc the constraint for p sylvestris was swc 0 24 m3m 3 based to the soil chemistry dt 95 4 of the p abies and p sylvestris growth sites were correctly classified the most important variables were cr ti mn and p distribution of conifers follows lithology such that p abies occupies mesic wet tills derived from ultramafic and mafic rocks of the clgb whereas p sylvestris thrives only on dry and coarse textured often granitoid tills we argue that dry and nutrient poor tills of felsic garnet gneisses of the lgb constitute a dispersal barrier for p abies the above tree species specific constraints provide guidance for future dispersal models keywords picea abies pinus sylvestris soil water content geochemistry lithology 1 introduction understanding spatial variability in soil water content swc and nutrients is vitally important with respect to distribution of tree species and is an interest in future climate scenario modelling conducted in different spatial scales one of the intriguing questions is the position of the northern conifer forest and tree lines picea abies ssp obovata forms the coniferous tree limit reaching 66 20 69 25 n in eurasia and siberia whereas the tree limit of p sylvestris remains latitudes 64 30 66 macdonald et al 2000 payette et al 2002 in fennoscandia the northern limits of p abies and p sylvestris both reach latitude 70on but the forest line of p abies is located at significantly lower latitudes than that of p sylvestris macdonald et al 2000 sutinen et al 2005 even though p abies is regarded as a climax species in the aspen birch pine spruce successional sequence it is absent over large regions in the northern boreal forests of lapland whereas p sylvestris is a dominant species with birch betula pendula roth and b pubescens ehrh as a principal associate sutinen et al 2005 2007a this discrepancy has seldom been considered as a result of lithological contrasts mafic felsic the holocene spread of tree species and forest line fluctuations are considered predominantly to be associated with climate driven factors moe 1970 eronen and hyvärinen 1987 kremenetski et al 1999 barber et al 2000 macdonald et al 2000 kullman 2002 kultti et al 2006 payette et al 2002 kirdyanov et al 2003 giesecke and bennett 2004 körner and paulsen 2004 väliranta et al 2011 parducci et al 2012 tollefsrud et al 2015 on the other hand the temperature concept has been challenged by scherrer and guisan 2019 showing that soil properties are important ecological factors explaining species distributions furthermore reich et al 2018 demonstrated that swc plays an important role in photosynthesis of trees based on the radiocarbon 14c dates of subfossil logs p sylvestris spread northern fennoscandia 8 3 7 kyr bp and reached its maximum spreading 6 4 kyr bp followed by gradual retreat to its modern range limit eronen and hyvärinen 1987 payette et al 2002 sutinen et al 2007b evidenced by subfossil trunks the expansion of p abies to sites north of the modern treeline in eurasian russia occurred 9 8 kyr bp but the retreat of p abies to its current treeline position occurred 4 3 kyr bp kremenetski et al 1998 macdonald et al 2000 also p abies macrofossils well above the present alpine tree limit in the caledonian mountain range in central sweden mount åreskutan indicate that spruce has been a vital part in the forest spread during the late glacial and early holocene time period 8 14 kyr bp kullman 2002 another case of p abies ice free refugia between 22 000 and 17 700 years ago in andøya northern norway has been presented by parducci et al 2012 in addition isolated patches of p abies have remained since late glacial yielding ages of 10 100 10 750 cal bp north of the present treeline on the unglaciated terrains in ne european russia väliranta et al 2011 these observations challenge the conceptual migration model suggesting that front like advance of p abies reached its northernmost range limit as late as 3 3 3 kyr bp in fennoscandia moe 1970 kremenetski et al 1999 giesecke and bennett 2004 cf macdonald et al 2000 payette et al 2002 tollefsrud et al 2015 in addition no p abies trunks megafossils have been found beyond its tree limit on felsic lithologies e g sutinen et al 2007b and still today p abies is absent on tills with low swc and derived from felsic ganulitic rocks sutinen et al 2005 therefore the spread and the present forest line of p abies in northern fennoscandia may be constrained by the geological features and thereby soil physical and chemical properties swc and soil nutrients are two of the most important causative edaphic factors that control tree growth species composition and diversity on regional scale reimann et al 1998 richardson 1998 sutinen et al 2002a närhi et al 2011 2014 hence the regional variability in the swc and nutrient regimes are critical drivers for the species specific distribution and sometimes treeline and forest line positions as well sutinen et al 2005 2012 even though swc varies seasonally the pattern of spatial variability does not change with time when the observations are ranked according to the magnitude of the swc vachaud et al 1985 starks et al 2006 sutinen et al 2007c biswas and si 2011 brocca et al 2012 liwata et al 2014 he et al 2019 therefore swc is a crucial species specific driver in the northern boreal forests see reich et al 2018 scherrer and guisan 2019 with respect to climate change ipcc 2019 transpiration of p abies may be more vulnerable to low swc and photosynthesis activity of the boreal tree species is depending on the swc reich et al 2018 even though variations in the soil water availability and the length of the growing season are controlled along with temperature by the thickness of the snowpack and the timing of the snowmelt groisman and davies 2001 mcdonald et al 2004 sturm et al 2005 euskirchen et al 2006 sutinen et al 2007c hallinger et al 2010 liwata et al 2014 the role of hydrology has seldom been discussed with respect to distribution of conifers to tackle the unawareness of the importance of geology we focused on soil physics and geochemistry on p abies and p sylvestris growth sites across the major lithological units mafic central lapland greenstone belt clgb and felsic lapland granulite belt lgb in finnish lapland fig 1 to see differences between p abies and p sylvestris distribution with respect to swc and or geochemistry the electromagnetic em radar radiation and induction measurements of the soil dielectric ɛ gamma ray γ and electrical conductivity σ provided us a basis to assess physical soil driven factors including particle size and matric potential as contributors to the distribution of p abies and p sylvestris we also provided data on plant available water soluble nutrients and geochemical aqua regia elements through the clgb lgb transect we upscaled our analyses to the national airborne geophysics and geochemistry databases over northern finland it is hypothesised that i p sylvestris is only suited on well drained soils whereas ii p abies is absent on dry and acidic nutrient poor soils and hence p abies forest line at the edge of the clgb is geological not explained by climatic factors or the holocene spread history to show hydrological differences between the growth sites occupied by p sylvestris and p abies we provide iii inter seasonal swc monitoring data as well as iv simulation experiment of swc at two geologically contrasting sites 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area in finnish lapland 67 20 n and 68 49 n 25 45 e and 27 48 e fig 1 is characterized by gently undulating glacial terrain reaching

60 of the annual precipitation falls as snow and snowmelt is the major contributor to the runoff we transected from sw to ne and with eight study sites the main lithological units in finnish lapland

southwestern edge of the lgb sutinen et al 2005 the fine fraction content of parent tills may reach 50 in clgb but may be less than 30 in lgb hänninen 1997 it should be noted that the latest weichselian ice flow was from sw to ne sutinen et al 2005 närhi et al 2014 hence the glacial dispersal eventually has smoothened some of the lithological imprints tills are generally superimposing the bedrock as a 1 4 m thick veneer but the tops of the fells frequently are frost shattered bare rock with no or scarce vegetation the podzol spodosol is mainly a typic haplocryod sutinen et al 2002a

principle of recording the time that the refracted em ground wave takes to travel from tx to rx and the travel time is governed by the ɛ ɛrsad properties of the soil hänninen 1997 the radar system is

swc 100 0 0132 0 0223 ɛ 2 72 10 4 ɛ2 1 87 10 6 ɛ3 swc is one of the major contributors to the intensity variations of gamma ray γ flux from glacial materials and a major part 90 of gamma radiation is emitted from the upper 30 cm of the soil grasty 1997 along with swc also soil texture i e sand silt and clay content bulk density soil organic matter content as well as mineralogy contribute to the gamma radiation heggemann et al 2017 hence the differentiation of the root zone soil water regimes under p sylvestris and p abies stands can be achieved with terrestrial and at landscape scale with airborne γ measurements grasty 1997 hyvönen et al 2003 sutinen et al 2005 the gamma ray flux from the glacial tills of stands dominated either by p sylvestris or p abies was measured with a portable

decision trees dt provide an effective nonparametric method to identify important variables and interactions of large and complex datasets breiman et al 1983 binary classification trees were computed with the statistical software r version 2 12 r development core team 2011 package rpart version 3 1 terry et al 2011 the response variable being tree species p sylvestris p abies which was determined in situ by recognizing the tree species of the nearest 5 m distance from the micro site individual mature tree 40 y in case of clear cutting the tree species was determined based on a tree stump four different dts were constructed with different set of explanatory variables i grain size distribution ii soil chemistry iii physics and iv all soil variables combined the fourth dt total in table 3 was constructed to see which single parameter can best explain the distribution of p sylvestris and p abies the data was randomly divided into 50 training and 50 testing sets in the training phase of the dt for each split only one variable is chosen giving the best split at each node breiman et al 1983 from all possible binary splits of the data amongst each explanatory variable the splits with highest improvement to node purity are selected by the algorithm to avoid overfitting the trees were pruned by requiring minimum node size six and by using the highest complexity parameter required minimum improvement to overall node purity to split node with only minor classification error increase an overall agreement and kappa were calculated as accuracy measures from the testing data correlations between the soil variables were analyzed calculating the spearman rank correlation coefficient rs 3 results and discussion 3 1 grainsize the inserted grain size variables and their statistics are presented in table 3 grainsize dt predicted the growth sites occupied by p abies and p sylvestris with 91 overall accuracy kappa 0 789 fig 3 the most indicative variables being 06 mm 0 2 mm 0 6 mm and 2 mm the first bifurcation node in the grainsize dt was 0 06 mm 33 77 by spliting p abies into the soils with more fines the second bifurcation node indicates p abies to be adapted to sites with fine sand 75 14 the cumulative proportion of the fine fraction content i e silt and clay i e 0 06 mm fig 4 is generally higher for the growth sites of p abies thus agreeing with the previous studies showing the fine fraction content of parent tills may reach 50 in clgb but may be less than 30 in lgb e g hänninen 1997 although fine fraction content was explaining factor for p sylvestris and p abies growth sites in some cases the hydrology is controlled by the coarse fraction content 20 mm via by pass flow sutinen et al 2007c conventional particle size analysis and sand silt clay soil classification do not take into account the role of coarse fraction content hillel 1998 and therefore mapping of spatial distribution of swc can be more reliably carried out with ɛ reference based classification of the airborne γ data hyvönen et al 2003 3 2 soil water soil physical variables are summarized in table 2 the density histograms fig 4 demonstrate that swc obtained via rsad and tdr trase measurements and soil γtot via terrestrial gamma ray spectrometry hänninen 1997 hyvönen et al 2003 sutinen et al 2005 was strongly discriminating the growth sites occupied by p abies and p sylvestris swc was significantly greater in till of p abies stands on mafic clgb compared to that of p sylvestris stands in the felsic lgb proper see airborne γtot in fig 2 suggesting that soil moisture availability is one of the most important drivers for the distribution of p abies like several other studies sutinen et al 2002a hyvönen et al 2003 the present results demonstrate p abies is adapted to a much wider soil moisture regime swc 0 15 0 50 m3m 3 compared to that of p sylvestris swc 0 04 0 25 m3m 3 p abies seems to be able to grow even on saturated sites swc 0 44 m3m 3 but is absent on sites at the dry end of the soil moisture gradient swc 0 15 m3m 3 in accordance to our results the sporadic spruce trees stands beyond the northern forest line have been found to be associated with edaphically moist sites oksanen 1995 a good example of these sporadic sites is the palloaivi appinite fig 9 providing soil p resources along with sufficient amount of swc for p abies see locations in oksanen 1995 the soil physics dt revealed the ɛrsad and ɛtrase and soil γtot variables to be the most indicative physical variables and the p abies and p sylvestris growth sites were classified with 97 overall accuracy kappa 0 918 fig 5 table 3 the physics dt generates two branches ɛrsad 13 05 from the first bifurcation node fig 5 in this case and when the ɛ swc conversion by sutinen 1992 is applied the corresponding constraining swc 0 236 m3m 3 we consider that swc 0 24 m3m 3 is limiting factor particularly for p sylvestris picea abies has tolerance for wide range of swc up to swc 0 50 m3m 3 sutinen et al 2002a this numerical site characteristics is in agreement with previous findings indicating that p sylvestris is dominant tree species on drier habitats with coarse rocky and sandy soils richardson 1998 kremenetski et al 1999 macdonald et al 2000 sutinen et al 2002a similarly to the constraining swc for p sylvestris found here swc 0 24 m3m 3 figs 4 and 5 the experimental research has shown that long lasting 8 5 weeks soil saturation results in fatal hypoxia for p sylvestris seedlings repo et al 2017 it has been observed within forest management including site preparation that artificial regeneration with p sylvestris had failed on tills with swc 0 25 m3m 3 sutinen et al 2002b the stabilisation of the forest plantations in the northern boreal climatic zone needs up to 20 years in fennoscandia hansson and karlman 1997 yet p sylvestris diebacks can be seen at the age of more than 12 years sutinen et al 2002b site preparation such as marttiini ploughing is not able to change the soil water conditions rather the physical properties of glacial tills outweigh the impact of site preparations sutinen et al 2002b 2019 and hence time stability of soil water largely govern the site suitability for p sylvestris sutinen et al 2007c liwata et al 2014 see also hyvönen et al 2003 3 3 gamma ray assessment of swc in the soil physics dt the soil γtot forms the second bifurcation node explaining the growth sites by p abies and p sylvestris fig 5 since the attenuation of the gamma ray flux is due to swc grasty 1997 hyvönen et al 2003 sutinen et al 2005 the high γtot values are diagnostic to dry soils at p sylvestris sites and low values to mesic wet soils at p abies sites fig 4 soil water content as expressed with ɛrsad is significantly correlated to γtot rs 0 80 p 0 05 and γk rs 0 78 p 0 05 respectively our results are in accordance with hyvönen et al 2003 who found soil γk to be significantly greater under p sylvestris stands mean γk 1 58 compared those formed of p abies mean γk 1 06 regional distribution of soil moisture regimes as expressed with the airborne radiometric data is clearly associated with lithologies such that clgb is typified by low soil γtot and lg proper by high soil γtot fig 2a hence 60 80 km wide lgb figs 1 and 2 constitutes a regional barrier for p abies sutinen et al 2005 in a similar manner as dry and acidic soils for p glauca in canadian subarctic timoney et al 1993 in addition the high soil γtot in north westernmost finnish lapland the finnish arm location in fig 2a may indicate potential barrier for p abies as denoted by the lack of p abies megafossils at the pousujärvi site 68 51 n 21 10 e sutinen et al 2007b in the peat chrono stratigraphy the lowermost and the oldest subfossil log of betula ssp yielded an age of 8810 cal bp subfossil p sylvestris logs yielded 5730 5900 cal bp thus agreeing with the previous findings indicating presence of p sylvestris between 6000 4000 cal bp beyond its present treeline eronen and hyvärinen 1987 kultti et al 2006 in their review giesecke and bennett 2004 listed numerous sites with p abies pollen observations and one of them mukkavaara 68 92 n 21 00 e is close to pousujärvi site see location in fig 2a in spite of pollen dispersal in the area no subfossils of p abies were found at pousujärvi suggesting that p abies may not have spread into the north westernmost finnish lapland during the holocene sutinen et al 2007b 3 4 inter seasonal variability of swc based on the swc monitoring conducted in 2007 2017 fig 6 8 10 weeks long soil saturation swc 0 35 0 40 m3m 3 is common on fine grained tills at the vaalolehto and äältövittikko sites as well as other fine grained tills of the clgb sutinen et al 2007c liwata et al 2014 in contrast soil saturation is absent at sandy till at vuotso site fig 6 and other sandy granitoid tills such as those on the lgb sutinen et al 2007c liwata et al 2014 since majority 60 of the annual precipitation falls as snow and snowmelt is the most critical period for soil saturation such that one meter snowpack thickness results in ten weeks saturation for mafic tills of the clgb sutinen et al 2007c in addition to being a crucial factor with regard to winter soil temperature snowmelt contributes to the major part of the seasonal soil water in the northern hemisphere groisman and davies 2001 vajda et al 2006 sutinen et al 2007c and provides necessary soil water reserves for the initiation of root water uptake in late winter and early spring sutinen et al 2009 hence variability in snowpack thickness may be a critical driver for plant communities and tree species specific dispersion sturm et al 2005 hallinger et al 2010 swc varies seasonally due to climatic factors such as precipitation snowmelt as well as transpiration of forest canopy and vegetation groisman and davies 2001 euskirchen et al 2006 vajda et al 2006 sutinen et al 2007c 2009 the spatial variability of swc pattern however does not change with time when the observations are ranked according to the magnitude of the swc vachaud et al 1985 this so called time stability of swc applies not only to agricultural soils vachaud et al 1985 but also to forest soils through the boreal gradient sutinen et al 2007c liwata et al 2014 and large scale catchments brocca et al 2012 as well as to soils in high elevation mountain forests he et al 2019 liwata et al 2014 indicated the time stability phenomena including vaalolehto äältövittikko and vuotso sites fig 6 with spearman s rank correlation coefficient rs 0 94 0 95 p 0 05 during long term inter seasonal 2002 2010 automatic monitoring of swc trough boreal gradient 60 68 n in a similar manner sutinen et al 2007 demonstrated intra seasonal 2001 time stability of fine grained glacial till at äältövittikko site with rs 0 83 0 93 p 0 05 even if the precipitation in july 2001 was twice as high as the long term average preferential flow occurs through macro pores of living or decayed root systems and through by pass flow attributed to subsurface coarse fraction content 20 mm stoniness governing the hydraulic characteristics of a site sutinen et al 2007c 3 5 swc water holding capacity the measurements done in the microsites of the greenhouse irrigation experiment at litologically and texturally contrasting vuotso occupyied by p sylvestris and vaalolehto sites occupyied by p abies fig 7 table 1 demonstrated that soil ψ is diagnostic parameter for low swc drought glacial tills the soil ψ is less sensitive to high swcs which ɛ measurements tdr and or rsad can capture fig 7 hänninen 1997 sutinen et al 2007c see whalley et al 2013 the swc of sandy till at vuotso remained low swc 0 27 m3m 3 even with the highest precipitation i e simulated maximum for 30 years 1971 2000 vajda and venäläinen 2003 on the other hand the swc of fine grained till at vaalolehto site remained high swc 0 22 m3m 3 even for the minimum precipitation the ψ of the sandy till at vuotso from 7 to 33 kpa fig 7 differs markedly from silty till at vaalolehto 3 to 10 kpa suggesting that p sylvestris is able to tolerate drought better than p abies yet suffers hypoxia at high swcs repo et al 2017 see fig 6 vaalolehto hosted native p abies forest with an admixture of birch b pubescens until 1950 when the forest 1000 ha in size was clear cut and regenerated with p sylvestris several times between 1952 and 1977 in spite of site preparations and soil fertilizations and re plantings artificial regeneration had failed and the site hosts again p abies forest in our study a significant correlation rs 0 95 p 0 05 was observed between both ɛ methods i e ɛtrase and ɛrsad the mean ɛtrase acquired at two adjacent 15 cm depth measurements for each sampling point whereas ɛrsad represents roughly 50 cm dept top soil layer along 3 m long tx rx spacing for each point sutinen 1992 hänninen 1997 the targeted soil space of these methods is different and we regard rsad to be more viable for stony soils with coarse fraction 20 mm content that is not routinely measured in the particle size analyses e g hillel 1998 the soil ɛrsad weakly correlated rs 0 269 p 0 05 with the soil 0 0006 mm fraction rs 0 394 p 0 05 with 0 0002 mm and rs 0 262 p 0 05 with 0 006 mm fraction but not with other particle size fractions unconsolidated materials cover more than 30 of the continents and non stratified glacial till is probably the most widespread sediment type in the world flint 1971 particularly in the glaciated terrains of fennoscandian and canadian shield areas hence it is important to have knowledge of the spatial variability of swc in tills 3 6 swc and soil temperature in our study soil t10 was lower at the growth sites of p abies compared to those of p sylvestris fig 3 but t10 was not a strong splitting factor in the dts fig 5 however we found a significant correlation between swc ɛrsad rs 0 71 p 0 05 and t10 suggesting that p abies sites are higher in swc fig 4 in terms of climate change and temperature rise in future e g myneni et al 1997 hallinger et al 2010 net photosynthesis will probably increase at wettest p abies sites yet will reduce at driest p sylvestris sites see reich et al 2018 therefore the spread of p abies from mesic wet terrain of the clgb onto the dry lgb seems unlikely in future the increase in spring temperature has concomitantly resulted in circumpolar reduction of snow cover area and earlier spring greening myneni et al 1997 euskirchen et al 2006 ipcc 2019 the increase in summer temperature by about 2 c has resulted in the twentieth century advance of p abies treeline on the fertile tills derived from alkaline nepheline syenite rocks of the khibiny mountains in the kola peninsula kremenetski et al 1999 in a similar way new regeneration and tree establishment have been observed in the p abies treelines on mafic fells in northern finland sutinen et al 2012 but no evidence has been found to show new p abies recruitment on the dry acidic tills of felsic lgb proper soil temperature is profoundly attributed to inter annual and intra seasonal climatic events such as incident solar radiation freeze thaw cycles snow interaction and precipitation groisman and davies 2001 kirdyanov et al 2003 mcdonald et al 2004 sturm et al 2005 euskirchen et al 2006 sutinen et al 2007c 2009 hallinger et al 2010 liwata et al 2014 p sylvestris forest line follows the 12 c july isotherm as shown for treelines in eurasian subarctic macdonald et al 2000 kultti et al 2006 yet p abies forest line is not associated with climatic isotherms but follows 100 km the arc formed lgb proper fig 1 the annual average temperature range of the study area from 1 6 c to 2 1 c is well above the species specific temperature annual mean temperature niches of 2 4 c for p sylvestris and 2 3 c for p abies such that p abies is able to thrive at rather similarly high altitudes and low temperature conditions as does p sylvestris macdonald et al 2000 hence topoclimatic factors give no explanation for the present p abies forest line fig 1 it has been shown that reduced growth of p glauca in alaska during the twentieth century is linked to temperature induced drought stress barber et al 2000 lloyd and fastie 2002 inverse growth responses to temperature appear to be widespread even in the treeline conditions but growth declines of p glauca are most common in dry soils lloyd and fastie 2002 3 7 soil chemistry soil chemical variables are summarized in table 2 along with soil physical variables the chemistry dt explained 95 4 of the growth sites occupied by p abies and p sylvestris kappa 0 954 table 3 fig 8 with the most indicative variables being nh4oac extracted cr mn ti and p see density histograms in fig 4 aqua regia digested concentrations were less significant in the dt analyses than nh4oac extracted however we found a significant spearman correlation between the two leaches aqua regia and plant available nh4oac for cr rs 0 68 p 0 05 and mn rs 0 57 p 0 05 but not for ti rs 0 08 p 0 05 or p rs 0 04 p 0 05 the spatial distribution on the above elements aqua regia leach as illustrated in fig 9 show a consistent trend i e high cr and low mn for p abies and low cr and low ti for p sylvestris with regard to lithology cr is associated with mafic and ultramafic rocks in general and particularly with clgb composed of mafic volcanic and ultramafic volcanogenic komatite rocks lehtonen et al 1998 fig 1 the cr content in felsic granitic rocks is low the ultramafic rocks are high in cr 600 2500 ppm compared to metavolcanites 67 150 ppm lehtonen et al 1998 cr content in felsic igneous and sedimentary rocks ranges from 5 to 120 ppm kabata pendias 2001 cr is commonly associated with cu ni co and pges and all are associated with mafic and ultramafic rocks reimann et al 1998 kabata pendias 2001 in our study a significant correlation between aqua regia cr and cu rs 0 74 p 0 05 ni rs 0 86 p 0 05 and co rs 0 72 p 0 05 was found in addition this was also observed between σem31 and nh4oac cr rs 0 62 p 0 05 cu rs 0 61 p 0 05 ni rs 0 53 p 0 05 and co rs 0 36 p 0 05 except cu the elements such as cr ni and co are non essential to plants kabata pendias 2001 yet their spatial coexistence suggests that the distribution of p abies is associated with mafic and ultramafic lithologies middleton et al 2011 sutinen et al 2019 fig 9 changes in tree species distribution and vegetation coverage are generally associated with soil hydrology see fig 2 and fertility often measured by the soil σ sutinen et al 2002a närhi et al 2011 here we found the em 31 measured soil σ to be correlative with plant available nh4oac ca rs 0 3 p 0 05 mg rs 0 21 p 0 05 and with geochemical aqua regia elements mg rs 0 69 p 0 05 soil fertility generally refers to the content of macro nutrients primarily n and p and also to ca and mg that normally have a high positive correlation with ph however the soil ph is highly dependent on the soil profile such that ph values increase with the soil depth it is notable that the topsoil organic rich a horizon ph 3 5 4 2 provides an effective buffer for the inter seasonal snowmelt dose with high co2 acidic ph 4 4 5 input on the soil sequences sutinen et al 2019 3 8 soil properties combined the combined soil properties i e grainsize chemistry and physics dt explained 98 1 of the growth sites occupied by p abies and p sylvestris kappa 0 948 table 3 fig 10 with the most indicative variables being ɛrsad and nh4oac extracted ti see density histograms in fig 4 this fourth dt reveals that volumetric swc 0 24 m3m 3 explains the divergence in spatial distribution of p abies and p sylvestris in finnish lapland the bifurcation nodes in fig 10 indicate that p sylvestris only occupies dry swc 0 24 m3m 3 and acidic soils typically found on granites and on lgb in particular p abies thrives on wet mesic soils typically found on the clgb fig 1 the soils derived from these mafic volcanic and ultramafic volcanogenic komatite rocks lehtonen et al 1998 are also high in ti fig 9 4 conclusions new records on spatial and temporal variability of soil water content swc from the lithological mafic fesic gradient through central lapland greenstone belt clgb to lapland ganulite belt lgb indicate swc to be the most important driver for the distributions of northern boreal conifers p sylvestris and p abies taking into account both physical and chemical variables of the analyzed glacial tills following conclusions are drawn 1 the volumetric swc 0 24 m3m 3 is the edaphic constraint for p sylvestris this applies to natural distribution and spreading in finnish lapland as well as is the key issue in the forest regeneration 2 p abies is adapted on wide range of soil water regime swc 15 50 m3m 3 but appears vulnerable to low swcs and drought 3 lithology has pronounced impact on the nutrient status of the sites and nutrient availability boosts distribution of p abies on tills derived from mafic rocks such as the clgb 4 cold hardy p abies is absent on the dry and nutrient poor tills of the felsic lgb suggesting that climate driven factors cannot explain the

5326,natural hydrogeochemical backgrounds or signatures from rivers around the world show great differences depending on the geological and hydrological settings where the specific watershed is placed this fact is especially relevant and notorious when the metallic content of waters draining hydrothermally altered high mountainous regions is considered the present study offers a hydrogeochemical perspective to improve the generation of environmental water quality standards ewqs in mineralized high mountain regions comprised by rivers unaffected and affected by acid rock drainage ard to this end the complex and versatile reality at the mapocho river upper basin comprised by a natural ard affected sub basin a mining intervened sub basin and a third sub basin with andean unaffected waters was used to evaluate the effect of seasonal and long term climatic variations on hydrothermally altered high mountainous regions in addition 22 different environmental water quality standards ewqs from different countries around the globe were analyzed this information was used to define what could be understood as an acceptable water quality for environmental use also the obtained elemental concentration and physicochemical ranges were compared with the results obtained at the mapocho upper basin to assess the importance of regional and local geochemical backgrounds on the generation of ewqs as a result of this information generation compilation analyses and intercomparison several recommendations to consider during the generation of ewqs at heterogenous high mountainous watersheds comprised by both ard affected and unaffected sub basins were made special attention was paid to the incorporation of seasonal variations and long term effects climate change on the generation of more realistic and useful ewqs keywords acid rock drainage climate change environmental sustainability high mountainous regions protection severe droughts natural water chemistry regulations 1 introduction the mining industry is frequently associated with the degradation of environmental quality in terms of biodiversity murguía et al 2016 water resources bellisario et al 2013 brenning 2008 caraballo et al 2016 wireman stover 2011 soil pokhrel dubey 2013 and air elaw 2010 among others there is a growing awareness and concern in both the scientific community and the general public about the occurrence of overlapping between mining properties and protected areas around the world armendáriz villegas et al 2015 durán et al 2013 assessing the mining industry related impacts on the environment especially on water quality requires distinguishing between the natural geochemical background pre mining condition and expected environmental conditions during the mining operation including closure and post closure stages however the best case scenario in river basins around the world is to have very little some years of limited hydraulic and hydrochemical records or non information of the natural geochemical background this situation is even more critical for rivers in mountainous and remote regions where many mining complexes are placed and can have decades of mining activity history as a result several authors have proposed alternative approaches to infer the natural geochemical background in watersheds affected by the mining activity with no previous hydrochemical or hydraulic records nordstrom 2015 runnells et al 1992 these approaches are based on the comparison with a proximal analog watershed with a similar non mined geological background and a strong hydrochemical and hydraulic record it is also important to notice that although most mining projects around the world are required by law to present an environmental impact assessment eia most cases actually underestimate water quality impacts due to the underestimation of the baseline water quality generated by their pre mining conditions predictions kuipers et al 2006 acid mine drainage amd is recognized as one of the most serious environmental problems in the mining industry dold 2017 because of its potential impact on water quality by inducing low ph and high electrical conductivity sulfate and metals concentrations valente leal gomes 2009 it is a common problem in all countries where mining started prior to any promulgation of an environmental legislation in addition when sulfide containing rocks reach the earth surface they naturally undergo a weathering process that in the presence of water and air typically lead to the generation of acid rock drainage ard nordstrom 2015 verplanck et al 2009 williams et al 2015 the only difference between amd and ard is that the former implies some anthropogenic origin or enhancement whereas the latter has a natural origin it is also important to realize that many high mountainous regions around the world e g andes himalayas alpes rocky mountains are characterized by the absence of soil and or vegetation coverage resulting on a geochemical signature of the waters that is predominantly due to the rocks of the region also hydrometeorology is determinant to understand the extent rate and seasonality of the final water quality generated since the specific characteristics of ard in terms of acidity and metal pollution are mainly controlled by local geology and climatology formulating site specific water quality standards for ecosystems protection on these naturally occurring high acidity high metal waters ought to be considered it is important to bare in mind that ard environments typically develop their own specific populations of metal resistant species that have to be considered as the local normal ecosystem reimann garrett 2005 generally speaking global warming is expected to reduce snowfall and promote glacier retreat at high mountain regions huss et al 2017 sellami et al 2015 uncovering bigger bedrock areas that will be exposed to aqueous weathering process potentially increasing the appearance of ard todd et al 2012 sharp tranter 2017 on the other hand it may also affect the hydraulic regime flores et al 2016 inducing lower water flows or changing the spatial distribution of the water courses as a result the specific long term response to global warming of ard at different high mountain hydrological systems may vary significantly in addition medium term climate fluctuations e g long drought periods may promote water table depth decrease and the concomitant increase of sulfide bearing rocks submitted to surficial oxidizing environments thus understanding the dynamical interaction between snowpack thickness water table depth groundwater flow bedrock mineral composition and surficial water flowrate at different time scales is essential for water resources management in high mountain environments affected by ard or amd in many countries around the world water management frameworks include water supply oriented management for agricultural production and are progressing toward the incorporation of new management forms to regulate other water uses address water quality issues and apply measures to control water demands grantham et al 2013 in fewer cases water management already considers a broader protection of the ecosystem processes and services as it has been done for example by the european water framework directive european communities 2008 despite this promising awareness of the importance of achieving a sustainable water management framework the actual advance in this sense has been very limited in most countries gleick 2014 the present study explores the meteorological hydrological and hydrochemical cycles of the upper mapocho river basin santiago chile this can be considered as a representative case of a complex high mountainous region comprised by three different sub basins developed on the different geological sections of the hydrothermally altered rocks of one of the biggest porphyry cu systems in the world as a result of the different geological settings hydrometeorological regimes and land uses these three sub basins cover almost all the specific water management situations typically appearing on those watersheds namely 1 a mining intervened basin with potential to generate amd 2 an undisturbed natural ard and 3 a non metal polluted non acidified river with high turbidity the main scope of this study is to offer a hydrochemical perspective to create the necessary tools for the generation of environmental public policies in mineralized high mountain regions where mining activities are developed in addition the formulation of a secondary water quality standard for an environmentally sustainable use of these precious water resource in dry semi arid and arid regions is discussed to this end the suitability of the current chilean environmental water quality standard from now on ewqs is discussed to exemplify with a real case the complex geological hydrometeorological hydrochemical and anthropogenic interactions on these aquatic systems 2 field background information 2 1 climate and hydrological context the mapocho upper basin is located east from the city of santiago and comprises three main sub basins yerba loca san francisco and molina with areas of 189 km2 108 km2 and 300 km2 respectively fig 1 the basin emplaces from the low zones of the lower basin 966 m a s l with temperate mediterranean climate zone to the high peaks of the andes about 4900 m a s l where periglacial environment develops rainfall is mostly limited to winter months i e may to september with annual accumulated rainfall estimates on the range of 400 900 mm for altitudes above arboreal line figure a 1 supplementary information headwater zones of the mapocho river have a snow glacial character during the dry season the river is fed by 1 snowmelting more noticeable in molina than yerba loca and 2 glacier defrosting from both rock glaciers and white glaciers mostly at upper yerba loca basin it is worth noting that the upper san francisco basin fig 1 have only little rock glaciers representing an almost negligible source of water on the other hand mapochós lower basin has a pluvial character being the molina river the principal tributary of the mapocho river due to its bigger catchment area fig 1 this basal hydrometeorological regime has been altered on its magnitude but not on its seasonality since 2010 when a mega drought period was described for central chile garreaud et al 2017 this mega drought extension and severity is unprecedented considering the records during the second half of 20th century as a result rainfall decreases with an annual rainfall deficit ranging from 25 to 45 and the subsequent substantial decrease of surface water resources are observed figure a 2 supplementary information 2 2 los sulfatos deposit the los sulfatos deposit is surrounded by a glacier system and is part of the rio blanco los bronces copper molybdenum porphyry district yellow star in fig 1 this district is within the late miocene to early pliocene magmatic arc of central chile approximately 50 km northeast of santiago at elevations between 3 000 and 4 800 m above sea level toro et al 2012 los sulfatos deposit comprises a large multiphase igneous hydrothermal cemented breccia complex with at least two separate centers of porphyry copper style mineralization toro et al 2012 locally cutting the breccia are sulfide rich veinlets containing pyrite chalcopyrite at shallow levels and chalcopyrite bornite at depth irarrazabal et al 2010 besides at shallow levels and in the periphery a pyrite fes2 halo characterizes los sulfatos system toro et al 2012 this district reports an inferred total resource of 206 7 mt of fine copper toro et al 2012 ranking it as the world s largest known copper concentration deckart et al 2014 irarrazabal et al 2010 toro et al 2012 so environmentally speaking the abundance of sulfides in the area is the perfect scenario to generate ard nordstrom alpers 1999 whereas economically speaking this mining district has become the world s greatest known deposit of copper and a potential increase in the productive development of the mine is expected medina 2017 2 3 chilean water management framework and mapocho river upper basin chile s strategy to develop a water market has facilitated water rights being transferred to uses with high monetary values this situation has promoted economic efficiency but at the same time it has failed to take into account environmental needs and values as well as human rights collins woodley 2013 jorquera et al 2014 however during the last years chile is progressing towards an more integrated water management system grantham et al 2013 the secondary ewqs was formulated locally for the mapocho and the maipo basins from 2003 to 2014 ministerio del medio ambiente 2014 headwaters in the upper san francisco river have been vastly intervened by mining activities for more than 100 years toro et al 2012 the yerba loca basin shows a natural low ph environment in its upper section whereas in the lower basin is characterized by high seasonal variability of ph and metal concentrations records this basin is almost unaffected by human activities gutiérrez et al 2015 jorquera et al 2014 and was declared as nature sanctuary a chilean protection category in 1973 ministerio de educación pública 1973 moreover the yerba loca basin is regarded as biodiversity hotspot for conservation priority figueroa et al 2013 myers et al 2000 finally the san francisco and yerba loca rivers mix with the molina river which presents freshwaters unaffected by mining activities and together originate the mapocho river which drains its water across santiago city with about six and half million inhabitant population approximately 40 of national population in addition there is also an important socioenvironmental aspect that needs to be taken into consideration during the development of water management strategies for the region future underground exploitation of los sulfatos partially developed underneath the yerba loca upper basin is being considered as a result local and regional communities are paying special attention to any potentially negative outcome of this activity that could endanger the glaciers at yerba locás upper basin given the whole context the water quality of the mapocho river upper basin is scientifically environmentally socially and industrially relevant 3 materials and methods 3 1 water sampling and field measurements historical data collection included a network of four stations with hydrological and hydrochemical monitoring in the mapocho river upper basin fig 1 operated by the dirección general de aguas the chilean water agency dga hydrochemical dataset include 1 four samples per year for each dga s station 650 samples between 1974 and 2017 2 several samples of the yerba loca san francisco and mapocho rivers between 1998 and 2010 with monthly resolution and between 2011 and 2017 with quarterly resolution provided by anglo american to servicio de evaluación ambiental the chilean environmental assessment agency sea 862 samples 3 another set of samples was obtained for the present research by different consulting companies and research institutes working on behalf of anglo american los bronces mine division this additional database was made by 578 water samples filtered and unfiltered samples from the mapocho river upper basin 328 samples from the yerba loca river from its headwaters to the mouth until the confluence with the san francisco river and 250 samples from the san francisco molina mapocho rivers and other small tributaries these field samplings comprised from april 2013 to december 2017 hydrometeorological data set alvarez garreton et al 2018 include 1 streamflow for each dga s station 2 monthly mean temperature and monthly accumulated rainfall measured in the yerba loca river upper basin at piedra carvajal station 3250 m a s l fig

meteorological stations table a 2 are available in the supplementary information 3 2 analytical methods water samples to study dissolved elements consulting companies dataset were filtered immediately at the field using 0 45 µm pore size filters collected in polyethylene bottles preserved with hno3 to ph less than 1 and stored in coolers with ice packs to keep temperature close to 4 c until arrival at the laboratory details about alkalinity temperature electrical conductivity redox potential and ph field measurements were obtained in situ additional details can be found in the supplementary information because the multiple sampling campaigns comprising the database were performed by different teams along the years a variety of analytical techniques and instruments were used on this regard the samples obtained by the dga were analyzed at its own laboratory the samples obtained from sea were analyzed at sgs laboratory the ones obtained in the present study and by environmental consulting companies were analyzed by als or acmelab laboratories in chile and canada respectively details of all the analytical procedures table a 3 and detection limits table a 4 used at the different sampling campaigns are described in the supplementary information 3 3 data qa qc analysis and consolidation data quality consolidation was performed through charge imbalance calculation for each sample using three different methods disaggregated table a 5 6 and visual figure a 3 and figure a 4 validation of the data comparing the different rivers and laboratories in the present study are shown in the supplementary information typically hydrochemical variables distributions e g metals concentrations are skewed have outliers and are the result of different processes olsen et al 2012 therefore irregular and time scattered sampling data could generate biased estimators declustering algorithm chilès delfiner 2012 with monthly cell resolution was considered to compute robust and unbiased estimators of location spread and range limits for each variable this method divides timeline in identical cells and assigns a weight inversely proportional to the number of data present in each cell median mad median absolute deviation 5th and 95th percentiles instead of mean standard deviation minimum and maximum were chosen like representative and robust estimators of water quality variables hydrochemical baseline of the mapocho upper basin are shown in table a 7 and table a 8 supplementary information for each dga stations in the studied period 2010 2017 additionally an extended durov diagram was used as a graphical tool to show the hydrochemical processes occurring within the different hydrogeological systems al bassam khalil 2012 4 results 4 1 hydro environmental characterization of the mapocho upper basin as suggested by plumlee et al 1999 copper can be considered a good indicator of ard or amd generation in watersheds draining cu porphyry deposits as a synthetic approximation to a more complex problem the most relevant historical events affecting the mapocho upper basin water quality are synthesized in fig 2 to this end water samples from 1974 to 2017 were split into five different periods based on the following criteria 1 before 1986 when sampling at yerba loca began 2 1986 1995 before any amd remediation strategy was implemented at the san francisco basin 3 1996 2000 from the beginning of the amd remediation strategy implementation at the san francisco basin until the year before the amd remediation strategies had a discernible improvement effect on water quality abrupt decrease in cu concentration from over 30 mg l to least 5 mg l respect to former period figure a 5 4 2001 2009 when the amd remediation strategies implemented in the san francisco basin began to have a discernible improvement effect on the water quality and before the mega drought described for the central region of chile garreaud et al 2017 and 5 2010 2017 length of the mega drought as shown by fig 2 copper concentrations in the molina station are commonly lower than 0 1 mg l and the calculated median values are typically lower than 0 03 mg l therefore this basin can historically be classified as non affected by either ard or amd on the other hand the yerba loca watershed is characterized by median copper concentrations in the vicinity of 2 2 3 5 mg l from 1986 to 2017 thus this basin can historically and consistently be classified as affected by ard as for the san francisco basin three different periods can be identified a before 1996 the river was clearly polluted by amd with median cu concentrations spanning 5 to 10 mg l b from 1996 to 2000 cu median concentrations decrease to 1 4 mg l and showed a very high dispersion of the data c from 2001 to 2017 the outflowing are no longer affected by amd finally the samples corresponding to the mapocho upper basin clearly reflect the combined history of the three sub basins yerba loca san francisco and molina the same line of reasoning can be obtained using water ph with values lower than 5 marking the moments when san francisco yerba loca or mapocho rivers behaved as amd or ard polluted waters figure a 5 supplementary information high mountain watersheds typically show complex hydrological regimes resulting from varying contributions of rainfall snowmelt and glaciers melting throughout the year on the one hand these water sources are controlled by the regional climate whereas on the other they are expected to have a significant control on the hydrology and hydrogeochemistry of these basins along the years the central zone of chile is considered a temperate mediterranean climate and it is characterized by a wet season may october and a dry one november april di castri hajek 1976 during wet season the decrease of temperature coupled with the increase of rain allows the accumulation of snow above 0 c isotherm in the three sub basins fig 3 a however during storms 0 c isotherm can descend roughly to 2 200 m a s l covering with snow 60 of the basins or even 90 of the basins when 0 c isotherm reaches 1 500 m a s l figure a 1 supplementary information then toward the end of the wet season the increased energy loads in the upper zones induces snowmelt and increases the discharge of all rivers this effect is more noticeable for the molina river because of its bigger catchment area in the range of 1 500 to 2 500 m a s l figure a 1 hence the molina river and as a result the mapocho river reaches its maximum discharge levels at the end of the wet season i e blue lines at fig 3 on the other hand during dry seasons defrosting in the upper zones reach its maximum and 0 c isotherm can raise even above 4 250 m a s l during summertime figure a 1 thus streamflow at yerba loca basin reaches its maximum because of its bigger catchment area over the glacier line figure a 1 as a result mapochós waterflow is generated by seasonally varying proportions of the molinás and yerba locás discharges the molina river controls the discharge of the mapocho river most of the year providing almost 70 of its annual discharge whereas the yerba loca river accounts for about 25 of mapochós annual discharge however because molinás and yerba locás discharge maximums are desynchronized about 30 to 50 or even more of mapochós discharge during dry months dec apr can be supplied by the yerba loca river fig 3 as a result the mapocho river frequently shows episodes along the year where it does behave as an ard polluted river i e low ph values and significant concentrations of metals in solution this situation has been accentuated during the dry years of the mega drought where the molinás discharge has decreased relative to yerba locás discharge e g fig 3b hydrologic years 2011 2012 2013 and 2014 please notice that the discharge of the san francisco river remains low and almost constant through all the year because of the following reasons 1 the existence of little rock glaciers 2 its relatively small catchment and 3 its upper subbasin quebrada disputada is intervened by the mining activities with the open pit generating a sump and a cut off wall in the waste rock dump closing the upper quebrada disputada subbasin therefore it typically provides less than 10 of mapochós annual discharge which doesn t match with its catchment area for the sake of clarity the following sections will mainly be focused on the relationship between the molina and yerba loca rivers and their effect on the resulting mapocho river however extended information about the san francisco river is offered in the supplementary information mapocho s upper basin hydrochemistry is graphically presented using an expanded durov diagram fig 4 as can be observed the molina river is characterized by calcium carbonated waters with neutral ph and very low concentration of dissolved elements representative specific elemental concentrations in table a 7 supplementary information and very low electrical conductivity around 150 μs cm headwaters of the yerba loca fig 4 and san francisco table a 7 rivers interact with very similar geological setting resulting on similar major ion compositions as a consequence waters from both rivers upper basins can be classified as acidic and ca so4 type with relatively high conductivity and metals concentrations in addition waters from the upper zone of the san francisco river 2600 2900 m a s l are in close interaction with the mining activities and tend to include significant concentrations of na and cl reflecting the salting of mine roads during winter jorquera et al 2014 as mentioned before the mapocho river is mostly the consequence of different proportions of mixtures between the molina and yerba loca rivers therefore the specific percentage of mixture will control the hydrochemical signature of the river making the composition of its waters to vary seasonally between ca so4 to ca hco3 types and its ph values from 5 2 to 8 6 5 ile and 95 ile respectively table a 7 a ficklin diagram was used to classify the waters according to their metallic pollution and ph fig 5 this type of diagram uses zn cu pb cd co and ni as fingerprints of ard or amd water pollution plumlee et al 1999 as can be observed in fig 5 water samples from the mapocho upper basin show a clear progression from acid waters with high metal content on one end corresponding to most samples in the upper and lower basin of the yerba loca to near neutral waters with low metal contents on the other end due to the water samples from the molina river as a result of the mixture of these two end members all the samples from the mapocho river are located in between the three defined categories also is important to notice that the ard at the upper yerba loca and the unaffected waters at molina river can be classified as acid high metal and near neutral low metal respectively through all the years i e from 2010 to 2017 fig 5 whereas the lower yerba loca and mapocho rivers fall into very different categories as a result of the seasonal and interannual variations of the waterflows and water qualities 4 2 water quality standards the definition of suitable and site specifics ewqss should observe the current trends on water quality standards generation around the world as well as it should consider local geochemical background and hydrometeorology to this end guidelines values of 22 water quality regulations from different countries and or states regions around the world i e argentina alberta australia brazil british columbia canada chile china japan new mexico peru queensland south africa spain sweden switzerland texas usa and european union were collected and analyzed table 1 and fig 6 despite the existing differences between all these water quality regulations all of them can be classified using two main categories 1 environmental these type of regulations are intended to preserve water ecosystems and ecosystem services through water quality maintenance or improvement e g water for wildlife and livestock chilean case and 2 aquatic life the main purpose of this type of regulations is to protect the most sensitive species and life stages against sub lethal chronic and lethal acute concentrations of certain pollutant at different exposure times table 1 at first glance the generated database shows how most countries chose between having an environmental type regulation or an aquatic life type regulation table 1 however some countries states with very recent regulations are choosing to follow both paths i e british columbia canada 2018 new mexico usa 2018 and 2017 and peru 2017 also as a general pattern aquatic life water regulations show stricter limits lower pollutants concentrations are allowed than environmental water regulations table 1 and fig 6 this pattern is clearly observed for no3 2 al cu zn cr and pb on the other hand ph cl fe mn as and ni concentration limits are very similar for both aquatic life and environmental regulations aquatic life criteria are typically the most restrictive ones because most guidelines values are based on most sensitive species and life stage over a defined short term exposure period e g 96 h so dissolved concentration measurement is preferred and recommended in most regulations because this fraction better approximates bioavailable metals on the other hand environmental guidelines values ranges are broader reflecting that what is understood by an acceptable water quality for environmental use is not clear and varies from region to region depending upon the regional predominant conditions fig 6 also it is important to notice that each country selects a specific set of elements environmental parameters to be included in their water regulations as a result whereas some of them are included in most water regulations i e ph cu zn as cr ni and pb others are poorly or not included at all among the last is worth noting the absence major ard mining related elements i e so4 2 fe al and mn table 1 with the exception of al which is included in most aquatic life water regulations due to its toxicity tipping carter 2011 the absence of other toxic elements is most probably to the fact that in most ard unaffected natural waters the concentrations of these elements tend to be very low and they don t represent a substantial risk for the environment however a few mg l of these elements may induce severe ard conditions and high toxicities nordstrom alpers 1999 5 discussion 5 1 evaluating the effect of long term climatic variations on high mountainous watersheds affected by ard droughts are likely to set in quicker and be more intense trenberth et al 2014 the identified mega drought in central chile is consistent with the projected climate change for western subtropical south america garreaud et al 2017 despite water availability reduction being the principal impact of this mega drought a detriment on water quality can be expected to gain a better understanding of this issue water quality indicators of the yerba loca and molina rivers at dga s stations were compared for the periods 2001 2009 pre drought period and 2010 2017 drought period using statistical estimator ratios table 2 median index m i and range index were obtained using the following equations m i x median 2010 2017 x median 2001 2009 r i x 95 t h i l e x 5 t h i l e 2010 2017 x 95 t h i l e x 5 t h i l e 2001 2009 where xmedian is the calculated median of a specific water quality parameter in the period 2010 2017 or 2001 2009 and x95th ile and x5th ile are 95th and 5th percentiles of a specific water quality parameter therefore if an index is greater than one it indicates an increase of the median and or range value for one parameter in the period 2010 2017 and vice versa the results in table 2 clearly display an increase in the severity of the ard at yerba loca during the drought period 2010 2017 showing lower ph and hco3 concentration as well as higher electrical conductivity hardness so4 2 cu mn as and ni median values regarding water quality at molinás basin before and during the drought period and increase in so4 2 k na al cu ni and pb was observed in terms of discharge the mega drought has affected the molina river harder than yerba loca river this difference can be explained due to the size of their respective glacier areas that act as resilient systems avoiding the mapocho river to be without water throughout dry season 5 2 the relevance of regional and local hydrogeochemical backgrounds on the generation of environmental water quality standards exemplified at mapocho upper basin chile every watershed has a hydrochemical fingerprint inherit to the geochemical signature of the surrounding rocks as a result of the specific regional and local lithology waters at small basins comprising bigger watersheds may share a common regional geochemical background but also may exhibit their own local geochemical peculiarities on this respect waters from yerba loca and molina basins share a regional geochemical background characterized by the presence of no3 fe as cr and pb fig 7 whereas the presence of low ph and high electrical conductivity so4 2 al cu mn and ni is the specific local geochemical fingerprint of the ard in yerba loca fig 7 finally the mapochós geochemical signature is a combination of the previous ones as a consequence the generation of useful and realistic environmental water quality guidelines on these geologically heterogeneous high mountainous watersheds must recognize and include these hydrochemical singularities as shown in fig 7 if the same water quality limits are applied to all the waters comprising the mapocho upper basin red lines in fig 7 correspond to the current chilean guidelines values the naturally occurring concentrations of some elements at yerba loca would be considered as water pollution e g electrical conductivity so4 2 and zn a similar situation is observed if the range of international environmental water limits green areas is considered notice that even using the most flexible and less strict limits in some international regulations upper section of the green areas the natural concentration of some elements would still be considered as pollution i e al cu fe and mn on the other hand the use of the same water quality limits for all the waters at the mapocho upper basin would imply that the molina basin is over regulated as a consequence there would be a significant margin for some elements to increase their water concentration before triggering a pollution alarm using cu as an example this element concentration at molinás water is typically lower than 0 05 mg l whereas the concentration at yerba locás waters is commonly lower than 5 mg l 95th percentile was used in both cases if the worst case scenario is used to generate a single water quality limit for the whole mapocho upper basin cu concentration at molinás waters could increase up to two orders of magnitude before it can be considered a pollution other approaches has dealt with similar situation using a qualitative water quality index without the need of set threshold values for each sub basin however they have the limitation of not highlighting the parameter s that exceed threshold values espejo et al 2012 6 conclusions on the basis of the experience gained during the generation of the hydrogeochemical background at mapocho upper basin table 3 and the comparison with local and international environmental water quality guidelines the following considerations may be issued when generating a local environmental water quality guideline at heterogenous high mountainous watersheds comprised by both ard affected and unaffected sub basins 1 all major elements involved in the specific water rock interactions controlling the water chemistry must be included the specific elements to consider will depend upon the regional and local lithology but at least the following elements should be included al ca k mg na si and hco3 as typical rock forming elements cl po4 3 and no3 as common inorganic pollutants so4 2 cu fe mn and zn as common ore forming major elements and as cr ni and pb as common ore forming minor elements 2 based on the results of the present study hydrochemical backgrounds comprised by water samples obtained on a monthly basis may highly differ depending on the extension of the studied period and on the specific sub basin this information is essential to define efficient regulations covering the inherent spatial and temporal heterogeneities of these high mountaneous systems when possible it is recommended to obtain several years of information five years could be considered as adequate but ten years may be needed 3 the possibility of water quality seasonal variations should be acknowledged and included in the regulatory limits if applicable as an example the yerba loca sub basin shows significantly different representative upper thresholds between wet and dry seasons whereas molina sub basin does not table 3 4 to enforce any local environmental water quality regulation at least a monthly sampling program should be required if concentrations are steady and rarely exceed the upper thresholds table 3 less frequent monitoring may be justified e g molina river on the contrary continuous online measurements of some selected parameters i e ph and conductivity for ard affected waters is advisable when the sub basin is expected to show important water quality variation in short periods of time e g daily or seasonal variations 5 based on the expected variations resulting from the effect of climate change on these high mountain regions the generated environmental water quality guideline must be revised every few years on the light of the new data collected to adjust the regulatory limits 6 this historical knowledge is essential to implement realistic ewqs incorporating the regional and local hydrogeochemical signature as well as possible climate change effects e g mega droughts this detail knowledge will avoid unnecessary socio environmental misunderstandings and conflicts in natural areas where the presence of mining activities is common or expected credit authorship contribution statement martín j

5326,natural hydrogeochemical backgrounds or signatures from rivers around the world show great differences depending on the geological and hydrological settings where the specific watershed is placed this fact is especially relevant and notorious when the metallic content of waters draining hydrothermally altered high mountainous regions is considered the present study offers a hydrogeochemical perspective to improve the generation of environmental water quality standards ewqs in mineralized high mountain regions comprised by rivers unaffected and affected by acid rock drainage ard to this end the complex and versatile reality at the mapocho river upper basin comprised by a natural ard affected sub basin a mining intervened sub basin and a third sub basin with andean unaffected waters was used to evaluate the effect of seasonal and long term climatic variations on hydrothermally altered high mountainous regions in addition 22 different environmental water quality standards ewqs from different countries around the globe were analyzed this information was used to define what could be understood as an acceptable water quality for environmental use also the obtained elemental concentration and physicochemical ranges were compared with the results obtained at the mapocho upper basin to assess the importance of regional and local geochemical backgrounds on the generation of ewqs as a result of this information generation compilation analyses and intercomparison several recommendations to consider during the generation of ewqs at heterogenous high mountainous watersheds comprised by both ard affected and unaffected sub basins were made special attention was paid to the incorporation of seasonal variations and long term effects climate change on the generation of more realistic and useful ewqs keywords acid rock drainage climate change environmental sustainability high mountainous regions protection severe droughts natural water chemistry regulations 1 introduction the mining industry is frequently associated with the degradation of environmental quality in terms of biodiversity murguía et al 2016 water resources bellisario et al 2013 brenning 2008 caraballo et al 2016 wireman stover 2011 soil pokhrel dubey 2013 and air elaw 2010 among others there is a growing awareness and concern in both the scientific community and the general public about the occurrence of overlapping between mining properties and protected areas around the world armendáriz villegas et al 2015 durán et al 2013 assessing the mining industry related impacts on the environment especially on water quality requires distinguishing between the natural geochemical background pre mining condition and expected environmental conditions during the mining operation including closure and post closure stages however the best case scenario in river basins around the world is to have very little some years of limited hydraulic and hydrochemical records or non information of the natural geochemical background this situation is even more critical for rivers in mountainous and remote regions where many mining complexes are placed and can have decades of mining activity history as a result several authors have proposed alternative approaches to infer the natural geochemical background in watersheds affected by the mining activity with no previous hydrochemical or hydraulic records nordstrom 2015 runnells et al 1992 these approaches are based on the comparison with a proximal analog watershed with a similar non mined geological background and a strong hydrochemical and hydraulic record it is also important to notice that although most mining projects around the world are required by law to present an environmental impact assessment eia most cases actually underestimate water quality impacts due to the underestimation of the baseline water quality generated by their pre mining conditions predictions kuipers et al 2006 acid mine drainage amd is recognized as one of the most serious environmental problems in the mining industry dold 2017 because of its potential impact on water quality by inducing low ph and high electrical conductivity sulfate and metals concentrations valente leal gomes 2009 it is a common problem in all countries where mining started prior to any promulgation of an environmental legislation in addition when sulfide containing rocks reach the earth surface they naturally undergo a weathering process that in the presence of water and air typically lead to the generation of acid rock drainage ard nordstrom 2015 verplanck et al 2009 williams et al 2015 the only difference between amd and ard is that the former implies some anthropogenic origin or enhancement whereas the latter has a natural origin it is also important to realize that many high mountainous regions around the world e g andes himalayas alpes rocky mountains are characterized by the absence of soil and or vegetation coverage resulting on a geochemical signature of the waters that is predominantly due to the rocks of the region also hydrometeorology is determinant to understand the extent rate and seasonality of the final water quality generated since the specific characteristics of ard in terms of acidity and metal pollution are mainly controlled by local geology and climatology formulating site specific water quality standards for ecosystems protection on these naturally occurring high acidity high metal waters ought to be considered it is important to bare in mind that ard environments typically develop their own specific populations of metal resistant species that have to be considered as the local normal ecosystem reimann garrett 2005 generally speaking global warming is expected to reduce snowfall and promote glacier retreat at high mountain regions huss et al 2017 sellami et al 2015 uncovering bigger bedrock areas that will be exposed to aqueous weathering process potentially increasing the appearance of ard todd et al 2012 sharp tranter 2017 on the other hand it may also affect the hydraulic regime flores et al 2016 inducing lower water flows or changing the spatial distribution of the water courses as a result the specific long term response to global warming of ard at different high mountain hydrological systems may vary significantly in addition medium term climate fluctuations e g long drought periods may promote water table depth decrease and the concomitant increase of sulfide bearing rocks submitted to surficial oxidizing environments thus understanding the dynamical interaction between snowpack thickness water table depth groundwater flow bedrock mineral composition and surficial water flowrate at different time scales is essential for water resources management in high mountain environments affected by ard or amd in many countries around the world water management frameworks include water supply oriented management for agricultural production and are progressing toward the incorporation of new management forms to regulate other water uses address water quality issues and apply measures to control water demands grantham et al 2013 in fewer cases water management already considers a broader protection of the ecosystem processes and services as it has been done for example by the european water framework directive european communities 2008 despite this promising awareness of the importance of achieving a sustainable water management framework the actual advance in this sense has been very limited in most countries gleick 2014 the present study explores the meteorological hydrological and hydrochemical cycles of the upper mapocho river basin santiago chile this can be considered as a representative case of a complex high mountainous region comprised by three different sub basins developed on the different geological sections of the hydrothermally altered rocks of one of the biggest porphyry cu systems in the world as a result of the different geological settings hydrometeorological regimes and land uses these three sub basins cover almost all the specific water management situations typically appearing on those watersheds namely 1 a mining intervened basin with potential to generate amd 2 an undisturbed natural ard and 3 a non metal polluted non acidified river with high turbidity the main scope of this study is to offer a hydrochemical perspective to create the necessary tools for the generation of environmental public policies in mineralized high mountain regions where mining activities are developed in addition the formulation of a secondary water quality standard for an environmentally sustainable use of these precious water resource in dry semi arid and arid regions is discussed to this end the suitability of the current chilean environmental water quality standard from now on ewqs is discussed to exemplify with a real case the complex geological hydrometeorological hydrochemical and anthropogenic interactions on these aquatic systems 2 field background information 2 1 climate and hydrological context the mapocho upper basin is located east from the city of santiago and comprises three main sub basins yerba loca san francisco and molina with areas of 189 km2 108 km2 and 300 km2 respectively fig 1 the basin emplaces from the low zones of the lower basin 966 m a s l with temperate mediterranean climate zone to the high peaks of the andes about 4900 m a s l where periglacial environment develops rainfall is mostly limited to winter months i e may to september with annual accumulated rainfall estimates on the range of 400 900 mm for altitudes above arboreal line figure a 1 supplementary information headwater zones of the mapocho river have a snow glacial character during the dry season the river is fed by 1 snowmelting more noticeable in molina than yerba loca and 2 glacier defrosting from both rock glaciers and white glaciers mostly at upper yerba loca basin it is worth noting that the upper san francisco basin fig 1 have only little rock glaciers representing an almost negligible source of water on the other hand mapochós lower basin has a pluvial character being the molina river the principal tributary of the mapocho river due to its bigger catchment area fig 1 this basal hydrometeorological regime has been altered on its magnitude but not on its seasonality since 2010 when a mega drought period was described for central chile garreaud et al 2017 this mega drought extension and severity is unprecedented considering the records during the second half of 20th century as a result rainfall decreases with an annual rainfall deficit ranging from 25 to 45 and the subsequent substantial decrease of surface water resources are observed figure a 2 supplementary information 2 2 los sulfatos deposit the los sulfatos deposit is surrounded by a glacier system and is part of the rio blanco los bronces copper molybdenum porphyry district yellow star in fig 1 this district is within the late miocene to early pliocene magmatic arc of central chile approximately 50 km northeast of santiago at elevations between 3 000 and 4 800 m above sea level toro et al 2012 los sulfatos deposit comprises a large multiphase igneous hydrothermal cemented breccia complex with at least two separate centers of porphyry copper style mineralization toro et al 2012 locally cutting the breccia are sulfide rich veinlets containing pyrite chalcopyrite at shallow levels and chalcopyrite bornite at depth irarrazabal et al 2010 besides at shallow levels and in the periphery a pyrite fes2 halo characterizes los sulfatos system toro et al 2012 this district reports an inferred total resource of 206 7 mt of fine copper toro et al 2012 ranking it as the world s largest known copper concentration deckart et al 2014 irarrazabal et al 2010 toro et al 2012 so environmentally speaking the abundance of sulfides in the area is the perfect scenario to generate ard nordstrom alpers 1999 whereas economically speaking this mining district has become the world s greatest known deposit of copper and a potential increase in the productive development of the mine is expected medina 2017 2 3 chilean water management framework and mapocho river upper basin chile s strategy to develop a water market has facilitated water rights being transferred to uses with high monetary values this situation has promoted economic efficiency but at the same time it has failed to take into account environmental needs and values as well as human rights collins woodley 2013 jorquera et al 2014 however during the last years chile is progressing towards an more integrated water management system grantham et al 2013 the secondary ewqs was formulated locally for the mapocho and the maipo basins from 2003 to 2014 ministerio del medio ambiente 2014 headwaters in the upper san francisco river have been vastly intervened by mining activities for more than 100 years toro et al 2012 the yerba loca basin shows a natural low ph environment in its upper section whereas in the lower basin is characterized by high seasonal variability of ph and metal concentrations records this basin is almost unaffected by human activities gutiérrez et al 2015 jorquera et al 2014 and was declared as nature sanctuary a chilean protection category in 1973 ministerio de educación pública 1973 moreover the yerba loca basin is regarded as biodiversity hotspot for conservation priority figueroa et al 2013 myers et al 2000 finally the san francisco and yerba loca rivers mix with the molina river which presents freshwaters unaffected by mining activities and together originate the mapocho river which drains its water across santiago city with about six and half million inhabitant population approximately 40 of national population in addition there is also an important socioenvironmental aspect that needs to be taken into consideration during the development of water management strategies for the region future underground exploitation of los sulfatos partially developed underneath the yerba loca upper basin is being considered as a result local and regional communities are paying special attention to any potentially negative outcome of this activity that could endanger the glaciers at yerba locás upper basin given the whole context the water quality of the mapocho river upper basin is scientifically environmentally socially and industrially relevant 3 materials and methods 3 1 water sampling and field measurements historical data collection included a network of four stations with hydrological and hydrochemical monitoring in the mapocho river upper basin fig 1 operated by the dirección general de aguas the chilean water agency dga hydrochemical dataset include 1 four samples per year for each dga s station 650 samples between 1974 and 2017 2 several samples of the yerba loca san francisco and mapocho rivers between 1998 and 2010 with monthly resolution and between 2011 and 2017 with quarterly resolution provided by anglo american to servicio de evaluación ambiental the chilean environmental assessment agency sea 862 samples 3 another set of samples was obtained for the present research by different consulting companies and research institutes working on behalf of anglo american los bronces mine division this additional database was made by 578 water samples filtered and unfiltered samples from the mapocho river upper basin 328 samples from the yerba loca river from its headwaters to the mouth until the confluence with the san francisco river and 250 samples from the san francisco molina mapocho rivers and other small tributaries these field samplings comprised from april 2013 to december 2017 hydrometeorological data set alvarez garreton et al 2018 include 1 streamflow for each dga s station 2 monthly mean temperature and monthly accumulated rainfall measured in the yerba loca river upper basin at piedra carvajal station 3250 m a s l fig 1 3 monthly mean temperature and monthly accumulated rainfall measured in the mapocho river at los almendros station 966 m a s l fig 1 the location for of all sampling points table a 1 and hydro meteorological stations table a 2 are available in the supplementary information 3 2 analytical methods water samples to study dissolved elements consulting companies dataset were filtered immediately at the field using 0 45 µm pore size filters collected in polyethylene bottles preserved with hno3 to ph less than 1 and stored in coolers with ice packs to keep temperature close to 4 c until arrival at the laboratory details about alkalinity temperature electrical conductivity redox potential and ph field measurements were obtained in situ additional details can be found in the supplementary information because the multiple sampling campaigns comprising the database were performed by different teams along the years a variety of analytical techniques and instruments were used on this regard the samples obtained by the dga were analyzed at its own laboratory the samples obtained from sea were analyzed at sgs laboratory the ones obtained in the present study and by environmental consulting companies were analyzed by als or acmelab laboratories in chile and canada respectively details of all the analytical procedures table a 3 and detection limits table a 4 used at the different sampling campaigns are described in the supplementary information 3 3 data qa qc analysis and consolidation data quality consolidation was performed through charge imbalance calculation for each sample using three different methods disaggregated table a 5 6 and visual figure a 3 and figure a 4 validation of the data comparing the different rivers and laboratories in the present study are shown in the supplementary information typically hydrochemical variables distributions e g metals concentrations are skewed have outliers and are the result of different processes olsen et al 2012 therefore irregular and time scattered sampling data could generate biased estimators declustering algorithm chilès delfiner 2012 with monthly cell resolution was considered to compute robust and unbiased estimators of location spread and range limits for each variable this method divides timeline in identical cells and assigns a weight inversely proportional to the number of data present in each cell median mad median absolute deviation 5th and 95th percentiles instead of mean standard deviation minimum and maximum were chosen like representative and robust estimators of water quality variables hydrochemical baseline of the mapocho upper basin are shown in table a 7 and table a 8 supplementary information for each dga stations in the studied period 2010 2017 additionally an extended durov diagram was used as a graphical tool to show the hydrochemical processes occurring within the different hydrogeological systems al bassam khalil 2012 4 results 4 1 hydro environmental characterization of the mapocho upper basin as suggested by plumlee et al 1999 copper can be considered a good indicator of ard or amd generation in watersheds draining cu porphyry deposits as a synthetic approximation to a more complex problem the most relevant historical events affecting the mapocho upper basin water quality are synthesized in fig 2 to this end water samples from 1974 to 2017 were split into five different periods based on the following criteria 1 before 1986 when sampling at yerba loca began 2 1986 1995 before any amd remediation strategy was implemented at the san francisco basin 3 1996 2000 from the beginning of the amd remediation strategy implementation at the san francisco basin until the year before the amd remediation strategies had a discernible improvement effect on water quality abrupt decrease in cu concentration from over 30 mg l to least 5 mg l respect to former period figure a 5 4 2001 2009 when the amd remediation strategies implemented in the san francisco basin began to have a discernible improvement effect on the water quality and before the mega drought described for the central region of chile garreaud et al 2017 and 5 2010 2017 length of the mega drought as shown by fig 2 copper concentrations in the molina station are commonly lower than 0 1 mg l and the calculated median values are typically lower than 0 03 mg l therefore this basin can historically be classified as non affected by either ard or amd on the other hand the yerba loca watershed is characterized by median copper concentrations in the vicinity of 2 2 3 5 mg l from 1986 to 2017 thus this basin can historically and consistently be classified as affected by ard as for the san francisco basin three different periods can be identified a before 1996 the river was clearly polluted by amd with median cu concentrations spanning 5 to 10 mg l b from 1996 to 2000 cu median concentrations decrease to 1 4 mg l and showed a very high dispersion of the data c from 2001 to 2017 the outflowing are no longer affected by amd finally the samples corresponding to the mapocho upper basin clearly reflect the combined history of the three sub basins yerba loca san francisco and molina the same line of reasoning can be obtained using water ph with values lower than 5 marking the moments when san francisco yerba loca or mapocho rivers behaved as amd or ard polluted waters figure a 5 supplementary information high mountain watersheds typically show complex hydrological regimes resulting from varying contributions of rainfall snowmelt and glaciers melting throughout the year on the one hand these water sources are controlled by the regional climate whereas on the other they are expected to have a significant control on the hydrology and hydrogeochemistry of these basins along the years the central zone of chile is considered a temperate mediterranean climate and it is characterized by a wet season may october and a dry one november april di castri hajek 1976 during wet season the decrease of temperature coupled with the increase of rain allows the accumulation of snow above 0 c isotherm in the three sub basins fig 3 a however during storms 0 c isotherm can descend roughly to 2 200 m a s l covering with snow 60 of the basins or even 90 of the basins when 0 c isotherm reaches 1 500 m a s l figure a 1 supplementary information then toward the end of the wet season the increased energy loads in the upper zones induces snowmelt and increases the discharge of all rivers this effect is more noticeable for the molina river because of its bigger catchment area in the range of 1 500 to 2 500 m a s l figure a 1 hence the molina river and as a result the mapocho river reaches its maximum discharge levels at the end of the wet season i e blue lines at fig 3 on the other hand during dry seasons defrosting in the upper zones reach its maximum and 0 c isotherm can raise even above 4 250 m a s l during summertime figure a 1 thus streamflow at yerba loca basin reaches its maximum because of its bigger catchment area over the glacier line figure a 1 as a result mapochós waterflow is generated by seasonally varying proportions of the molinás and yerba locás discharges the molina river controls the discharge of the mapocho river most of the year providing almost 70 of its annual discharge whereas the yerba loca river accounts for about 25 of mapochós annual discharge however because molinás and yerba locás discharge maximums are desynchronized about 30 to 50 or even more of mapochós discharge during dry months dec apr can be supplied by the yerba loca river fig 3 as a result the mapocho river frequently shows episodes along the year where it does behave as an ard polluted river i e low ph values and significant concentrations of metals in solution this situation has been accentuated during the dry years of the mega drought where the molinás discharge has decreased relative to yerba locás discharge e g fig 3b hydrologic years 2011 2012 2013 and 2014 please notice that the discharge of the san francisco river remains low and almost constant through all the year because of the following reasons 1 the existence of little rock glaciers 2 its relatively small catchment and 3 its upper subbasin quebrada disputada is intervened by the mining activities with the open pit generating a sump and a cut off wall in the waste rock dump closing the upper quebrada disputada subbasin therefore it typically provides less than 10 of mapochós annual discharge which doesn t match with its catchment area for the sake of clarity the following sections will mainly be focused on the relationship between the molina and yerba loca rivers and their effect on the resulting mapocho river however extended information about the san francisco river is offered in the supplementary information mapocho s upper basin hydrochemistry is graphically presented using an expanded durov diagram fig 4 as can be observed the molina river is characterized by calcium carbonated waters with neutral ph and very low concentration of dissolved elements representative specific elemental concentrations in table a 7 supplementary information and very low electrical conductivity around 150 μs cm headwaters of the yerba loca fig 4 and san francisco table a 7 rivers interact with very similar geological setting resulting on similar major ion compositions as a consequence waters from both rivers upper basins can be classified as acidic and ca so4 type with relatively high conductivity and metals concentrations in addition waters from the upper zone of the san francisco river 2600 2900 m a s l are in close interaction with the mining activities and tend to include significant concentrations of na and cl reflecting the salting of mine roads during winter jorquera et al 2014 as mentioned before the mapocho river is mostly the consequence of different proportions of mixtures between the molina and yerba loca rivers therefore the specific percentage of mixture will control the hydrochemical signature of the river making the composition of its waters to vary seasonally between ca so4 to ca hco3 types and its ph values from 5 2 to 8 6 5 ile and 95 ile respectively table a 7 a ficklin diagram was used to classify the waters according to their metallic pollution and ph fig 5 this type of diagram uses zn cu pb cd co and ni as fingerprints of ard or amd water pollution plumlee et al 1999 as can be observed in fig 5 water samples from the mapocho upper basin show a clear progression from acid waters with high metal content on one end corresponding to most samples in the upper and lower basin of the yerba loca to near neutral waters with low metal contents on the other end due to the water samples from the molina river as a result of the mixture of these two end members all the samples from the mapocho river are located in between the three defined categories also is important to notice that the ard at the upper yerba loca and the unaffected waters at molina river can be classified as acid high metal and near neutral low metal respectively through all the years i e from 2010 to 2017 fig 5 whereas the lower yerba loca and mapocho rivers fall into very different categories as a result of the seasonal and interannual variations of the waterflows and water qualities 4 2 water quality standards the definition of suitable and site specifics ewqss should observe the current trends on water quality standards generation around the world as well as it should consider local geochemical background and hydrometeorology to this end guidelines values of 22 water quality regulations from different countries and or states regions around the world i e argentina alberta australia brazil british columbia canada chile china japan new mexico peru queensland south africa spain sweden switzerland texas usa and european union were collected and analyzed table 1 and fig 6 despite the existing differences between all these water quality regulations all of them can be classified using two main categories 1 environmental these type of regulations are intended to preserve water ecosystems and ecosystem services through water quality maintenance or improvement e g water for wildlife and livestock chilean case and 2 aquatic life the main purpose of this type of regulations is to protect the most sensitive species and life stages against sub lethal chronic and lethal acute concentrations of certain pollutant at different exposure times table 1 at first glance the generated database shows how most countries chose between having an environmental type regulation or an aquatic life type regulation table 1 however some countries states with very recent regulations are choosing to follow both paths i e british columbia canada 2018 new mexico usa 2018 and 2017 and peru 2017 also as a general pattern aquatic life water regulations show stricter limits lower pollutants concentrations are allowed than environmental water regulations table 1 and fig 6 this pattern is clearly observed for no3 2 al cu zn cr and pb on the other hand ph cl fe mn as and ni concentration limits are very similar for both aquatic life and environmental regulations aquatic life criteria are typically the most restrictive ones because most guidelines values are based on most sensitive species and life stage over a defined short term exposure period e g 96 h so dissolved concentration measurement is preferred and recommended in most regulations because this fraction better approximates bioavailable metals on the other hand environmental guidelines values ranges are broader reflecting that what is understood by an acceptable water quality for environmental use is not clear and varies from region to region depending upon the regional predominant conditions fig 6 also it is important to notice that each country selects a specific set of elements environmental parameters to be included in their water regulations as a result whereas some of them are included in most water regulations i e ph cu zn as cr ni and pb others are poorly or not included at all among the last is worth noting the absence major ard mining related elements i e so4 2 fe al and mn table 1 with the exception of al which is included in most aquatic life water regulations due to its toxicity tipping carter 2011 the absence of other toxic elements is most probably to the fact that in most ard unaffected natural waters the concentrations of these elements tend to be very low and they don t represent a substantial risk for the environment however a few mg l of these elements may induce severe ard conditions and high toxicities nordstrom alpers 1999 5 discussion 5 1 evaluating the effect of long term climatic variations on high mountainous watersheds affected by ard droughts are likely to set in quicker and be more intense trenberth et al 2014 the identified mega drought in central chile is consistent with the projected climate change for western subtropical south america garreaud et al 2017 despite water availability reduction being the principal impact of this mega drought a detriment on water quality can be expected to gain a better understanding of this issue water quality indicators of the yerba loca and molina rivers at dga s stations were compared for the periods 2001 2009 pre drought period and 2010 2017 drought period using statistical estimator ratios table 2 median index m i and range index were obtained using the following equations m i x median 2010 2017 x median 2001 2009 r i x 95 t h i l e x 5 t h i l e 2010 2017 x 95 t h i l e x 5 t h i l e 2001 2009 where xmedian is the calculated median of a specific water quality parameter in the period 2010 2017 or 2001 2009 and x95th ile and x5th ile are 95th and 5th percentiles of a specific water quality parameter therefore if an index is greater than one it indicates an increase of the median and or range value for one parameter in the period 2010 2017 and vice versa the results in table 2 clearly display an increase in the severity of the ard at yerba loca during the drought period 2010 2017 showing lower ph and hco3 concentration as well as higher electrical conductivity hardness so4 2 cu mn as and ni median values regarding water quality at molinás basin before and during the drought period and increase in so4 2 k na al cu ni and pb was observed in terms of discharge the mega drought has affected the molina river harder than yerba loca river this difference can be explained due to the size of their respective glacier areas that act as resilient systems avoiding the mapocho river to be without water throughout dry season 5 2 the relevance of regional and local hydrogeochemical backgrounds on the generation of environmental water quality standards exemplified at mapocho upper basin chile every watershed has a hydrochemical fingerprint inherit to the geochemical signature of the surrounding rocks as a result of the specific regional and local lithology waters at small basins comprising bigger watersheds may share a common regional geochemical background but also may exhibit their own local geochemical peculiarities on this respect waters from yerba loca and molina basins share a regional geochemical background characterized by the presence of no3 fe as cr and pb fig 7 whereas the presence of low ph and high electrical conductivity so4 2 al cu mn and ni is the specific local geochemical fingerprint of the ard in yerba loca fig 7 finally the mapochós geochemical signature is a combination of the previous ones as a consequence the generation of useful and realistic environmental water quality guidelines on these geologically heterogeneous high mountainous watersheds must recognize and include these hydrochemical singularities as shown in fig 7 if the same water quality limits are applied to all the waters comprising the mapocho upper basin red lines in fig 7 correspond to the current chilean guidelines values the naturally occurring concentrations of some elements at yerba loca would be considered as water pollution e g electrical conductivity so4 2 and zn a similar situation is observed if the range of international environmental water limits green areas is considered notice that even using the most flexible and less strict limits in some international regulations upper section of the green areas the natural concentration of some elements would still be considered as pollution i e al cu fe and mn on the other hand the use of the same water quality limits for all the waters at the mapocho upper basin would imply that the molina basin is over regulated as a consequence there would be a significant margin for some elements to increase their water concentration before triggering a pollution alarm using cu as an example this element concentration at molinás water is typically lower than 0 05 mg l whereas the concentration at yerba locás waters is commonly lower than 5 mg l 95th percentile was used in both cases if the worst case scenario is used to generate a single water quality limit for the whole mapocho upper basin cu concentration at molinás waters could increase up to two orders of magnitude before it can be considered a pollution other approaches has dealt with similar situation using a qualitative water quality index without the need of set threshold values for each sub basin however they have the limitation of not highlighting the parameter s that exceed threshold values espejo et al 2012 6 conclusions on the basis of the experience gained during the generation of the hydrogeochemical background at mapocho upper basin table 3 and the comparison with local and international environmental water quality guidelines the following considerations may be issued when generating a local environmental water quality guideline at heterogenous high mountainous watersheds comprised by both ard affected and unaffected sub basins 1 all major elements involved in the specific water rock interactions controlling the water chemistry must be included the specific elements to consider will depend upon the regional and local lithology but at least the following elements should be included al ca k mg na si and hco3 as typical rock forming elements cl po4 3 and no3 as common inorganic pollutants so4 2 cu fe mn and zn as common ore forming major elements and as cr ni and pb as common ore forming minor elements 2 based on the results of the present study hydrochemical backgrounds comprised by water samples obtained on a monthly basis may highly differ depending on the extension of the studied period and on the specific sub basin this information is essential to define efficient regulations covering the inherent spatial and temporal heterogeneities of these high mountaneous systems when possible it is recommended to obtain several years of information five years could be considered as adequate but ten years may be needed 3 the possibility of water quality seasonal variations should be acknowledged and included in the regulatory limits if applicable as an example the yerba loca sub basin shows significantly different representative upper thresholds between wet and dry seasons whereas molina sub basin does not table 3 4 to enforce any local environmental water quality regulation at least a monthly sampling program should be required if concentrations are steady and rarely exceed the upper thresholds table 3 less frequent monitoring may be justified e g molina river on the contrary continuous online measurements of some selected parameters i e ph and conductivity for ard affected waters is advisable when the sub basin is expected to show important water quality variation in short periods of time e g daily or seasonal variations 5 based on the expected variations resulting from the effect of climate change on these high mountain regions the generated environmental water quality guideline must be revised every few years on the light of the new data collected to adjust the regulatory limits 6 this historical knowledge is essential to implement realistic ewqs incorporating the regional and local hydrogeochemical signature as well as possible climate change effects e g mega droughts this detail knowledge will avoid unnecessary socio environmental misunderstandings and conflicts in natural areas where the presence of mining activities is common or expected credit authorship contribution statement martín j

5327,during rainfall events rain and throughfall drops impact on individual leaves exerting a force that divides the drops into multiple droplets and produces momentary increases in the leaf inclination angle a portion of the splash residue from the raindrop impact accumulates on the leaf surface and adds mass to the lamina of leaf this lab based study examined changes in leaf inclination angle after the impact of a sequence of raindrops of two different volumes 10 µl and 30 µl on leaf surfaces of three different tree species acer saccharinum l ulmus pumila l and quercus gambelii nutt leaf inclination is measured as the angle between the lamina surface normal and the horizontal the differences between the initial leaf inclination angle before raindrop impacts and the steady state leaf inclination angles after each raindrop impact were examined to explore the hypothesis that rainsplash residue accumulated on leaves after raindrop impact will incrementally increase the steady state leaf inclination angle as the leaves approach leaf surface storage the difference between the initial leaf inclination angle and the steady state leaf inclination angle after two 10 µl raindrops increased by 0 23 for q gambelii 0 84 for a saccharinum and 1 29 for u pumila the difference between the initial leaf inclination angle and the steady state leaf inclination angle after two 30 µl raindrops increased by 0 56 for q gambelii 1 45 for u pumila and 2 05 for a saccharinum for each species the mass of the accumulated water incrementally increased the steady state leaf inclination angle after each raindrop impact as expected larger raindrops produced more rainsplash residue on the leaf surface based on the incremental increase in steady state leaf inclination angle after sequential raindrop impacts with repeated raindrop impacts leaves in the canopy accumulate more water mass as the maximum leaf surface storage is achieved observing changes in steady state leaf inclination angles after raindrop impact may serve as an indicator for rainfall interception totals during rainfall events keywords leaf biomechanics leaf inclination angle leaf hydrophobicity leaf surface storage raindrop impact rainfall interception 1 introduction during a rainfall event individual raindrops pass through the canopy or splash on vegetative surfaces herwitz 1987 crockford and richardson 2000 papierowska et al 2019 a portion of the raindrop splash may reach the forest floor after breaking up into smaller throughfall drops levia et al 2019 another portion of the raindrop may accumulate on the vegetative surfaces and contribute to stemflow or the development of canopy drips along vegetative surface eventually returning to the forest floor carlyle moses and schooling 2015 iida et al 2017 levia et al 2019 the amount of rainfall remaining on the canopy that does not pass through the canopy drip from the canopy or drain down the branches and stems evaporates back into the atmosphere as the rainfall event proceeds the vegetation canopy continues to intercept precipitation until canopy storage capacity is achieved aston 1979 keim et al 2006 wang et al 2012 xiao and mcpherson 2016 canopy storage capacity is the maximum depth of water a canopy can store at the end of a rainfall event after drip has ceased a component of canopy storage capacity is leaf surface storage the maximum mass of precipitation stored on leaf surfaces per unit of leaf area barfield et al 1973 wohlfahrt et al 2006 baptista et al 2018a xiong et al 2019 water retention on a leaf area basis varies because of leaf surface characteristics such as hydrophobicity presence of trichomes and surface morphology garcia estringana et al 2010 klamerus iwan et al 2018 xiong et al 2018 smets et al 2019 leaf surface storage is achieved as water continues to accumulate on the leaf during a rainfall event holder 2013 individual raindrops impact leaf surfaces during rainfall events causing transient changes in the leaf inclination angle casas et al 1998 gart et al 2015 ginebra solanellas 2016 modeled the changes in leaf inclination angle due to a single raindrop impacting leaves as an exponentially decaying oscillation before the raindrop impact the leaf maintains a steady state leaf inclination angle immediately following the raindrop impact the leaf inclination angle increases from steady state to the maximum leaf inclination angle then the inclination angle oscillates and decays to a new steady state angle the maximum change in leaf inclination angle after raindrop impact is a function of species and raindrop size ginebra solanellas et al 2020 the leaf oscillations from individual raindrops form similar patterns to the ones found in experiments examining the plant vibrations produced because of wind speck and spatz 2004 spatz et al 2007 tadrist et al 2015 de langre 2019 as the mass of water increases on a leaf surface during a rainfall event the leaf inclination angle increases the mass of water supported by leaves and the associated deflection may be species dependent based on the biomechanical properties of the petiole and the lamina niklas 1991 vogel 1992 niklas 1999 niinemets and fleck 2002 tadrist et al 2014 tadrist and darbois texier 2016 water remaining on the leaf following a raindrop impact herwitz 1987 papierowska et al 2019 will cause a new steady state leaf inclination angle due to the mass of water accumulating on the leaf surface this change in leaf inclination angle from the initial steady state before raindrop impact to a new steady state following raindrop impact may indicate the progression toward the leaf surface storage the objectives of this lab based study are 1 to examine the changes in steady state leaf inclination angles following sequential raindrop impacts and 2 to examine the effect of leaf traits on leaf oscillations following sequential raindrop impacts specifically we utilize an exponentially decaying oscillation model to determine the initial and new steady state leaf inclination angles following multiple raindrop impacts on leaves of three tree species we hypothesize that raindrop splash residue accumulated on leaves will incrementally increase the leaf inclination angle following sequential raindrop impacts 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling area and selection of species three species acer saccharinum l ulmus pumila l and quercus gambelii nutt located in colorado springs co usa 38 53 n 104 48 w were selected for this study colorado springs is situated along the boundary between the highland grasslands and the mixed conifers ecosystems within the rapidly urbanizing fountain creek watershed annual precipitation in this foothills prairie ecosystem is 442 mm mean monthly temperature ranges from 2 2 c in january to 20 9 c in july arguez et al 2010 the three species were selected because of previous research on them and each species represented a different ecological and hydrological function within the watershed holder and gibbes 2017 quercus gambelii is a common native species in the sampling area and has adapted to undisturbed open spaces ulmus pumila is native to asia and has naturalized in the sampling area ulmus pumila is an invasive and opportunistic species that disperses rapidly in vacant lots in the sampling area acer saccharinum is not native the species is planted as an ornamental tree by households within the city of colorado springs acer saccharinum would not survive in the semi arid climate without adequate irrigation leaf samples were collected from multiple individual plants in the sampling area in the vicinity of the university campus in the morning for three weeks in july small branches from the lower canopy of each species were harvested in the sampling area and brought to the lab the transportation time from the sampling sites to the lab was under five minutes the ends of the branches were placed in water to minimize desiccation approximately five leaves were sampled from the harvested branches each day from 9 00 a m to 3 00p m and the branches with unsampled leaves were discarded at the end of the day experiments with each leaf began immediately after the leaf was harvested from the branch all of the following experiments for each leaf occurred in 30 min after sampling the leaf from the branch over the course of three weeks a total of sixty leaves 20 from each species with a range of sizes were harvested from the branches for the experiments 2 2 raindrop generator experiment a raindrop generator was constructed in the laboratory to investigate the changes in leaf inclination angle after sequential raindrop impacts fig 1 the raindrop generator used a ne 300 infusion syringe pump new era pump systems farmingdale ny usa that forced deionized water through a pvc tube to a straight stainless steel needle the connections between the syringe the tube and the needle were made using barbed sockets and plugs a metered stand secured both the leaf and the needle interchangeable needles with different apertures were used to generate 10 µl and 30 µl water drops the 10 µl and 30 µl water drop sizes equal a spherical drop size of 2 67 mm and 3 86 mm respectively and the sizes are within reported ranges of common precipitation and throughfall drop sizes nanko et al 2016 levia et al 2019 the 30 µl drops were released from a height of 1 22 m resulting in a velocity at impact of 4 85 m sec 55 of terminal velocity and a linear momentum of 0 146 g m sec the terminal velocity for a 30 µl drop was 8 83 m sec and the linear momentum at terminal velocity was 0 265 g m sec the release height for the 10 µl drops was 0 875 m resulting in a velocity at impact of 3 83 m sec 52 of terminal velocity and a linear momentum of 0 039 g m sec the terminal velocity of a 10 µl drop is 7 37 m sec and the linear momentum at terminal velocity was 0 0737 g m sec the selection of drop sizes provided a range of linear momentum representative of both incident rainfall and throughfall individual leaves were secured using a metal clamp and positioned directly beneath the needle for the water drop to strike at the geometric center of the leaf the metal clamp fastened to the vertical stand of the raindrop generator fig 1 petioles with diameters of up to 6 mm can be held with the metal clamp the end of the petiole was secured within the clamp and gently tightened to secure the leaf without damaging the petiole we determined the geometric center of the leaf as the half way distance along the mid vein of the lamina between the leaf tip and the point where the lamina connects with the petiole trial water drops were released from the needle avoiding getting the leaf sample wet to ensure that the drop hit the geometric center the clamp holding the needle was adjusted to ensure that each water drop fell on the center of the leaf the trial water drops were prevented from wetting the leaf surface by placing an absorptive paper over the drop point immediately above the leaf surface the water temperature was kept constant at 20 c to avoid changes in viscosity a hot shot cc video camera nac image technology simi valley ca usa was positioned approximately 1 5 m from the drop release point and perpendicular to the leaf to produce a high contrast grey scale image a white background was placed behind the leaf as the water drops were released at a rate of approximately one drop per second from the raindrop generator the high speed video camera recorded the drop impact on the leaf at either 2 000 for the a saccharinum and q gambelii leaf samples or 3 000 frames per second for the u pumila leaf samples because the u pumila experiments were videotaped at a faster frame rate three sequential water drops were able to be recorded the videos from the a saccharinum and q gambelii experiments recorded two sequential water drops the maximum length of each video was approximately three seconds each video was between 0 5 and 2 gb in size and was saved as avi files 2 3 measurement of leaf traits after each leaf was harvested and before the experiment with the raindrop generator the fresh weight of each leaf leaf mass was measured leaf area was measured with a ci 202 portable area meter cid bio science camas wa usa leaf hydrophobicity and water droplet retention angle of the adaxial leaf surface of each leaf from each species was measured with a model 250 contact angle goniometer tensiometer rame hart instrument company netcong new jersey following the procedures of holder 2012 a 10 µl droplet of deionized water was placed on the horizontal leaf pinned to a balsa wood platform on the goniometer the contact angle between the water droplet and the adaxial leaf surface was measured with dropimage software a greater contact angle indicates a more spherical water droplet and a more water repelling surface if the contact angle between the water droplet and the leaf surface is greater than 110 then the leaf surface is classified as non wettable aryal neuner 2010 the water droplet retention angle the threshold maximum of the leaf from the horizontal to resist water drop drainage was measured by placing a 50 µl droplet of deionized water on the adaxial leaf surface pinned to the tilting platform of the goniometer the platform of the goniometer and leaf was tilted slowly at 0 1 increments from the horizontal 0 to 90 until the water droplet began to move off the leaf surface the leaf surface storage g m 2 the maximum amount of water retained on a leaf divided by the all sided surface area of the leaf was measured by adapting the methodology of liu 1998 and llorens and gallart 2000 each leaf was submerged in distilled water for 15 s after the 15 second immersion the leaf was extracted from the distilled water and water was allowed to drip off the leaf for 10 s to simulate still air conditions then the leaf mass was re measured the difference between dry and wet leaf mass for each leaf is calculated and divided by the all sided surface area to determine the leaf surface storage of each leaf 2 4 video processing the recorded videos were processed in matlab to track the changes in leaf inclination angle from immediately before to after two or three sequential raindrop impacts each video was recorded for approximately three seconds the videos were processed frame by frame in order to use built in image processing tools in matlab the video frames were converted from greyscale to black and white the frames of the video were cropped to include only the profile image of the leaf a sharp contrast between the leaf and the background was produced and the matlab built in function edge was able to detect the margins of the leaf in each frame leaf inclination angle is defined as the angle between the lamina surface normal and the horizontal fig 2 the leaf tip and the point connecting the petiole with the leaf blade was identified in each frame and a segment was drawn to connect the two points the leaf inclination angle was determined by calculating the angle produced between the line segment and a horizontal line across the image the static leaf inclination angle deflection due to the leaf s weight was measured as the average leaf angle in the first twenty frames of the video before each raindrop impact then the maximum leaf inclination angle was measured as the maximum value of the leaf inclination angle following the first water drop impact subsequent oscillation peaks and minimums were also identified a model described in ginebra solanellas 2016 was fit to the sequence of oscillation peaks to model the exponential portion of the following equation 1 θ a e ζ ω n â t sin ω d t θ ss where 2 ω d ω n 1 ζ 2 a is the amplitude of the vibration t is time ω d is the damped natural frequency ω n is the natural frequency and ζ is the damping ratio θ ss is the steady state value of the leaf inclination angle after the drop impact the maximum value of the inclination angle θmax is 3 θ max a exp ζ 1 ζ 2 tan 1 1 ζ 2 ζ sin tan 1 1 ζ 2 ζ θ ss the model is fit to the data by identifying the oscillation peaks the time between peaks is used to determine the damped natural frequency then the equation 4 a e ζ ω n â t θ ss is fit to the oscillation peaks the dashed line in fig 3 shows this fit for a representative data set 2 5 data analysis the changes in leaf inclination angle before and after water drop impact were plotted and analyzed tests of significance were conducted to determine if the maximum change in leaf inclination angle differs between the 10 µl water drop experiments and the 30 µl water drop experiments for each species analyses of variance were used to test whether there are significant differences in leaf mass leaf area leaf hydrophobicity water droplet retention leaf surface storage and the maximum change in leaf inclination angle between the three species when analysis of variance indicated significant differences among species a tukey honestly significant differences test was performed to determine which pairs of species exhibit significant differences paired t tests were conducted to test for significant differences between maximum changes in leaf inclination angles between the 10 µl experiment and the 30 µl experiment additionally paired t tests were conducted to test for differences between the initial steady state leaf inclination angle and each new steady state leaf inclination angle following each sequential raindrop from the t test results for the changes in leaf inclination angle after multiple sequential raindrop impacts we were able to evaluate the hypothesis that raindrop splash residue accumulated on leaves incrementally increases the leaf inclination angle following sequential raindrop impacts additionally linear regressions were performed to determine if there were associations between water droplet retention and leaf hydrophobicity

to 10 µl water drops impacting the geometric center of each leaf the plots of change in leaf inclination angle show decaying sinusoidal oscillations after each raindrop impact large increases in leaf inclination angles occurred immediately after impact and within 0 1 s following each sequential raindrop impact the leaf inclination angle oscillations achieve a new steady state within a second and right before the next raindrop impacts the amplitudes of the leaf inclination angle changes were generally greater after 30 µl drops impacted the leaf surface fig 4b the mean maximum change in leaf

amplitude of the leaf deflections after water drop impact was not as large in q gambelii when compared with the other two species fig 5 the mean maximum change in leaf inclination angle in q gambelii

gambelii was the only pair of species not significantly different in maximum change in leaf inclination angle in the 10 µl water drop experiment p 0 844 however in the 30 µl water drop experiment a saccharinum and q gambelii was the only pair of species that was significantly different in maximum change in leaf inclination angle table 1 p 0 05 strong linear relationships existed between leaf area and the maximum change in leaf inclination angle after drop impact for the 10 µl drop and 30 µl drop experiments fig 7 the regression models showed a significant relationship between leaf area and maximum leaf inclination angle at p 0 05 for q gambelii and u pumila the regression models for a saccharinum were not significant the regression models for q gambelii and u pumila had r2 values greater than 0 55 which indicates that leaf area accounted for more than 54 of the variation in the maximum leaf inclination angle additionally strong linear relationships existed between leaf mass and the maximum change in leaf inclination angle also for q gambelii and u pumila fig 8 but not for acer saccharinum the weakest r2 value calculated in the relationship between leaf mass and the maximum change in leaf inclination angle was for a saccharinum in the 10 µl drop experiment r2 0 26 n 10 p 0 136 fig 7a 3 3 incremental increases in steady state leaf inclination angle after raindrop impact table 2 shows the mean initial leaf inclination angle before raindrop impact and the mean steady state leaf inclination angles following each subsequent raindrop impact from the 10 µl drop and 30 µl drop experiments the peak leaf inclination angles from the experimental data in figs 4 5 and 6 were used to determine the steady state angle as describe in section 2 4 and illustrated in fig 3 in the 10 µl drop experiment the steady state leaf inclination angle for u pumila increased the most after subsequent raindrop impacts compared with the other two species the difference between the initial leaf inclination angle and the steady state leaf inclination angle after two 10 µl raindrops increased by 0 23 for q gambelii 0 84 for a saccharinum and 1 29 for u pumila in the 30 µl drop experiment the incremental increase in steady state leaf inclination angles from the initial leaf inclination was larger for all species the difference between the initial leaf inclination angle and the steady state leaf inclination angle after two 30 µl raindrops increased by 0 56 for q gambelii 1 45 for u pumila and 2 05 for a saccharinum table 2 in both raindrop size experiments 10 µl and 30 µl q gambelii showed the least change in steady state leaf inclination angle between the initial leaf inclination angle and subsequent steady state leaf inclination angles following raindrop impact results from paired t tests between all pairs of initial leaf inclination angles and subsequent steady state leaf inclination angles in all species were significantly different p 0 01 except in one case the difference between the initial leaf inclination and the steady state leaf inclination angle after one 10 µl raindrop for q gambelii was not significantly different p 0 15 the results from the paired t tests may support our hypothesis that raindrop splash residue accumulated on leaves during rainfall events incrementally increases the leaf inclination angle following sequential raindrop impacts 4 discussion the water drop sizes produced from the raindrop generator were within the range of actual rain and throughfall drop size distributions reported from previous studies nanko et al 2006 carollo et al 2017 while drop size distribution patterns change with meteorological phenomenon such as rainfall intensity and wind the nominal spherical drop size of the 30 µl water drop 3 86 mm would be representative of a throughfall drop beneath a canopy drip point and the nominal spherical drop size of the 10 µl water drop 2 67 mm would be comparable to a large raindrop nanko et al 2013 increasing the water drop size in this experimental study from 10 µl to 30 µl resulted in an increased maximum change in leaf inclination angle table 1 the increased maximum change in leaf inclination angle with water drop size is the result of the increased force exerted on the leaf surface ginebra solanellas et al 2020 the maximum change in leaf inclination angle after the first drop impact was lower in quercus gambelii than the other two species table 1 the leaf inclination angle for q gambelii after each 10 µl water drop impact barely changed fig 5a for many of the leaf samples following a 30 µl water droplet fig 5b the mean leaf inclination angle for q gambelii more than doubled table 1 however the mean change in maximum leaf inclination angle was less than half compared with the other two species ulmus pumila leaves experienced the largest mean change in leaf inclination angle following the impact of 10 µl drops table 1 fig 6a acer saccharinum leaves had the largest mean change in maximum leaf inclination angle following 30 µl drops table 1 fig 4b from a hydrological point of view the significance of the variation in changes in mean leaf inclination angle upon raindrop impact between species is that this phenomenon contributes to our understanding of the dynamic rainfall interception process calder et al 1996 found that the rate of canopy wetting increased with small volume water drops compared with larger water drop sizes in experiments using a rainfall simulator the reduction in canopy wetting with increased drop size was attributed to splashing from the kinetic energy of the larger drops although it was predicted that increased drop sizes would exert more force on the leaf to momentarily increase the leaf inclination angle an important finding in this study was to illustrate that the response of impact of the same water drop size was different for the three species a large variation in responses to raindrop impacts is shown in figs 4 5 and 6 leaf traits such as leaf area and leaf mass may explain a portion of the variation in response to raindrop impact fig 7 and fig 8 also the initial leaf inclination angle may explain the large variation in responses to raindrop impact a leaf that is not inclined i e leaf inclination angle 0 will receive the full force of a raindrop impact when the force is perpendicular to the leaf surface the force causes the majority of the deflection niklas 1999 for leaves with an initial angle only the portion of the impact that is perpendicular to the leaf surface will contribute to the deflection of the leaf ginebra solanellas et al 2020 when the force is almost parallel to the leaf surface minimal effects to leaf inclination angle will be produced because only a small portion of the momentum of a falling drop is transferred to the leaf to cause it to momentarily oscillate de langre 2019 additionally differences in leaf biomechanical properties influence the resistance to leaf movement upon exertion of force by water drops or wind spatz and theckes 2013 goodrich et al 2016 the biomechanical properties of leaves are controlled by the leaf structure and composition such as the strength of internal fibers and vascular tissues and the toughness of epicuticular wax on the leaf surface and these traits vary by species sanson et al 2001 read and sanson 2003 gibson 2005 onoda et al 2015 khanal and knoche 2017 because of the variability of leaf biomechanical properties leaves respond differently to raindrop impact during a rainfall event species with leaves that respond to raindrop impact by creating greater leaf oscillations may be able to shed intercepted water from leaf surfaces more efficiently ginebra solanellas et al 2020 the differences in mean change in leaf inclination angle between the three species may be largely explained by differences in leaf structural properties including leaf toughness leaf area and leaf mass for example holder 2011 measured leaf toughness using a punch test through the lamina sanson et al 2001 read and sanson 2003 and found that the toughness of q gambelii leaves were significantly greater than leaves of u pumila and a saccharinum the structural toughness of q gambelii leaves may be responsible for the greater resistance to leaf movement upon raindrop impact resistance to change in leaf inclination angle was also influenced by leaf area fig 7 and leaf mass fig 8 as leaf area and leaf mass increased the maximum change in leaf inclination angle decreased this relationship was not equal for the three species suggesting that other leaf structural and biomechanical properties were important in determining the impact of the force of water on leaves the r2 values for the relationships in q gambelii and u pumila leaves were larger than a saccharinum leaves figs 7 and 8 leaves are composed of the lamina and the petiole each component consisting of different structural properties and composition niklas 1999 onoda et al 2015 a function of the petiole is to support the mass of lamina to maximize sunlight by properly orienting photosynthetic tissues to direct light niinemets and fleck 2002 raabe et al 2015 minorsky 2019 the petioles of a saccharinum are longer than the petioles of u pumila and q gambelii little 1980 a larger proportion of the mass of u pumila and q gambelii leaves consists of the lamina niklas 1991 1999 described the petiole acting like an elastic cantilever beam when a force is exerted on it and the decaying sinusoidal oscillation shown in figs 4 5 and 6 for each species support the conclusion that individual leaves respond as a cantilever beam in response to raindrop impact because of differences in structural properties the petiole and the lamina may respond different to individual raindrops the different biomechanical responses of species to raindrop impacts may influence interception processes in the canopy for example leaves that respond by maximizing the leaf inclination angle after raindrop impact may shed water droplets from the canopy easier than leaves that barely deflect after raindrop impact leaves store a maximum amount of water on their surfaces leaf surface storage the leaf surface storage for the three species in this study were statistically different from each other table 1 leaf surface storage was highest in u pumila and lowest in a saccharinum additionally the water droplet retention angle was highest in u pumila and lowest in a saccharinum table 1 the water droplet retention angle is the angle at which a water droplet begins to move from a leaf surface as the leaf is incrementally tilted in this study u pumila had a higher leaf surface storage than the other two species and individual raindrops may act as a stimulus to drain the u pumila leaves of excess water on the surface by causing the the water droplet retention angle to be surpassed u pumila leaves responded greatly to raindrop impact as is indicated by the maximum change in leaf inclination angle following raindrop impacts table 1 fig 6 water accumulated on leaf surfaces may promote the development of pathogens huber and gillespie 1992 and influence photosynthesis by decreasing gas exchange between the internal leaf and the atmosphere ishibashi and terashima 1995 berry and goldsmith 2020 but there may be potential benefits to water accumulation on leaves such as improving plant water status dawson and goldsmith 2018 for all three species the force of raindrop impacts momentarily increased leaf inclination angles and may serve as a mechanism to reduce accumulated water on leaf surfaces during rainfall interception in addition to this process the accumulation of water remaining on a leaf surface after raindrop impact may provide another mechanism to increase the leaf inclination angle during rainfall interception and this accumulation of water on the leaf surface may assist with water drainage from the leaf surface as the rainfall event progresses papierowska et al 2019 examined raindrop splash residues on leaf surfaces from species with a variation in leaf wettability the wettability of the leaf created different rainsplash patterns and produced varying sizes of ejecta small water drops after raindrop impacts on leaves raindrops separate into multiple smaller sized drops upon impact on the vegetative surfaces herwitz 1987 papierowska et al 2019 a proportion of these smaller droplets remain on the leaf adding mass on the lamina that the petiole supports for each species the mass of the accumulated water incrementally increases the steady state leaf inclination angle after each raindrop impact figs 4 6 larger raindrops produced more rainsplash residue on the leaf surface based on the incremental increase in steady state leaf inclination angle after sequential raindrop impacts table 2 with repeated raindrop impacts leaves in the canopy accumulate more water mass as the maximum leaf surface storage is achieved this study only examined the change in leaf inclination angles after two raindrop impacts for a saccharinum and q gambelii and after three raindrop impacts for u pumila even after two 30 µl raindrop impacts the steady state leaf inclination angle increased by 0 56 for q gambelii 1 45 for u pumila and 2 05 for a saccharinum table 2 the toughness of q gambelii may explain the lower values for this species compared with the other two species additionally the mass and leaf area contribute to the changes in steady state leaf inclination angle after raindrop impact figs 7 and 8 after the third sequential raindrop the steady state leaf inclination angle for u pumila increased by 1 83 and 2 11 in the 10 µl and 30 µl experiments respectively table 2 although this study only examined a maximum of three rain drops impacting on leaves many more than three raindrops could impact an individual leaf during a rainfall event and the impacts of more raindrops could produce even larger steady state leaf inclination angles the maximum steady state leaf inclination angle created after multiple raindrops may be used as an estimate for the leaf surface storage for a species scaling up to the entire canopy determining the differences in leaf inclination angles in the canopy before a rainfall event and immediately after a rainfall event may also serve as a method to estimate the foliage component of canopy interception terrestrial lidar remote sensing may provide an example of a technology and methodology to scale up from the leaf to an entire canopy béland et al 2011 hosoi and omasa 2015 bailey and mahaffee 2017 liu et al 2019 a terrestrial lidar scanner could measure the canopy from a fixed location immediately before and immediately following a rainfall event and record changes in leaf inclination angles the changes in leaf inclination angles before and after a rainfall event could serve as another metric for canopy water storage baptista et al 2018b 5 conclusions rainfall interception is a dynamic process as individual raindrops exert a force on leaf surfaces this force breaks the raindrop into multiple smaller drops some of which are retained on the leaf and some splash off herwitz 1987 papierowska et al 2019 this force also produces transient change in leaf inclination angle incident rainfall splash throughfall and intra canopy drops of various drop sizes and velocities impact leaves within a canopy during a rainfall event levia et al 2019 each species responds differently to raindrop impacts based on the biomechanical traits of the leaves the significance of leaf biomechanics on canopy rainfall interception is a largely unexplored research topic because the relationships between leaf inclination angle water droplet retention and leaf surface storage are important canopy parameters that explain differences in rainfall interception and throughfall under different canopies with constant leaf area index additional research could provide more nuanced understandings of the dynamic process of rainfall interception that link leaf biomechanics and ecohydrology this study found that the steady state leaf inclination angle increases after the impact of raindrops these changes in steady state leaf inclination angle are largely species specific e g particular leaf biomechanical properties and are influenced by raindrop size i e larger raindrop sizes produce more accumulation of mass after raindrop impact the steady state inclination angle increased with each sequential raindrop impact during a rainfall event as leaf surface storage is achieved

5327,during rainfall events rain and throughfall drops impact on individual leaves exerting a force that divides the drops into multiple droplets and produces momentary increases in the leaf inclination angle a portion of the splash residue from the raindrop impact accumulates on the leaf surface and adds mass to the lamina of leaf this lab based study examined changes in leaf inclination angle after the impact of a sequence of raindrops of two different volumes 10 µl and 30 µl on leaf surfaces of three different tree species acer saccharinum l ulmus pumila l and quercus gambelii nutt leaf inclination is measured as the angle between the lamina surface normal and the horizontal the differences between the initial leaf inclination angle before raindrop impacts and the steady state leaf inclination angles after each raindrop impact were examined to explore the hypothesis that rainsplash residue accumulated on leaves after raindrop impact will incrementally increase the steady state leaf inclination angle as the leaves approach leaf surface storage the difference between the initial leaf inclination angle and the steady state leaf inclination angle after two 10 µl raindrops increased by 0 23 for q gambelii 0 84 for a saccharinum and 1 29 for u pumila the difference between the initial leaf inclination angle and the steady state leaf inclination angle after two 30 µl raindrops increased by 0 56 for q gambelii 1 45 for u pumila and 2 05 for a saccharinum for each species the mass of the accumulated water incrementally increased the steady state leaf inclination angle after each raindrop impact as expected larger raindrops produced more rainsplash residue on the leaf surface based on the incremental increase in steady state leaf inclination angle after sequential raindrop impacts with repeated raindrop impacts leaves in the canopy accumulate more water mass as the maximum leaf surface storage is achieved observing changes in steady state leaf

richardson 2000 papierowska et al 2019 a portion of the raindrop splash may reach the forest floor after breaking up into smaller throughfall drops levia et al 2019 another portion of the raindrop may accumulate on the vegetative surfaces and contribute to stemflow or the development of canopy drips along vegetative surface eventually returning to the forest floor carlyle moses and schooling 2015 iida et al 2017 levia et al 2019 the amount of rainfall remaining on the canopy that does not pass through the canopy drip from the canopy or drain down the branches and stems evaporates back into the atmosphere as the rainfall event proceeds the vegetation canopy continues to intercept precipitation until canopy storage capacity is achieved aston 1979 keim et al 2006 wang et al 2012 xiao and mcpherson 2016 canopy storage capacity is the maximum depth of water a canopy can store at the end of a rainfall event after drip has ceased a component of canopy storage capacity is leaf surface

al 2019 leaf surface storage is achieved as water continues to accumulate on the leaf during a rainfall event holder 2013 individual raindrops impact leaf surfaces during rainfall events causing transient changes in the leaf inclination angle casas et al 1998 gart et al 2015 ginebra solanellas 2016 modeled the changes in leaf inclination angle due to a single raindrop impacting leaves as an exponentially decaying oscillation before the raindrop impact the leaf maintains a steady state leaf inclination angle immediately following the raindrop impact the leaf inclination angle increases from steady state to the maximum leaf inclination angle then the inclination angle oscillates and decays to a new steady state angle the maximum change in leaf inclination angle after raindrop impact is a function of species and raindrop size ginebra solanellas et al 2020 the leaf oscillations from individual raindrops form similar patterns to the ones found in experiments examining the plant vibrations produced because of wind speck and spatz 2004 spatz et al 2007 tadrist et al 2015 de langre 2019 as the mass of water increases on a leaf surface during a rainfall event the leaf inclination angle increases the mass of water supported by leaves and the associated deflection may be species dependent based on the biomechanical properties of the petiole and the lamina niklas 1991

cause a new steady state leaf inclination angle due to the mass of water accumulating on the leaf surface this change in leaf inclination angle from the initial steady state before raindrop impact to a new steady state following raindrop impact may indicate the progression toward the leaf surface storage the objectives of this lab based study are 1 to examine the changes in steady state leaf inclination angles following sequential raindrop impacts and 2 to examine the effect of leaf traits on leaf oscillations following sequential raindrop impacts specifically we utilize an exponentially decaying oscillation model to determine the initial and new steady state leaf inclination angles following multiple raindrop impacts on leaves of three tree species we hypothesize that raindrop splash residue accumulated on leaves will incrementally increase the leaf inclination angle following sequential raindrop impacts 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling area and selection of species three species acer saccharinum l ulmus pumila l and quercus gambelii nutt located in colorado springs co usa 38 53 n 104 48 w were selected for this study colorado springs is situated along the boundary between the highland grasslands and the mixed conifers ecosystems within the rapidly urbanizing fountain creek watershed annual precipitation in this foothills prairie ecosystem is 442 mm mean monthly temperature ranges from 2 2 c in january to 20 9 c in july arguez et al 2010 the three species were selected because of previous research on them and each species represented a different ecological and hydrological function within the watershed holder and gibbes 2017 quercus gambelii is a common native species in the sampling area and has adapted to undisturbed open spaces ulmus pumila is native to asia and has naturalized in the sampling area ulmus pumila is an invasive and opportunistic species that disperses rapidly in vacant lots in the sampling area acer saccharinum is not native the species is planted as an ornamental tree by households within the city of colorado springs acer saccharinum would not survive in the semi arid climate without adequate irrigation leaf samples were collected from multiple individual plants in the sampling area in the vicinity of the university campus in the morning for three weeks in july small branches from the lower canopy of each species were harvested in the sampling area and brought to the lab the transportation time from the sampling sites to the lab was under five minutes the ends of the branches were placed in water to minimize desiccation approximately five leaves were sampled from the harvested branches each day from 9 00 a m to 3 00p m and the branches with unsampled leaves were discarded at the end of the day experiments with each leaf began immediately after the leaf was harvested from the branch all of the following experiments for each leaf occurred in 30 min after sampling the leaf from the branch over the course of three weeks a total of sixty leaves 20 from each species with a range of sizes were harvested from the branches for the experiments 2 2 raindrop generator experiment a raindrop generator was constructed in the laboratory to investigate the changes in leaf inclination angle after sequential raindrop impacts fig 1 the raindrop generator used a ne 300 infusion syringe pump new era pump systems farmingdale ny usa that forced deionized water through a pvc tube to a straight stainless steel needle the connections between the syringe the tube and the needle were made using barbed sockets and plugs a metered stand secured both the leaf and the needle interchangeable needles with different apertures were used to generate 10 µl and 30 µl water drops the 10 µl and 30 µl water drop sizes equal a spherical drop size of 2 67 mm and 3 86 mm respectively and the sizes are within reported ranges of common precipitation and throughfall drop sizes nanko et al 2016 levia et al 2019 the 30 µl drops were released from a height of 1 22 m resulting in a velocity at impact of 4 85 m sec 55 of terminal velocity and a linear momentum of 0 146 g m sec the terminal velocity for a 30 µl drop was 8 83 m sec and the linear momentum at terminal velocity was 0 265 g m sec the release height for the 10 µl drops was 0 875 m resulting in a velocity at impact of 3 83 m sec 52 of terminal velocity and a linear momentum of 0 039 g m sec the terminal velocity of a 10 µl drop is 7 37 m sec and the linear momentum at terminal velocity was 0 0737 g m sec the selection of drop sizes provided a range of linear momentum representative of both incident rainfall and throughfall individual leaves were secured using a metal clamp and positioned directly beneath the needle for the water drop to strike at the geometric center of the leaf the metal clamp fastened to the vertical stand of the raindrop generator fig 1 petioles with diameters of up to 6 mm can be held with the metal clamp the end of the petiole was secured within the clamp and gently tightened to secure the leaf without damaging the petiole we determined the geometric center of the leaf as the half way distance along the mid vein of the lamina between the leaf tip and the point where the lamina connects with the petiole trial water drops were released from the needle avoiding getting the leaf sample wet to ensure that the drop hit the geometric center the clamp holding the needle was adjusted to ensure that each water drop fell on the center of the leaf the trial water drops were prevented from wetting the leaf surface by placing an absorptive paper over the drop point immediately above the leaf surface the water temperature was kept constant at 20 c to avoid changes in viscosity a hot shot cc video camera nac image technology simi valley ca usa was positioned approximately 1 5 m from the drop release point and perpendicular to the leaf to produce a high contrast grey scale image a white background was placed behind the leaf as the water drops were released at a rate of approximately one drop per second from the raindrop generator the high speed video camera recorded the drop impact on the leaf at either 2 000 for the a saccharinum and q gambelii leaf samples or 3 000 frames per second for the u pumila leaf samples because the u pumila experiments were videotaped at a faster frame rate three sequential water drops were able to be recorded the videos from the a saccharinum and q gambelii experiments recorded two sequential water drops the maximum length of each video was approximately three seconds each video was between 0 5 and 2 gb in size and was saved as avi files 2 3 measurement of leaf traits after each leaf was harvested and before the experiment with the raindrop generator the fresh weight of each leaf leaf mass was measured leaf area was measured with a ci 202 portable area meter cid bio science camas wa usa leaf hydrophobicity and water droplet retention angle of the adaxial leaf surface of each leaf from each species was measured with a model 250 contact angle goniometer tensiometer rame hart instrument company netcong new jersey following the procedures of holder 2012 a 10 µl droplet of deionized water was placed on the horizontal leaf pinned to a balsa wood platform on the goniometer the contact angle between the water droplet and the adaxial leaf surface was measured with dropimage software a greater contact angle indicates a more spherical water droplet and a more water repelling surface if the contact angle between the water droplet and the leaf surface is greater than 110 then the leaf surface is classified as non wettable aryal neuner 2010 the water droplet retention angle the threshold maximum of the leaf from the horizontal to resist water drop drainage was measured by placing a 50 µl droplet of deionized water on the adaxial leaf surface pinned to the tilting platform of the goniometer the platform of the goniometer and leaf was tilted slowly at 0 1 increments from the horizontal 0 to 90 until the water droplet began to move off the leaf surface the leaf surface storage g m 2 the maximum amount of water retained on a leaf divided by the all sided surface area of the leaf was measured by adapting the methodology of liu 1998 and llorens and gallart 2000 each leaf was submerged in distilled water for 15 s after the 15 second immersion the leaf was extracted from the distilled water and water was allowed to drip off the leaf for 10 s to simulate still air conditions then the leaf mass was re measured the difference between dry and wet leaf mass for each leaf is calculated and divided by the all sided surface area to determine the leaf surface storage of each leaf 2 4 video processing the recorded videos were processed in matlab to track the changes in leaf inclination angle from immediately before to after two or three sequential raindrop impacts each video was recorded for approximately three seconds the videos were processed frame by frame in order to use built in image processing tools in matlab the video frames were converted from greyscale to black and white the frames of the video were cropped to include only the profile image of the leaf a sharp contrast between the leaf and the background was produced and the matlab built in function edge was able to detect the margins of the leaf in each frame leaf inclination angle is defined as the angle between the lamina surface normal and the horizontal fig 2 the leaf tip and the point connecting the petiole with the leaf blade was identified in each frame and a segment was drawn to connect the two points the leaf inclination angle was determined by calculating the angle produced between the line segment and a horizontal line across the image the static leaf inclination angle deflection due to the leaf s weight was measured as the average leaf angle in the first twenty frames of the video before each raindrop impact then the maximum leaf inclination angle was measured as the maximum value of the leaf inclination angle following the first water drop impact subsequent oscillation peaks and minimums were also identified a model described in ginebra solanellas 2016 was fit to the sequence of oscillation peaks to model the exponential portion of the following equation 1 θ a e ζ ω n â t sin ω d t θ ss where 2 ω d ω n 1 ζ 2 a is the amplitude of the vibration t is time ω d is the damped natural frequency ω n is the natural frequency and ζ is the damping ratio θ ss is the steady state value of the leaf inclination angle after the drop impact the maximum value of the inclination angle θmax is 3 θ max a exp ζ 1 ζ 2 tan 1 1 ζ 2 ζ sin tan 1 1 ζ 2 ζ θ ss the model is fit to the data by identifying the oscillation peaks the time between peaks is used to determine the damped natural frequency then the equation 4 a e ζ ω n â t θ ss is fit to the oscillation peaks the dashed line in fig 3 shows this fit for a representative data set 2 5 data analysis the changes in leaf inclination angle before and after water drop impact were plotted and analyzed tests of significance were conducted to determine if the maximum change in leaf inclination angle differs between the 10 µl water drop experiments and the 30 µl water drop experiments for each species analyses of variance were used to test whether there are significant differences in leaf mass leaf area leaf hydrophobicity water droplet retention leaf surface storage and the maximum change in leaf inclination angle between the three species when analysis of variance indicated significant differences among species a tukey honestly significant differences test was performed to determine which pairs of species exhibit significant differences paired t tests were conducted to test for significant differences between maximum changes in leaf inclination angles between the 10 µl experiment and the 30 µl experiment additionally paired t tests were conducted to test for differences between the initial steady state leaf inclination angle and each new steady state leaf inclination angle following each sequential raindrop from the t test results for the changes in leaf inclination angle after multiple sequential raindrop impacts we were able to evaluate the hypothesis that raindrop splash residue accumulated on leaves incrementally increases the leaf inclination angle following sequential raindrop impacts additionally linear regressions were performed to determine if there were associations between water droplet retention and leaf hydrophobicity leaf surface storage and water droplet retention and leaf surface storage and leaf hydrophobicity all statistical tests were considered significant at p 0 05 data analyses were conducted using systat

to 10 µl water drops impacting the geometric center of each leaf the plots of change in leaf inclination angle show decaying sinusoidal oscillations after each raindrop impact large increases in leaf inclination angles occurred immediately after impact and within 0 1 s following each sequential raindrop impact the leaf inclination angle oscillations achieve a new steady state within a second and right before the next raindrop impacts the amplitudes of the leaf inclination angle changes were generally greater after 30 µl drops impacted the leaf surface fig 4b the mean maximum change in leaf

amplitude of the leaf deflections after water drop impact was not as large in q gambelii when compared with the other two species fig 5 the mean maximum change in leaf inclination angle in q gambelii

leaf inclination was larger for a saccharinum table 1 the changes in leaf inclination angle for u pumila fig 6 were especially large in the 30 µl water drop experiment the difference in the maximum change in leaf inclination angle for u pumila between the 10 µl drop experiment and the 30 µl drop experiment was significant t 2 217 d f 18 p 0 04 analysis of variance showed differences in the

gambelii was the only pair of species not significantly different in maximum change in leaf inclination angle in the 10 µl water drop experiment p 0 844 however in the 30 µl water drop experiment a saccharinum and q gambelii was the only pair of species that was significantly different in maximum change in leaf inclination angle table 1 p 0 05 strong linear relationships existed between leaf area and the maximum change in leaf inclination angle after drop impact for the 10 µl drop and 30 µl drop experiments fig 7 the regression models showed a significant relationship between leaf area and maximum leaf inclination angle at p 0 05 for q gambelii and u pumila the regression models for a saccharinum were not significant the regression models for q gambelii and u pumila had r2 values greater than 0 55 which indicates that leaf area accounted for more than 54 of the variation in the maximum leaf inclination angle additionally strong linear relationships existed between leaf mass and the maximum change in leaf inclination angle also for q gambelii and u pumila fig 8 but not for acer saccharinum the weakest r2 value calculated in the relationship between leaf mass and the maximum change in leaf inclination angle was for a saccharinum in the 10 µl drop experiment r2 0 26 n 10 p 0 136 fig 7a 3 3 incremental increases in steady state leaf inclination angle after raindrop impact table 2 shows the mean initial leaf inclination angle before raindrop impact and the mean steady state leaf inclination angles following each subsequent raindrop impact from the 10 µl drop and 30 µl drop experiments the peak leaf inclination angles from the experimental data in figs 4 5 and 6 were used to determine the steady state angle as describe in section 2 4 and illustrated in fig 3 in the 10 µl drop experiment the steady state leaf inclination angle for u pumila increased the most after subsequent raindrop impacts compared with the other two species the difference between the initial leaf inclination angle and the steady state leaf inclination angle after two 10 µl raindrops increased by 0 23 for q gambelii 0 84 for a saccharinum and 1 29 for u pumila in the 30 µl drop experiment the incremental increase in steady state leaf inclination angles from the initial leaf inclination was larger for all species the difference between the initial leaf inclination angle and the steady state leaf inclination angle after two 30 µl raindrops increased by 0 56 for q gambelii 1 45 for u pumila and 2 05 for a saccharinum table 2 in both raindrop size experiments 10 µl and 30 µl q gambelii showed the least change in steady state leaf inclination angle between the initial leaf inclination angle and subsequent steady state leaf inclination angles following raindrop impact results from paired t tests between all pairs of initial leaf inclination angles and subsequent steady state leaf inclination angles in all species were significantly different p 0 01 except in one case the difference between the initial leaf inclination and the steady state leaf inclination angle after one 10 µl raindrop for q gambelii was not significantly different p 0 15 the results from the paired t tests may support our hypothesis that raindrop splash residue accumulated on leaves during rainfall events incrementally increases the leaf inclination angle following sequential raindrop impacts 4 discussion the water drop sizes produced from the raindrop generator were within the range of actual rain and throughfall drop size distributions reported from previous studies nanko et al 2006 carollo et al 2017 while drop size distribution patterns change with meteorological phenomenon such as rainfall intensity and wind the nominal spherical drop size of the 30 µl water drop 3 86 mm would be representative of a throughfall drop beneath a canopy drip point and the nominal spherical drop size of the 10 µl water drop 2 67 mm would be comparable to a large raindrop nanko et al 2013 increasing the water drop size in this experimental study from 10 µl to 30 µl resulted in an increased maximum change in leaf inclination angle table 1 the increased maximum change in leaf inclination angle with water drop size is the result of the increased force exerted on the leaf surface ginebra solanellas et al 2020 the maximum change in leaf inclination angle after the first drop impact was lower in quercus gambelii than the other two species table 1 the leaf inclination angle for q gambelii after each 10 µl water drop impact barely changed fig 5a for many of the leaf samples following a 30 µl water droplet fig 5b the mean leaf inclination angle for q gambelii more than doubled table 1 however the mean change in maximum leaf inclination angle was less than half compared with the other two species ulmus pumila leaves experienced the largest mean change in leaf inclination angle following the impact of 10 µl drops table 1 fig 6a acer saccharinum leaves had the largest mean change in maximum leaf inclination angle following 30 µl drops table 1 fig 4b from a hydrological point of view the significance of the variation in changes in mean leaf inclination angle upon raindrop impact between species is that this phenomenon contributes to our understanding of the dynamic rainfall interception process calder et al 1996 found that the rate of canopy wetting increased with small volume water drops compared with larger water drop sizes in experiments using a rainfall simulator the reduction in canopy wetting with increased drop size was attributed to splashing from the kinetic energy of the larger drops although it was predicted that increased drop sizes would exert more force on the leaf to momentarily increase the leaf inclination angle an important finding in this study was to illustrate that the response of impact of the same water drop size was different for the three species a large variation in responses to raindrop impacts is shown in figs 4 5 and 6 leaf traits such as leaf area and leaf mass may explain a portion of the variation in response to raindrop impact fig 7 and fig 8 also the initial leaf inclination angle may explain the large variation in responses to raindrop impact a leaf that is not inclined i e leaf inclination angle 0 will receive the full force of a raindrop impact when the force is perpendicular to the leaf surface the force causes the majority of the deflection niklas 1999 for leaves with an initial angle only the portion of the impact that is perpendicular to the leaf surface will contribute to the deflection of the leaf ginebra solanellas et al 2020 when the force is almost parallel to the leaf surface minimal effects to leaf inclination angle will be produced because only a small portion of the momentum of a falling drop is transferred to the leaf to cause it to momentarily oscillate de langre 2019 additionally differences in leaf biomechanical properties influence the resistance to leaf movement upon exertion of force by water drops or wind spatz and theckes 2013 goodrich et al 2016 the biomechanical properties of leaves are controlled by the leaf structure and composition such as the strength of internal fibers and vascular tissues and the toughness of epicuticular wax on the leaf surface and these traits vary by species sanson et al 2001 read and sanson 2003 gibson 2005 onoda et al 2015 khanal and knoche 2017 because of the variability of leaf biomechanical properties leaves respond differently to raindrop impact during a rainfall event species with leaves that respond to raindrop impact by creating greater leaf oscillations may be able to shed intercepted water from leaf surfaces more efficiently ginebra solanellas et al 2020 the differences in mean change in leaf inclination angle between the three species may be largely explained by differences in leaf structural properties including leaf toughness leaf area and leaf mass for example holder 2011 measured leaf toughness using a punch test through the lamina sanson et al 2001 read and sanson 2003 and found that the toughness of q gambelii leaves were significantly greater than leaves of u pumila and a saccharinum the structural toughness of q gambelii leaves may be responsible for the greater resistance to leaf movement upon raindrop impact resistance to change in leaf inclination angle was also influenced by leaf area fig 7 and leaf mass fig 8 as leaf area and leaf mass increased the maximum change in leaf inclination angle decreased this relationship was not equal for the three species suggesting that other leaf structural and biomechanical properties were important in determining the impact of the force of water on leaves the r2 values for the relationships in q gambelii and u pumila leaves were larger than a saccharinum leaves figs 7 and 8 leaves are composed of the lamina and the petiole each component consisting of different structural properties and composition niklas 1999 onoda et al 2015 a function of the petiole is to support the mass of lamina to maximize sunlight by properly orienting photosynthetic tissues to direct light niinemets and fleck 2002 raabe et al 2015 minorsky 2019 the petioles of a saccharinum are longer than the petioles of u pumila and q gambelii little 1980 a larger proportion of the mass of u pumila and q gambelii leaves consists of the lamina niklas 1991 1999 described the petiole acting like an elastic cantilever beam when a force is exerted on it and the decaying sinusoidal oscillation shown in figs 4 5 and 6 for each species support the conclusion that individual leaves respond as a cantilever beam in response to raindrop impact because of differences in structural properties the petiole and the lamina may respond different to individual raindrops the different biomechanical responses of species to raindrop impacts may influence interception processes in the canopy for example leaves that respond by maximizing the leaf inclination angle after raindrop impact may shed water droplets from the canopy easier than leaves that barely deflect after raindrop impact leaves store a maximum amount of water on their surfaces leaf surface storage the leaf surface storage for the three species in this study were statistically different from each other table 1 leaf surface storage was highest in u pumila and lowest in a saccharinum additionally the water droplet retention angle was highest in u pumila and lowest in a saccharinum table 1 the water droplet retention angle is the angle at which a water droplet begins to move from a leaf surface as the leaf is incrementally tilted in this study u pumila had a higher leaf surface storage than the other two species and individual raindrops may act as a stimulus to drain the u pumila leaves of excess water on the surface by causing the the water droplet retention angle to be surpassed u pumila leaves responded greatly to raindrop impact as is indicated by the maximum change in leaf inclination angle following raindrop impacts table 1 fig 6 water accumulated on leaf surfaces may promote the development of pathogens huber and gillespie 1992 and influence photosynthesis by decreasing gas exchange between the internal leaf and the atmosphere ishibashi and terashima 1995 berry and goldsmith 2020 but there may be potential benefits to water accumulation on leaves such as improving plant water status dawson and goldsmith 2018 for all three species the force of raindrop impacts momentarily increased leaf inclination angles and may serve as a mechanism to reduce accumulated water on leaf surfaces during rainfall interception in addition to this process the accumulation of water remaining on a leaf surface after raindrop impact may provide another mechanism to increase the leaf inclination angle during rainfall interception and this accumulation of water on the leaf surface may assist with water drainage from the leaf surface as the rainfall event progresses papierowska et al 2019 examined raindrop splash residues on leaf surfaces from species with a variation in leaf wettability the wettability of the leaf created different rainsplash patterns and produced varying sizes of ejecta small water drops after raindrop impacts on leaves raindrops separate into multiple smaller sized drops upon impact on the vegetative surfaces herwitz 1987 papierowska et al 2019 a proportion of these smaller droplets remain on the leaf adding mass on the lamina that the petiole supports for each species the mass of the accumulated water incrementally increases the steady state leaf inclination angle after each raindrop impact figs 4 6 larger raindrops produced more rainsplash residue on the leaf surface based on the incremental increase in steady state leaf inclination angle after sequential raindrop impacts table 2 with repeated raindrop impacts leaves in the canopy accumulate more water mass as the maximum leaf surface storage is achieved this study only examined the change in leaf inclination angles after two raindrop impacts for a saccharinum and q gambelii and after three raindrop impacts for u pumila even after two 30 µl raindrop impacts the steady state leaf inclination angle increased by 0 56 for q gambelii 1 45 for u pumila and 2 05 for a saccharinum table 2 the toughness of q gambelii may explain the lower values for this species compared with the other two species additionally the mass and leaf area contribute to the changes in steady state leaf inclination angle after raindrop impact figs 7 and 8 after the third sequential raindrop the steady state leaf inclination angle for u pumila increased by 1 83 and 2 11 in the 10 µl and 30 µl experiments respectively table 2 although this study only examined a maximum of three rain drops impacting on leaves many more than three raindrops could impact an individual leaf during a rainfall event and the impacts of more raindrops could produce even larger steady state leaf inclination angles the maximum steady state leaf inclination angle created after multiple raindrops may be used as an estimate for the leaf surface storage for a species scaling up to the entire canopy determining the differences in leaf inclination angles in the canopy before a rainfall event and immediately after a rainfall event may also serve as a method to estimate the foliage component of canopy interception terrestrial lidar remote sensing may provide an example of a technology and methodology to scale up from the leaf to an entire canopy béland et al 2011 hosoi and omasa 2015 bailey and mahaffee 2017 liu et al 2019 a terrestrial lidar scanner could measure the canopy from a fixed location immediately before and immediately following a rainfall event and record changes in leaf inclination angles the changes in leaf inclination angles before and after a rainfall event could serve as another metric for canopy water storage baptista et al 2018b 5 conclusions rainfall interception is a dynamic process as individual raindrops exert a force on leaf surfaces this force breaks the raindrop into multiple smaller drops some of which are retained on the leaf and some splash off herwitz 1987 papierowska et al 2019 this force also produces transient change in leaf inclination angle incident rainfall splash throughfall and intra canopy drops of various drop sizes and velocities impact leaves within a canopy during a rainfall event levia et al 2019 each species responds differently to raindrop impacts based on the biomechanical traits of the leaves the significance of leaf biomechanics on canopy rainfall interception is a largely unexplored research topic because the relationships between leaf inclination angle water droplet retention and leaf surface storage are important canopy parameters that explain differences in rainfall interception and throughfall under different canopies with constant leaf area index additional research could provide more nuanced understandings of the dynamic process of rainfall interception that link leaf biomechanics and ecohydrology this study found that the steady state leaf inclination angle increases after the impact of raindrops these changes in steady state leaf inclination angle are largely species specific e g particular leaf biomechanical properties and are influenced by raindrop size i e larger raindrop sizes produce more accumulation of mass after raindrop impact the steady state inclination angle increased with each sequential raindrop impact during a rainfall event as leaf surface storage is achieved the difference between initial and maximum steady state leaf inclination angle after a rainfall event may be an indicator for achievement of leaf surface storage declaration of competing interest the

retrievals fang and lakshmi 2014b fang et al 2018a fang et al 2018b senanayake et al 2019 dandridge et al 2020 2 brief description of the downscaling methodology the original downscaling algorithm is based on the thermal inertia theory that wetter objects tend to have a greater volumetric heat capacity and lower temperature change and vice versa for dry objects the assumption made is that the rate of change in surface soil moisture is negatively correlated to the rate of change in surface temperature matsushima et al 2012 this is especially true during the summer months when the evapotranspiration rate is the dominant factor therefore in the application of the algorithm it is assumed that the maximum diurnal surface temperature difference can be estimated by the difference of surface temperature between the two overpass times of aqua modis 1 30 p m time of maximum surface temperature and 1 30 a m time of minimum surface temperature fang et al 2013 and this would correspond to the smap sm overpasses i e 6 00 a m or 6 00 p m the relationship between the nldas noah model derived surface skin temperature change δ t s and sm θ between 1981 and 2018 can be modeled using a linear regression fit the ltdr ndvi data were used to classify the corresponding nldas θ δ t s relationship by grouping them at an interval of 0 1 over the 0 1 ndvi range the relationship was then developed separately for each class and applied on 1 km modis lst grids which were included within the corresponding nldas grid s boundaries to calculate the 1 km sm we made an assumption that the spatial variability of the θ δ t s relationship within one nldas grid could be ignored the 1 km sm calculated from the θ δ t s model needs to be adjusted by the difference between smap 9 km sm and the average of all 1 km θ δ t s model output grids located in the 33 km contributing domain which is the native spatial area to the 9 km smap radiometer tb grid chan et al 2018 this modification can effectively reduce the sharp edge effect which is most likely caused by the errors of nldas and modis data this is the major improvement of the original downscaling algorithm developed by fang et al 2013 the conceptual diagram of the model building implementation and downscaling is given in fig 1 3 study area and data description 3 1 study area the sm downscaling algorithm was used to derive a downscaled 1 km soil moisture product using the available smap 9 km daily sm product between 2015 and 2018 over the conus domain a major reason for limiting the spatial domain to conus was determined by the need of long term estimates of surface skin temperature change δts and sm θ one way to address this need at a global scale is to use readily available model based products the regression model was applied by utilizing the nldas model output data which provides spatial coverage limited to the conus area at 12 5 km model grid spacing 3 2 data 3 2 1 nldas data nldas provides forcing data and lsm data at hourly time step and 12 5 km model grid spacing it spans from january 1979 to the present nldas data integrates lsm datasets and ground observations in this study we used the nldas noaa national oceanic and atmospheric administration noah lsm level 4 variables surface skin temperature unit k and sm unit m3 m3 at 0 10 cm http ldas gsfc nasa gov nldas to build the θ δ t s model the nldas noah model was developed from the ncep national centers for environmental prediction mesoscale eta model there have been numerous publications on validation of the nldas data such as ek et al 2003 schaake et al 2004 mitchell et al 2004 and xia et al 2013 fang et al 2016 3 2 2 ltdr ndvi data the ltdr is a project launched by nasa for publishing global surface climate data record and currently the ltdr version 5 ndvi is derived from noaa satellites n07 n19 avh13c1 avhrr 1981 present and terra aqua modis 2000 present pedelty et al 2007 the daily ndvi product is originally projected at 0 05 spatial resolution climate modeling grid cmg and is available at https ltdr nascom nasa gov the previous study showed a strong overall correlation of 0 87 between avhrr and modis ndvi data which suggested that the modis ndvi data could be used to supplement the existing avhrr historical data bédard et al 2006 in this study we only used the ltdr avhrr data and upscaled it to 12 5 km resolution to match with nldas grids for the θ δ t s model building 3 2 3 modis products modis is onboard two nasa satellites terra and aqua modis provides daily observations of land surface variables including radiation temperature and vegetation at a global scale it has a total of 36 visible infrared bands which range between 250 m and 1 km spatial resolution tucker 1979 wan and li 1997 in this study the 1 km daily aqua modis lst myd11a1 and the biweekly ndvi products myd13a2 were acquired from land processes distributed active archive center lp daac at https lpdaac usgs gov 3 2 4 smap data the smap mission was launched in january 2015 and it has an l band mission radiometer centered at 1 41 ghz that operates in a near polar sun synchronous orbit it has a revisit time of 2 3 days and observes the earth at 6 a m 6 p m the sm estimates represent the top 0 5 cm of soil layer with a threshold of vegetation water content 5 kg m2 chan et al 2016 in this study the enhanced level 2 half orbit 9 km sm product spl2smp e was acquired from nsidc national snow and ice data center at https nsidc org data spl2smp e for downscaling the smap sm retrievals are solely derived from the l band radiometer tb data using the single channel algorithm jackson 1993 at the native spatial resolution of 33 to 40 km the retrievals are enhanced to 9 km ease equal area scalable earth grid using the approach developed by chan et al 2018 which is based on interpolating antenna temperature data in the original smap level 1b tb data by using backus gilbert optimal interpolation technique 3 2 5 gpm global precipitation measurement data the gpm satellite mission is designed to provide new standard rainfall and snowfall observations at a global scale every 3 h this satellite has dual frequency dpr precipitation radar and gmi gpm microwave imager mounted and extends the measurement range of the trmm tropical rainfall measuring mission hou et al 2014 huffman et al 2015 the imerg integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm precipitation data were downloaded from https pmm nasa gov data access downloads gpm and were used as reference data to study the sm spatial and temporal variability of the downscaled sm as well as the influence of precipitation on the performance of the downscaling algorithm 3 2 6 ismn data the ismn hosts in situ sm measurements collected starting 1952 to present from a total of 35 international sm networks which include more than 1400 stations the purpose of ismn is to validate calibrate and improve the accuracy of remote sensing sm retrieval algorithms and lsm sm outputs as well as to provide other variable measurements including soil temperature and precipitation for the better interpretation of soil moisture dorigo et al 2011 2013 gruber et al 2013 the ismn data from the various sm networks were downloaded from https ismn geo tuwien ac at discussions and evaluations of the accuracy and uncertainties between different ismn soil networks can be found in the research by han et al 2014 rosolem et al 2013 zreda et al 2012 coopersmith et al 2016 bell et al 2013a b and diamond et al 2013 the downscaled smap 1 km sm estimates were evaluated using in situ sm measurements from 100 ismn stations in conus as the fig 2 shows the validation data include the stations from 4 sm networks for validating smap sm retrieval algorithms the ismn sm networks include cosmos cosmic ray soil moisture observation system soilscape soil moisture sensing controller and optimal estimator uscrn u s climate reference network and scan soil climate analysis network table 1 shows the brief descriptions of the 4 sm networks these stations cover different types of climate zones soil properties land cover types and vegetation types which allow us to thoroughly examine the performance of the downscaling algorithm over the conus domain in addition the san pedro watershed was used for mapping 1 km 9 km smap sm and showing the spatial and temporal sm variabilities 4 results and analyses 4 1 θ δt model evaluation the eqs 1 5 of the statistical variables r2 unbiased rmse bias spatial standard deviation and average are shown below they were used for evaluating and validating the 1 km 9 km smap sm estimates as well as the model performance willmott 1982 1 r 2 1 θ i θ i 2 θ i θ 2 2 b i 1 n θ i θ i n 3 ubrmse i 1 n θ i θ i b 2 n 4 σ i 1 n θ θ i 2 n 5 m i 1 n θ i n where r 2 and b are the coefficient of determination and bias between in situ sm θ and estimated sm θ 1 km downscaled and 9 km smap respectively u b r m s e is the unbiased rmse which removes the bias b from θ σ is the spatial standard deviation of estimated or in situ sm m is the averaged sm in addition in order to analyze the non randomness and the correlation of the data in the time series the autocorrelation function was applied on all three sm data sets and the autocorrelation r at the lag k is calculated as 6 r k i 1 n k θ i θ θ i k θ i 1 n θ i θ 2 where θ i is the sm estimate on the day i in this equation the time variable is not used for calculating the correlation coefficient but the two sm estimates on the days i and i k were used instead usually the first correlation when lag 1 is of interest in practical use the first step of the downscaling algorithm was to establish a reliable relationship between θ and δ t s using outputs from the nldas noah model between 1981 and 2018 separately for each ndvi class on a monthly basis fig 3 shows the overall r2 averaged from all ndvi classes for each nldas grid over the san pedro watershed for the months of april through september where each grid value represents the average value from the θ δ t s linear regression fit of all ndvi classes the maps demonstrate a change in the θ δ t s agreement for the april to september period higher r2 are achieved during the months of june and july it can be concluded that generally the warm months exhibit a stronger thermal inertia relationship between θ and δ t s june and july had relatively better overall r2 and most of the grid values in these two months are greater than 0 4 in addition to these we observe that some grids have relatively lower overall r2 these areas correspond to complex terrain and higher vegetation coverage which can lead to higher errors of nldas outputs hong et al 2009 fig 4 and table 2 summarize the θ δ t s linear regression fit statistics using the data between 1981 and 2018 at 6 locations for the month of july these results demonstrate generally better r2 at the san pedro basin r2 ranges 0 516 0 782 and tonzi ranch r2 ranges 0 417 0 213 compared to the other sites it also can be noted that the ndvi range at the san pedro basin is the narrowest which is approximately between 0 and 0 3 while the other sites have wider ndvi ranges in addition the r2 computed at the sites located in the western u s i e san pedro basin reynolds creek and tonzi ranch where have generally lower vegetation coverage are generally better than the sites located in the eastern u s i e stillwater little river and ithaca we may conclude that the vegetation has an influence on the θ δ t s relationship additionally the r2 of the θ δ t s relationship does not show a regular descending trend as ndvi increased 4 2 downscaled smap sm results the 1 km downscaled smap sm and the original 9 km smap sm are shown in fig 5 maps represent 8 day composites generated using sm estimates from the ascending and the descending overpasses separately between june 1 and 16 2018 over the conus domain the 1 km sm maps display similar patterns as the 9 km sm maps but with greater detail the 1 km sm maps have missing spatial coverage which is due to the removal of cloud contaminated pixels from the modis products the removal of low quality pixels as well as the gaps between the swaths of the modis and the smap products from the fig 6 a when compared the average number of days between 2015 and 2018 which have both ismn and 9 km smap sm data with the average number of days which have no 1 km smap sm data it is found that the ratio between ismn 9 km availability and 1 km sm unavailability is approximately 2 3 for three networks cosmos scan and uscrn while this ratio is approximately 1 3 for soilscape from the fig 6b if analyzed regarding the source of the missing days of the 1 km downscaled smap sm data the modis lst data approximately account for 65 of missing days while the 9 km smap data approximately account for the remaining 35 fig 7 a b shows maps of the 1 km downscaled and 9 km smap sm the difference between the 1 km 9 km sm from june 18 21 and 23 2018 as well as the accumulated gpm precipitation between june 16 17 please note that it was the only rainfall event that occurred before or during the time period june 18 23 over the san pedro watershed a linearly shaped wet area in the middle of the watershed from north to south that is shown in all three 1 km maps which represents the san pedro river furthermore there are some wet areas outlined in pink boxes near the edge of the watershed boundaries that are only captured in the 1 km maps the difference maps between the 1 km and the 9 km sm also confirm that more spatial variability is present in the downscaled sm product in addition the difference maps show that the 1 km sm estimates are lower than the original 9 km product along the edges of the watershed the corresponding areas that received more precipitation exhibit a slower sm dry down trend if we draw a transect line vertically across the center of the watershed to compare the 1 km downscaled sm with 9 km sm fig 8 it appears that the 1 km sm line shows greater variability than the 9 km line additionally two sm dry downs can be noted in the line plot which are located in the north central of the watershed shown in the pink boxes from 1 km sm map while they are completely missing in the 9 km map 4 3 validation the validation metrics r2 unbiased rmse bias for the 1 km downscaled and the 9 km smap sm validations using the ismn in situ measurements are shown in table 3 the soilscape is a soil moisture network with high density nodes and the sm sensors are clustered in groups within a relatively small area 1 km2 moghaddam et al 2010 the network uses decagon ec 5 capacitance probes to estimate sm at different depths from the series of stations within the tonzi california in northern california ford and quiring 2019 on the other hand the cosmos sm measurements are recorded by cosmic ray probes from the wireless sensor network soilnet and the best overall accuracy is within 0 013 m3 m3 at regions with low soil water content zreda et al 2012 bogena et al 2013 han et al 2014 jakobi et al 2018 the uscrn uses three sets of probes for soil and climate measurements for minimizing the measurement errors and soil effects it has an average error of approximately 0 012 m3 m3 by the triple collocation validation method however the largest error was noted at shallower depths diamond et al 2013 bell et al 2013a b coopersmith et al 2016 lastly the scan uses stevens hydraprobe dielectric reflectometers at different depths and has hourly intervals cosh et al 2004 schaefer et al 2007 previous studies reported that overall high errors were greater than 0 015 m3 m3 at the stations in the eastern conus region and utah agricultural valleys and lowlands dirmeyer et al 2016 ford and quiring 2019 for the r2 of 1 km sm the soilscape network has the highest average value 0 728 compared to the other networks the average r2 values for cosmos scan and uscrn are 0 568 0 399 and 0 470 respectively the average ubrmse for all 4 networks range between 0 02 and 0 022 m3 m3 and they do not show much difference for the average bias the cosmos has the best result 0 003 m3 m3 while the other three networks scan soilscape and uscrn have 0 005 0 004 and 0 009 m3 m3 respectively the relatively higher bias at the uscrn is most likely due to the fact that some stations are located in farmland and forest and the sm measurements are influenced by vegetation cover and undulating terrain which may cause uncertainties in the 1 km 9 km sm estimates comparing the validation metrics of the 1 km sm to the 9 km on average the r2 increases by 0 045 the ubrmse decreases by 0 018 m3 m3 and the bias decreases by 0 001 m3 m3 for the 4 sm networks given these results we can conclude that the downscaling algorithm performs better over areas with lower soil moisture content and less complex vegetation conditions for the p values of the regression analysis output for each ismn station both 1 km 9 km sm validations are much less than 0 05 at the significance level α 0 05 which indicates the significance of the regression fitting for the 95 confidence interval of the regression on average the 1 km smap sm is 0 17 while the 9 km smap sm is 0 139 the values are relatively narrow and can also prove the accuracy of the regression fitting estimates from table 3 we may also note the improvement in ubrmse and bias at 1 km validations over 9 km validations for a few stations but have no improvement of r2 for example the stations include fort peck kendall from cosmos bragg farm cave valley from scan node901 node906 from soilscape and baker 5 w bronte 11 nne from uscrn this is due to the bias variance tradeoff issue occurred in 9 km validation which implies high bias and low variance of the data pairs in the validation plots this fact especially could be observed in the plots of fort peck node 901 bronte 11 nne in fig 9 a c and d the 1 km points are relatively more scattered but the fit lines are closer to the 1 1 diagonal lines moreover from fig 9a d it can be observed that the fit lines of 1 km data pairs are generally closer to the diagonal lines than the fit lines of 9 km data pairs for all scatter plots which indicates the improved accuracy of the 1 km downscaled sm additionally it is observed that the underestimation occurred for 9 km smap sm for most of the stations from cosmos scan and soilscape while the overestimation occurred in uscrn we also can find that the underestimation trend of sm occurred in some stations from the western u s including such as walnut gulch 1 tonzi ranch and reynolds creek fig 9a b while the overestimation trend occurred in stations from eastern u s including bronte 11 nne and smap ok fig 9a d the overestimation underestimation trends of 9 km data pairs are clearly reduced in 1 km data pairs especially in the stations smap ok fig 9a mason 1 fig 9b and node901 fig 9c table 4 shows the average daily spatial standard deviation σ and average sm values of the 3 data sets 1 km 9 km smap sm and ismn sm from the 4 sites between 2015 and 2018 the σ refers to the spatial variability of sm it can be summarized that on average the σ of 1 km sm is 0 026 m3 m3 while 9 km sm is 0 022 m3 m3 for all 4 sites the difference of σ between 1 km and ismn is 0 005 m3 m3 on average it is clearly less than the difference of σ between 9 km and ismn which is 0 01 m3 m3 on average this indicates that the 1 km downscaled sm can better estimate the spatial variability than the 9 km sm for the average sm the 1 km is 0 113 m3 m3 on average and has an average difference of 0 005 m3 m3 with the ismn while the 9 km is 0 119 m3 m3 and has an average difference of 0 012 m3 m3 with the ismn it is also summarized that the 1 km sm average is overall closer to the ismn sm from the time series plots between the averaged 1 km 9 km ismn sm data and gpm precipitation at the 4 sm networks between 2015 and 2018 shown in fig 10 a d we may note that the 1 km 9 km sm estimates had a good agreement with ismn data during the days without rain on the days with precipitation we observe greater sm temporal variability and difference between estimated sm and ismn sm which agreed with our conclusion made in the above paragraph that the precipitation could affect the accuracy of estimated sm for example the difference between ismn and 1 km 9 km smap sm during rainy days can be observed in the following stations arm 1 and fort peck in 2016 smap ok in 2017 fig 10a mason 1 fig 10b sandstone 6 w and stillwater 5 wnw fig 10d in all 4 years the 1 km downscaled sm estimates of some days with precipitation were missing which was due to the cloud cover in modis images on the other hand it is found that the 1 km smap sm generally better agreed to ismn sm than 9 km sm for all sites especially during the rainy days table 5 shows the time series autocorrelation r lag 1 of the 1 km 9 km smap sm and the corresponding ismn sm measurements of descending overpass between 2015 and 2018 from 100 ismn validations stations of 4 sm networks if the stations are grouped by the networks it can be summarized that on average the r for ismn sm is 0 888 comparing with r 0 791 for 1 km sm and r 0 741 for 9 km sm the results prove that both 1 km and 9 km sm have strong autocorrelation of 1 day lag from fig 11 a c the time series autocorrelations for all three stations show descending trends as the lag increases on the other hand the r of ismn data decreases more slowly than either 1 km or 9 km smap sm as the lag increases if observed the shaded area which represents the confident interval the 1 km and 9 km sm both have good autocorrelations when lag 4 for the tonzi ranch station while the other two stations show good autocorrelations when lag 2 5 conclusions and discussion in this paper we modified and implemented a 1 km sm downscaling algorithm which was based on the thermal inertia relationship between surface temperature difference and sm under different vegetation conditions the approach was used to downscale the smap enhanced l2 radiometer only half orbit 9 km daily sm retrievals over the conus during the growing season between april and september from 2015 to 2018 the downscaling algorithm was developed and implemented using remote sensing and lsm derived variables which were readily available every 2 3 days a major revision to the original algorithm involved downscaling the 9 km smap sm by applying the θ δ t s model output sm at the native smap tb domain of 33 km this step could effectively reduce the sharp edge issue that occurred in the downscaled sm product which was most likely caused by the errors from the model building and implementation data from nldas and modis the algorithm performance and accuracy of the downscaled product were assessed using the ismn in situ sm observations the performance of the θ δ t s model varied in different seasons when analyzing the averaged r2 from the linear regression best fit of the θ δ t s at san pedro watershed warm months may to july had higher r2 the sites from ismn representing different moisture or vegetation cover conditions were selected for studying and validating the spatial and temporal sm characteristics at 1 km downscaled and 9 km resolution from the validation statistics it was found that the 1 km downscaled sm showed an improvement compared to the 9 km sm with the overall improvements of 0 045 for r2 0 018 m3 m3 for ubrmse and 0 001 m3 m3 for bias respectively overall the p values in the regression analyses indicated that both the 1 km and 9 km smap sm had statistically significant correlations with ismn sm additionally the difference of spatial standard deviation σ between the 1 km downscaled and ismn sm was 0 005 m3 m3 on average which was less than the difference of σ between the 9 km and ismn sm the validation results r2 ubrmse and bias between ismn and 1 km 9 km sm did not show much difference in different sm networks the algorithm produced reliable downscaling sm on the days with no rain and over regions with less vegetation coverage on the other hand the time series autocorrelation coefficient of the 1 km downscaled sm ranged 0 791 at lag 1 which indicated the strong correlation between adjacent days the validation results on the 1 km downscaled smap sm showed the potential to extend this data to a global scale our review of some other passive microwave sm downscaling algorithms of recent years that are based on the relationships between sm lst and vegetation is in table 6 these algorithms were applied on amsr e smos esa and smap sm products and the statistical results shown that the r2 ranged 0 057 0 72 and rmse rmsd root mean square difference ranged 0 027 0 1 m3 m3 comparing with similar types of studies the validation results of our downscaling product of which average r2 0 541 and average ubrmse 0 02 m3 m3 show fairly good

5328,the soil moisture sm data retrieved from the soil moisture active and passive smap satellite are available at a 9 km grid spacing since april 2015 this product can provide valuable information for research and applications in hydrology and other related fields however the resolution may be too coarse for applications at catchment or field scale in this study an established downscaling methodology which had a major modification regarding its application on the smap 33 km domain was implemented to develop a 1 km soil moisture product based on the smap 9 km data the algorithm proposed here is based on the thermal inertia principle and developed by modeling the relationship between surface temperature difference and sm for different normalized difference vegetation index ndvi classes the model functions were established and tuned using data from the nasa s land information system lis north america land data assimilation system nldas and remotely sensed visible infrared vis ir reflectance data from long term data record ltdr avhrr advanced very high resolution radiometer for the growing season months of april september 1981 2018 these were then implemented using the modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer data over the continental united states conus domain validation activities were carried out using in situ measurements distributed through the international soil moisture network ismn the validation results computed using the 1 km sm data showed that the r2 unbiased rmse root mean square error and bias were improved relative to the 9 km smap product by 0 045 0 018 m3 m3 and 0 001 m3 m3 respectively the 1 km sm also exhibited a strong time series autocorrelation further accuracy assessment analyses indicated that precipitation might contribute to the uncertainties in both the 9 km smap and 1 km downscaled smap sm products keywords smap soil moisture downscaling in situ validation 1 introduction soil moisture sm observations provide important information for studying the exchange of water and energy between the land and the atmosphere and serve as a key input variable in numerical models for weather forecasting ecology and agriculture applications as well as the prediction of hydrological extremes such as floods and droughts as compared to point scale sm from ground based sensors satellite observations in particular microwave based remote sensing provide routine and almost continuous global coverage lakshmi et al 1997 lakshmi 2004 during the past decades a number of active and passive microwave satellites have been launched that are capable of measuring surface moisture at a global scale these include advanced microwave scanning radiometer for the earth observing system amsr e njoku et al 2003 jackson et al 2010 sridhar et al 2013 advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 imaoka et al 2010 oki et al 2010 bindlish et al 2018 advanced scatterometer ascat wagner et al 2013 kim et al 2018 aquarius

2018 kim and lakshmi 2018 the l band microwave radiometer observations are preferred because they provide more reliable surface sm information accuracy and contributing depth schmugge et al 1986 jackson 1993 schmugge and jackson 1994 njoku and entekhabi 1996 lakshmi and susskind 2000 lakshmi 2013 lakshmi 2014 although radio frequency interference rfi effect was a concern at l band the smap mission has addressed rfi through avoidance and filtering approaches spencer et al 2013 piepmeier et al 2013 colliander et al 2017a the spatial resolution of the currently available passive microwave sm products is on the order of tens of kilometers which is determined by the antenna aperture le vine et al 1994 such spatial resolution does not satisfy the demands of many hydrological or agricultural studies that require the characterization of sm variability at finer scales recent research examined the use of downscaling algorithms as a solution to the spatial resolution problem merlin et al 2015 peng et al 2017 sabaghy et al 2018 the available downscaling algorithms can be classified as 1 using data from satellite observations for example some of the proposed methods have downscaled coarse resolution passive microwave sm retrievals which rely on the use of higher resolution radar observations bindlish and barros 2002 bolten et al 2003 narayan et al 2004 narayan et al

information from the other related land surface variables such as vegetation and soil properties fang and lakshmi 2014a kim et al 2017 merlin et al 2010 2013 mishra et al 2018 peng et al 2015 2016 tagesson et al 2018 or 3 statistical based or model based land surface model lsm approaches using derived geophysical variables at high spatial resolution sánchez ruiz et al 2014 zhao et al 2018 in this investigation we implemented a modified sm downscaling algorithm based on thermal inertia principle and used satellite vis ir observations to downscale the enhanced 9 km smap data we validated the 1 km downscaled and 9 km smap sm observations and discussed their performances over the conus domain a detailed description of the original downscaling algorithm applied here can be found in fang et al 2013 the algorithm originally exploited the previously well studied ndvi modulated relationship between sm and surface temperature gillies et al 1997 carlson 2007 mallick et al 2009 minacapilli et al 2009 lakshmi et al 2001 lakshmi et al 2011 in this investigation a major modification was performed to downscale the enhanced 9 km smap sm over the 33 km domain which is the contributing domain of smap radiometer observations it utilizes the high spatial resolution satellite surface temperature and vis ir based vegetation index from modis to produce a wide coverage and routinely available sm retrievals fang and lakshmi 2014b fang et al 2018a fang et al 2018b senanayake et al 2019 dandridge et al 2020 2 brief description of the downscaling methodology the original downscaling algorithm is based on the thermal inertia theory that wetter objects tend to have a greater volumetric heat capacity and lower temperature change and vice versa for dry objects the assumption made is that the rate of change in surface soil moisture is negatively correlated to the rate of change in surface temperature matsushima et al 2012 this is especially true during the summer months when the evapotranspiration rate is the dominant factor therefore in the application of the algorithm it is assumed that the maximum diurnal surface temperature difference can be estimated by the difference of surface temperature between the two overpass times of aqua modis 1 30 p m time of maximum surface temperature and 1 30 a m time of minimum surface temperature fang et al 2013 and this would correspond to the smap sm overpasses i e 6 00 a m or 6 00 p m the relationship between the nldas noah model derived surface skin temperature change δ t s and sm θ between 1981 and 2018 can be modeled using a linear regression fit the ltdr ndvi data were used to classify the corresponding nldas θ δ t s relationship by grouping them at an interval of 0 1 over the 0 1 ndvi range the relationship was then developed separately for each class and applied on 1 km modis lst grids which were included within the corresponding nldas grid s boundaries to calculate the 1 km sm we made an assumption that the spatial variability of the θ δ t s relationship within one nldas grid could be ignored the 1 km sm calculated from the θ δ t s model needs to be adjusted by the difference between smap 9 km sm and the average of all 1 km θ δ t s model output grids located in the 33 km contributing domain which is the native spatial area to the 9 km smap radiometer tb grid chan et al 2018 this modification can effectively reduce the sharp edge effect which is most likely caused by the errors of nldas and modis data this is the major improvement of the original downscaling algorithm developed by fang et al 2013 the conceptual diagram of the model building implementation and downscaling is given in fig 1 3 study area and data description 3 1 study area the sm downscaling algorithm was used to derive a downscaled 1 km soil moisture product using the available smap 9 km daily sm product between 2015 and 2018 over the conus domain a major reason for limiting the spatial domain to conus was determined by the need of long term estimates of surface skin temperature change δts and sm θ one way to address this need at a global scale is to use readily available model based products the regression model was applied by utilizing the nldas model output data which provides spatial coverage limited to the conus area at 12 5 km model grid spacing 3 2 data 3 2 1 nldas data nldas provides forcing data and lsm data at hourly time step and 12 5 km model grid spacing it spans from january 1979 to the present nldas data integrates lsm datasets and ground observations in this study we used the nldas noaa national oceanic and atmospheric administration noah lsm level 4 variables surface skin temperature unit k and sm unit m3 m3 at 0 10 cm http ldas gsfc nasa gov nldas to build the θ δ t s model the nldas noah model was developed from the ncep national centers for environmental prediction mesoscale eta model there have been numerous publications on validation of the nldas data such as ek et al 2003 schaake et al 2004 mitchell et al 2004 and xia et al 2013 fang et al 2016 3 2 2 ltdr ndvi data the ltdr is a project launched by nasa for publishing global surface climate data record and currently the ltdr version 5 ndvi is derived from noaa satellites n07 n19 avh13c1 avhrr 1981 present and terra aqua modis 2000 present pedelty et al 2007 the daily ndvi product is originally projected at 0 05 spatial resolution climate modeling grid cmg and is available at https ltdr nascom nasa gov the previous study showed a strong overall correlation of 0 87 between avhrr and modis ndvi data which suggested that the modis ndvi data could be used to supplement the existing avhrr historical data bédard et al 2006 in this study we only used the ltdr avhrr data and upscaled it to 12 5 km resolution to match with nldas grids for the θ δ t s model building 3 2 3 modis products modis is onboard two nasa satellites terra and aqua modis provides daily observations of land surface variables including radiation temperature and vegetation at a global scale it has a total of 36 visible infrared bands which range between 250 m and 1 km spatial resolution tucker 1979 wan and li 1997 in this study the 1 km daily aqua modis lst myd11a1 and the biweekly ndvi products myd13a2 were acquired from land processes distributed active archive center lp daac at https lpdaac usgs gov 3 2 4 smap data the smap mission was launched in january 2015 and it has an l band mission radiometer centered at 1 41 ghz that operates in a near polar sun synchronous orbit it has a revisit time of 2 3 days and observes the earth at 6 a m 6 p m the sm estimates represent the top 0 5 cm of soil layer with a threshold of vegetation water content 5 kg m2 chan et al 2016 in this study the enhanced level 2 half orbit 9 km sm product spl2smp e was acquired from nsidc national snow and ice data center at https nsidc org data spl2smp e for downscaling the smap sm retrievals are solely derived from the l band radiometer tb data using the single channel algorithm jackson 1993 at the native spatial resolution of 33 to 40 km the retrievals are enhanced to 9 km ease equal area scalable earth grid using the approach developed by chan et al 2018 which is based on interpolating antenna temperature data in the original smap level 1b tb data by using backus gilbert optimal interpolation technique 3 2 5 gpm global precipitation measurement data the gpm satellite mission is designed to provide new standard rainfall and snowfall observations at a global scale every 3 h this satellite has dual frequency dpr precipitation radar and gmi gpm microwave imager mounted and extends the measurement range of the trmm tropical rainfall measuring mission hou et al 2014 huffman et al 2015 the imerg integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm precipitation data were downloaded from https pmm nasa gov data access downloads gpm and were used as reference data to study the sm spatial and temporal variability of the downscaled sm as well as the influence of precipitation on the performance of the downscaling algorithm 3 2 6 ismn data the ismn hosts in situ sm measurements collected starting 1952 to present from a total of 35 international sm networks which include more than 1400 stations the purpose of ismn is to validate calibrate and improve the accuracy of remote sensing sm retrieval algorithms and lsm sm outputs as well as to provide other variable measurements including soil temperature and precipitation for the better interpretation of soil moisture dorigo et al 2011 2013 gruber et al 2013 the ismn data from the various sm networks were downloaded from https ismn geo tuwien ac at discussions and evaluations of the accuracy and uncertainties between different ismn soil networks can be found in the research by han et al 2014 rosolem et al 2013 zreda et al 2012 coopersmith et al 2016 bell et al 2013a b and diamond et al 2013 the downscaled smap 1 km sm estimates were evaluated using in situ sm measurements from 100 ismn stations in conus as the fig 2 shows the validation data include the stations from 4 sm networks for validating smap sm retrieval algorithms the ismn sm networks include cosmos cosmic ray soil moisture observation system soilscape soil moisture sensing controller and optimal estimator uscrn u s climate reference network and scan soil climate analysis network table 1 shows the brief descriptions of the 4 sm networks these stations cover different types of climate zones soil properties land cover types and vegetation types which allow us to thoroughly examine the performance of the downscaling algorithm over the conus domain in addition the san pedro watershed was used for mapping 1 km 9 km smap sm and showing the spatial and temporal sm variabilities 4 results and analyses 4 1 θ δt model evaluation the eqs 1 5 of the statistical variables r2 unbiased rmse bias spatial standard deviation and average are shown below they were used for evaluating and validating the 1 km 9 km smap sm estimates as well as the model performance willmott 1982 1 r 2 1 θ i θ i 2 θ i θ 2 2 b i 1 n θ i θ i n 3 ubrmse i 1 n θ i θ i b 2 n 4 σ i 1 n θ θ i 2 n 5 m i 1 n θ i n where r 2 and b are the coefficient of determination and bias between in situ sm θ and estimated sm θ 1 km downscaled and 9 km smap respectively u b r m s e is the unbiased rmse which removes the bias b from θ σ is the spatial standard deviation of estimated or in situ sm m is the averaged sm in addition in order to analyze the non randomness and the correlation of the data in the time series the autocorrelation function was applied on all three sm data sets and the autocorrelation r at the lag k is calculated as 6 r k i 1 n k θ i θ θ i k θ i 1 n θ i θ 2 where θ i is the sm estimate on the day i in this equation the time variable is not used for calculating the correlation coefficient but the two sm estimates on the days i and i k were used instead usually the first correlation when lag 1 is of interest in practical use the first step of the downscaling algorithm was to establish a reliable relationship between θ and δ t s using outputs from the nldas noah model between 1981 and 2018 separately for each ndvi class on a monthly basis fig 3 shows the overall r2 averaged from all ndvi classes for each nldas grid over the san pedro watershed for the months of april through september where each grid value represents the average value from the θ δ t s linear regression fit of all ndvi classes the maps demonstrate a change in the θ δ t s agreement for the april to september period higher r2 are achieved during the months of june and july it can be concluded that generally the warm months exhibit a stronger thermal inertia relationship between θ and δ t s june and july had relatively better overall r2 and most of the grid values in these two months are greater than 0 4 in addition to these we observe that some grids have relatively lower overall r2 these areas correspond to complex terrain and higher vegetation coverage which can lead to higher errors of nldas outputs hong et al 2009 fig 4 and table 2 summarize the θ δ t s linear regression fit statistics using the data between 1981 and 2018 at 6 locations for the month of july these results demonstrate generally better r2 at the san pedro basin r2 ranges 0 516 0 782 and tonzi ranch r2 ranges 0 417 0 213 compared to the other sites it also can be noted that the ndvi range at the san pedro basin is the narrowest which is approximately between 0 and 0 3 while the other sites have wider ndvi ranges in addition the r2 computed at the sites located in the western u s i e san pedro basin reynolds creek and tonzi ranch where have generally lower vegetation coverage are generally better than the sites located in the eastern u s i e stillwater little river and ithaca we may conclude that the vegetation has an influence on the θ δ t s relationship additionally the r2 of the θ δ t s relationship does not show a regular descending trend as ndvi increased 4 2 downscaled smap sm results the 1 km downscaled smap sm and the original 9 km smap sm are shown in fig 5 maps represent 8 day composites generated using sm estimates from the ascending and the descending overpasses separately between june 1 and 16 2018 over the conus domain the 1 km sm maps display similar patterns as the 9 km sm maps but with greater detail the 1 km sm maps have missing spatial coverage which is due to the removal of cloud contaminated pixels from the modis products the removal of low quality pixels as well as the gaps between the swaths of the modis and the smap products from the fig 6 a when compared the average number of days between 2015 and 2018 which have both ismn and 9 km smap sm data with the average number of days which have no 1 km smap sm data it is found that the ratio between ismn 9 km availability and 1 km sm unavailability is approximately 2 3 for three networks cosmos scan and uscrn while this ratio is approximately 1 3 for soilscape from the fig 6b if analyzed regarding the source of the missing days of the 1 km downscaled smap sm data the modis lst data approximately account for 65 of missing days while the 9 km smap data approximately account for the remaining 35 fig 7 a b shows maps of the 1 km downscaled and 9 km smap sm the difference between the 1 km 9 km sm from june 18 21 and 23 2018 as well as the accumulated gpm precipitation between june 16 17 please note that it was the only rainfall event that occurred before or during the time period june 18 23 over the san pedro watershed a linearly shaped wet area in the middle of the watershed from north to south that is shown in all three 1 km maps which represents the san pedro river furthermore there are some wet areas outlined in pink boxes near the edge of the watershed boundaries that are only captured in the 1 km maps the difference maps between the 1 km and the 9 km sm also confirm that more spatial variability is present in the downscaled sm product in addition the difference maps show that the 1 km sm estimates are lower than the original 9 km product along the edges of the watershed the corresponding areas that received more precipitation exhibit a slower sm dry down trend if we draw a transect line vertically across the center of the watershed to compare the 1 km downscaled sm with 9 km sm fig 8 it appears that the 1 km sm line shows greater variability than the 9 km line additionally two sm dry downs can be noted in the line plot which are located in the north central of the watershed shown in the pink boxes from 1 km sm map while they are completely missing in the 9 km map 4 3 validation the validation metrics r2 unbiased rmse bias for the 1 km downscaled and the 9 km smap sm validations using the ismn in situ measurements are shown in table 3 the soilscape is a soil moisture network with high density nodes and the sm sensors are clustered in groups within a relatively small area 1 km2 moghaddam et al 2010 the network uses decagon ec 5 capacitance probes to estimate sm at different depths from the series of stations within the tonzi california in northern california ford and quiring 2019 on the other hand the cosmos sm measurements are recorded by cosmic ray probes from the wireless sensor network soilnet and the best overall accuracy is within 0 013 m3 m3 at regions with low soil water content zreda et al 2012 bogena et al 2013 han et al 2014 jakobi et al 2018 the uscrn uses three sets of probes for soil and climate measurements for minimizing the measurement errors and soil effects it has an average error of approximately 0 012 m3 m3 by the triple collocation validation method however the largest error was noted at shallower depths diamond et al 2013 bell et al 2013a b coopersmith et al 2016 lastly the scan uses stevens hydraprobe dielectric reflectometers at different depths and has hourly intervals cosh et al 2004 schaefer et al 2007 previous studies reported that overall high errors were greater than 0 015 m3 m3 at the stations in the eastern conus region and utah agricultural valleys and lowlands dirmeyer et al 2016 ford and quiring 2019 for the r2 of 1 km sm the soilscape network has the highest average value 0 728 compared to the other networks the average r2 values for cosmos scan and uscrn are 0 568 0 399 and 0 470 respectively the average ubrmse for all 4 networks range between 0 02 and 0 022 m3 m3 and they do not show much difference for the average bias the cosmos has the best result 0 003 m3 m3 while the other three networks scan soilscape and uscrn have 0 005 0 004 and 0 009 m3 m3 respectively the relatively higher bias at the uscrn is most likely due to the fact that some stations are located in farmland and forest and the sm measurements are influenced by vegetation cover and undulating terrain which may cause uncertainties in the 1 km 9 km sm estimates comparing the validation metrics of the 1 km sm to the 9 km on average the r2 increases by 0 045 the ubrmse decreases by 0 018 m3 m3 and the bias decreases by 0 001 m3 m3 for the 4 sm networks given these results we can conclude that the downscaling algorithm performs better over areas with lower soil moisture content and less complex vegetation conditions for the p values of the regression analysis output for each ismn station both 1 km 9 km sm validations are much less than 0 05 at the significance level α 0 05 which indicates the significance of the regression fitting for the 95 confidence interval of the regression on average the 1 km smap sm is 0 17 while the 9 km smap sm is 0 139 the values are relatively narrow and can also prove the accuracy of the regression fitting estimates from table 3 we may also note the improvement in ubrmse and bias at 1 km validations over 9 km validations for a few stations but have no improvement of r2 for example the stations include fort peck kendall from cosmos bragg farm cave valley from scan node901 node906 from soilscape and baker 5 w bronte 11 nne from uscrn this is due to the bias variance tradeoff issue occurred in 9 km validation which implies high bias and low variance of the data pairs in the validation plots this fact especially could be observed in the plots of fort peck node 901 bronte 11 nne in fig 9 a c and d the 1 km points are relatively more scattered but the fit lines are closer to the 1 1 diagonal lines moreover from fig 9a d it can be observed that the fit lines of 1 km data pairs are generally closer to the diagonal lines than the fit lines of 9 km data pairs for all scatter plots which indicates the improved accuracy of the 1 km downscaled sm additionally it is observed that the underestimation occurred for 9 km smap sm for most of the stations from cosmos scan and soilscape while the overestimation occurred in uscrn we also can find that the underestimation trend of sm occurred in some stations from the western u s including such as walnut gulch 1 tonzi ranch and reynolds creek fig 9a b while the overestimation trend occurred in stations from eastern u s including bronte 11 nne and smap ok fig 9a d the overestimation underestimation trends of 9 km data pairs are clearly reduced in 1 km data pairs especially in the stations smap ok fig 9a mason 1 fig 9b and node901 fig 9c table 4 shows the average daily spatial standard deviation σ and average sm values of the 3 data sets 1 km 9 km smap sm and ismn sm from the 4 sites between 2015 and 2018 the σ refers to the spatial variability of sm it can be summarized that on average the σ of 1 km sm is 0 026 m3 m3 while 9 km sm is 0 022 m3 m3 for all 4 sites the difference of σ between 1 km and ismn is 0 005 m3 m3 on average it is clearly less than the difference of σ between 9 km and ismn which is 0 01 m3 m3 on average this indicates that the 1 km downscaled sm can better estimate the spatial variability than the 9 km sm for the average sm the 1 km is 0 113 m3 m3 on average and has an average difference of 0 005 m3 m3 with the ismn while the 9 km is 0 119 m3 m3 and has an average difference of 0 012 m3 m3 with the ismn it is also summarized that the 1 km sm average is overall closer to the ismn sm from the time series plots between the averaged 1 km 9 km ismn sm data and gpm precipitation at the 4 sm networks between 2015 and 2018 shown in fig 10 a d we may note that the 1 km 9 km sm estimates had a good agreement with ismn data during the days without rain on the days with precipitation we observe greater sm temporal variability and difference between estimated sm and ismn sm which agreed with our conclusion made in the above paragraph that the precipitation could affect the accuracy of estimated sm for example the difference between ismn and 1 km 9 km smap sm during rainy days can be observed in the following stations arm 1 and fort peck in 2016 smap ok in 2017 fig 10a mason 1 fig 10b sandstone 6 w and stillwater 5 wnw fig 10d in all 4 years the 1 km downscaled sm estimates of some days with precipitation were missing which was due to the cloud cover in modis images on the other hand it is found that the 1 km smap sm generally better agreed to ismn sm than 9 km sm for all sites especially during the rainy days table 5 shows the time series autocorrelation r lag 1 of the 1 km 9 km smap sm and the corresponding ismn sm measurements of descending overpass between 2015 and 2018 from 100 ismn validations stations of 4 sm networks if the stations are grouped by the networks it can be summarized that on average the r for ismn sm is 0 888 comparing with r 0 791 for 1 km sm and r 0 741 for 9 km sm the results prove that both 1 km and 9 km sm have strong autocorrelation of 1 day lag from fig 11 a c the time series autocorrelations for all three stations show descending trends as the lag increases on the other hand the r of ismn data decreases more slowly than either 1 km or 9 km smap sm as the lag increases if observed the shaded area which represents the confident interval the 1 km and 9 km sm both have good autocorrelations when lag 4 for the tonzi ranch station while the other two stations show good autocorrelations when lag 2 5 conclusions and discussion in this paper we modified and implemented a 1 km sm downscaling algorithm which was based on the thermal inertia relationship between surface temperature difference and sm under different vegetation conditions the approach was used to downscale the smap enhanced l2 radiometer only half orbit 9 km daily sm retrievals over the conus during the growing season between april and september from 2015 to 2018 the downscaling algorithm was developed and implemented using remote sensing and lsm derived variables which were readily available every 2 3 days a major revision to the original algorithm involved downscaling the 9 km smap sm by applying the θ δ t s model output sm at the native smap tb domain of 33 km this step could effectively reduce the sharp edge issue that occurred in the downscaled sm product which was most likely caused by the errors from the model building and implementation data from nldas and modis the algorithm performance and accuracy of the downscaled product were assessed using the ismn in situ sm observations the performance of the θ δ t s model varied in different seasons when analyzing the averaged r2 from the linear regression best fit of the θ δ t s at san pedro watershed warm months may to july had higher r2 the sites from ismn representing different moisture or vegetation cover conditions were selected for studying and validating the spatial and temporal sm characteristics at 1 km downscaled and 9 km resolution from the validation statistics it was found that the 1 km downscaled sm showed an improvement compared to the 9 km sm with the overall improvements of 0 045 for r2 0 018 m3 m3 for ubrmse and 0 001 m3 m3 for bias respectively overall the p values in the regression analyses indicated that both the 1 km and 9 km smap sm had statistically significant correlations with ismn sm additionally the difference of spatial standard deviation σ between the 1 km downscaled and ismn sm was 0 005 m3 m3 on average which was less than the difference of σ between the 9 km and ismn sm the validation results r2 ubrmse and bias between ismn and 1 km 9 km sm did not show much difference in different sm networks the algorithm produced reliable downscaling sm on the days with no rain and over regions with less vegetation coverage on the other hand the time series autocorrelation coefficient of the 1 km downscaled sm ranged 0 791 at lag 1 which indicated the strong correlation between adjacent days the validation results on the 1 km downscaled smap sm showed the potential to extend this data to a global scale our review of some other passive microwave sm downscaling algorithms of recent years that are based on the relationships between sm lst and vegetation is in table 6 these algorithms were applied on amsr e smos esa and smap sm products and the statistical results shown that the r2 ranged 0 057 0 72 and rmse rmsd root mean square difference ranged 0 027 0 1 m3 m3 comparing with similar types of studies the validation results of our downscaling product of which average r2 0 541 and average ubrmse 0 02 m3 m3 show fairly good

5329,flooding from intense rainfall is a major hazard in many urban areas one of the major challenges in urban flood simulations is lack of data about the location and properties of stormwater infrastructure and land cover in this paper we investigate the sensitivity of urban flood simulations to inputs of stormwater infrastructure and soil characteristics we use a 2d hydrodynamic model mike urban to simulate flood events on the university of alabama ua campus in tuscaloosa u s a infiltration rate soil moisture and soil texture were measured in the field soil texture was found to be homogeneous across campus sandy loam but with a high degree of spatial and temporal variation in infiltration rate and soil moisture comparison between different storm event return periods 10 25 50 and 100 years shows that the same flooding hotspots are persistent but with considerable variation in water depth and flood extent to investigate the sensitivity of the simulations to stormwater infrastructure simulations without the stormwater infrastructure input were conducted the results show that stormwater infrastructure decreases flooding volume of rp 10 25 50 and 100 by factors of 20 14 12 and 8 respectively this shows that urban flood simulation is highly sensitive to the inclusion of stormwater infrastructure though with decreasing relative impact for larger events to investigate the sensitivity of the simulations to soil characteristics four land cover simulations actual uniform entirely pervious entirely impervious were compared the results show flood simulation predictions are sensitive to both the value and spatial explicitness of the soil input data we discuss challenges in urban flood simulation and their potential solutions in the context of emerging frameworks for national and global hyper resolution flood forecasting and analysis keywords urban flooding hydraulic modeling stormwater infrastructure soil infiltration 1 introduction the effects of

and fenner 2016 curriero et al 2001 tunstall et al 2006 booth 2012 in recent years urban flooding due to extreme weather rapid urbanization and climate change has been increasing both in severity and frequency worldwide increasing risks to human lives health properties infrastructure and the environment mahmood et al 2017 huong and pathirana 2013 mahmoud and gan 2018 di baldassarre et al 2010 agbola et al 2012 actionaid 2006 ntelekos et al 2010 galloway et al 2018 teng et al 2017 generally urban flooding is caused by extreme runoff in a developed area where drainage is insufficient weber 2019 fernández and lutz 2010 this runoff travels over the surface pooling in low lying areas within the catchment until it drains infiltrates or evaporates however infiltration rates in the urban environment tend to be much lower than that of a natural environment due to prevalence of impervious land cover mahmoud and gan 2018 villarini et al 2011 huong and pathirana 2013 though urban stormwater infrastructure can drain surface water efficiently it has a finite water transport capacity which can lead to waterlogging soon after a rainfall event commences fletcher et al 2015 schmitt et al 2004 hoang and fenner 2016 several studies in recent years have focused on the role and significance of urban drainage systems and urban runoff motivated by the high costs and potential damage involved with prolonged flooding arnone et al 2018 grum et al 2006 arnbjerg nielsen 2012 berggren et al 2014 according to the european standard en 752 cen 1996 1997 urban drainage systems should be designed to endure periods of flooding of 10 50 years depending on the type of urban area and traffic infrastructure associated with it however aging drainage infrastructures and lack of upgrades to keep pace with development and climate changes can result in failure when extreme rainfall occurs while improvement to stormwater infrastructure is costly stormwater control measures scms can be a cheaper solution to reduce the runoff from those locations li et al 2017 bell et al 2016 liu et al 2014 national research council 2009 there are different types of scms that are commonly used in urban environments to reduce runoff such as retention basin bio swales infiltration trench porous pavement rain barrels detention pond green roof rain garden epa 2019 while these initiatives are quite promising for small rainfall events the storm drainage network remains the dominant and most widely used technique in most urban environment this paper investigates urban flooding using the university of alabama ua campus in tuscaloosa alabama u s a as a case study ua experiences frequent flooding in several hotspots fig 1 like most urban environments the ua campus has mixed land uses i e a combination of green areas and human made infrastructure runoff generated from the study area can vary spatially and temporally depending on the local drainage capacity vegetation type and density and topographic features realistic calculation of runoff dynamics is dependent on accurate classification of the land cover slope topographic wetness index and soil type as well as other key soil properties nouh 2006 şen 2004 mahmoud and gan 2018 runoff generation and accumulation depend on the effectiveness with which the surface is connected to the stormwater drainage system for instance in an urban environment the impervious surfaces buildings roofs roads and parking lots are often connected to an underground stormwater drainage system for roads parking lots and similar types of surfaces stormwater is collected through street curbs and gutters and eventually drains to the stormwater infrastructure network dhi 2015 however there are some impervious surfaces that are less likely to be connected to the stormwater infrastructure such as sports fields playgrounds and paved paths and when an extreme event occurs they can get flooded within a short time span fig 1 gis data on stormwater infrastructure is not readily available or attainable for most local urban environments even in developed countries galloway et al 2018 liptan 2017 land cover and soil characteristics can be inferred estimated from soil or land use land cover maps or derived from remote sensing analysis but these are often too coarse for urban applications given these limitations and the great efforts and costs involved in obtaining these data such as through detailed surveys and digitization of infrastructure and land cover maps and detailed field measurement and analysis of soil properties elucidating the sensitivity of urban flood simulations to these factors is of great importance while it is clear that stormwater infrastructure and soil properties are very important for accurate representation of urban water dynamics their control on flooding dynamics during extreme events is not well understood this is because soils may become saturated and stormwater infrastructure capacity may be reached shortly after the start of an event this will limit or eliminate their effective influence on surface water dynamics this paper aims to quantify the impact of stormwater infrastructure and soil properties on flood predictions by analyzing the sensitivity of urban flood simulations using the mike urban model to stormwater infrastructure and soil infiltration inputs under different storm severities return periods of 10 25 50 and 100 years we hypothesize that while the relative impact of these factors will decrease with increasing storm magnitude they will remain highly impactful even for the most extreme storm severity 2 methodology 2 1 mike urban model the combined hydrologic and hydraulic model mike urban dhi 2020 was used in this study to simulate surface

simulation scenarios and settings a flooding event on 6th july 2018 was simulated and used to qualitatively evaluate the model results this event was used as we were able to survey flooding locations during the event across the ua campus e g fig 1c e though the survey did not include all flooded locations it offers confirmation of several flooding locations this will allow us to evaluate whether or not these flooding locations were predicted by the model design storms at return periods rp of 10 25 50 and 100 years were used to simulate flooding at different levels of severity the stormwater infrastructure and measured soil characteristics are used in realistic simulations the impact of the stormwater infrastructure on flood severity at varying rps was quantified by comparing the realistic simulations to simulations without the stormwater infrastructure input infiltration input in the realistic simulations was generated by dividing the study area into small sub catchments where spatially varied infiltration rates collected from the field were averaged the infiltration data for tutwiler quad shelby hall and bryce lawn ranged from 20 to 40 mm hr 60 120 mm hr 40 80 mm hr and 35 60 mm hr respectively the impact of soil characteristics on flood predictions was quantified by comparing the realistic simulations to simulations with three soil infiltration input configurations 1 fully impervious the entire study site was set to 0 mm hr infiltration 2 fully pervious the entire study site was set to high infiltration maximum value of 120 mm hr 3 uniform the entire study site was set to a spatially uniform infiltration rate equal to the average infiltration rate of the realistic simulation 53 6 mm hr 3 results 3 1 soil characteristics and distribution the results of the particle size analysis show that soil texture on campus can be classified as sandy loam soil texture was found to be relatively homogeneous across campus table 1 with a range of 24 76 52 in the sand fraction and 24 38 14 for clay the infiltration rate for this soil type is high due to the relatively large proportion of sand particles resulting in high porosity and permeability according to horton s initial infiltration capacity values for dry sand and loam with thick vegetation the infiltration rate is expected to be 254 mm hr and 152 mm hr respectively dhi 2015 these values correspond with the infiltration data collected from the field analysis of organic matter om was conducted and it was also found to be homogeneous table 1 these values were within the typical range 1 5 for upland soils ljworld 2019 gravimetric soil moisture analyses were conducted in four locations on campus and repeated on days with different soil moisture conditions soil moisture readings from the sm150 sensor were compared to gravimetric soil moisture measurements table 2 the soil moisture from the sensor was found to be within the range of 3 of the results from the gravimetric lab analysis the soil moisture from the second day of measurements was higher due to rainfall earlier that week the agreement between these two methods is high so the sm150 sensor was further used for measuring soil moisture at the study sites among the four locations the soil moisture at bryce lawn was found to be the highest and the quad was found to be the lowest in both tests table 2 this is interesting as both the quad and bryce lawn are open green spaces differences in gravimetric soil moisture between the two dates also were the highest 15 9 6 and 42 11 31 respectively in these two locations the proportion of fines silt clay was higher at bryce lawn than the quad table 1 and therefore the capacity to retain water was higher for bryce lawn however likely a more important reason for the difference between the two locations is the fact that soil on the quad is more compacted because of intensive daily activities and foot traffic including walking recreational activities and football game day activities wet soil increases the chance of soil compaction because soil moisture works as a lubricant between soil particles under pressure from traffic movement and daily activities al kaisi and licht 2005 yang and zhang 2011 an inverse relationship was found between soil moisture and infiltration an increase in soil moisture results in a decrease in the infiltration rate and vice versa fig 3 this relationship was strongest at shelby and the quad r2 0 53 and 0 96 respectively these results show the non stationarity and spatially variable co dependence of soil moisture and infiltration rates even for soils with similar texture and organic matter 3 2 model evaluation a quantitative verification of model performance was not possible because of the lack of observed data on flood inundation measuring the areal extent of flooded area during an actual event is difficult and dangerous however we did observe a flood event on campus on 6th july 2018 with a 4 hour rainfall event between 4 00 pm to 8 00 pm which yielded a total of 101 mm equals a rp of about 7 years we simulated this event to qualitatively compare the extent and spatial pattern of flooding with our observations of the actual event we found that the simulated flooded area was 301 000 m2 the total area of the ua campus is 3 899 223 m2 the ratio between flooded and non flooded area was therefore 7 7 the major inundated areas were near tutwiler hall with a flood depth of 0 78 m behind the biology building and at the parking deck also known as the bus hub where the flood depth was also 0 78 m fig 4 these locations are adjacent to student fraternity housing toward the northeast side of the campus the maximum inundation depth found near the parking lot just behind cyber hall and adjacent to peter bryce boulevard was 0 35 m other than these locations the flood water depth in different parts of campus was around 0 15 m the model simulated locations and depths of flooding that corresponded very well with our observations of the actual event this provides qualitative support for the model s ability to simulate flooding patterns on the ua campus 3 3 flooding under different precipitation return periods rp flooding caused by rainstorms at different return periods rp 10 25 50 and 100 years was simulated fig 5 table 3 shows that as expected greater return periods yield greater floodwater volumes and depths flooding hotspots on campus were the same for all simulations with increasing extent and water depth except for rp 10 for rp 10 two locations the intersection near bryant denny stadium and tutwiler and the bus hub were detected to be flooded with very negligible and dispersed waterlogging in some locations fig 5 for rp 25 and 50 flood maps show similar patterns the rp 100 flood map showed the highest flood volume and flooding at 10 different locations on campus with various depths and extents the flood volume found for rp 100 was 4 8 2 5 and 1 9 times higher than for rp 10 25 and 50 respectively table 3 3 4 the impact of stormwater infrastructure a comparison between the simulations with and without stormwater infrastructure shows considerable differences in floodwater depth and extent throughout the study area e g fig 6 the objective was to identify how important it is to include stormwater infrastructure to understand urban flood simulation performances under different storm severity scenarios due to the absence of detailed drainage data of stormwater infrastructure as is often the case in urban flood applications instead of determining the exact carrying capacity we quantified how it affects the flooding area and depth by comparing the differences between simulations with and without stormwater infrastructure floodwater volume without the stormwater infrastructure is higher by a factor of 20 for rp 10 and by factors of 14 12 and 8 times for rp 25 50 and 100 respectively table 4 the difference in volume between the two scenarios for rp 10 was found to be 348 864 m3 which means that the simulated stormwater infrastructure was draining that volume of water in the 4 hour duration of the simulated storm event 87 000 m3 h this translates to an average drainage capacity of 24 m3 s these results demonstrate the importance of incorporating stormwater infrastructure into urban flood simulations the reduction in the relative differences between the two simulation scenarios with and without the stormwater infrastructure with increasing storm rp can be explained by the finite drainage capacity of the stormwater infrastructure the proportion of water drained by the stormwater infrastructure decreases for larger storms however these results show that even for rp 100 incorporating stormwater infrastructure into the simulation is crucial for predicting water volume and depth 3 5 the impact of soil infiltration inputs three infiltration input configurations were compared to the realistic scenario spatially variable infiltration based on our field measurements and land cover classification the mean and maximum water depths found from the fully impervious flood simulations for rp 25 were 0 21 m and 2 05 m respectively fig 7 table 5 this is compared to the realistic simulation with mean and maximum water depth of 0 19 and 1 58 m a difference of 0 02 and 0 46 m respectively the simulated floodwater volume for the fully impervious simulation was 44 288 m3 compared to 35 776 m3 in the original simulation a difference of 8512 m3 a difference factor of 1 2 for rp 100 the floodwater volume for the fully impervious simulation was 97 280 m3 compared to 88 960 m3 in the original simulation a difference of 8320 m3 a difference factor of 1 1 the fully pervious simulation for rp 25 yielded mean and maximum flood depths of 0 13 m and 0 83 m respectively table 5 a difference of 0 06 m and 0 75 m respectively from the realistic simulation the simulated floodwater volume for the pervious simulation for rp 25 was 6208 m3 a difference of 29 568 m3 from the realistic simulation a difference factor of 0 17 for the rp 100 simulation the floodwater volume for the fully pervious simulation was 30 280 m3 a difference of 58 680 m3 a difference factor of 0 34 the results of the uniform average infiltration scenario show a major reduction in floodwater volume relative to the realistic simulation when simulating spatially uniform infiltration a difference factor of 0 18 and 0 35 for rp 25 and 100 respectively table 5 this is surprising considering that the average infiltration across the study site is the same for the realistic and uniform simulations this can be attributed to the fact that flooding is most prevalent in areas dominated by impervious land cover so using an average infiltration rate resulted in considerable underprediction in these hotspots this effect is reduced in high magnitude events rp 100 due to a reduction in the relative contribution of infiltration to simulated surface water balance these results however demonstrate that infiltration still has an impact even for rp 100 yielding about one third of the simulated floodwater volume total volume of 31 232 m3 and 88 960 m3 for the uniform and realistic simulations respectively 4 discussion the analysis of soil characteristics revealed highly homogeneous texture sandy loam and organic matter in the study site but with a high degree of spatial and temporal variation in soil moisture and infiltration rate the soil moisture from the field observations was found to be lower with corresponding higher infiltration rates before november but the soil moisture increased after november due to the increase in antecedent rain during november december which resulted in lower infiltration rates in the study area these complex spatiotemporal dynamics in soil even in areas with similar land cover type showcase the need for detailed soil data and for models that explicitly simulate soil moisture and infiltration dynamics the value and spatial explicitness of the model s soil infiltration input were found to have a strong impact on its flood predictions section 3 5 this further demonstrates the importance of obtaining detailed soil data for urban flood modeling stormwater infrastructure model input was also found to have a major influence on flood simulations while the relative difference between simulations which include and exclude stormwater infrastructure is reduced as storm magnitude increases it remains of crucial importance even in high magnitude events a factor of 8 difference in floodwater volume predictions for rp100 the results highlight major challenges in urban flood predictions and analyses obtaining detailed data on soil characteristics mainly infiltration rate obtaining detailed gis data on stormwater infrastructure and developing modeling frameworks that are able to simulate and couple both surface hydrology and subsurface drainage through the stormwater infrastructure the latter is identified as a challenge given the costs and complexity of existing modeling frameworks emerging and future developments of national and global scale hyper resolution flood forecasting and analysis frameworks both in the us and internationally mandate the development of solutions for obtaining high resolution soil and stormwater infrastructure data these can include the development of data repositories and government mandates or incentives for local municipalities to update and share the data somewhat akin to fema s national flood insurance program citizen science programs and remote and proximity sensing analysis e g street view development of open source alternatives to the commercial models will likely greatly improve accessibility to scientists and practitioners efforts should also focus on improving the computational efficiency and ease of use of the models through advances such as parallelization and cloud computing architecture and services 5 conclusion urban environments have highly heterogeneous infiltration rates and complex drainage systems because of the general unavailability of detailed spatial data on infiltration and stormwater infrastructure incorporating these characteristics into models of urban flooding is challenging in this paper we quantified the impact of stormwater infrastructure and soil infiltration on simulated flooding in an urban environment at a range of storm severities we compared simulations in which stormwater infrastructure input was included and excluded and soil infiltration inputs were configured differently realistic uniform completely impervious and completely pervious the results show that urban flood simulation is highly sensitive to inputs of both infiltration rates and stormwater infrastructure impact of stormwater infrastructure and infiltration values decrease for larger storms due to more rapid saturation of the stormwater infrastructure and soil however even for 100 year return period rainfall the impact was very high a factor of 8 greater simulated stormwater volume when excluding the stormwater infrastructure and about one third of the simulated floodwater volume when using a spatially uniform infiltration input in light of these results we assert that there is a need to develop frameworks or mechanisms for making these urban datasets available and incorporating them into openly accessible and easy to implement hydraulic stormwater models such advances could greatly contribute to understanding of flood mechanisms in the

5329,flooding from intense rainfall is a major hazard in many urban areas one of the major challenges in urban flood simulations is lack of data about the location and properties of stormwater infrastructure and land cover in this paper we investigate the sensitivity of urban flood simulations to inputs of stormwater infrastructure and soil characteristics we use a 2d hydrodynamic model mike urban to simulate flood events on the university of alabama ua campus in tuscaloosa u s a infiltration rate soil moisture and soil texture were measured in the field soil texture was found to be homogeneous across campus sandy loam but with a high degree of spatial and temporal variation in infiltration rate and soil moisture comparison between different storm event return periods 10 25 50 and 100 years shows that the same flooding hotspots are persistent but with considerable variation in water depth and flood extent to investigate the sensitivity of the simulations to stormwater infrastructure simulations without the stormwater infrastructure input were conducted the results show that stormwater infrastructure decreases flooding volume of rp 10 25 50 and 100 by factors of 20 14 12 and 8 respectively this shows that urban flood simulation is highly sensitive to the inclusion of stormwater infrastructure though with decreasing relative impact for larger events to investigate the sensitivity of the simulations to soil characteristics four land cover simulations actual uniform entirely pervious entirely impervious were compared the results show flood simulation predictions are sensitive to both the value and spatial explicitness of the soil input data we discuss challenges in urban flood simulation and their potential solutions in the context of emerging frameworks for national and global hyper resolution flood forecasting and analysis keywords urban flooding hydraulic modeling stormwater infrastructure soil infiltration 1 introduction the effects of

and fenner 2016 curriero et al 2001 tunstall et al 2006 booth 2012 in recent years urban flooding due to extreme weather rapid urbanization and climate change has been increasing both in severity and

agbola et al 2012 actionaid 2006 ntelekos et al 2010 galloway et al 2018 teng et al 2017 generally urban flooding is caused by extreme runoff in a developed area where drainage is insufficient weber 2019 fernández and lutz 2010 this runoff travels over the surface pooling in low lying areas within the catchment until it drains infiltrates or evaporates however infiltration rates in the urban environment tend to be much lower than that of a natural environment due to prevalence of impervious land cover mahmoud and gan 2018 villarini et al 2011 huong and pathirana 2013 though urban stormwater infrastructure can drain surface water efficiently it has a finite water transport capacity which can lead to waterlogging soon after a rainfall event commences fletcher et al 2015 schmitt et al 2004 hoang and fenner 2016 several studies in recent years have focused on the role and significance of urban drainage systems and urban runoff motivated by the high costs and potential damage involved with prolonged flooding arnone et al 2018 grum et al 2006 arnbjerg nielsen 2012 berggren et al 2014 according to the european standard en 752 cen 1996 1997 urban drainage systems should be designed to endure periods of flooding of 10 50 years depending on the type of urban area and traffic infrastructure associated with it however aging drainage infrastructures and lack of upgrades to keep pace with development and climate changes can result in failure when extreme rainfall occurs while improvement to stormwater infrastructure is costly stormwater control measures scms can be a cheaper solution to reduce the runoff from those locations li et al 2017 bell et al 2016 liu et al 2014 national research council 2009 there are different types of scms that are commonly used in urban environments to reduce runoff such as retention basin bio swales infiltration trench porous pavement rain barrels detention pond green roof rain garden epa 2019 while these initiatives are quite promising for small rainfall events the storm drainage network remains the dominant and most widely used technique in most urban environment this paper investigates urban flooding using the university of alabama ua campus in tuscaloosa alabama u s a as a case study ua experiences frequent flooding in several hotspots fig 1 like most urban environments the ua campus has mixed land uses i e a combination of green areas and human made infrastructure runoff generated from the study area can vary spatially and temporally depending on the local drainage capacity vegetation type and density and topographic features realistic calculation of runoff dynamics is dependent on accurate classification of the land cover slope topographic wetness index and soil type as well as other key soil properties nouh 2006 şen 2004 mahmoud and gan 2018 runoff generation and accumulation depend on the effectiveness with which the surface is connected to the stormwater drainage system for instance in an urban environment the impervious surfaces buildings roofs roads and parking lots are often connected to an underground stormwater drainage system for roads parking lots and similar types of surfaces stormwater is collected through street curbs and gutters and eventually drains to the stormwater infrastructure network dhi 2015 however there are some impervious surfaces that are less likely to be connected to the stormwater infrastructure such as sports fields playgrounds and paved paths and when an extreme event occurs they can get flooded within a short time span fig 1 gis data on stormwater infrastructure is not readily available or attainable for most local urban environments even in developed countries galloway et al 2018 liptan 2017 land cover and soil characteristics can be inferred estimated from soil or land use land cover maps or derived from remote sensing analysis but these are often too coarse for urban applications given these limitations and the great efforts and costs involved in obtaining these data such as through detailed surveys and digitization of infrastructure and land cover maps and detailed field measurement and analysis of soil properties elucidating the sensitivity of urban flood simulations to these factors is of great importance while it is clear that stormwater infrastructure and soil properties are very important for accurate representation of urban water dynamics their control on flooding dynamics during extreme events is not well understood this is because soils may become saturated and stormwater infrastructure capacity may be reached shortly after the start of an event this will limit or eliminate their effective influence on surface water dynamics this paper aims to quantify the impact of stormwater infrastructure and soil properties on flood predictions by analyzing the sensitivity of urban flood simulations using the mike urban model to stormwater infrastructure and soil infiltration inputs under different storm severities return periods of 10 25 50 and 100 years we hypothesize that while the relative impact of these factors will decrease with increasing storm magnitude they will remain highly impactful even for the most extreme storm severity 2 methodology 2 1 mike urban model the combined hydrologic and hydraulic model mike urban dhi 2020 was used in this study to simulate surface

flooding that corresponded very well with our observations of the actual event this provides qualitative support for the model s ability to simulate flooding patterns on the ua campus 3 3 flooding under different precipitation return periods rp flooding caused by rainstorms at different return periods rp 10 25 50 and 100 years was simulated fig 5 table 3 shows that as expected greater return periods yield greater floodwater volumes and depths flooding hotspots on campus were the same for all simulations with increasing extent and water depth except for rp 10 for rp 10 two locations the intersection near bryant denny stadium and tutwiler and the bus hub were detected to be flooded with very negligible and dispersed waterlogging in some locations fig 5 for rp 25 and 50 flood maps show similar patterns the rp 100 flood map showed the highest flood volume and flooding at 10 different locations on campus with various depths and extents the flood volume found for rp 100 was 4 8 2 5 and 1 9 times higher than for rp 10 25 and 50 respectively table 3 3 4 the impact of stormwater infrastructure a comparison between the simulations with and without stormwater infrastructure shows considerable differences in floodwater depth and extent throughout the study area e g fig 6 the objective was to identify how important it is to include stormwater infrastructure to understand urban flood simulation performances under different storm severity scenarios due to the absence of detailed drainage data of stormwater infrastructure as is often the case in urban flood applications instead of determining the exact carrying capacity we quantified how it affects the flooding area and depth by comparing the differences between simulations with and without stormwater infrastructure floodwater volume without the stormwater infrastructure is higher by a factor of 20 for rp 10 and by factors of 14 12 and 8 times for rp 25 50 and 100 respectively table 4 the difference in volume between the two scenarios for rp 10 was found to be 348 864 m3 which means that the simulated stormwater infrastructure was draining that volume of water in the 4 hour duration of the simulated storm event 87 000 m3 h this translates to an average drainage capacity of 24 m3 s these results demonstrate the importance of incorporating stormwater infrastructure into urban flood simulations the reduction in the relative differences between the two simulation scenarios with and without the stormwater infrastructure with increasing storm rp can be explained by the finite drainage capacity of the stormwater infrastructure the proportion of water drained by the stormwater infrastructure decreases for larger storms however these results show that even for rp 100 incorporating stormwater infrastructure into the simulation is crucial for predicting water volume and depth 3 5 the impact of soil infiltration inputs three infiltration input configurations were compared to the realistic scenario spatially variable infiltration based on our field measurements and land cover classification the mean and maximum water depths found from the fully impervious flood simulations for rp 25 were 0 21 m and 2 05 m respectively fig 7 table 5 this is compared to the realistic simulation with mean and maximum water depth of 0 19 and 1 58 m a difference of 0 02 and 0 46 m respectively the simulated floodwater volume for the fully impervious simulation was 44 288 m3 compared to 35 776 m3 in the original simulation a difference of 8512 m3 a difference factor of 1 2 for rp 100 the floodwater volume for the fully impervious simulation was 97 280 m3 compared to 88 960 m3 in the original simulation a difference of 8320 m3 a difference factor of 1 1 the fully pervious simulation for rp 25 yielded mean and maximum flood depths of 0 13 m and 0 83 m respectively table 5 a difference of 0 06 m and 0 75 m respectively from the realistic simulation the simulated floodwater volume for the pervious simulation for rp 25 was 6208 m3 a difference of 29 568 m3 from the realistic simulation a difference factor of 0 17 for the rp 100 simulation the floodwater volume for the fully pervious simulation was 30 280 m3 a difference of 58 680 m3 a difference factor of 0 34 the results of the uniform average infiltration scenario show a major reduction in floodwater volume relative to the realistic simulation when simulating spatially uniform infiltration a difference factor of 0 18 and 0 35 for rp 25 and 100 respectively table 5 this is surprising considering that the average infiltration across the study site is the same for the realistic and uniform simulations this can be attributed to the fact that flooding is most prevalent in areas dominated by impervious land cover so using an average infiltration rate resulted in considerable underprediction in these hotspots this effect is reduced in high magnitude events rp 100 due to a reduction in the relative contribution of infiltration to simulated surface water balance these results however demonstrate that infiltration still has an impact even for rp 100 yielding about one third of the simulated floodwater volume total volume of 31 232 m3 and 88 960 m3 for the uniform and realistic simulations respectively 4 discussion the analysis of soil characteristics revealed highly homogeneous texture sandy loam and organic matter in the study site but with a high degree of spatial and temporal variation in soil moisture and infiltration rate the soil moisture from the field observations was found to be lower with corresponding higher infiltration rates before november but the soil moisture increased after november due to the increase in antecedent rain during november december which resulted in lower infiltration rates in the study area these complex spatiotemporal dynamics in soil even in areas with similar land cover type showcase the need for detailed soil data and for models that explicitly simulate soil moisture and infiltration dynamics the value and spatial explicitness of the model s soil infiltration input were found to have a strong impact on its flood predictions section 3 5 this further demonstrates the importance of obtaining detailed soil data for urban flood modeling stormwater infrastructure model input was also found to have a major influence on flood simulations while the relative difference between simulations which include and exclude stormwater infrastructure is reduced as storm magnitude increases it remains of crucial importance even in high magnitude events a factor of 8 difference in floodwater volume predictions for rp100 the results highlight major challenges in urban flood predictions and analyses obtaining detailed data on soil characteristics mainly infiltration rate obtaining detailed gis data on stormwater infrastructure and developing modeling frameworks that are able to simulate and couple both surface hydrology and subsurface drainage through the stormwater infrastructure the latter is identified as a challenge given the costs and complexity of existing modeling frameworks emerging and future developments of national and global scale hyper resolution flood forecasting and analysis frameworks both in the us and internationally mandate the development of solutions for obtaining high resolution soil and stormwater infrastructure data these can include the development of data repositories and government mandates or incentives for local municipalities to update and share the data somewhat akin to fema s national flood insurance program citizen science programs and remote and proximity sensing analysis e g street view development of open source alternatives to the commercial models will likely greatly improve accessibility to scientists and practitioners efforts should also focus on improving the computational efficiency and ease of use of the models through advances such as parallelization and cloud computing architecture and services 5 conclusion urban environments have highly heterogeneous infiltration rates and complex drainage systems because of the general unavailability of detailed spatial data on infiltration and stormwater infrastructure incorporating these characteristics into models of urban flooding is challenging in this paper we quantified the impact of stormwater infrastructure and soil infiltration on simulated flooding in an urban environment at a range of storm severities we compared simulations in which stormwater infrastructure input was included and excluded and soil infiltration inputs were configured differently realistic uniform completely impervious and completely pervious the results show that urban flood simulation is highly sensitive to inputs of both infiltration rates and stormwater infrastructure impact of stormwater infrastructure and infiltration values decrease for larger storms due to more rapid saturation of the stormwater infrastructure and soil however even for 100 year return period rainfall the impact was very high a factor of 8 greater simulated stormwater volume when excluding the stormwater infrastructure and about one third of the simulated floodwater volume when using a spatially uniform infiltration input in light of these results we assert that there is a need to develop frameworks or mechanisms for making these urban datasets available and incorporating them into openly accessible and easy to implement hydraulic stormwater models such advances could greatly contribute to understanding of flood mechanisms in the urban environment and to prediction and management of flood risk in cities credit authorship contribution statement afrin hossain anni investigation software validation visualization writing original
