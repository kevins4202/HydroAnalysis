15510,anaerobic digestion ad relies on myriads of functions performed by complex microbial communities in customized settings thus a comprehensive investigation on the ad microbiome is central to the fine tuned control most current ad microbiome studies are based on relative abundance which hinders the interpretation of microbes dynamics and inter sample comparisons here we developed an absolute quantification aq approach that integrated cellular spike ins with metagenomic sequencing to elucidate microbial community variations and population dynamics in four anaerobic digesters using this method 253 microbes were defined as decaying populations with decay rates ranging from 0 05 to 5 85 d 1 wherein a population from flavobacteriaceae family decayed at the highest rates of 3 87 to 5 85 d 1 in four digesters meanwhile 25 microbes demonstrated the growing trend in the ad processes with growth rates ranging from 0 11 to 1 77 d 1 and genome centric analysis assigned some of the populations to the functional niches of hydrolysis short chain fatty acids metabolism and methane generation additionally we observed that the specific activity of methanogens was lower in the prolonged digestion stage and redundancy analysis revealed that the feedstock composition and the digestion duration were the two key parameters in governing the ad microbial compositions graphical

introduction anaerobic digestion ad a microbial mediated biotechnology relies on myriads of functions performed by complex microbial communities in customized settings for volatile solid reduction biogas generation and pathogen inactivation kim et al 2002 labatut et al 2014 vanwonterghem et al 2014a zhang et al 2014 the operating parameters are adjusted to optimize the anaerobic digesters performance based on the waste stabilization efficiency and biogas generation rates ju et al 2017 however the fine tuned manipulation of the ad system presents major challenges owing to the lack of comprehensive biological understanding of the ad microbiome which has been regarded as a black box wang et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 with the rapid development of molecular techniques especially the culture independent high throughput sequencing an increasing number of studies have explored and documented the heterogeneity of microbial communities and the population dynamics in anaerobic digesters under varying operating conditions such as solid hydraulic retention time srt hrt mei et al 2017 wang et al 2020 temperature vanwonterghem et al 2015 and feedstock compositions fitamo et al 2016 wang et al 2022 which provides substantial insights into the ad microbiome the mono digestion of sewage sludge ss has been widely adopted in sewage treatment works treating the excess biomass from the secondary aeration tank and or the solids separated from the primary sedimentation as the dominant organic feedstocks mei et al 2017 vanwonterghem et al 2014b currently the co digestion of ss with food waste fw is gaining the increasing popularity globally chiu and lo 2016 to promote the ad application with higher efficiencies in treating different types of organic wastes it is of great importance to determine how the structure and functions of microbial community changes when anaerobic digesters are fed with various feedstocks however current interpretations of the ad microbiome are dependent on the relative abundance rather than absolute values which hinders the illustration of the actual microbial dynamics and inter sample comparisons ju et al 2017 morton et al 2017 props et al 2017 vandeputte et al 2017 yang et al 2021 thus high resolution profile of the community wide and population specific dynamics shall be rooted in absolute cell numbers additionally the growth decay rates of microbes a basic parameter of microbial lifestyle is central to understanding microbial interactions and the whole ecosystem long et al 2021 rousk and bååth 2011 weissman et al 2021 more crucially the widely applied correlation analysis based on pearson and spearman metrics which has been used to infer the microbe microbe and microbe operating parameters correlations mainly relies on the assumption that the changes of an individual population are independent lovell et al 2015 weiss et al 2015 lloréns rico et al 2021 nowadays some studies have attempted to apply absolute quantification aq to study the microbial communities of some ecosystems e g human gut ji et al 2019 vandeputte et al 2017 soil tkacz et al 2018 and cooling water props et al 2017 but very few studies adopted aq in ad systems in the above studies that adopted aq the cell number of a specific population was calculated by multiplying the total cell number of a mixed community which was roughly estimated based on biomass from volatile suspended solids vss mei et al 2019 or enumerated by the flow cytometer fcm or fluorescence microscopy foladori et al 2007 vandeputte et al 2017 liang et al 2020 long et al 2021 with the compositional data derived from the 16s rrna amplicon sequencing nonetheless these absolute values shall be interpretated with care because of the bias in microbial load counting methods and or unequal amplification pcr bias o donnell et al 2016 peng et al 2018 to avoid the above mentioned pitfalls we adopted two strategies to develop the metagenome based absolute quantification i using two microbial internal cellular standards termed as spike ins of known absolute cell numbers for the downstream calibration to avoid the bias in counting the microbial total loads yang et al 2021 and ii integrating metagenomic sequencing with genome centric analyses to avoid pcr amplicon bias the reliability of this spike ins based aq method was validated using fcm based counting to quantify the total cell number of ad samples and culture based colilert maximum possible number mpn test to enumerate cell counts of escherichia coli making use of this spike ins based aq approach helped successfully deciphering populations with varying dynamic trends coupled with their corresponding growth decay rates especially for those decaying ones withvaried behaviors in mono and co digesters additionally the specific activity of methanogens calculated based on the absolute quantification method provided novel insights into the methane production per methanogen cell in the anaerobic digesters and could be a valuable reference for the fine tuned control of the ad process 2 method and materials 2 1 digester setup operation and chemical analyses the inoculum and feedstock preparations were illustrated in supplementary information 1 si 1 four mesophilic digesters with 900 ml working volume per digester wherein two for mono digestion of feeding sewage sludge fss named as m1 and m2 and two for co digestion of fw and fss named as c1 and c2 with fw fss mass ratio of 50 50 were set up with the feedstock to inoculum ratio of 2 1 v v all digesters were flushed with n2 gas for 15 min to create the oxygen free condition and operated for 40 days the physicochemical properties monitored were 1 biogas volume and its composition 2 concentrations of total organic carbon toc volatile fatty acids vfas and 3 total solids ts and volatile solids vs the analytical methods for these parameters had been well documented in our previous publications ju et al 2016 wang et al 2017 the physicochemical characteristics of the feedstocks and the mixtures of feedstock and inoculum were summarized in table s2 the isolation and numeration methods for an isolated wild type e coli strain were described in si 2 which was added into the feedstocks as indicator organism with the ratio of 4 0 e coli fss vs based ahead of starting the ad process 2 2 internal standards spike ins preparation and spike ins based aq workflow we used two spike ins namely pseudomonas putida kt2240 gfp and bacillus amyloliquefaciens mcherry considering different dna extraction efficiencies for gram positive and gram negative microbes detailed information of spike ins solution preparation enumeration and complete genomes were documented in si 3 in total 56 samples were selected for the spike ins based aq metagenomics including 52 digested effluent samples from four anaerobic digesters i e 13 samples per digester as shown in table s1 two feedstocks and two inoculum samples and the spike ins based aq workflow is as below firstly we combined 3 08 108 cells of each spike in with 0 25 ml sample into a 15 ml centrifuge tube placed the centrifuge tube on a vortex machine at full power for 1 min to completely mix the spike ins with the sample then the mixture was centrifuged at 4 000 rpm for 20 min and concentrated into 0 5 ml and finally the total dna was extracted using the fastdna spin kit mp biomedicals details of direct counting on cell number of the spike ins and the ad samples using single cell fcm could be found in si 4 2 3 illumina sequencing and metagenomic analyses the illumina sequencing service novaseq pe150 was provided by novogene co ltd beijing and fastp v0 23 2 chen et al 2018 with default settings was employed for the quality control of raw reads clean reads from the same digester were co assembled using megahit v 1 2 9 li et al 2015 with default settings after which the assembled contigs were imported to metawrap v 1 2 1 uritskiy et al 2018 to retrieve metagenome assembled genomes mags using metabat 2 kang et al 2019 and maxbin wu et al 2016 respectively and the retrieved bins were further polished with the bin refinement module to retain mags with completeness 50 and contamination 10 as determined by checkm parks et al 2015 mags dereplication was conducted using drep v2 4 0 olm et al 2017 comp 50 con 10 and nc 0 5 and 365 non redundant mags were obtained taxonomy affiliation of these 365 mags was processed through gtdb tk v1 4 1 parks et al 2020 refering to the genome taxonomy database version r95 parks et al 2020 abundances of mags were computed in the genome module of coverm min covered fraction 0 v0 61 0 https github com wwood coverm with the methods of relative abundance to output relative abundance values of mags and mean to output the coverage values of mags using the mapping aligner of bwa mem li 2013 with default settings the cutoff of 99 identity and 20 query alignment coverage alignment cutoff evaluation was described in si 5 and fig s2 was used to quantify the copy number of gfp and mcherry genes using bowtie2 in local mode langmead and salzberg 2012 in the clean reads then scaling factors sfs values between known cell numbers of spike ins strains and copy numbers of these two genes in the metagenomics sequencing datasets were employed to scale up the mags coverage to attain the absolute number of microbes si 6 we assumed that i the gram positive and gram negative populations shared the same dna exaction efficiencies with b amyloliquefaciens and p putida respectively and ii the cell numbers of spike ins were consistent with the copy numbers of gfp and mcherry genes as these two genes were single copy on the spike ins genomes the retrieved mags were grouped into three categories according to the cell membrane features namely gram negative g gram positive g and unknown populations mcherry and gfp sfs were subjected to compute the absolute cell number of g and g populations and for microbes with unknown membrane features or these affiliated to the novel phylum with no pure culture the sf was the average values of gfp and mcherry sfs besides the mcherry sfs of gram positive spike in b amyloliquefaciens were applied to obtain the cell counts of archaeal populations the cell numbers in the scientific notation in different order of magnitude were used for comparison the workflow of the developed spike ins based aq and genome centric metagenomics analysis was shown in fig 1 and the phylogenetic tree construction functional annotation of mags table s7 network analysis and redundancy analysis were illustrated in si 7 sequencing data are available in the ncbi sequence read archive sra under the prjna875893 3 results 3 1 validation of the spike ins based aq approach benchmarking to the total cell number of the ad samples enumerated by the spike ins based aq was performed using the fcm counting results showed that the total cell abundance of ad samples based on the spike ins based aq and fcm counting were comparable i e ranging from 2 25 109 to 5 20 109 cells ml versus from 7 06 109 to 17 1 109 cells ml the difference of values generated from these two methods was within one magnitude although cell number counted by fcm were higher i e 3 68 0 87 and 2 65 0 62 times in mono and co digesters respectively than that enumerated by spike ins based aq method fig s3 furthermore we evaluated the consistency of results obtained from the spike ins based aq and from the colilert mpn test to quantify cell changes of specifically concerned populations such as e coli an indicator organism fig s4 it showed that the ad did have an inactivation effect on e coli in both the mono and co digestion processes and the rapid inactivation of the ad on e coli during the first five days was consistent using these two numeration approaches pearson metric based correlation analysis revealed a significant p value 0 001 positive correlation with the coefficient of 0 81 between cell counts derived from the two numeration methods in the first five days hence this spike ins based aq was adopted to calculate the cell numbers of ad samples for the downstream analysis 3 2 microbial population dynamics there were 365 mags retrieved from four anaerobic digesters fig 2 when profiling the longitudinal microbial population dynamics based on relative and absolute abundances in the four anaerobic digesters one striking discrepancy was observed that all mags had opposite trends between the relative and the absolute profiles in at least one ad digester for example the bacterium chloro 3 the cell counts decreased by 4 47 107 cell ml in c1 from day 8 to day 10 while its relative abundance increased by 1 97 the relative abundance of actino 14 decreased by 3 94 while its cell numbers increased by 1 42 107 cell ml in c2 from day 3 to day 5 another bacterium thermot 4 increased its relative abundance by 0 80 while its cell counts decreased by 1 82 107 cell ml in m1 from day 15 to day 20 fig 3 thus the compositional data would potentially be misleading if the conclusions were drawn solely based on the relative abundance the spike ins based aq approach enabled us to track the community wide and population resolved dynamics firstly we analyzed the retrieved 365 mags on the correlation of their dynamic profiles using elsa xia et al 2011 then we grouped these clustered microorganisms into three categories featured with growing decaying and fluctuated trends table s5 the dynamics variation of each population was determined by dividing the maximum cell number by its minimum value in each digester we found that 25 populations spanning from 8 phyla e g firmicutes 10 synergistota 4 halobacteriota 4 hydrogenedentota 2 proteobacteria 2 chloroflexota 1 thermoplasmatota 1 and verrucomicrobiota 1 demonstrated an obvious growing trend implying that they gained the proliferative advantage in ad conditions among these growing microorganisms 7 populations were shared in both mono and co digesters table 1 of which 6 microbes grew at the same magnitudes including 5 populations with less than 1 log increasement and 1 population with 1 2 logs increasement in anaerobic digesters results showed that 253 mags spanning 28 phyla e g proteobacteria 58 actinobacteriota 36 bacteroidota 31 firmicutes 36 etc were classified as decaying populations in the ad digesters during the course of 40 day operationed suggesting that ad conditions unfavored their survival specifically 189 out of these 253 decaying populations were shared in both mono and co digesters wherein 97 microbes decayed at the same magnitudes in all four digesters among the 189 shared decaying populations 23 microbes had varied decay scales in anaerobic digesters fed with different feedstocks wherein 1 population showed larger decay variation in mono digesters and 22 ones decayed in higher magnitudes in co digesters in replicate digesters of mono digestion 31 populations decayed at the same scales while 24 populations decayed at the same magnitudes in two co digesters 3 3 observed maximum growth decay rates of the populations in the ad microbiome in addition to documenting population dynamics the growth decay rate is another key characteristic for microbial ecology kirchman 2016 rousk and bååth 2011 our spike ins based aq integrated with genome centric analyses enabled the population level scan on the growth decay rate of a large number of microbes weissman et al 2021 the growth decay rates were computed as the slopes of the ln transformed mags cell counts over the digestion time between two time points following the method in the previous studies korem et al 2015 long et al 2021 for growing populations the cell density increased from 0 04 0 001 109 to 0 20 0 01 109 cells ml in mono digesters and from 0 04 0 005 109 to 0 15 0 02 109 cells ml in co digesters respectively the maximum growth rates of all growing microbes were in the range of 0 11 1 77 d 1 with doubling times ranged from 6 3 to 0 4 days wherein synerg 1 affiliating to s aminobacterium sp002432275 had the highest maximum growth rate of 1 77 d 1 in co digester c1 and firmic 51 was the one with the highest maximum growth rate of 1 20 d 1 in mono digester m1 for the shared growing microbes 6 out of the 7 populations showed higher maximum growth rates in mono digesters than that in co digesters for example haloba 1 affiliating to s methanothrix a harundinacea grew twice faster in mono digesters than that in co digesters one archaeal microbe haloba 3 belonging to the g methanoculleus was the only population grew faster in co digesters than that in mono digesters the total cell density of the decaying populations declined from 2 24 0 07 109 to 0 69 0 10 109 cells ml in the mono digesters and from 2 00 0 06 109 to 0 39 0 03 109 cells ml in the co digesters over the 40 day digestion fig 4 a we used the term of decay rate to refer the negative growth rate of the population showing the decreasing trend in the ad process the overall range of the maximum decay rates in all four digesters were from 0 05 d 1 to 5 85 d 1 with decimal reduction time ranging from 46 1 to 0 4 days fig 4 table s6 we observed that decay rates varied largely at the phylum level and the top three phyla with the highest maximum decay rates were aureabacteria fusobacteriota and campylobacterota with values of 1 90 1 14 d 1 1 86 0 27 d 1 and 1 56 0 95 d 1 respectively meanwhile hydrogenedentota and dependentiae microbes were the two phyla with the lowest maximum decay rates of 0 12 0 02 d 1 and 0 23 0 08 d 1 respectively proteobacteria populations did not decay at high rates although this phylum comprised the highest number of decayed populations the average decay rate of proteobacteria populations was 0 64 0 70 d 1 in all four digesters and they were observed decaying at similar rates in mono and co digesters with values of 0 65 0 67 d 1 vs 0 63 0 73 d 1 respectively intriguingly proteobacteria populations showed divergent maximum decay rates among 27 families wherein the top three families with the highest decay rates were enterobacteriaceae 3 52 0 55 d 1 rhodanobacteraceae 1 88 0 10 d 1 and competibacteraceae 1 77 0 66 d 1 additionally proteo 11 belonging to enterobacteriaceae family decayed at high rates ranging from 4 19 to 2 85 d 1 in the four anaerobic digesters we also observed that almost half of the families in the phylum of proteobacteria for example competibacteraceae aeromonadaceae and parvularculaceae decayed faster in the co digesters than in the mono digesters most families from bacteroidota also showed higher decay rates in the co digesters than that in the mono digesters wherein two populations bacter 8 and bacter 28 affiliating to f flavobacteriaceae and g draconibacterium had the highest decay rates with values ranging from 5 85 to 3 87 d 1 and 4 34 to 3 47 d 1 in the four anaerobic digesters desulfobacterota microbes also showed the same trend they decayed faster in the co digesters at the rates of 1 45 1 22 d 1 than those in the mono digesters with the rates of 1 13 0 71 d 1 the average decay rate of firmicutes was more than twice higher in co digesters than that in the mono digesters 1 11 0 77 d 1 vs 0 50 0 30 d 1 different from bacteroidota desulfobacterota and firmicutes populations microbes from actinobacteriota phylum demonstrated the opposite trends with 0 33 0 11 d 1 vs 0 24 0 20 d 1 decay rates in mono digesters synerg 14 belonging to s aminivibrio sp002417725 demonstrated the lowest decay rate of 0 09 d 1 in the mono digester m1 and chloro 11 affiliating to o thermomicrobiales had the slowest decay rate of 0 05 d 1 in co digester c1 interestingly we observed that two populations i e synerg 3 and hydrog 3 showed the inverse trend in mono and co digesters the cell number of synerge 3 increased in the mono digesters at the max growth rate of 0 63 0 16 d 1 but decayed at the maximum rate of 0 31 0 01 d 1 in co digesters hydrog 3 decayed in co digesters at rates of 0 12 0 02 d 1 but grew at the maximum growth rate of 0 57 0 10 d 1 in the mono digesters fig s7 3 4 dynamics profile and the specific activity of methanogens during the 40 day digestion the accumulated ch4 productions were 3699 48 6 and 5254 460 ml for the mono and co digesters respectively a total of 17 archaeal mags were retrieved from the ad samples wherein 16 comprised nearly complete methanogenic pathways spanning two archaeal phyla i e halobacteriota 12 and thermoplasmatota 4 the total cell counts of methanogens were in the ranges of 0 04 0 14 0 06 0 16 0 06 0 2 and 0 08 0 22 109 cells ml in m1 m2 c1 and c2 respectively and the highest cell concentrations of methanogens were observed no later than day 15 in all digesters fig 5b the specific activities of methanogens were calculated and we found that i the average values of both mono and co digesters were similar i e 0 09 0 02 and 0 08 0 01 µmch4 106 methanogens d equal to 0 60 0 13 106 and 0 54 0 05 106 methane molecule generated by a methanogen cell per second over the 40 day digestion ii higher specific activity of methanogens was observed in the early digestion period in all anaerobic digesters and iii the longer the digestion time the lower the detected specific activity of methanogens fig 5a especially the highest specific activities of methanogens were detected on day 1 with 0 22 0 13 and 0 23 0 02 µmch4 106 methanogens d equal to 1 51 0 89 106 and 1 59 0 16 106 methane molecule generated by a methanogen cell per second in the mono and co digesters respectively we observed that the specific activities of methanogens were not positively correlated with the total cell counts of methanogens during the digestion process starting from day 20 the specific activities of methanogens were very low and the cell numbers of methanogens declined suggesting that methanogens might terminate both their proliferative and metabolic activities when the digestion period lasted more than 20 days which might due to the depletion of the methanogenic substrates i e acetate formate h2 co2 in this specific study we profiled the methanogen dynamics and found that haloba 1 accounted for more than half of the total cells of methanogens in all the four digesters at the end of ad and its relative abundance gradually increased with the digestion time fig 5c this microbe was an acetoclastic methanogen while it was also reported with the metabolic potential to reduce co2 for ch4 production through direct interspecies electron transfer zheng et al 2021 besides the relative abundance of halobo 11 affiliated to the f methanoregulaceae was higher at the early stage of the digestion with the highest values of 27 9 2 34 on day 1 and gradually declined over time suggesting that this microbe might be one of the key contributors to methane production in the early digestion stage it was noteworthy that certain methanogens demonstrated proliferative and niche preferences in varying digestion conditions specifically although haloba 9 and haloba 12 affiliated to s methanofollis liminatans and s methanosarcina mazei respectively were the major methanogenic members at the early stage of digestion the former methanogen was more abundant in the mono digesters and the latter predominated in the co digesters probably due to their preference to the varying substrate compositions in the two types of anaerobic digesters 3 5 functional microbes for short chain fatty acids metabolism genome centric analysis enabled us to identify functional microbes with genetic potentials in metabolizing short chain fatty acids i e butyrate propionate and acetate vanwonterghem et al 2016 results showed that 40 populations from 9 bacterial phyla and 18 microbes from 8 bacterial phyla harbored genes involved in the butyrate and propionate metabolism in their genomes besides 32 microbes were annotated as the fermentative acetogens possessing nearly complete glycolysis pathway pyruvate oxidation as well as acka and pta genes in their genomes additionally 3 firmicutes and one chloroflexota mags were identified to have the genetic potential to carry out syntrophic acetate oxidization sao through the reverse wood ljungdahl pathway mosbæk et al 2016 and 52 mags spanning 15 bacterial phyla were identified with the genetic potential of the glycine cleavage system nobu et al 2015 for the sao process which was consistent with a previous report that this novel pathway was not phylogenetically conserved zhu et al 2020 we observed that the total cell concentrations of these functional populations were higher during the early digestion period and decreased thereafter fig s5 specifically the cell numbers of microbes with propionate metabolic potentials peaked on day 1 and decreased to the lowest levels after day 30 the highest abundance of fermentative acetogens with values of 1 70 0 3 109 cells ml on day 1 and 1 05 0 01 109 cells ml on day 15 were observed and their cell numbers decreased till day 35 and day 40 as the lowest points for the co and mono digesters respectively regarding syntrophic acetate oxidation bacteria saob dynamics their cell numbers stepwise increased and peaked at 1 08 0 09 109 and 1 08 0 14 109 cells ml on day 8 in mono digesters and co digesters respectively the cell changes of butyrate related microbes showed the similar trend with that of saob their cell numbers peaked at 1 16 0 07 109 on day 8 and 1 25 0 12 109 cells ml on day 10 and gradually decreased afterwards in mono and co digesters respectively 3 6 redundancy analysis in this study we employed the redundancy analysis to pinpoint the key abiotic and or biotic factor s in governing the dynamics of functional populations and quantify their contributions mei et al 2019 results showed that two operating parameters i e digestion duration and feedstock composition and six environmental variables accumulated methane biogas production and varying digestion intermediates such as propionate butyrate and valerate acids concentrations had significant impacts p value 0 01 explaining 77 of the variability in microbial dynamics fig s6 notably the operating parameters i e digestion duration and feedstock composition were the most significant factors up to 73 governing the compositional variation of functional populations furthermore we observed some correlations between the dynamics of some functional populations and the fatty acids concentrations based on the pearson correlation analysis for example the cell counts of firmic 30 firmic 33 bacter 6 and rifleb 3 were positively correlated with the butyrate concentration but 2 thermotoga populations i e thermot 1 and thermot 2 demonstrated the reverse trend besides firmic 25 s abundance was positively correlated with the propionate concentration additionally the variations of cell counts of desulf 3 desulf 11 firmic 8 and firmic 10 were similar to acetate concentrations changes and the cell counts of two firmicutes microbes i e firmic 53 and firmic 58 were negatively correlated with acetate concentrations 4 discussion absolute quantification plays an important role in accurately identifying the populations dynamics correcting the potential misinterpreation as introduced by the relative abundance profile of microbes stämmler et al 2016 vandeputte et al 2017 it had been reported that the relative abundances of the two abundant microbes in a cooling water system were almost identical but their absolute cell counts were significantly different props et al 2017 additionally absolute quantitation indicated that the taxonomic trade off between bacteroides and prevotella in human gut lozupone et al 2012 was an artefact generated from the relative microbiome analyses vandeputte et al 2017 besides genome centric metagenomics is currently a central molecular technique that offers insights into microbial ecology in biological processes from tracking microbial temporal dynamics to pinpointing microbial metabolic interactions hao et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 an approach is highly required that can quantify hundreds of populations in a sample in the units of cell number per mass or volume integrated with genome centric metagenomics crossette et al 2021 comparing with the published aq methods including adding the synthetic dna fragments into soil samples tkacz et al 2018 and dosing an internal standard stain e coli cells with green fluorescent protein before dna extraction yang et al 2018 our proposed approach addressed the bias caused by dna extraction efficiency variation and quantified the absolute number of microbes considering the different cell wall structures of gram positive and gram negative bacteria nevertheless one limitation of applying this newly developed quantification method in ad systems was that no exogenous archaeal microbe was spiked in the ad samples due to the lack of gene labeled engineered archaeal population the absolute cell counts of methanogens were attained by scaling up the methanogenic mags coverage with the sfs of gram positive spike in b amyloliquefaciens benchmarking cell numbers of ad samples using fcm counting demonstrated the reliability of applying this spike ins based aq approach in quantifying the cell concentrations of ad samples over the course of the 40 days anaerobic digestion vs declined from 25 3 to 15 9 g l and from 24 6 to 11 1 g l in mono and co digesters respectively cell densities measured at different sampling points were from 0 31 to 0 96 1012 cells g vs using fcm counting and from 0 16 to 0 31 1012 cells g vs using the spike ins based aq these absolute cell counts of microbes were comparable to that of samples in anaerobic side stream reactors ranging from 1 1 1012 to 1 2 1012cells g tss reported by foladori et al 2015 although the fcm technique enables us to count the total cell number faster than using the spike ins based aq method some limitations hindered the use of fcm counting in the ad systems and these limitations include tedious pretreatment efforts to make cells in a homogenized suspension before fcm counting by applying serial dilution and mechanical dispersion such as vortex mixing and or ultrasonication etc foladori et al 2007 foladori et al 2010 props et al 2017 vandeputte et al 2017 and fcm counting requires supervised strategies to gate the cell signals from background noises and cell aggregates props et al 2017 besides quantification of a specific population based on the relative abundance revealed by amplicon sequencing and total cell number may be inaccurate due to the biases of pcr before amplicon sequencing o donnell et al 2016 in this study samples from co digesters were less dense and cells were more homogeneously distributed in the suspension than those from mono digesters and we observed that the cell numbers enumerated by spike ins based aq and fcm were closer for samples from co digesters than those from mono digesters the spike ins based aq not only overcame the above mentioned drawbacks of the fcm method but also was highly sensitive with very low limits of detection lods allowing us to detect rare populations in the ad microbiome lods of gram positive and gram negative microbes were 265 4 136 1 cells ml vs 130 9 93 9 cells ml in mono digesters and 298 4 146 2 cells ml vs 113 8 81 4 cells ml in co digesters following the calculation method illustrated in si 6 at the sequencing depth of 10 gb the growth and decay are fundamental issues in the studies of microbial dynamics long et al 2021 three terms are exchangeable to quantify growth and decay of microbes namely growth decay rate kirchman 2016 growth decay rate constant hall et al 2014 and specific growth decay rate calabrese et al 2021 in the units of hour 1 or day 1 which normalizes the biomass change in abundance per unit initial biomass following the assumption of the first order growth model hall et al 2014 the global average growth rate was 0 076 0 071 d 1 for heterotrophic bacteria in open sea kirchman 2016 but seawater microbes grew at rates ranging from 0 08 to 5 99 d 1 in the bottle incubation based on the quantitative genome centric metagenomics analysis long et al 2021 interestingly in a full scale activated sludge of a wastewater treatment facility 49 41 of the observed operational taxonomic units otus showed growing trends but most populations growth rates were 0 10 d 1 and the remaining half otus were defined as inactive microbes with decay rates from 0 20 to 1 2 d 1 mei et al 2019 the above study employed calculation based on the vss based biomass estimation for total cell density and the relative abundance derived from 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing thus the rough cell counts estimation and biased pcr amplicon efficiency might cause potential misinterpretations in this study based on the aq method which may overcome the above biases we computed the growth rates of 25 populations with the overall growing trend and the decay rates of 253 microbes with decreasing profiles in the 40 day anaerobic digesters table s6 we found that microbes demonstrated different growth decay rates in mono and co digesters because they are sensitive to environmental conditions rousk and bååth 2011 5 conclusion this study developed and evaluated an absolute quantification workflow coupling cellular spike ins and genome centric analyses which was then implemented to elucidate the populations dynamics from the perspective of absolute cell counts rather than relative abundance profiling microbial communities dynamics based on absolute cell number enabled us to identify populations featured with growth and decay dynamics to chart the behavioral divergence of microbes in anaerobic digesters fed with varying feedstocks and to obtain their growth decay rates through high resolution screening at both the community and individual level these observed growth decay rates of ad microbes could serve as benchmarks for understanding the ad microbial ecology the specific activity of methanogens calculated in this study provided quantitative insights into methane production per methanogenic cell in the anaerobic digesters furthermore statistical analyses based on microbial absolute cell counts enabled us to identify the real contributions from several factors in governing the functional microbes variability and to pinpoint the true relationships between environmental variables and microorganisms these findings were basic aspects of microbial lifestyle and were necessary to further conceptually or mathematically model microbial community composition and dynamics laying the foundation for fine tuned controls of the engineered ad systems in the future there are two perspectives to be further investigated 1 developing the methods to differentiate viable and nonviable cells integrated with this spike ins based aq and ii optimizing sequencing strategies and developing bioinformatic tools to retrieve mags of higher

15510,anaerobic digestion ad relies on myriads of functions performed by complex microbial communities in customized settings thus a comprehensive investigation on the ad microbiome is central to the fine tuned control most current ad microbiome studies are based on relative abundance which hinders the interpretation of microbes dynamics and inter sample comparisons here we developed an absolute quantification aq approach that integrated cellular spike ins with metagenomic sequencing to elucidate microbial community variations and population dynamics in four anaerobic digesters using this method 253 microbes were defined as decaying populations with decay rates ranging from 0 05 to 5 85 d 1 wherein a population from flavobacteriaceae family decayed at the highest rates of 3 87 to 5 85 d 1 in four digesters meanwhile 25 microbes demonstrated the growing trend in the ad processes with growth rates ranging from 0 11 to 1 77 d 1 and genome centric analysis assigned some of the populations to the functional niches of hydrolysis short chain fatty acids metabolism and methane generation additionally we observed that the specific activity of methanogens was lower in the prolonged digestion stage and redundancy analysis revealed that the feedstock composition and the digestion duration were the two key parameters in governing the ad microbial compositions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords absolute quantification anaerobic digestion growth rate specific activity of methanogens data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad a microbial mediated biotechnology relies on myriads of functions performed by complex microbial communities in customized settings for volatile solid reduction biogas generation and pathogen inactivation kim et al 2002 labatut et al 2014 vanwonterghem et al 2014a zhang et al 2014 the operating parameters are adjusted to optimize the anaerobic digesters performance based on the waste stabilization efficiency and biogas generation rates ju et al 2017 however the fine tuned manipulation of the ad system presents major challenges owing to the lack of comprehensive biological understanding of the ad microbiome which has been regarded as a black box wang et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 with the rapid development of molecular techniques especially the culture independent high throughput sequencing an increasing number of studies have explored and documented the heterogeneity of microbial communities and the population dynamics in anaerobic digesters under varying operating conditions such as solid hydraulic retention time srt hrt mei et al 2017 wang et al 2020 temperature vanwonterghem et al 2015 and feedstock compositions fitamo et al 2016 wang et al 2022 which provides substantial insights into the ad microbiome the mono digestion of sewage sludge ss has been widely adopted in sewage treatment works treating the excess biomass from the secondary aeration tank and or the solids separated from the primary sedimentation as the dominant organic feedstocks mei et al 2017 vanwonterghem et al 2014b currently the co digestion of ss with food waste fw is gaining the increasing popularity globally chiu and lo 2016 to promote the ad application with higher efficiencies in treating different types of organic wastes it is of great importance to determine how the structure and functions of microbial community changes when anaerobic digesters are fed with various feedstocks however current interpretations of the ad microbiome are dependent on the relative abundance rather than absolute values which hinders the illustration of the actual microbial dynamics and inter sample comparisons ju et al 2017 morton et al 2017 props et al 2017 vandeputte et al 2017 yang et al 2021 thus high resolution profile of the community wide and population specific dynamics shall be rooted in absolute cell numbers additionally the growth decay rates of microbes a basic parameter of microbial lifestyle is central to understanding microbial interactions and the whole ecosystem long et al 2021 rousk and bååth 2011 weissman et al 2021 more crucially the widely applied correlation analysis based on pearson and spearman metrics which has been used to infer the microbe microbe and microbe operating parameters correlations mainly relies on the assumption that the changes of an individual population are independent lovell et al 2015 weiss et al 2015 lloréns rico et al 2021 nowadays some studies have attempted to apply absolute quantification aq to study the microbial communities of some ecosystems e g human gut ji et al 2019 vandeputte et al 2017 soil tkacz et al 2018 and cooling water props et al 2017 but very few studies adopted aq in ad systems in the above studies that adopted aq the cell number of a specific population was calculated by multiplying the total cell number of a mixed community which was roughly estimated based on biomass from volatile suspended solids vss mei et al 2019 or enumerated by the flow cytometer fcm or fluorescence microscopy foladori et al 2007 vandeputte et al 2017 liang et al 2020 long et al 2021 with the compositional data derived from the 16s rrna amplicon sequencing nonetheless these absolute values shall be interpretated with care because of the bias in microbial load counting methods and or unequal amplification pcr bias o donnell et al 2016 peng et al 2018 to avoid the above mentioned pitfalls we adopted two strategies to develop the metagenome based absolute quantification i using two microbial internal cellular standards termed as spike ins of known absolute cell numbers for the downstream calibration to avoid the bias in counting the microbial total loads yang et al 2021 and ii integrating metagenomic sequencing with genome centric analyses to avoid pcr amplicon bias the reliability of this spike ins based aq method was validated using fcm based counting to quantify the total cell number of ad samples and culture based colilert maximum possible number mpn test to enumerate cell counts of escherichia coli making use of this spike ins based aq approach helped successfully deciphering populations with varying dynamic trends coupled with their corresponding growth decay rates especially for those decaying ones withvaried behaviors in mono and co digesters additionally the specific activity of methanogens calculated based on the absolute quantification method provided novel insights into the methane production per methanogen cell in the anaerobic digesters and could be a valuable reference for the fine tuned control of the ad process 2 method and materials 2 1 digester setup operation and chemical analyses the inoculum and feedstock preparations were illustrated in supplementary information 1 si 1 four mesophilic digesters with 900 ml working volume per digester wherein two for mono digestion of feeding sewage sludge fss named as m1 and m2 and two for co digestion of fw and fss named as c1 and c2 with fw fss mass ratio of 50 50 were set up with the feedstock to inoculum ratio of 2 1 v v all digesters were flushed with n2 gas for 15 min to create the oxygen free condition and operated for 40 days the physicochemical properties monitored were 1 biogas volume and its composition 2 concentrations of total organic carbon toc volatile fatty acids vfas and 3 total solids ts and volatile solids vs the analytical methods for these parameters had been well documented in our previous publications ju et al 2016 wang et al 2017 the physicochemical characteristics of the feedstocks and the mixtures of feedstock and inoculum were summarized in table s2 the isolation and numeration methods for an isolated wild type e coli strain were described in si 2 which was added into the feedstocks as indicator organism with the ratio of 4 0 e coli fss vs based ahead of starting the ad process 2 2 internal standards spike ins preparation and spike ins based aq workflow we used two spike ins namely pseudomonas putida kt2240 gfp and bacillus amyloliquefaciens mcherry considering different dna extraction efficiencies for gram positive and gram negative microbes detailed information of spike ins solution preparation enumeration and complete genomes were documented in si 3 in total 56 samples were selected for the spike ins based aq metagenomics including 52 digested effluent samples from four anaerobic digesters i e 13 samples per digester as shown in table s1 two feedstocks and two inoculum samples and the spike ins based aq workflow is as below firstly we combined 3 08 108 cells of each spike in with 0 25 ml sample into a 15 ml centrifuge tube placed the centrifuge tube on a vortex machine at full power for 1 min to completely mix the spike ins with the sample then the mixture was centrifuged at 4 000 rpm for 20 min and concentrated into 0 5 ml and finally the total dna was extracted using the fastdna spin kit mp biomedicals details of direct counting on cell number of the spike ins and the ad samples using single cell fcm could be found in si 4 2 3 illumina sequencing and metagenomic analyses the illumina sequencing service novaseq pe150 was provided by novogene co ltd beijing and fastp v0 23 2 chen et al 2018 with default settings was employed for the quality control of raw reads clean reads from the same digester were co assembled using megahit v 1 2 9 li et al 2015 with default settings after which the assembled contigs were imported to metawrap v 1 2 1 uritskiy et al 2018 to retrieve metagenome assembled genomes mags using metabat 2 kang et al 2019 and maxbin wu et al 2016 respectively and the retrieved bins were further polished with the bin refinement module to retain mags with completeness 50 and contamination 10 as determined by checkm parks et al 2015 mags dereplication was conducted using drep v2 4 0 olm et al 2017 comp 50 con 10 and nc 0 5 and 365 non redundant mags were obtained taxonomy affiliation of these 365 mags was processed through gtdb tk v1 4 1 parks et al 2020 refering to the genome taxonomy database version r95 parks et al 2020 abundances of mags were computed in the genome module of coverm min covered fraction 0 v0 61 0 https github com wwood coverm with the methods of relative abundance to output relative abundance values of mags and mean to output the coverage values of mags using the mapping aligner of bwa mem li 2013 with default settings the cutoff of 99 identity and 20 query alignment coverage alignment cutoff evaluation was described in si 5 and fig s2 was used to quantify the copy number of gfp and mcherry genes using bowtie2 in local mode langmead and salzberg 2012 in the clean reads then scaling factors sfs values between known cell numbers of spike ins strains and copy numbers of these two genes in the metagenomics sequencing datasets were employed to scale up the mags coverage to attain the absolute number of microbes si 6 we assumed that i the gram positive and gram negative populations shared the same dna exaction efficiencies with b amyloliquefaciens and p putida respectively and ii the cell numbers of spike ins were consistent with the copy numbers of gfp and mcherry genes as these two genes were single copy on the spike ins genomes the retrieved mags were grouped into three categories according to the cell membrane features namely gram negative g gram positive g and unknown populations mcherry and gfp sfs were subjected to compute the absolute cell number of g and g populations and for microbes with unknown membrane features or these affiliated to the novel phylum with no pure culture the sf was the average values of gfp and mcherry sfs besides the mcherry sfs of gram positive spike in b amyloliquefaciens were applied to obtain the cell counts of archaeal populations the cell numbers in the scientific notation in different order of magnitude were used for comparison the workflow of the developed spike ins based aq and genome centric metagenomics analysis was shown in fig 1 and the phylogenetic tree construction functional annotation of mags table s7 network analysis and redundancy analysis were illustrated in si 7 sequencing data are available in the ncbi sequence read archive sra under the prjna875893 3 results 3 1 validation of the spike ins based aq approach benchmarking to the total cell number of the ad samples enumerated by the spike ins based aq was performed using the fcm counting results showed that the total cell abundance of ad samples based on the spike ins based aq and fcm counting were comparable i e ranging from 2 25 109 to 5 20 109 cells ml versus from 7 06 109 to 17 1 109 cells ml the difference of values generated from these two methods was within one magnitude although cell number counted by fcm were higher i e 3 68 0 87 and 2 65 0 62 times in mono and co digesters respectively than that enumerated by spike ins based aq method fig s3 furthermore we evaluated the consistency of results obtained from the spike ins based aq and from the colilert mpn test to quantify cell changes of specifically concerned populations such as e coli an indicator organism fig s4 it showed that the ad did have an inactivation effect on e coli in both the mono and co digestion processes and the rapid inactivation of the ad on e coli during the first five days was consistent using these two numeration approaches pearson metric based correlation analysis revealed a significant p value 0 001 positive correlation with the coefficient of 0 81 between cell counts derived from the two numeration methods in the first five days hence this spike ins based aq was adopted to calculate the cell numbers of ad samples for the downstream analysis 3 2 microbial population dynamics there were 365 mags retrieved from four anaerobic digesters fig 2 when profiling the longitudinal microbial population dynamics based on relative and absolute abundances in the four anaerobic digesters one striking discrepancy was observed that all mags had opposite trends between the relative and the absolute profiles in at least one ad digester for example the bacterium chloro 3 the cell counts decreased by 4 47 107 cell ml in c1 from day 8 to day 10 while its relative abundance increased by 1 97 the relative abundance of actino 14 decreased by 3 94 while its cell numbers increased by 1 42 107 cell ml in c2 from day 3 to day 5 another bacterium thermot 4 increased its relative abundance by 0 80 while its cell counts decreased by 1 82 107 cell ml in m1 from day 15 to day 20 fig 3 thus the compositional data would potentially be misleading if the conclusions were drawn solely based on the relative abundance the spike ins based aq approach enabled us to track the community wide and population resolved dynamics firstly we analyzed the retrieved 365 mags on the correlation of their dynamic profiles using elsa xia et al 2011 then we grouped these clustered microorganisms into three categories featured with growing decaying and fluctuated trends table s5 the dynamics variation of each population was determined by dividing the maximum cell number by its minimum value in each digester we found that 25 populations spanning from 8 phyla e g firmicutes 10 synergistota 4 halobacteriota 4 hydrogenedentota 2 proteobacteria 2 chloroflexota 1 thermoplasmatota 1 and verrucomicrobiota 1 demonstrated an obvious growing trend implying that they gained the proliferative advantage in ad conditions among these growing microorganisms 7 populations were shared in both mono and co digesters table 1 of which 6 microbes grew at the same magnitudes including 5 populations with less than 1 log increasement and 1 population with 1 2 logs increasement in anaerobic digesters results showed that 253 mags spanning 28 phyla e g proteobacteria 58 actinobacteriota 36 bacteroidota 31 firmicutes 36 etc were classified as decaying populations in the ad digesters during the course of 40 day operationed suggesting that ad conditions unfavored their survival specifically 189 out of these 253 decaying populations were shared in both mono and co digesters wherein 97 microbes decayed at the same magnitudes in all four digesters among the 189 shared decaying populations 23 microbes had varied decay scales in anaerobic digesters fed with different feedstocks wherein 1 population showed larger decay variation in mono digesters and 22 ones decayed in higher magnitudes in co digesters in replicate digesters of mono digestion 31 populations decayed at the same scales while 24 populations decayed at the same magnitudes in two co digesters 3 3 observed maximum growth decay rates of the populations in the ad microbiome in addition to documenting population dynamics the growth decay rate is another key characteristic for microbial ecology kirchman 2016 rousk and bååth 2011 our spike ins based aq integrated with genome centric analyses enabled the population level scan on the growth decay rate of a large number of microbes weissman et al 2021 the growth decay rates were computed as the slopes of the ln transformed mags cell counts over the digestion time between two time points following the method in the previous studies korem et al 2015 long et al 2021 for growing populations the cell density increased from 0 04 0 001 109 to 0 20 0 01 109 cells ml in mono digesters and from 0 04 0 005 109 to 0 15 0 02 109 cells ml in co digesters respectively the maximum growth rates of all growing microbes were in the range of 0 11 1 77 d 1 with doubling times ranged from 6 3 to 0 4 days wherein synerg 1 affiliating to s aminobacterium sp002432275 had the highest maximum growth rate of 1 77 d 1 in co digester c1 and firmic 51 was the one with the highest maximum growth rate of 1 20 d 1 in mono digester m1 for the shared growing microbes 6 out of the 7 populations showed higher maximum growth rates in mono digesters than that in co digesters for example haloba 1 affiliating to s methanothrix a harundinacea grew twice faster in mono digesters than that in co digesters one archaeal microbe haloba 3 belonging to the g methanoculleus was the only population grew faster in co digesters than that in mono digesters the total cell density of the decaying populations declined from 2 24 0 07 109 to 0 69 0 10 109 cells ml in the mono digesters and from 2 00 0 06 109 to 0 39 0 03 109 cells ml in the co digesters over the 40 day digestion fig 4 a we used the term of decay rate to refer the negative growth rate of the population showing the decreasing trend in the ad process the overall range of the maximum decay rates in all four digesters were from 0 05 d 1 to 5 85 d 1 with decimal reduction time ranging from 46 1 to 0 4 days fig 4 table s6 we observed that decay rates varied largely at the phylum level and the top three phyla with the highest maximum decay rates were aureabacteria fusobacteriota and campylobacterota with values of 1 90 1 14 d 1 1 86 0 27 d 1 and 1 56 0 95 d 1 respectively meanwhile hydrogenedentota and dependentiae microbes were the two phyla with the lowest maximum decay rates of 0 12 0 02 d 1 and 0 23 0 08 d 1 respectively proteobacteria populations did not decay at high rates although this phylum comprised the highest number of decayed populations the average decay rate of proteobacteria populations was 0 64 0 70 d 1 in all four digesters and they were observed decaying at similar rates in mono and co digesters with values of 0 65 0 67 d 1 vs 0 63 0 73 d 1 respectively intriguingly proteobacteria populations showed divergent maximum decay rates among 27 families wherein the top three families with the highest decay rates were enterobacteriaceae 3 52 0 55 d 1 rhodanobacteraceae 1 88 0 10 d 1 and competibacteraceae 1 77 0 66 d 1 additionally proteo 11 belonging to enterobacteriaceae family decayed at high rates ranging from 4 19 to 2 85 d 1 in the four anaerobic digesters we also observed that almost half of the families in the phylum of proteobacteria for example competibacteraceae aeromonadaceae and parvularculaceae decayed faster in the co digesters than in the mono digesters most families from bacteroidota also showed higher decay rates in the co digesters than that in the mono digesters wherein two populations bacter 8 and bacter 28 affiliating to f flavobacteriaceae and g draconibacterium had the highest decay rates with values ranging from 5 85 to 3 87 d 1 and 4 34 to 3 47 d 1 in the four anaerobic digesters desulfobacterota microbes also showed the same trend they decayed faster in the co digesters at the rates of 1 45 1 22 d 1 than those in the mono digesters with the rates of 1 13 0 71 d 1 the average decay rate of firmicutes was more than twice higher in co digesters than that in the mono digesters 1 11 0 77 d 1 vs 0 50 0 30 d 1 different from bacteroidota desulfobacterota and firmicutes populations microbes from actinobacteriota phylum demonstrated the opposite trends with 0 33 0 11 d 1 vs 0 24 0 20 d 1 decay rates in mono digesters synerg 14 belonging to s aminivibrio sp002417725 demonstrated the lowest decay rate of 0 09 d 1 in the mono digester m1 and chloro 11 affiliating to o thermomicrobiales had the slowest decay rate of 0 05 d 1 in co digester c1 interestingly we observed that two populations i e synerg 3 and hydrog 3 showed the inverse trend in mono and co digesters the cell number of synerge 3 increased in the mono digesters at the max growth rate of 0 63 0 16 d 1 but decayed at the maximum rate of 0 31 0 01 d 1 in co digesters hydrog 3 decayed in co digesters at rates of 0 12 0 02 d 1 but grew at the maximum growth rate of 0 57 0 10 d 1 in the mono digesters fig s7 3 4 dynamics profile and the specific activity of methanogens during the 40 day digestion the accumulated ch4 productions were 3699 48 6 and 5254 460 ml for the mono and co digesters respectively a total of 17 archaeal mags were retrieved from the ad samples wherein 16 comprised nearly complete methanogenic pathways spanning two archaeal phyla i e halobacteriota 12 and thermoplasmatota 4 the total cell counts of methanogens were in the ranges of 0 04 0 14 0 06 0 16 0 06 0 2 and 0 08 0 22 109 cells ml in m1 m2 c1 and c2 respectively and the highest cell concentrations of methanogens were observed no later than day 15 in all digesters fig 5b the specific activities of methanogens were calculated and we found that i the average values of both mono and co digesters were similar i e 0 09 0 02 and 0 08 0 01 µmch4 106 methanogens d equal to 0 60 0 13 106 and 0 54 0 05 106 methane molecule generated by a methanogen cell per second over the 40 day digestion ii higher specific activity of methanogens was observed in the early digestion period in all anaerobic digesters and iii the longer the digestion time the lower the detected specific activity of methanogens fig 5a especially the highest specific activities of methanogens were detected on day 1 with 0 22 0 13 and 0 23 0 02 µmch4 106 methanogens d equal to 1 51 0 89 106 and 1 59 0 16 106 methane molecule generated by a methanogen cell per second in the mono and co digesters respectively we observed that the specific activities of methanogens were not positively correlated with the total cell counts of methanogens during the digestion process starting from day 20 the specific activities of methanogens were very low and the cell numbers of methanogens declined suggesting that methanogens might terminate both their proliferative and metabolic activities when the digestion period lasted more than 20 days which might due to the depletion of the methanogenic substrates i e acetate formate h2 co2 in this specific study we profiled the methanogen dynamics and found that haloba 1 accounted for more than half of the total cells of methanogens in all the four digesters at the end of ad and its relative abundance gradually increased with the digestion time fig 5c this microbe was an acetoclastic methanogen while it was also reported with the metabolic potential to reduce co2 for ch4 production through direct interspecies electron transfer zheng et al 2021 besides the relative abundance of halobo 11 affiliated to the f methanoregulaceae was higher at the early stage of the digestion with the highest values of 27 9 2 34 on day 1 and gradually declined over time suggesting that this microbe might be one of the key contributors to methane production in the early digestion stage it was noteworthy that certain methanogens demonstrated proliferative and niche preferences in varying digestion conditions specifically although haloba 9 and haloba 12 affiliated to s methanofollis liminatans and s methanosarcina mazei respectively were the major methanogenic members at the early stage of digestion the former methanogen was more abundant in the mono digesters and the latter predominated in the co digesters probably due to their preference to the varying substrate compositions in the two types of anaerobic digesters 3 5 functional microbes for short chain fatty acids metabolism genome centric analysis enabled us to identify functional microbes with genetic potentials in metabolizing short chain fatty acids i e butyrate propionate and acetate vanwonterghem et al 2016 results showed that 40 populations from 9 bacterial phyla and 18 microbes from 8 bacterial phyla harbored genes involved in the butyrate and propionate metabolism in their genomes besides 32 microbes were annotated as the fermentative acetogens possessing nearly complete glycolysis pathway pyruvate oxidation as well as acka and pta genes in their genomes additionally 3 firmicutes and one chloroflexota mags were identified to have the genetic potential to carry out syntrophic acetate oxidization sao through the reverse wood ljungdahl pathway mosbæk et al 2016 and 52 mags spanning 15 bacterial phyla were identified with the genetic potential of the glycine cleavage system nobu et al 2015 for the sao process which was consistent with a previous report that this novel pathway was not phylogenetically conserved zhu et al 2020 we observed that the total cell concentrations of these functional populations were higher during the early digestion period and decreased thereafter fig s5 specifically the cell numbers of microbes with propionate metabolic potentials peaked on day 1 and decreased to the lowest levels after day 30 the highest abundance of fermentative acetogens with values of 1 70 0 3 109 cells ml on day 1 and 1 05 0 01 109 cells ml on day 15 were observed and their cell numbers decreased till day 35 and day 40 as the lowest points for the co and mono digesters respectively regarding syntrophic acetate oxidation bacteria saob dynamics their cell numbers stepwise increased and peaked at 1 08 0 09 109 and 1 08 0 14 109 cells ml on day 8 in mono digesters and co digesters respectively the cell changes of butyrate related microbes showed the similar trend with that of saob their cell numbers peaked at 1 16 0 07 109 on day 8 and 1 25 0 12 109 cells ml on day 10 and gradually decreased afterwards in mono and co digesters respectively 3 6 redundancy analysis in this study we employed the redundancy analysis to pinpoint the key abiotic and or biotic factor s in governing the dynamics of functional populations and quantify their contributions mei et al 2019 results showed that two operating parameters i e digestion duration and feedstock composition and six environmental variables accumulated methane biogas production and varying digestion intermediates such as propionate butyrate and valerate acids concentrations had significant impacts p value 0 01 explaining 77 of the variability in microbial dynamics fig s6 notably the operating parameters i e digestion duration and feedstock composition were the most significant factors up to 73 governing the compositional variation of functional populations furthermore we observed some correlations between the dynamics of some functional populations and the fatty acids concentrations based on the pearson correlation analysis for example the cell counts of firmic 30 firmic 33 bacter 6 and rifleb 3 were positively correlated with the butyrate concentration but 2 thermotoga populations i e thermot 1 and thermot 2 demonstrated the reverse trend besides firmic 25 s abundance was positively correlated with the propionate concentration additionally the variations of cell counts of desulf 3 desulf 11 firmic 8 and firmic 10 were similar to acetate concentrations changes and the cell counts of two firmicutes microbes i e firmic 53 and firmic 58 were negatively correlated with acetate concentrations 4 discussion absolute quantification plays an important role in accurately identifying the populations dynamics correcting the potential misinterpreation as introduced by the relative abundance profile of microbes stämmler et al 2016 vandeputte et al 2017 it had been reported that the relative abundances of the two abundant microbes in a cooling water system were almost identical but their absolute cell counts were significantly different props et al 2017 additionally absolute quantitation indicated that the taxonomic trade off between bacteroides and prevotella in human gut lozupone et al 2012 was an artefact generated from the relative microbiome analyses vandeputte et al 2017 besides genome centric metagenomics is currently a central molecular technique that offers insights into microbial ecology in biological processes from tracking microbial temporal dynamics to pinpointing microbial metabolic interactions hao et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 an approach is highly required that can quantify hundreds of populations in a sample in the units of cell number per mass or volume integrated with genome centric metagenomics crossette et al 2021 comparing with the published aq methods including adding the synthetic dna fragments into soil samples tkacz et al 2018 and dosing an internal standard stain e coli cells with green fluorescent protein before dna extraction yang et al 2018 our proposed approach addressed the bias caused by dna extraction efficiency variation and quantified the absolute number of microbes considering the different cell wall structures of gram positive and gram negative bacteria nevertheless one limitation of applying this newly developed quantification method in ad systems was that no exogenous archaeal microbe was spiked in the ad samples due to the lack of gene labeled engineered archaeal population the absolute cell counts of methanogens were attained by scaling up the methanogenic mags coverage with the sfs of gram positive spike in b amyloliquefaciens benchmarking cell numbers of ad samples using fcm counting demonstrated the reliability of applying this spike ins based aq approach in quantifying the cell concentrations of ad samples over the course of the 40 days anaerobic digestion vs declined from 25 3 to 15 9 g l and from 24 6 to 11 1 g l in mono and co digesters respectively cell densities measured at different sampling points were from 0 31 to 0 96 1012 cells g vs using fcm counting and from 0 16 to 0 31 1012 cells g vs using the spike ins based aq these absolute cell counts of microbes were comparable to that of samples in anaerobic side stream reactors ranging from 1 1 1012 to 1 2 1012cells g tss reported by foladori et al 2015 although the fcm technique enables us to count the total cell number faster than using the spike ins based aq method some limitations hindered the use of fcm counting in the ad systems and these limitations include tedious pretreatment efforts to make cells in a homogenized suspension before fcm counting by applying serial dilution and mechanical dispersion such as vortex mixing and or ultrasonication etc foladori et al 2007 foladori et al 2010 props et al 2017 vandeputte et al 2017 and fcm counting requires supervised strategies to gate the cell signals from background noises and cell aggregates props et al 2017 besides quantification of a specific population based on the relative abundance revealed by amplicon sequencing and total cell number may be inaccurate due to the biases of pcr before amplicon sequencing o donnell et al 2016 in this study samples from co digesters were less dense and cells were more homogeneously distributed in the suspension than those from mono digesters and we observed that the cell numbers enumerated by spike ins based aq and fcm were closer for samples from co digesters than those from mono digesters the spike ins based aq not only overcame the above mentioned drawbacks of the fcm method but also was highly sensitive with very low limits of detection lods allowing us to detect rare populations in the ad microbiome lods of gram positive and gram negative microbes were 265 4 136 1 cells ml vs 130 9 93 9 cells ml in mono digesters and 298 4 146 2 cells ml vs 113 8 81 4 cells ml in co digesters following the calculation method illustrated in si 6 at the sequencing depth of 10 gb the growth and decay are fundamental issues in the studies of microbial dynamics long et al 2021 three terms are exchangeable to quantify growth and decay of microbes namely growth decay rate kirchman 2016 growth decay rate constant hall et al 2014 and specific growth decay rate calabrese et al 2021 in the units of hour 1 or day 1 which normalizes the biomass change in abundance per unit initial biomass following the assumption of the first order growth model hall et al 2014 the global average growth rate was 0 076 0 071 d 1 for heterotrophic bacteria in open sea kirchman 2016 but seawater microbes grew at rates ranging from 0 08 to 5 99 d 1 in the bottle incubation based on the quantitative genome centric metagenomics analysis long et al 2021 interestingly in a full scale activated sludge of a wastewater treatment facility 49 41 of the observed operational taxonomic units otus showed growing trends but most populations growth rates were 0 10 d 1 and the remaining half otus were defined as inactive microbes with decay rates from 0 20 to 1 2 d 1 mei et al 2019 the above study employed calculation based on the vss based biomass estimation for total cell density and the relative abundance derived from 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing thus the rough cell counts estimation and biased pcr amplicon efficiency might cause potential misinterpretations in this study based on the aq method which may overcome the above biases we computed the growth rates of 25 populations with the overall growing trend and the decay rates of 253 microbes with decreasing profiles in the 40 day anaerobic digesters table s6 we found that microbes demonstrated different growth decay rates in mono and co digesters because they are sensitive to environmental conditions rousk and bååth 2011 5 conclusion this study developed and evaluated an absolute quantification workflow coupling cellular spike ins and genome centric analyses which was then implemented to elucidate the populations dynamics from the perspective of absolute cell counts rather than relative abundance profiling microbial communities dynamics based on absolute cell number enabled us to identify populations featured with growth and decay dynamics to chart the behavioral divergence of microbes in anaerobic digesters fed with varying feedstocks and to obtain their growth decay rates through high resolution screening at both the community and individual level these observed growth decay rates of ad microbes could serve as benchmarks for understanding the ad microbial ecology the specific activity of methanogens calculated in this study provided quantitative insights into methane production per methanogenic cell in the anaerobic digesters furthermore statistical analyses based on microbial absolute cell counts enabled us to identify the real contributions from several factors in governing the functional microbes variability and to pinpoint the true relationships between environmental variables and microorganisms these findings were basic aspects of microbial lifestyle and were necessary to further conceptually or mathematically model microbial community composition and dynamics laying the foundation for fine tuned controls of the engineered ad systems in the future there are two perspectives to be further investigated 1 developing the methods to differentiate viable and nonviable cells integrated with this spike ins based aq and ii optimizing sequencing strategies and developing bioinformatic tools to retrieve mags of higher

15511,the contamination of pesticides has been recognized as a major stressor in fresh water ecosystems in terms of the losses of services and population declines and extinctions however information on the adverse effects of pesticides on zooplankton communities under natural field conditions are still lacking although zooplankton is quite sensitive to most of pesticides in laboratory studies in this study a natural lake ecosystem liangzi lake was used to determine the relationship between pesticide contamination and abundance decline of metazoan zooplankton in august 2020 the comprehensive trophic level indexes and the abundance of phytoplankton in the 14 sampling sites of liangzi lake were comparable but the abundance of metazoan zooplankton showed significant variations across two orders of magnitude these results suggested that other factors such as pesticide contamination might be responsible for the variations of metazoan zooplankton community furthermore the responsible pesticides were screened and totally 29 pesticides were obtained finally five pesticides were identified to provide more than 99 4 toxic contributions and chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin were two main causal agents these results were further supported by laboratory exposure experiments using d magna and field study in november 2020 where the concentrations of the 29 pesticides were strongly decreased and the abundance of metazoan zooplankton was comparable across the 14 sites of liangzi lake taken together this work provided an evidence that the contamination of pesticides might be responsible for the abundance decline of metazoan zooplankton in a natural freshwater ecosystem graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords zooplankton freshwater ecosystem pesticide abundance decline agricultural run off data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as one of the most bio diverse ecosystems freshwater ecosystems are critical to life on earth and provide numerous services for human communities worldwide cardinale 2012 deines et al 2017 however in the past years many freshwater ecosystems have been seriously threatened in terms of losses in ecosystem services and population declines and extinctions tickner et al 2020 yamamuro et al 2019 the contamination of pesticides is recognized as a major contributor of biodiversity loss and abundance decline of aquatic biota barmentlo et al 2021 rumschlag et al 2022 schulz 2004 schulz et al 2021 some pesticides have been frequently detected in global rivers and lakes with the concentrations ranging from ng l to μg l anderson et al 2018 brauns et al 2018 hull et al 2015 otalvaro and brigante 2018 these concentrations detected in freshwater ecosystems often exceed acute or chronic exposure risk thresholds for aquatic organisms and thus might lead to population level adverse effects especially for the groups that are physiologically similar to the target pest species beketov et al 2013 liess et al 2021 malaj et al 2014 wolfram et al 2021 testing pesticides for toxicity is straightforward but the evaluation of effects on the population or community level is an enormous challenge especially for the effect of complex mixtures that best reflect actual field conditions kohler and triebskorn 2013 rumschlag et al 2022 recently a study reports that neonicotinoid application to watersheds coincide with a decrease in average zooplankton biomass but the casual relationship has been not established yamamuro et al 2019 furthermore several studies have been performed to evaluate the connections between biodiversity and abundance of aquatic invertebrates and contamination of pesticides in wild freshwater ecosystems bighiu et al 2020 liess et al 2021 macaulay et al 2021 however zooplankton is not included in these studies although they are considered as one of the most sensitive groups to pesticides in freshwater ecosystems according to the results from laboratory exposure studies almeida et al 2020 hanazato 2001 to the best of our knowledge the ecotoxicological assessment of pesticides in zooplankton is often pesticide specific in controlled laboratory exposures or larger scale outdoor mesocosm studies hanazato 2001 rumschlag et al 2020 and the results demonstrate that environmentally relevant concentrations of pesticides can strongly affect zooplankton at individual and population levels for example several outdoor mesocosm experiments have been performed and the results demonstrate that exposure to pesticides change the composition and abundance of zooplankton community barmentlo et al 2021 brock et al 2000 morrissey et al 2015 moreover the application of pesticides decrease the abundance of zooplankton but a significant recovery of zooplankton community can be observed after 2 month of the final application of pesticides van wijngaarden et al 2005 however direct evidence under field conditions is presently lacking furthermore zooplankton in freshwater ecosystems are exposed to diverse array of pesticides or complex mixture and thus anthropogenic exposure in laboratory conditions is insufficient to fully understand and predict the impact of pesticides on zooplankton communities bernhardt et al 2017 to our knowledge no studies have been performed to report the response evaluations of a zooplankton community exposed to pesticides under unattended and wild field conditions lakes are sentinels for changes in global and local freshwater ecosystems and make ideal for investigating the adverse effects of pesticides on zooplankton which lack the ability to conquer water flow resistance yi et al 2011 liangzi lake is semi static shallow lake and surrounded by an active agricultural landscape it is estimated that this lake is frequently exposed to agriculture run off that includes pesticides ge et al 2021 therefore it is considered as an appropriate freshwater ecosystem model to study the impacts of pesticides on zooplankton community in this study the survey and sampling were performed in august and november 2020 and it was expected that the abundance of zooplankton would be strongly decreased in peak period of pesticide application august and the abundance would recovery in trough period of pesticide application november firstly the abundance of plankton community in 14 sampling sites of liangzi lake was characterized then the toxic pesticides in lake water extracts were identified by utilizing acute toxicity test of d magna as well as target and suspect screening of pesticides finally the relationships between the contamination of agricultural pesticides and the changes in abundance of metazoan zooplankton in liangzi lake were studied by correlation analysis and confirmed by laboratory exposure experiments this study represented a field based finding and thus provided an evidence that the contamination of pesticides might be responsible for the abundance decline of metazoan zooplankton in a freshwater ecosystem 2 materials and methods 2 1 liangzi lake description located in central china liangzi lake 30 01 30 20 n 114 20 114 43 e is the second largest lake in hubei province it covers an area of 304 3 km2 but has a catchment area of 3 620 km2 with a water volume of 1 27 109 m3 xu et al 2018 liangzi lake is a shallow freshwater lake mean depth ca 4 m and from april to july of each year it is wet season and from october to march of the next year it is dry season there are many branches in liangzi lake and water exchange between branches is slow due to the limitation of topography and landforms furthermore there are more than 30 rivers that flow into liangzi lake but there is only one outlet namely the modaoji river which discharges into the yangtze river via the changgang river the direction of water flow in this lake is from south to north and then from west to east as the farmland accounts for 50 of the total area surrounding liangzi lake this lake is inevitably received agricultural run off that includes pesticides ge et al 2021 therefore based on these unique characterizations liangzi lake was chosen to investigate the effects of pesticide mixtures on metazoan zooplankton communities in this study furthermore in order to better show and analyze the results liangzi lake was divided into three lake areas west liangzi lake central liangzi lake and east liangzi lake and the workflow which included field survey laboratory toxic tests and instrument analysis was shown in fig 1 2 2 plankton sampling and characterization to exclude the bottom up effects of phytoplankton on zooplankton both the phytoplankton and metazoan zooplankton resources were analyzed as summer is the season that multiple pesticides were frequently applied in the surrounding agricultural lands around liangzi lake the first sampling was conducted in august 2020 which was the end of the application period of most pesticides for crops and the concentrations of pesticides in liangzi lake were expected to be the greatest the second sampling was in november 2020 since it was hypothesized that in november the concentrations of pesticides in liangzi lake were decreased due to biological degradation and reduced usage of pesticides and the effects on zooplankton population would decrease or disappear compared with those in august a total of 14 sampling sites were selected along the water flow direction the detailed sampling locations were showed in fig 2 a and table s1 according to the regulations for the investigation of hydrobiological resources plankton resources were surveyed from 8 a m to 12 a m and each sampling site had three replicates the sampling and calculation method of plankton was based on a previous study and documented in supporting information li et al 2017 2 3 water collection and preparation lake water samples were collected from three water layers to prepare mixed water samples during sampling water depth wd and secchi depth sd were measured by sliding staff and secchi disk respectively the hq series portable meters hach loveland usa were used to measure water temperature dissolved oxygen do ph and electrical conductivity ec for each sampling site a total of 10 l mixed water was grabbed using a polymethyl methacrylate sampler and then transferred into a clean amber glass sample bottle after that the 14 water samples were pre treated within 24 h for subsequent toxicity testing and screening of suspect pesticides furthermore a total of 1 l mixed water sample from each site was used to detect physicochemical parameters including total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn ammonium nitrogen nh4 n chlorophyll a chl a and chemical oxygen demand cod and analysis methods referred to the established standards in previous studies burns et al 2005 zhang et al 2013 in addition a total of 200 ml mixed water was collected from each sampling site and stored at 20 c for further quantification of target pesticides all samples were transported to our laboratory and processed immediately upon receipt the trophic state of liangzi lake was evaluated based on the method of comprehensive trophic level index tli bonvallot et al 2021 specific pretreatment methods for suspect and target analysis of pesticides were descripted in the supporting information 2 4 instrumental analysis for the screening of suspect pesticides an in house database containing over 2119 pesticides was used water extracts prepared using the 10 l lake water samples were injected directly into waters acquity uplc i class plus uhplc system coupled with waters xevotm g2 xs tof mass spectrometer qtof waters milford ma usa pesticides were separated on waters acquity uplc beh c18 column 2 1 mm 100 mm 1 7 μm particle size waters and the column was maintained at 40 c the gradient elution parameters were set in table s2 masslynx software waters corp milford usa was used for the acquisition of qtof system and the concrete parameters of mass and acquisition conditions were detailed in table s2 mass calibrations of the qtof instrument were conducted every second day by direct infusion of the calibration solution as recommended by waters the esi negative mode was excluded as the qtof acquisition and inventory comparison results from negative mode showed that all matching pesticides were included in positive mode the suspect screening details for pesticides in water extracts of liangzi lake were documented in the supporting information to validate the suspect pesticides screened by uhplc qtof table s3 and quantify the target pesticides in the water extracts and lake waters the concentrations of pesticides were determined by uhplc coupled to waters xevotm tq xs mass spectrometer ms ms milford ma usa sixty four pesticides were included in the target analysis firstly seventeen compounds were selected according to the screening results of qtof analysis secondly due to the analytical limitations of qtof forty seven insecticides were included additionally in the target analysis such as pyrethroid and organophosphorus insecticides since they had extensive usage but high ilod based on literature retrieval liess et al 2021 separation was performed on an acquity uplc beh c18 column 2 1 mm 50 mm 1 7 μm particle size waters with 40 c column temperature more details of the instrumental analysis were given in table s2 quantification was conducted by using the extracted ion chromatographic peak areas of the target pesticides and the isotope labeled internal standards the transitions used for quantitative analysis of the pesticides and the retention behaviors of all the target pesticides on the separation column by the uhplc ms ms method were documented in table s4 for most of the pesticides instrument limits of quantitation were in the range of 0 001 1 639 μg l the quality assurance and quality control data of target and suspect screening were detailed in the supporting information 2 5 toxicity testing protocols d magna has long been employed in toxicological studies because it is proved to be one of the most sensitive aquatic organisms to exogenous chemicals and represents the sentinel animal in the freshwater lakes hanazato 2001 in view of the variations in the abundances of metazoan zooplankton among the 14 sampling sites in this study d magna was used as a representative test organism of metazoan zooplankton to evaluate the toxic potency of the 14 water extracts the culturing of d magna was detailed in the supporting information the procedure of acute exposure basically followed oecd organization for economic co operation and development protocol novak et al 2018 briefly neonates 24 h old were randomly divided into 96 well plates with 300 μl solution in each well and exposed to each of the 14 water extracts or control condition 0 1 methanol for 48 h for each water extract two diluted concentrations 100 fold and 10 fold concentrations relative to original levels in liangzi lake in theory were used therefore they were called 100 fold or 10 fold water extracts there were 30 wells for each treatment control and each well contained one animal no food was provided during the 48 h acute exposure in addition in order to verify the results of the extract exposure above the acute toxicity of the identified pesticides by suspect and target analyses was evaluated single and combined exposures of pesticides were considered the details of selection strategies and exposure concentrations were documented in the supporting information to test the long term toxicity caused by the pesticides which were detected in lake water samples a 21 day chronic toxicity test was performed according to a previous study yuan et al 2018 briefly less than 24 h d magna neonates were exposed to single pesticide or a mixture of pesticides and the exposure concentrations were selected based on the results of the pesticide quantitation in lake water the selection strategies for single and combined exposure experiments were detailed in the supporting information three replicate glass beakers were included in each treatment and the mortality was recorded daily for f0 generation each beaker initially contained 200 ml exposure solution and 30 neonates after exposure for 2 d ten animals were randomly sampled from each beaker and they were used for behavioral assay and body length determination sequentially similarly after exposure for 6 d another ten animals were sampled from each beak and used for the measurement of body length at the end of the exposure the rest of the ten animals were sampled for behavioral assay after the evaluation of effect on reproduction the swimming behaviors were assessed using 96 well plates for 2 d animals and 24 well plates for 21 d animals for reproductive assay the time of the first brood was recorded and the number of offspring produced was counted every day to evaluate the effect on reproduction f1 generation neonates produced at 21 d of the exposure were collected and the same exposure procedure was continuously performed the growth of f1 were measured at 24 h 2 d and 6 d of the exposure and swimming behaviors were examined at 2 d in 96 well plate a solvent control was used and all the treatment groups received 0 02 methanol during the chronic exposure d magna were fed with the algae as described in the supporting information both acute and chronic exposure solutions were prepared using the authentic pesticide standards and the exposure concentrations used were confirmed by uhplc ms ms to ensure the actual exposure concentrations were consisted with the predetermined values in lake waters the measurement of biotic parameters was detailed in supporting information 2 6 relative toxic potency calculation to quantitatively identify the ecological risk and screen the pesticides with high toxicity the relative acute and chronic toxic potency were calculated based on the toxic unit tu approach the concentration addition method was more conservative and represented a good prediction in most environmental mixtures backhaus and faust 2012 therefore the sum of acute toxic units σtus acute was calculated according to the following formula carazo rojas et al 2018 and σtus acute 1 0 were considered to indicate toxicity to zooplankton t u s i t e i 1 n c i e c 50 i ci is the measured concentration of compound i in the extraction of a water sample and ec50i is the median effective concentration of the compound i the ec50 values of various pesticides of d magna in acute toxicity experiment were retrieved from the ecotox knowledgebase https cfpub epa gov ecotox and the pesticide property data base ppdb http sitem herts ac uk aeru ppdb en index htm moreover the sum of chronic toxic units σtus chronic was also calculated as t u s c h r o n i c i 1 n c i l o e c i ci is the measured concentration of compound i in natural water sample loeci is the lowest observed effect concentration value of compound i the long term loec values of various pesticides were also collected by querying ppdb and ecotox knowledgebase the ec50 and loec values of the identified pesticides were listed in table s5 furthermore the toxic contribution tc of each pesticide was calculated as follows t c i t u i σ t u 100 tui is the toxic unit of pesticide i and σtu is the sum of toxic units of the identified pesticides in a sampling site 2 7 data analysis kolmogorov smirnow test and levene s test were applied to test the normality of distribution and the homogeneity of data respectively statistically significant differences p 0 05 between the solvent control and extraction or pesticide exposure groups in acute and chronic tests were determined using onesample t test in order to identify the potential affiliations between the σtus of pesticides in lake water and the abundances of metazoan zooplankton a spearman rank correlation analysis was performed all analyses in this study were finished using ibm spss statics 19 0 spss chicago il 3 results and discussion 3 1 decline of the metazoan zooplankton community in liangzi lake water physicochemical parameters in the 14 sampling sites of liangzi lake in august were documented in table s6 and tli values ranged from 40 64 to 50 23 fig s1 indicating that the trophic states were similar among the 14 sampling sites therefore this lake was considered as a mesotrophic lake and the environment was suitable for the growth and reproduction of plankton the composition and density of phytoplankton communities were showed in fig s1 and the abundances of phytoplankton in the 14 sampling sites were in the same level with no magnitude difference a total of 77 species of metazoan zooplankton were observed across all the 14 samples in liangzi lake which were clustered into three taxa cladocera rotifera and copepoda among them rotifers copepods and cladocerans accounted for 72 23 19 48 and 7 79 of the total species respectively in august a total of 44 species of metazoan zooplankton were quantified in the 14 sampling sites and the numbers of species rotifers cladocerans and copepodas were 30 4 and 10 respectively fig s2 the abundances of metazoan zooplankton were ranged from 66 00 to 2702 67 ind l in the 14 sampling sites and thus revealed significant variations across two orders of magnitude with the order of central liangzi lake east liangzi lake west liangzi lake the species composition and density of metazoan zooplankton communities measured in august were showed in figs 2b and s2 generally the abundance of metazoan zooplankton was declined along the direction of water flow in liangzi lake fig 2b the abundances of cladocera rotifera and copepoda in 14 sampling sites showed relatively consistent tendency which was comparable with the changes in abundances of metazoan zooplankton community fig 2b the proportion of cladocera which was more sensitive to pesticides than other taxa of metazoan zooplankton was decreased by comparison with previous survey results of liangzi lake and the lakes located in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river in the same period estrada et al 2012 li et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 the trophic states were similar among the 14 sampling sites in liangzi lake and suitable for the growth and reproduction of plankton which was supported by the comparable densities of phytoplankton in the 14 sampling sites therefore the bottom up effects of phytoplankton on metazoan zooplankton might be not responsible for the abundance decline of metazoan zooplankton community in liangzi lake fig s1 a great zooplankton phytoplankton ratio is known to be a characteristic of a healthy ecosystem xu et al 2001 in this study the metazoan zooplankton phytoplankton ratios were clearly different in various branches of liangzi lake fig 2c which indicated that the health status of the ecosystem had gradually deteriorated along the direction of water flow in liangzi lake moreover due to the fact that cyanophyta in lakes are not suitable food for a large portion of zooplankton species the densities of phytoplankton except for cyanophyta were also used to calculate the metazoan zooplankton phytoplankton ratios in the 14 sampling sites of liangzi lake similarly the ratios were also significantly variable across two orders of magnitude in the 14 sampling sites fig 2d the health pressure was particularly serious in the central liangzi lake it was hypothesized that a pesticide contamination of liangzi lake was continuously converged along the water flow and thus induced combined toxic effects on metazoan zooplankton 3 2 identification of key toxic pesticides in water extracts an acute toxicity test of d magna was used to quickly determine the tentative toxicities of the 14 water extracts d magna cladocera was a suitable test organism since it was representative and sensitive enough to pesticide mediated effects it was found that the 100 fold water extracts from sampling sites 2 4 and 7 fig 2a induced severe immobilization 50 of d magna and exposure to each of the 100 fold water extracts from the sites 8 11 and 14 only caused slight immobilization effects fig 3 a and b no significant effects on immobilization were observed after exposure to each of the water extracts from the other eight sites the greatest toxicity of water extracts was observed at site 7 accompanied by the lowest abundance of metazoan zooplankton in liangzi lake the abundances of metazoan zooplankton at site 2 and site 4 were slightly greater than site 7 but were smaller than the upstream sampling sites overall the negative relationships between toxicity potency of water extracts and abundance of metazoan zooplankton in downstream of liangzi lake indicated that the toxic pesticides which had the capacity to induce decline of metazoan zooplankton community should be presented in the water extracts from sites 2 4 and 7 therefore these three extract samples were selected to further identify the key toxic pesticides the toxic pesticides in water extracts from sites 2 4 and 7 were tentatively identified by suspect screening of 2119 pesticides via four strategies and the details were documented in the supporting information suspect pesticides were first screened by using strategy i described as limiting the mass accuracy threshold to 5 ppm the isotope match intensity rms percentage less than 20 and the precursors of pesticides with at least two ms2 fragments intensity 200 and consistent with the silico fragmentations this resulted in 170 233 and 159 suspect pesticides in the water extracts from sites 2 4 and 7 respectively therefore a total of 268 suspects were recognized in the three toxic extracts for further evaluation by strategy ii which was that by the evaluation of the mass spectra information ionization polarity precursors and ms2 spectra based on the mass spectral library 41 pesticides were filtered for further identification and then 32 suspects were identified by applying the strategy iii which was to match the characteristics of chromatography afterwards according to strategy iv the pesticides that were very toxic to aquatic life according to the ghs globally harmonized system classification were retained lastly 23 suspect pesticides were retained by the four strategies in the 3 toxic extracts and they were further confirmed by comparison with the corresponding reference pesticide standards among all the identified candidate pesticides six were recognized as interferents and thus they were excluded in further analysis therefore 17 pesticides were eventually confirmed with authentic reference pesticide standards in the three toxic water extracts and they were listed in table s4 in order to further determine the key toxic pesticides that caused the acute toxicity to d magna the concentrations of target n 47 the selection details were described in 2 4 section and the confirmed suspect pesticides n 17 were measured using uhplc ms ms in the three toxic extracts and 29 pesticides were detected furthermore the concentrations of the 29 pesticides were determined in the extracts of the 14 sampling sites and corrected using matrix effects to obtain the final quantitative results table s7 the sum concentrations of the 29 pesticides in 100 fold water extracts from the 14 sampling sites ranged from 5 24 to 10 99 μg l of which 51 7 were insecticides 20 7 were herbicides and 27 6 were fungicides table s8 the calculated tus acute based on the concentrations of pesticides in 100 fold water extracts were employed for the toxicity comparison fig 3c and table s9 the results showed clear differences in tus acute at various sampling sites with the highest tus acute at site 7 and followed by site 4 and 2 furthermore the tus acute values were negatively correlated with the abundances of metazoan zooplankton fig 3d the tus acute results of water extracts were in accordance with the results of acute toxicity of d magna which proved that the key toxic pesticides to d magna should be included in the 29 pesticides screened furthermore the tus acute were mainly driven by few pesticides and three to four insecticides contributed more than 90 of the tus acute in the three toxic extracts fig 3c and table s10 in order to further confirm the key toxic pesticides in the three extracts an acute exposure testing was performed using d magna two exposure approaches of pesticides including combined exposure of chemicals and single chemical exposure were used and a total of 8 exposure groups were set up for combined exposure experiment the pesticides with 1 tc in the three toxic extracts were included the specific species and concentrations of pesticides were detailed in table s11 for single pesticide exposure experiment chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin were selected since their concentrations were the greatest in one of the three toxic extracts compared with the other extracts and they had great contributions in the tus acute of the three toxic extracts after exposure to mix2 mix4 or mix7 the survival rates were decreased to 69 2 73 1 and 46 2 respectively which were comparable with the results of tus acute after exposure to chlorpyrifos cpf for 48 h at the concentrations relative to the levels in 100 fold water extracts of site 2 and 7 the survival rates of d magna were significantly decreased fig 3e no significant effect on survival rate was observed after cypermethrin cyp exposure these results suggested that cpf was a dominant toxic contributor furthermore mix7 induced an over 50 of immobilization to d magna and a similar immobilization effect was also found in acute exposure of the water extract from site 7 a previous study reported that ec50 and noec of cpf exposure to d magna for 48 h was 1 μg l and 0 5 μg l respectively gaizick et al 2001 which was consistent with the findings in this study where exposure to 100 fold water extract of site 7 decreased survival rate of d magna but no effect was observed after exposure to 10 fold water extract similarly this also could explain that why the acute toxicities of d magna were only observed at the sites 2 4 and 7 since the concentrations of cpf in the three sites were slight greater than those in the other sites therefore these results suggested that cpf had a narrow toxic range however there was still approximate 30 of the acute toxicity that could not be explained by the identified pesticides which might be contributed by the transformation products of pesticides or other chemicals 3 3 driver pesticides of abundance decline of metazoan zooplankton in liangzi lake to accurately determine the causal pesticides that induced the abundance decline of metazoan zooplankton in liangzi lake the measurement of concentrations of the identified 29 pesticides in lake water was necessary the recoveries of 28 pesticides were above 70 table s7 the sum concentration ranges of pesticides in the 14 sampling sites were from 74 4 to 153 8 ng l and the number of pesticides found was consistent with the results of the pesticides identified in water extracts fig 4 a and table s12 the quantitation results showed that total concentrations of pesticides in east liangzi lake were generally greater than that in west liangzi lake and the sampling site with the greatest sum concentration of pesticides was site 7 which was supported by both field survey and laboratory acute exposure result in terms of toxic pressure for pesticides the tus chronic in the 14 sampling sites for d magna was spanned from 0 1 to 9 9 in august fig 4b and table s13 and the greatest tus chronic was observed at site 7 followed by site 2 and 4 meanwhile the tus chronic for algae were ranged of 0 01 0 04 indicating that the contamination of pesticides in august had no potentials to affect phytoplankton communities in liangzi lake fig s3 the tus chronic values in the 14 sampling sites were negatively correlated with the densities of metazoan zooplankton in liangzi lake fig 4c importantly the tus chronic of 7 sampling sites were greater than 1 0 which disclosed that the contamination of pesticides had capacity to induce toxic effects on metazoan zooplankton fig 3d and table s13 in addition the correlation analyses between the densities of the three taxa and tus chronic values were performed and a significant correlation between the densities of copepodas and the tus chronic values of the 29 pesticides in the 14 sampling sites was observed table s14 moreover the densities of 5 species were negatively correlated with the tus chronic values in the 14 sampling sites table s14 including 3 species of rotiferas lecane bulla trichocerca tenuior and keratella valga 1 cladocera diaphanosoma leuchtenbergianum and 1 copepodas nauplii thus the results suggested that these 5 species might be the sensitive species to the contamination of pesticides at 14 sampling sites of linagzi lake in august furthermore the pesticides with tc 1 in any of the 7 sampling sites were screened and they were cyp per and cpf as well as the abamectin and dichlorvos fig 4d the five pesticides provided more than 99 4 tcs in the 7 toxic sites table s15 and the tus chronic of these pesticides was also negatively correlated with the density of metazoan zooplankton fig s4 indicating that these pesticides might be the causal agents which drove abundance decline of metazoan zooplankton in liangzi lake in terms of combined effects of pesticides although the detected frequency of cyp was only 43 the results of tus chronic revealed the high toxicity proportion in toxic sites and showed non acceptable risk in the lake a further comparison showed that the species of these toxic pesticides at each site in liangzi lake were different which corroborated the possibility of heterogeneity in pesticide contamination proposed above moreover in terms of single effect of one pesticide the correlation between tu value of each pesticide and the density of metazoan zooplankton in liangzi lake was evaluated it was found that the tu values of seven pesticides were negatively correlated with the density of metazoan zooplankton fig 4e and cyp and cpf were two main toxic pesticides tus 0 1 hence the negative relationship of tus of pesticides and the abundance decline of zooplankton supported the hypothesis that pesticides e g cyp and cpf were the key toxic substances and their contamination led to the abundance decline of metazoan zooplankton in liangzi lake recently cpf was proposed to be included in the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants while there was no water quality criterion for cpf in china the concentrations of cpf in some sampling sites in the present study were greater than the wqc established by other countries or regions hu et al 2015 pyrethroid pesticides were widely used in both rural and urban areas worldwide and very toxic to aquatic organisms and cyp is the most frequently reported pyrethroid pesticide in the global environment water tang et al 2018 therefore these results suggested that the findings in this study might occur globally to verify the reliability of identification of the key toxic pesticide the density of metazoan zooplankton and the concentrations of the 29 pesticides in lake waters of the 14 sampling sites were determined in november 2020 as the inputs of pesticides were hypothesized to be largely decreased or stopped during autumn period and the effects of pesticides on the density of metazoan zooplankton would be decreased or not observed in november a total of 51 species of metazoan zooplankton were quantified in the 14 sampling sites and the numbers of species rotifers cladocerans and copepodas were 31 5 and 15 respectively fig s2 the results demonstrated that the densities of metazoan zooplankton in 14 sites ranged from 139 87 287 60 ind l 1 fig 4f specifically the abundances of cladocera rotifera and copepoda in 14 sampling sites showed relatively consistent tendency which was comparable with the changes in abundances of metazoan zooplankton community in november with no order of magnitude difference fig 4f in addition the ratios of metazoan zooplankton phytoplankton showed little different in various branches and were relatively stable compared with that in august fig 4g in addition the ratios of metazoan zooplankton phytoplankton except for cyanophyta were also comparable in the 14 sampling sites in november fig 4h furthermore the concentrations of most of the 29 pesticides including cpf and cyp were largely decreased and total concentrations of the pesticides detected were from 11 08 to 38 35 ng l fig 4h the summation of long term toxic units in the 14 sampling sites were from 0 01 to 0 12 suggesting that the pesticides detected in liangzi lake posed no threat to metazoan zooplankton in november fig 4i which was confirmed by the absence of significantly negative correlation between the density of metazoan zooplankton any taxa or species and the tus chronic table s16 taken together the data further supported the reliability of the identification of the key toxic pesticides and the inference that combined contamination of pesticides led to the abundance decline of metazoan zooplankton in the freshwater ecosystem surrounded by agricultural landscape 3 4 toxic confirmation of the identified pesticides in the controlled laboratory exposure experiments the long term effects of the pesticides identified above were evaluated by combined and single exposures for combined exposure experiment the pesticides with 1 tc in the site 7 were selected since the greatest tus chronic was obtained in this site for single pesticide exposure cyp and cpy were selected since their tu values were greater than 0 1 and were negatively correlated with the density of metazoan zooplankton the exposure concentrations used were comparable to the detected concentrations in site 7 of liangzi lake table s17 survival rates were unchanged during the whole exposure it was observed that exposure to the 1 fold concentrations of pesticide mixture mixchronic slightly but significantly decreased the body length of f0 d magna at 2 d fig 5 a while no significant effect was observed at 6 d exposure to smaller concentrations of pesticide mixture 1 10 concentration relative to the realistic concentration in liangzi lake did not change the body length of f0 d magna at 2 and 6 d a previous study had clarified that behavioral alteration was a direct indication of overall fitness of individuals and would further contribute to the fluctuation of population level glaholt et al 2016 in this study exposure to 1 fold concentration of cpf or cyp for 21 d significantly decreased moving distance of f0 whereas the combined exposure led to an insignificant decreasing trend fig 5b the possible reason was that in the combined exposure group the organisms used a strategy of adaptation by synthesizing the antioxidant and detoxification enzymes and further activated the avoidance mechanism of d magna bownik 2017 ferrario et al 2018 moreover the reproduction of d magna was inhibited by pesticides the time to first brood was increased after exposure to cyp or the mixture of the seven pesticides but it was not statistically significant indicating a probably degraded performance fig 5c the accumulated number of offspring was significantly decreased compared with control after exposure to 1 fold cyp or 1 fold mixture of the seven pesticides for 21 d while no effect on reproduction was observed due to cpf exposure fig 5d additionally the reproduction effects of pesticides were further examined by the evaluation of offspring quality including the growth and swimming behavior the body length of neonates f1 individuals was significantly decreased after exposure to 1 10 or 1 fold cyp at 0 d while the effect on body length disappeared as the exposure time was extended to 6 days fig 5e a similar decrease in body length was also observed in d magna exposed to sublethal concentrations of cyp in a recent study gottardi et al 2017 furthermore exposure to cpf or mix at 1 fold lake water concentration was proved to cause demotivation of f1 individuals in swimming behavior fig 5f thus the results supported our findings in liangzi lake that the contamination of pesticides caused abundance decline of metazoan zooplankton by affecting swimming behavior and reproduction overall this study provided an evidence that the contamination of pesticides might be responsible for the abundance decline of metazoan zooplankton in a natural lake ecosystem through the combination of field survey two stage laboratory exposure experiments and wide scope screening of pesticides furthermore chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin were identified as two key responsible pesticides in liangzi lake although the contamination of pesticides in lake ecosystems was decreased in recent years the concentrations of cyp and cpf were frequently reported to exceed the regulatory thresholds in fresh water ecosystems worldwide huang et al 2020 recent studies reported the relatively high positive rate of cpf in fresh water and the cpf concentrations were as high as 180 ng l in china hu et al 2015 79 ng l in the usa wang et al 2016 590 ng l in argentina alvarez et al 2019 396 ng l in spain rico et al 2020 9100 ng l in bangladesh sumon et al 2018 and 22400 ng l in kenya otieno et al 2013 and those reported concentrations were greater than the concentrations quantified in this study furthermore cyp is the most frequently detected pyrethroid in global fresh water stehle and schulz 2015 tang et al 2018 and the concentrations of cyp were as high as 50 ng l in china zhao 2015 57 ng l in spain feo et al 2010 3550 ng l in vietnam toan et al 2013 29400 ng l in mexico moreno villa et al 2012 and 80500 ng l in bangladesh which were much greater than the guideline value of 0 2 ng l for cyp in stagnant water systems hossain et al 2015 thus the residues of cpf and cyp might threaten the abundance of zooplankton in freshwater ecosystem globally given the great worldwide consumption of these pesticides and their great lethal toxicity to zooplankton stehle and schulz 2015 taken together our results specifically highlighted the adverse effects of pesticide contamination on zooplankton communities in freshwater ecosystems especially for those surrounded by agricultural landscapes and thus further regulations of production and consumption of toxic pesticides are encouraged 4 conclusion to the best of our knowledge this study provided an evidence that the contamination of pesticides might be responsible for the abundance decline of metazoan zooplankton in a natural freshwater ecosystem emphasizing the requirement of conventional monitoring and risk control of pesticides in freshwater ecosystems the combination of the field survey two stage laboratory toxicological exposure and wide scope screening of pesticides provided an effective strategy for the identification of high risk pesticides in freshwater ecosystems chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin were identified as two key responsible pesticides however these pesticides were not incorporated into the water quality criterion in china and thus current official monitoring strategies in china might underestimate the input of pesticides into freshwater ecosystems more researches should be performed to evaluate the combined effects of pesticides on population

15511,the contamination of pesticides has been recognized as a major stressor in fresh water ecosystems in terms of the losses of services and population declines and extinctions however information on the adverse effects of pesticides on zooplankton communities under natural field conditions are still lacking although zooplankton is quite sensitive to most of pesticides in laboratory studies in this study a natural lake ecosystem liangzi lake was used to determine the relationship between pesticide contamination and abundance decline of metazoan zooplankton in august 2020 the comprehensive trophic level indexes and the abundance of phytoplankton in the 14 sampling sites of liangzi lake were comparable but the abundance of metazoan zooplankton showed significant variations across two orders of magnitude these results suggested that other factors such as pesticide contamination might be responsible for the variations of metazoan zooplankton community furthermore the responsible pesticides were screened and totally 29 pesticides were obtained finally five pesticides were identified to provide more than 99 4 toxic contributions and chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin were two main causal agents these results were further supported by laboratory exposure experiments using d magna and field study in november 2020 where the concentrations of the 29 pesticides were strongly decreased and the abundance of metazoan zooplankton was comparable across the 14 sites of liangzi lake taken together this work provided an evidence that the contamination of pesticides might be responsible for the abundance decline of metazoan zooplankton in a natural freshwater ecosystem graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords zooplankton freshwater ecosystem pesticide abundance decline agricultural run off data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as one of the most bio diverse ecosystems freshwater ecosystems are critical to life on earth and provide numerous services for human communities worldwide cardinale 2012 deines et al 2017 however in the past years many freshwater ecosystems have been seriously threatened in terms of losses in ecosystem services and population declines and extinctions tickner et al 2020 yamamuro et al 2019 the contamination of pesticides is recognized as a major contributor of biodiversity loss and abundance decline of aquatic biota barmentlo et al 2021 rumschlag et al 2022 schulz 2004 schulz et al 2021 some pesticides have been frequently detected in global rivers and lakes with the concentrations ranging from ng l to μg l anderson et al 2018 brauns et al 2018 hull et al 2015 otalvaro and brigante 2018 these concentrations detected in freshwater ecosystems often exceed acute or chronic exposure risk thresholds for aquatic organisms and thus might lead to population level adverse effects especially for the groups that are physiologically similar to the target pest species beketov et al 2013 liess et al 2021 malaj et al 2014 wolfram et al 2021 testing pesticides for toxicity is straightforward but the evaluation of effects on the population or community level is an enormous challenge especially for the effect of complex mixtures that best reflect actual field conditions kohler and triebskorn 2013 rumschlag et al 2022 recently a study reports that neonicotinoid application to watersheds coincide with a decrease in average zooplankton biomass but the casual relationship has been not established yamamuro et al 2019 furthermore several studies have been performed to evaluate the connections between biodiversity and abundance of aquatic invertebrates and contamination of pesticides in wild freshwater ecosystems bighiu et al 2020 liess et al 2021 macaulay et al 2021 however zooplankton is not included in these studies although they are considered as one of the most sensitive groups to pesticides in freshwater ecosystems according to the results from laboratory exposure studies almeida et al 2020 hanazato 2001 to the best of our knowledge the ecotoxicological assessment of pesticides in zooplankton is often pesticide specific in controlled laboratory exposures or larger scale outdoor mesocosm studies hanazato 2001 rumschlag et al 2020 and the results demonstrate that environmentally relevant concentrations of pesticides can strongly affect zooplankton at individual and population levels for example several outdoor mesocosm experiments have been performed and the results demonstrate that exposure to pesticides change the composition and abundance of zooplankton community barmentlo et al 2021 brock et al 2000 morrissey et al 2015 moreover the application of pesticides decrease the abundance of zooplankton but a significant recovery of zooplankton community can be observed after 2 month of the final application of pesticides van wijngaarden et al 2005 however direct evidence under field conditions is presently lacking furthermore zooplankton in freshwater ecosystems are exposed to diverse array of pesticides or complex mixture and thus anthropogenic exposure in laboratory conditions is insufficient to fully understand and predict the impact of pesticides on zooplankton communities bernhardt et al 2017 to our knowledge no studies have been performed to report the response evaluations of a zooplankton community exposed to pesticides under unattended and wild field conditions lakes are sentinels for changes in global and local freshwater ecosystems and make ideal for investigating the adverse effects of pesticides on zooplankton which lack the ability to conquer water flow resistance yi et al 2011 liangzi lake is semi static shallow lake and surrounded by an active agricultural landscape it is estimated that this lake is frequently exposed to agriculture run off that includes pesticides ge et al 2021 therefore it is considered as an appropriate freshwater ecosystem model to study the impacts of pesticides on zooplankton community in this study the survey and sampling were performed in august and november 2020 and it was expected that the abundance of zooplankton would be strongly decreased in peak period of pesticide application august and the abundance would recovery in trough period of pesticide application november firstly the abundance of plankton community in 14 sampling sites of liangzi lake was characterized then the toxic pesticides in lake water extracts were identified by utilizing acute toxicity test of d magna as well as target and suspect screening of pesticides finally the relationships between the contamination of agricultural pesticides and the changes in abundance of metazoan zooplankton in liangzi lake were studied by correlation analysis and confirmed by laboratory exposure experiments this study represented a field based finding and thus provided an evidence that the contamination of pesticides might be responsible for the abundance decline of metazoan zooplankton in a freshwater ecosystem 2 materials and methods 2 1 liangzi lake description located in central china liangzi lake 30 01 30 20 n 114 20 114 43 e is the second largest lake in hubei province it covers an area of 304 3 km2 but has a catchment area of 3 620 km2 with a water volume of 1 27 109 m3 xu et al 2018 liangzi lake is a shallow freshwater lake mean depth ca 4 m and from april to july of each year it is wet season and from october to march of the next year it is dry season there are many branches in liangzi lake and water exchange between branches is slow due to the limitation of topography and landforms furthermore there are more than 30 rivers that flow into liangzi lake but there is only one outlet namely the modaoji river which discharges into the yangtze river via the changgang river the direction of water flow in this lake is from south to north and then from west to east as the farmland accounts for 50 of the total area surrounding liangzi lake this lake is inevitably received agricultural run off that includes pesticides ge et al 2021 therefore based on these unique characterizations liangzi lake was chosen to investigate the effects of pesticide mixtures on metazoan zooplankton communities in this study furthermore in order to better show and analyze the results liangzi lake was divided into three lake areas west liangzi lake central liangzi lake and east liangzi lake and the workflow which included field survey laboratory toxic tests and instrument analysis was shown in fig 1 2 2 plankton sampling and characterization to exclude the bottom up effects of phytoplankton on zooplankton both the phytoplankton and metazoan zooplankton resources were analyzed as summer is the season that multiple pesticides were frequently applied in the surrounding agricultural lands around liangzi lake the first sampling was conducted in august 2020 which was the end of the application period of most pesticides for crops and the concentrations of pesticides in liangzi lake were expected to be the greatest the second sampling was in november 2020 since it was hypothesized that in november the concentrations of pesticides in liangzi lake were decreased due to biological degradation and reduced usage of pesticides and the effects on zooplankton population would decrease or disappear compared with those in august a total of 14 sampling sites were selected along the water flow direction the detailed sampling locations were showed in fig 2 a and table s1 according to the regulations for the investigation of hydrobiological resources plankton resources were surveyed from 8 a m to 12 a m and each sampling site had three replicates the sampling and calculation method of plankton was based on a previous study and documented in supporting information li et al 2017 2 3 water collection and preparation lake water samples were collected from three water layers to prepare mixed water samples during sampling water depth wd and secchi depth sd were measured by sliding staff and secchi disk respectively the hq series portable meters hach loveland usa were used to measure water temperature dissolved oxygen do ph and electrical conductivity ec for each sampling site a total of 10 l mixed water was grabbed using a polymethyl methacrylate sampler and then transferred into a clean amber glass sample bottle after that the 14 water samples were pre treated within 24 h for subsequent toxicity testing and screening of suspect pesticides furthermore a total of 1 l mixed water sample from each site was used to detect physicochemical parameters including total phosphorus tp total nitrogen tn ammonium nitrogen nh4 n chlorophyll a chl a and chemical oxygen demand cod and analysis methods referred to the established standards in previous studies burns et al 2005 zhang et al 2013 in addition a total of 200 ml mixed water was collected from each sampling site and stored at 20 c for further quantification of target pesticides all samples were transported to our laboratory and processed immediately upon receipt the trophic state of liangzi lake was evaluated based on the method of comprehensive trophic level index tli bonvallot et al 2021 specific pretreatment methods for suspect and target analysis of pesticides were descripted in the supporting information 2 4 instrumental analysis for the screening of suspect pesticides an in house database containing over 2119 pesticides was used water extracts prepared using the 10 l lake water samples were injected directly into waters acquity uplc i class plus uhplc system coupled with waters xevotm g2 xs tof mass spectrometer qtof waters milford ma usa pesticides were separated on waters acquity uplc beh c18 column 2 1 mm 100 mm 1 7 μm particle size waters and the column was maintained at 40 c the gradient elution parameters were set in table s2 masslynx software waters corp milford usa was used for the acquisition of qtof system and the concrete parameters of mass and acquisition conditions were detailed in table s2 mass calibrations of the qtof instrument were conducted every second day by direct infusion of the calibration solution as recommended by waters the esi negative mode was excluded as the qtof acquisition and inventory comparison results from negative mode showed that all matching pesticides were included in positive mode the suspect screening details for pesticides in water extracts of liangzi lake were documented in the supporting information to validate the suspect pesticides screened by uhplc qtof table s3 and quantify the target pesticides in the water extracts and lake waters the concentrations of pesticides were determined by uhplc coupled to waters xevotm tq xs mass spectrometer ms ms milford ma usa sixty four pesticides were included in the target analysis firstly seventeen compounds were selected according to the screening results of qtof analysis secondly due to the analytical limitations of qtof forty seven insecticides were included additionally in the target analysis such as pyrethroid and organophosphorus insecticides since they had extensive usage but high ilod based on literature retrieval liess et al 2021 separation was performed on an acquity uplc beh c18 column 2 1 mm 50 mm 1 7 μm particle size waters with 40 c column temperature more details of the instrumental analysis were given in table s2 quantification was conducted by using the extracted ion chromatographic peak areas of the target pesticides and the isotope labeled internal standards the transitions used for quantitative analysis of the pesticides and the retention behaviors of all the target pesticides on the separation column by the uhplc ms ms method were documented in table s4 for most of the pesticides instrument limits of quantitation were in the range of 0 001 1 639 μg l the quality assurance and quality control data of target and suspect screening were detailed in the supporting information 2 5 toxicity testing protocols d magna has long been employed in toxicological studies because it is proved to be one of the most sensitive aquatic organisms to exogenous chemicals and represents the sentinel animal in the freshwater lakes hanazato 2001 in view of the variations in the abundances of metazoan zooplankton among the 14 sampling sites in this study d magna was used as a representative test organism of metazoan zooplankton to evaluate the toxic potency of the 14 water extracts the culturing of d magna was detailed in the supporting information the procedure of acute exposure basically followed oecd organization for economic co operation and development protocol novak et al 2018 briefly neonates 24 h old were randomly divided into 96 well plates with 300 μl solution in each well and exposed to each of the 14 water extracts or control condition 0 1 methanol for 48 h for each water extract two diluted concentrations 100 fold and 10 fold concentrations relative to original levels in liangzi lake in theory were used therefore they were called 100 fold or 10 fold water extracts there were 30 wells for each treatment control and each well contained one animal no food was provided during the 48 h acute exposure in addition in order to verify the results of the extract exposure above the acute toxicity of the identified pesticides by suspect and target analyses was evaluated single and combined exposures of pesticides were considered the details of selection strategies and exposure concentrations were documented in the supporting information to test the long term toxicity caused by the pesticides which were detected in lake water samples a 21 day chronic toxicity test was performed according to a previous study yuan et al 2018 briefly less than 24 h d magna neonates were exposed to single pesticide or a mixture of pesticides and the exposure concentrations were selected based on the results of the pesticide quantitation in lake water the selection strategies for single and combined exposure experiments were detailed in the supporting information three replicate glass beakers were included in each treatment and the mortality was recorded daily for f0 generation each beaker initially contained 200 ml exposure solution and 30 neonates after exposure for 2 d ten animals were randomly sampled from each beaker and they were used for behavioral assay and body length determination sequentially similarly after exposure for 6 d another ten animals were sampled from each beak and used for the measurement of body length at the end of the exposure the rest of the ten animals were sampled for behavioral assay after the evaluation of effect on reproduction the swimming behaviors were assessed using 96 well plates for 2 d animals and 24 well plates for 21 d animals for reproductive assay the time of the first brood was recorded and the number of offspring produced was counted every day to evaluate the effect on reproduction f1 generation neonates produced at 21 d of the exposure were collected and the same exposure procedure was continuously performed the growth of f1 were measured at 24 h 2 d and 6 d of the exposure and swimming behaviors were examined at 2 d in 96 well plate a solvent control was used and all the treatment groups received 0 02 methanol during the chronic exposure d magna were fed with the algae as described in the supporting information both acute and chronic exposure solutions were prepared using the authentic pesticide standards and the exposure concentrations used were confirmed by uhplc ms ms to ensure the actual exposure concentrations were consisted with the predetermined values in lake waters the measurement of biotic parameters was detailed in supporting information 2 6 relative toxic potency calculation to quantitatively identify the ecological risk and screen the pesticides with high toxicity the relative acute and chronic toxic potency were calculated based on the toxic unit tu approach the concentration addition method was more conservative and represented a good prediction in most environmental mixtures backhaus and faust 2012 therefore the sum of acute toxic units σtus acute was calculated according to the following formula carazo rojas et al 2018 and σtus acute 1 0 were considered to indicate toxicity to zooplankton t u s i t e i 1 n c i e c 50 i ci is the measured concentration of compound i in the extraction of a water sample and ec50i is the median effective concentration of the compound i the ec50 values of various pesticides of d magna in acute toxicity experiment were retrieved from the ecotox knowledgebase https cfpub epa gov ecotox and the pesticide property data base ppdb http sitem herts ac uk aeru ppdb en index htm moreover the sum of chronic toxic units σtus chronic was also calculated as t u s c h r o n i c i 1 n c i l o e c i ci is the measured concentration of compound i in natural water sample loeci is the lowest observed effect concentration value of compound i the long term loec values of various pesticides were also collected by querying ppdb and ecotox knowledgebase the ec50 and loec values of the identified pesticides were listed in table s5 furthermore the toxic contribution tc of each pesticide was calculated as follows t c i t u i σ t u 100 tui is the toxic unit of pesticide i and σtu is the sum of toxic units of the identified pesticides in a sampling site 2 7 data analysis kolmogorov smirnow test and levene s test were applied to test the normality of distribution and the homogeneity of data respectively statistically significant differences p 0 05 between the solvent control and extraction or pesticide exposure groups in acute and chronic tests were determined using onesample t test in order to identify the potential affiliations between the σtus of pesticides in lake water and the abundances of metazoan zooplankton a spearman rank correlation analysis was performed all analyses in this study were finished using ibm spss statics 19 0 spss chicago il 3 results and discussion 3 1 decline of the metazoan zooplankton community in liangzi lake water physicochemical parameters in the 14 sampling sites of liangzi lake in august were documented in table s6 and tli values ranged from 40 64 to 50 23 fig s1 indicating that the trophic states were similar among the 14 sampling sites therefore this lake was considered as a mesotrophic lake and the environment was suitable for the growth and reproduction of plankton the composition and density of phytoplankton communities were showed in fig s1 and the abundances of phytoplankton in the 14 sampling sites were in the same level with no magnitude difference a total of 77 species of metazoan zooplankton were observed across all the 14 samples in liangzi lake which were clustered into three taxa cladocera rotifera and copepoda among them rotifers copepods and cladocerans accounted for 72 23 19 48 and 7 79 of the total species respectively in august a total of 44 species of metazoan zooplankton were quantified in the 14 sampling sites and the numbers of species rotifers cladocerans and copepodas were 30 4 and 10 respectively fig s2 the abundances of metazoan zooplankton were ranged from 66 00 to 2702 67 ind l in the 14 sampling sites and thus revealed significant variations across two orders of magnitude with the order of central liangzi lake east liangzi lake west liangzi lake the species composition and density of metazoan zooplankton communities measured in august were showed in figs 2b and s2 generally the abundance of metazoan zooplankton was declined along the direction of water flow in liangzi lake fig 2b the abundances of cladocera rotifera and copepoda in 14 sampling sites showed relatively consistent tendency which was comparable with the changes in abundances of metazoan zooplankton community fig 2b the proportion of cladocera which was more sensitive to pesticides than other taxa of metazoan zooplankton was decreased by comparison with previous survey results of liangzi lake and the lakes located in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river in the same period estrada et al 2012 li et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 the trophic states were similar among the 14 sampling sites in liangzi lake and suitable for the growth and reproduction of plankton which was supported by the comparable densities of phytoplankton in the 14 sampling sites therefore the bottom up effects of phytoplankton on metazoan zooplankton might be not responsible for the abundance decline of metazoan zooplankton community in liangzi lake fig s1 a great zooplankton phytoplankton ratio is known to be a characteristic of a healthy ecosystem xu et al 2001 in this study the metazoan zooplankton phytoplankton ratios were clearly different in various branches of liangzi lake fig 2c which indicated that the health status of the ecosystem had gradually deteriorated along the direction of water flow in liangzi lake moreover due to the fact that cyanophyta in lakes are not suitable food for a large portion of zooplankton species the densities of phytoplankton except for cyanophyta were also used to calculate the metazoan zooplankton phytoplankton ratios in the 14 sampling sites of liangzi lake similarly the ratios were also significantly variable across two orders of magnitude in the 14 sampling sites fig 2d the health pressure was particularly serious in the central liangzi lake it was hypothesized that a pesticide contamination of liangzi lake was continuously converged along the water flow and thus induced combined toxic effects on metazoan zooplankton 3 2 identification of key toxic pesticides in water extracts an acute toxicity test of d magna was used to quickly determine the tentative toxicities of the 14 water extracts d magna cladocera was a suitable test organism since it was representative and sensitive enough to pesticide mediated effects it was found that the 100 fold water extracts from sampling sites 2 4 and 7 fig 2a induced severe immobilization 50 of d magna and exposure to each of the 100 fold water extracts from the sites 8 11 and 14 only caused slight immobilization effects fig 3 a and b no significant effects on immobilization were observed after exposure to each of the water extracts from the other eight sites the greatest toxicity of water extracts was observed at site 7 accompanied by the lowest abundance of metazoan zooplankton in liangzi lake the abundances of metazoan zooplankton at site 2 and site 4 were slightly greater than site 7 but were smaller than the upstream sampling sites overall the negative relationships between toxicity potency of water extracts and abundance of metazoan zooplankton in downstream of liangzi lake indicated that the toxic pesticides which had the capacity to induce decline of metazoan zooplankton community should be presented in the water extracts from sites 2 4 and 7 therefore these three extract samples were selected to further identify the key toxic pesticides the toxic pesticides in water extracts from sites 2 4 and 7 were tentatively identified by suspect screening of 2119 pesticides via four strategies and the details were documented in the supporting information suspect pesticides were first screened by using strategy i described as limiting the mass accuracy threshold to 5 ppm the isotope match intensity rms percentage less than 20 and the precursors of pesticides with at least two ms2 fragments intensity 200 and consistent with the silico fragmentations this resulted in 170 233 and 159 suspect pesticides in the water extracts from sites 2 4 and 7 respectively therefore a total of 268 suspects were recognized in the three toxic extracts for further evaluation by strategy ii which was that by the evaluation of the mass spectra information ionization polarity precursors and ms2 spectra based on the mass spectral library 41 pesticides were filtered for further identification and then 32 suspects were identified by applying the strategy iii which was to match the characteristics of chromatography afterwards according to strategy iv the pesticides that were very toxic to aquatic life according to the ghs globally harmonized system classification were retained lastly 23 suspect pesticides were retained by the four strategies in the 3 toxic extracts and they were further confirmed by comparison with the corresponding reference pesticide standards among all the identified candidate pesticides six were recognized as interferents and thus they were excluded in further analysis therefore 17 pesticides were eventually confirmed with authentic reference pesticide standards in the three toxic water extracts and they were listed in table s4 in order to further determine the key toxic pesticides that caused the acute toxicity to d magna the concentrations of target n 47 the selection details were described in 2 4 section and the confirmed suspect pesticides n 17 were measured using uhplc ms ms in the three toxic extracts and 29 pesticides were detected furthermore the concentrations of the 29 pesticides were determined in the extracts of the 14 sampling sites and corrected using matrix effects to obtain the final quantitative results table s7 the sum concentrations of the 29 pesticides in 100 fold water extracts from the 14 sampling sites ranged from 5 24 to 10 99 μg l of which 51 7 were insecticides 20 7 were herbicides and 27 6 were fungicides table s8 the calculated tus acute based on the concentrations of pesticides in 100 fold water extracts were employed for the toxicity comparison fig 3c and table s9 the results showed clear differences in tus acute at various sampling sites with the highest tus acute at site 7 and followed by site 4 and 2 furthermore the tus acute values were negatively correlated with the abundances of metazoan zooplankton fig 3d the tus acute results of water extracts were in accordance with the results of acute toxicity of d magna which proved that the key toxic pesticides to d magna should be included in the 29 pesticides screened furthermore the tus acute were mainly driven by few pesticides and three to four insecticides contributed more than 90 of the tus acute in the three toxic extracts fig 3c and table s10 in order to further confirm the key toxic pesticides in the three extracts an acute exposure testing was performed using d magna two exposure approaches of pesticides including combined exposure of chemicals and single chemical exposure were used and a total of 8 exposure groups were set up for combined exposure experiment the pesticides with 1 tc in the three toxic extracts were included the specific species and concentrations of pesticides were detailed in table s11 for single pesticide exposure experiment chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin were selected since their concentrations were the greatest in one of the three toxic extracts compared with the other extracts and they had great contributions in the tus acute of the three toxic extracts after exposure to mix2 mix4 or mix7 the survival rates were decreased to 69 2 73 1 and 46 2 respectively which were comparable with the results of tus acute after exposure to chlorpyrifos cpf for 48 h at the concentrations relative to the levels in 100 fold water extracts of site 2 and 7 the survival rates of d magna were significantly decreased fig 3e no significant effect on survival rate was observed after cypermethrin cyp exposure these results suggested that cpf was a dominant toxic contributor furthermore mix7 induced an over 50 of immobilization to d magna and a similar immobilization effect was also found in acute exposure of the water extract from site 7 a previous study reported that ec50 and noec of cpf exposure to d magna for 48 h was 1 μg l and 0 5 μg l respectively gaizick et al 2001 which was consistent with the findings in this study where exposure to 100 fold water extract of site 7 decreased survival rate of d magna but no effect was observed after exposure to 10 fold water extract similarly this also could explain that why the acute toxicities of d magna were only observed at the sites 2 4 and 7 since the concentrations of cpf in the three sites were slight greater than those in the other sites therefore these results suggested that cpf had a narrow toxic range however there was still approximate 30 of the acute toxicity that could not be explained by the identified pesticides which might be contributed by the transformation products of pesticides or other chemicals 3 3 driver pesticides of abundance decline of metazoan zooplankton in liangzi lake to accurately determine the causal pesticides that induced the abundance decline of metazoan zooplankton in liangzi lake the measurement of concentrations of the identified 29 pesticides in lake water was necessary the recoveries of 28 pesticides were above 70 table s7 the sum concentration ranges of pesticides in the 14 sampling sites were from 74 4 to 153 8 ng l and the number of pesticides found was consistent with the results of the pesticides identified in water extracts fig 4 a and table s12 the quantitation results showed that total concentrations of pesticides in east liangzi lake were generally greater than that in west liangzi lake and the sampling site with the greatest sum concentration of pesticides was site 7 which was supported by both field survey and laboratory acute exposure result in terms of toxic pressure for pesticides the tus chronic in the 14 sampling sites for d magna was spanned from 0 1 to 9 9 in august fig 4b and table s13 and the greatest tus chronic was observed at site 7 followed by site 2 and 4 meanwhile the tus chronic for algae were ranged of 0 01 0 04 indicating that the contamination of pesticides in august had no potentials to affect phytoplankton communities in liangzi lake fig s3 the tus chronic values in the 14 sampling sites were negatively correlated with the densities of metazoan zooplankton in liangzi lake fig 4c importantly the tus chronic of 7 sampling sites were greater than 1 0 which disclosed that the contamination of pesticides had capacity to induce toxic effects on metazoan zooplankton fig 3d and table s13 in addition the correlation analyses between the densities of the three taxa and tus chronic values were performed and a significant correlation between the densities of copepodas and the tus chronic values of the 29 pesticides in the 14 sampling sites was observed table s14 moreover the densities of 5 species were negatively correlated with the tus chronic values in the 14 sampling sites table s14 including 3 species of rotiferas lecane bulla trichocerca tenuior and keratella valga 1 cladocera diaphanosoma leuchtenbergianum and 1 copepodas nauplii thus the results suggested that these 5 species might be the sensitive species to the contamination of pesticides at 14 sampling sites of linagzi lake in august furthermore the pesticides with tc 1 in any of the 7 sampling sites were screened and they were cyp per and cpf as well as the abamectin and dichlorvos fig 4d the five pesticides provided more than 99 4 tcs in the 7 toxic sites table s15 and the tus chronic of these pesticides was also negatively correlated with the density of metazoan zooplankton fig s4 indicating that these pesticides might be the causal agents which drove abundance decline of metazoan zooplankton in liangzi lake in terms of combined effects of pesticides although the detected frequency of cyp was only 43 the results of tus chronic revealed the high toxicity proportion in toxic sites and showed non acceptable risk in the lake a further comparison showed that the species of these toxic pesticides at each site in liangzi lake were different which corroborated the possibility of heterogeneity in pesticide contamination proposed above moreover in terms of single effect of one pesticide the correlation between tu value of each pesticide and the density of metazoan zooplankton in liangzi lake was evaluated it was found that the tu values of seven pesticides were negatively correlated with the density of metazoan zooplankton fig 4e and cyp and cpf were two main toxic pesticides tus 0 1 hence the negative relationship of tus of pesticides and the abundance decline of zooplankton supported the hypothesis that pesticides e g cyp and cpf were the key toxic substances and their contamination led to the abundance decline of metazoan zooplankton in liangzi lake recently cpf was proposed to be included in the stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants while there was no water quality criterion for cpf in china the concentrations of cpf in some sampling sites in the present study were greater than the wqc established by other countries or regions hu et al 2015 pyrethroid pesticides were widely used in both rural and urban areas worldwide and very toxic to aquatic organisms and cyp is the most frequently reported pyrethroid pesticide in the global environment water tang et al 2018 therefore these results suggested that the findings in this study might occur globally to verify the reliability of identification of the key toxic pesticide the density of metazoan zooplankton and the concentrations of the 29 pesticides in lake waters of the 14 sampling sites were determined in november 2020 as the inputs of pesticides were hypothesized to be largely decreased or stopped during autumn period and the effects of pesticides on the density of metazoan zooplankton would be decreased or not observed in november a total of 51 species of metazoan zooplankton were quantified in the 14 sampling sites and the numbers of species rotifers cladocerans and copepodas were 31 5 and 15 respectively fig s2 the results demonstrated that the densities of metazoan zooplankton in 14 sites ranged from 139 87 287 60 ind l 1 fig 4f specifically the abundances of cladocera rotifera and copepoda in 14 sampling sites showed relatively consistent tendency which was comparable with the changes in abundances of metazoan zooplankton community in november with no order of magnitude difference fig 4f in addition the ratios of metazoan zooplankton phytoplankton showed little different in various branches and were relatively stable compared with that in august fig 4g in addition the ratios of metazoan zooplankton phytoplankton except for cyanophyta were also comparable in the 14 sampling sites in november fig 4h furthermore the concentrations of most of the 29 pesticides including cpf and cyp were largely decreased and total concentrations of the pesticides detected were from 11 08 to 38 35 ng l fig 4h the summation of long term toxic units in the 14 sampling sites were from 0 01 to 0 12 suggesting that the pesticides detected in liangzi lake posed no threat to metazoan zooplankton in november fig 4i which was confirmed by the absence of significantly negative correlation between the density of metazoan zooplankton any taxa or species and the tus chronic table s16 taken together the data further supported the reliability of the identification of the key toxic pesticides and the inference that combined contamination of pesticides led to the abundance decline of metazoan zooplankton in the freshwater ecosystem surrounded by agricultural landscape 3 4 toxic confirmation of the identified pesticides in the controlled laboratory exposure experiments the long term effects of the pesticides identified above were evaluated by combined and single exposures for combined exposure experiment the pesticides with 1 tc in the site 7 were selected since the greatest tus chronic was obtained in this site for single pesticide exposure cyp and cpy were selected since their tu values were greater than 0 1 and were negatively correlated with the density of metazoan zooplankton the exposure concentrations used were comparable to the detected concentrations in site 7 of liangzi lake table s17 survival rates were unchanged during the whole exposure it was observed that exposure to the 1 fold concentrations of pesticide mixture mixchronic slightly but significantly decreased the body length of f0 d magna at 2 d fig 5 a while no significant effect was observed at 6 d exposure to smaller concentrations of pesticide mixture 1 10 concentration relative to the realistic concentration in liangzi lake did not change the body length of f0 d magna at 2 and 6 d a previous study had clarified that behavioral alteration was a direct indication of overall fitness of individuals and would further contribute to the fluctuation of population level glaholt et al 2016 in this study exposure to 1 fold concentration of cpf or cyp for 21 d significantly decreased moving distance of f0 whereas the combined exposure led to an insignificant decreasing trend fig 5b the possible reason was that in the combined exposure group the organisms used a strategy of adaptation by synthesizing the antioxidant and detoxification enzymes and further activated the avoidance mechanism of d magna bownik 2017 ferrario et al 2018 moreover the reproduction of d magna was inhibited by pesticides the time to first brood was increased after exposure to cyp or the mixture of the seven pesticides but it was not statistically significant indicating a probably degraded performance fig 5c the accumulated number of offspring was significantly decreased compared with control after exposure to 1 fold cyp or 1 fold mixture of the seven pesticides for 21 d while no effect on reproduction was observed due to cpf exposure fig 5d additionally the reproduction effects of pesticides were further examined by the evaluation of offspring quality including the growth and swimming behavior the body length of neonates f1 individuals was significantly decreased after exposure to 1 10 or 1 fold cyp at 0 d while the effect on body length disappeared as the exposure time was extended to 6 days fig 5e a similar decrease in body length was also observed in d magna exposed to sublethal concentrations of cyp in a recent study gottardi et al 2017 furthermore exposure to cpf or mix at 1 fold lake water concentration was proved to cause demotivation of f1 individuals in swimming behavior fig 5f thus the results supported our findings in liangzi lake that the contamination of pesticides caused abundance decline of metazoan zooplankton by affecting swimming behavior and reproduction overall this study provided an evidence that the contamination of pesticides might be responsible for the abundance decline of metazoan zooplankton in a natural lake ecosystem through the combination of field survey two stage laboratory exposure experiments and wide scope screening of pesticides furthermore chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin were identified as two key responsible pesticides in liangzi lake although the contamination of pesticides in lake ecosystems was decreased in recent years the concentrations of cyp and cpf were frequently reported to exceed the regulatory thresholds in fresh water ecosystems worldwide huang et al 2020 recent studies reported the relatively high positive rate of cpf in fresh water and the cpf concentrations were as high as 180 ng l in china hu et al 2015 79 ng l in the usa wang et al 2016 590 ng l in argentina alvarez et al 2019 396 ng l in spain rico et al 2020 9100 ng l in bangladesh sumon et al 2018 and 22400 ng l in kenya otieno et al 2013 and those reported concentrations were greater than the concentrations quantified in this study furthermore cyp is the most frequently detected pyrethroid in global fresh water stehle and schulz 2015 tang et al 2018 and the concentrations of cyp were as high as 50 ng l in china zhao 2015 57 ng l in spain feo et al 2010 3550 ng l in vietnam toan et al 2013 29400 ng l in mexico moreno villa et al 2012 and 80500 ng l in bangladesh which were much greater than the guideline value of 0 2 ng l for cyp in stagnant water systems hossain et al 2015 thus the residues of cpf and cyp might threaten the abundance of zooplankton in freshwater ecosystem globally given the great worldwide consumption of these pesticides and their great lethal toxicity to zooplankton stehle and schulz 2015 taken together our results specifically highlighted the adverse effects of pesticide contamination on zooplankton communities in freshwater ecosystems especially for those surrounded by agricultural landscapes and thus further regulations of production and consumption of toxic pesticides are encouraged 4 conclusion to the best of our knowledge this study provided an evidence that the contamination of pesticides might be responsible for the abundance decline of metazoan zooplankton in a natural freshwater ecosystem emphasizing the requirement of conventional monitoring and risk control of pesticides in freshwater ecosystems the combination of the field survey two stage laboratory toxicological exposure and wide scope screening of pesticides provided an effective strategy for the identification of high risk pesticides in freshwater ecosystems chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin were identified as two key responsible pesticides however these pesticides were not incorporated into the water quality criterion in china and thus current official monitoring strategies in china might underestimate the input of pesticides into freshwater ecosystems more researches should be performed to evaluate the combined effects of pesticides on population

15512,plutonium pu in the subsurface environment can transport in different oxidation states as an aqueous solute or as colloidal particles the transport behavior of pu is affected by the relative abundances of these species and can be difficult to predict when they simultaneously exist this study investigates the concurrent transport of pu intrinsic colloids pu iv aq and pu v vi aq through a combination of controlled experiments and semi analytical dual porosity transport modeling pu transport experiments were conducted in a fractured granite at high and low flow rates to elucidate sorption processes and their scaling behavior in the experiments pu iv aq was the least mobile of the pu species pu v vi aq had intermediate mobility and the colloidal pu which consisted mainly of precipitated and or hydrolyzed pu iv was the most mobile the semi analytical modeling revealed that the sorption of each pu species was rate limited as the sorption could not be described by assuming local equilibrium in the experiments the model was able to describe the sorption of the different pu species that occurring either on fracture surfaces in the pores of the rock matrix or simultaneously in both locations while equally good fits to the data could be achieved using any of these assumptions a fracture dominated process was considered to be the most plausible because it provided the most reasonable estimates of sorption rate constants importantly a key result of this work is that the sorption rate constant of all pu species tends to decrease with increasing time scales which implies that pu will tend to be more mobile at longer time scales than observations at shorter time scales suggest this result has important implications for predicting the environmental impacts of pu in the safety assessments of geologic repositories for radioactive waste disposal and we explore potential mechanistic bases for upscaling the sorption rate constants to time and distance scales that cannot be practically evaluated in experiments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reactive transport sorption mechanism fractured rock pu species upscaling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as more countries pursue plans for geologic disposal of accumulated high level nuclear waste quantifying the fate and transport of radionuclides in complex fractured rocks has become an important issue especially for repositories located within crystalline rocks faybishenko and swift 2016 wang et al 2018 among the radionuclides plutonium pu is of great concern because of its radiological impacts on health and its complicated geochemistry in the subsurface environment begg et al 2015 smith and amonette 2006 wolfsberg et al 2017 early studies recognized pu as a strongly sorbing dissolved solute with limited mobility due to its high affinity for solids and low solubility romanchuk et al 2016 later field observations at the nevada test site us and the mayak production association russia showed that pu transport is greatly enhanced with naturally occurring submicrometer particles i e colloids kersting et al 1999 novikov et al 2006 zhao et al 2020 pu was also discovered to migrate long distances at the savannah river site and the us doe hanford site as an oxidized species with small retardation dai et al 2005 2002 these diverse observations at different field sites demonstrate that the transport of pu is highly influenced by its chemical nature gerber et al 2020 our understanding of how pu migrates in subsurface environments is far from complete in modeling practice treating mobile pu as a single soluble species often delivers unsatisfactory results with significant uncertainties glynn 2002 as illustrated by zavarin et al 2005 simulated pu concentrations were in poor agreement with observations and lacked the appropriate mechanisms to adequately model the transport behavior of pu if pu transport is colloid facilitated improvements are offered by regarding the colloidal pu as a fraction of the total pu in solution as at the nevada site dai et al 2012 while ignoring the potential migration of non colloidal pu however the potential for colloid facilitated transport in groundwater may still be poorly estimated especially over long distances marty et al 1997 there have been very few studies examining the transport of pu in fractured rock when colloidal and aqueous pu exist together accurate modeling of bulk pu transport behavior requires understanding the transport behavior of various pu species in solution individually the most significant geochemical process limiting radionuclide transport in groundwater is sorption li and kaplan 2012 zhang et al 2016 which in this paper is taken to include many potential physical or chemical processes including ion exchange surface complexation precipitation and in the case of colloids physical and chemical filtration dai et al 2009 hakoun et al 2019 shahkarami et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 in part because of the diversity of hydrogeological conditions in widely varying settings the sorption processes determining the reactive transport of many radionuclides remain poorly understood zhang et al 2022 which is limiting our ability to produce useful predictions with mathematical and numerical models a detailed description of the sorption processes in fractures and or the surrounding matrix that control pu transport in fractured rocks is needed to improve model accuracy and reduce model uncertainty descriptions of the important processes could then be coupled into reactive transport models with appropriate parameter upscaling to produce acceptable results over a wide range of scales reimus and zavarin 2017 zhang et al 2021 utilizing the transport model the retardation caused by the complicated interactions mentioned above can be described with empirical parameters that are estimated from model fits to experimental data such as rate constants in a kinetic model or partition coefficients or retardation factors in an equilibrium model neretnieks 1990 samper et al 2008 it is desirable in models to describe sorption processes using a simple approach with as few parameters as necessary to effectively capture the expected behavior in the system of interest more complicated chemical mathematical models while sometimes offering advantages of having more robust mechanistic underpinnings that allow predictions over a wider range of potential hydrogeochemical conditions typically require longer computing times and have greater parameter uncertainty because of a larger number of parameters černý 2019 a relatively simple dual porosity transport model that can be readily incorporated into a risk assessment model in a computationally efficient manner would be useful for describing radionuclide transport in the fractured rock where flowing water in fractures is in diffusive communication with immobile water in a surrounding matrix neumann et al 2021 experimentally it is important to investigate reactive transport behavior under extremely slow groundwater flow conditions that mimic hydrogeologic conditions in most field systems conroy 2017 the aim of this paper is to investigate the reactive transport behaviors of different co existing pu species in fractured rock with experiments and semi analytical dual porosity transport modeling we investigate the effect of flow rate on pu transport with high flow and low flow rate experiments meanwhile we use the model to determine whether pu sorption is better described as a kinetic or equilibrium process and also to try to distinguish between sorption occurring predominantly in fractures the surrounding rock matrix or both domains additionally upscaling relationships of sorption parameters are inferred from the experiments and modeling with discussion of potential mechanistic bases for these relationships this is important for the long term predictive modeling of pu transport in field settings with much longer time and distance scales than can be investigated in practical experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 granite properties and fracture generation the granite core in the transport experiment was collected from the northwest area of china the rock sample is 10 cm in length and 5 cm in diameter an artificial fracture in the middle along the axial direction of the cylindrical core is created by the brazilian splitting technique singh et al 2015 the measured fracture half aperture is 0 125 mm quantitative x ray diffraction mineralogy shows that it contains 31 7 quartz 26 4 microcline 30 4 albite 7 2 biotite and 4 3 chlorite in mass percentage the examined minerals exposed on the fracture surface especially the clay minerals have adsorption capacity to produce effective fracture retardation the matrix porosity of the core is set as 0 5 as estimated by difference in saturated and dry 80 c oven for 24 h weights of a sample of known volume this porosity compares favorably with granites of similar composition measured by the saturation method keeney et al 1985 bulk density and grain density values were determined simultaneously 2 2 distribution of pu species an important assumption in this study is that the different pu species transport independently without interaction which allows us to take advantage of sequential measurements of pu colloid pu col pu iv aq and pu v vi aq in aqueous samples to deduce the transport behavior of each species this assumption is justified by the short time scales of the experiments relative to the time scales over which transformations and interactions take place at neutral ph region li and kaplan 2012 zang et al 2020 2016 pu vi aq is reduced very fast to pu v aq and pu v aq is the dominant dissolved aqueous species under oxic conditions zhao et al 2020 thus the two forms are lumped together as pu v vi aq in the experiments pu iii aq exists in the reduced environment and is barely detected under laboratory conditions pu iv aq is more insoluble than pu v vi aq and hence it is considered an independent species in the experiments it should be noted that the conversion between pu iv aq and pu v vi aq involve the break or formation of pu o bonds and takes place over time scales of tens of days neck et al 2007 the half time of pu v aq disproportionation is about 0 16 years 58 4d kersting et al 2003 most of the pu iv in our experiments was present as pu iv intrinsic colloids which are formed either by precipitation when the pu iv aq concentration exceeds its solubility as it did initially in our experiment see section 2 3 or through the hydrolytic process to form puo2 nanoparticles cleveland and mullin 1993 puo2 colloids are not easy to dissolve and their lifetime is on the order of 1 9 years in the natural water used in this study zhao et al 2020 these processes are all quite slow compared to the timescale of the experiments conducted here the pu iv aq pu v vi aq and pu col are treated as separate tracers in the experiments with different initial concentrations a step wise approach was adopted to quantify different pu species in the effluent solutions with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms method adapted from nitsche et al 1988 a flowchart was shown in fig s1 in the supplementary materials with the designed method the total pu the colloidal pu pu iv aq pu v vi aq were separated and measured accordingly 2 3 solution preparation natural groundwater was used as the background solution in all the experiments the groundwater was slightly alkaline with a ph value of 8 2 the total dissolved solids concentration was 2 23 g l the major cations in the groundwater were k na ca2 mg2 with concentrations of 8 78 707 45 101 74 and 41 02 mg l the major anions consisted of f hco3 cl so4 2 no3 with concentrations of 0 84 150 452 858 and 9 1 mg l prior to use in the experiments the groundwater was filtered with a 0 45 μm membrane filter to ensure there were no natural colloids present in the solutions aliquots of the 0 45 μm filtered water were further filtered using 10 kd ultrafiltration tubes 1 5 nm pore size to determine the mass and composition of colloids less than 0 45 μm in size in the solution as shown in table s1 si the results suggest that the 0 45 μm filtered water used in the experiments was essentially free of colloids containing mn fe and al with a small amount of sio2 colloids 1 5 mg l the approximate composition of the filtered natural colloids can be deduced from analyses of the water before and after filtration the stock solutions of pu iv were added to 0 45μm filtered groundwater to achieve an initial target concentration of 2390 pg ml 10 nmol l which was greater than the solubility of plutonium at room temperature 5 01 nmol l neck et al 2007 the chemical form of the stock pu iv solution is pu iv no3 4 1 μg g 0 5 mol l hno3 the atom ratios of the 239pu stock solution were 240pu 239pu 0 0346 241pu 239pu 0 000355 and 242pu 239pu 0 0000323 it can be seen that extremely trivial 241pu and 242pu exist and the dominated pu isotope is 239pu with limited 240pu the tritium in the form of tritiated water was added as a conservative tracer with a concentration of 0 19 pmol l 204 bq l tritium was quantified in samples collected from the fracture outlet using lsc since the dominant isotope 239pu has significantly different energy emitting properties from tritium the two elements are located at varied regions in the counting spectrum golashvili et al 2006 hence the pu in the solution barely interferes with the tritium measurement the detailed information is described in section 1 of the si with detection limit calculation the solution ph was readjusted to equal to that of the groundwater by adding naoh solution we note here that the apparent presence of sio2 colloids in the filtered groundwater could have resulted in some of the pu iv and or pu v vi being transported while sorbed to these colloids kersting et al 1999 soderholm et al 2008 the detailed form of colloidal pu in this study could not be distinguished as we used physical filtration to separate colloids powell et al 2008 reported sorption of both pu iv and pu v to silica surfaces at near neutral phs and the lack of formation of pu v colloids in our spiking experiments as described in section 4 of the si suggested that 1 silica colloids played a minor role in sorbing either pu v or pu iv and 2 almost all the pu iv colloids observed in our experiments were pu iv intrinsic colloids further recent studies indicated other forms of pu colloid maybe enrolled in specified environment such as the intermittent pu v solid phase has been reported under alkaline conditions by kvashnina et al 2019 at a neutral condition in our experiment it is unlikely to form the pu v solid phase as its corresponding ph was approach to 11 thus colloidal pu or pu col was assumed to consist of a combination of dominated intrinsic polymeric pu iv colloids with limited pu that was sorbed to natural sio2 colloids in this study two solutions were used in the transport experiments by allowing different static equilibration times after adding pu iv 7 days and 11 days the 7 day solution was used for the high flow rate experiment and the 11 day solution was used for the low flow rate experiment the total pu concentrations and distributions of the different species were analyzed at the times the transport experiments started and served as initial concentrations for the experiments 2 4 column transport experiments the pu transport experiments were conducted in the prepared fractured rock core as shown in fig 1 to test the impact of flow rate on pu sorption two experiments with significantly different flow rates were conducted in the high flow rate experiment the flow rate was controlled at 1 92 ml h the low flow rate was intended to more closely approximate expected hydrologic conditions in fractured rock at the proposed repository site in beishan china in the field especially in potential hlw repositories which are preferably sited in intact rock the stochastically distributed fractures are often tiny with extremely slow groundwater flow velocities previous studies reported an average outflow velocity of about 10 10 10 6 m s in the hard rock laboratory at äspö sweden kröhn 2017 with an average darcy velocity ranging from 2 8 10 13 to 3 5 10 11 m s abarca et al 2019 at the proposed repository site in beishan china the estimated flow velocity was about 10 9 m s in the far field ling 2018 wang et al 2018 in order to simulate the migration of plutonium at a very low velocity a low speed peristaltic pump was used to slowly inject groundwater at an average flow rate of 0 157 ml h which corresponded to an equivalent linear velocity of 3 5 10 6 m s the detailed experimental configuration and experimental steps are described in the si section 6 importantly the volume of the flow system includes the fluororesin tubing and flow manifolds on either end of the fracture which together exceed the fracture volume so it was necessary to account for this dead volume in the interpretations of the experiments to test the effect of the tubing on pu sorption the total pu concentrations in a polypropylene bottle at different times were measured as reference and shown in table s2 si it can be deduced that for the high rate flow experiment where the residence time in the tubing was about 1 32 h the effect on sorption should have been negligible 1 or less of the injection concentration for the low flow rate the residence time in the tubing was about 16 11 h and the reduction in pu concentration due to sorption should have been about 3 of the injection concentration based on the first order decay rate deduced from the results of table s2 si prior to each new experiment the apparatus was first flushed with 50 ml 2 hno3 to remove the residual pu from previous experiment then 200 ml ultrapure water was flushed to eliminate the residual acid finally 50 ml groundwater was pumped through the core at the experiment flow rate to achieve water rock interface equilibrium to evaluate the effectiveness of the flushing treatment the 50 ml of 2 hno3 was subjected to liquid scintillation counting lsc after the first experiment the first 20 ml of hno3 contained about 90 of the residual pu from the preceding experiment and in the second 20 ml hno3 the counts of pu dropped below the lsc detection limit these results indicated that the flushing method was effective in removing pu and therefore minimizing pu carryover between experiments furthermore a breakthrough curve btc of only tritium without pu at a flow rate of 1 9 ml h was obtained the two btcs are shown in fig s3 si and their excellent agreement suggests that the fracture volume and the flow pathways through the fracture were not altered by the flushing procedure 2 6 dual porosity transport model the dual porosity conceptual model developed by tang et al 1981 which takes into account advection dispersion diffusion and adsorption was adopted to simulate the fracture transport experiments in this model the groundwater flows primarily through the naturally open fracture pathways and the matrix porewater is considered immobile but is connected to the fracture flow pathways by diffusion sudicky and frind 1982 reimus and haga 1999 derived a semi analytical solution for the model by assuming 1 d transport in fractures of constant aperture no concentration gradients across the fracture aperture a steady flow rate in the fractures and diffusive exchange with the surrounding rock matrix in a direction perpendicular to fracture flow reimus et al 2003 while this model involves many simplifying assumptions the assumptions are consistent with the experimental design and perhaps more importantly the model is well suited for our goals of distinguishing between different types of sorption processes and exploring upscaling relationships of the processes and the parameters describing these processes for kinetic sorption the solute concentrations in the fracture and matrix are separately described by the following equations with variables explained in table 1 reimus and haga 1999 fractures solution phase 1 c f t v f c f x d f 2

factors can still be defined as r f 1 k f f ρ f k f r η and r m 1 k f m ρ m k m r ϕ in eq 1 the parameters η ϕ and b were measured for the experimental fracture system the radionuclide diffusion coefficients in water were assigned based on previous studies the laplace transforms of eqs 1 and 2 were solved simultaneously and the solutions were inverted back to the time domain using the relap reactive transport laplace transform inversion code the parameter estimation software pest was used to automatically adjust input parameters to relap to achieve best fits to the experimental data doherty 2015 model parameters were estimated for a given experiment using the tritium and pu breakthrough data in a stepwise fashion first the tritium breakthrough data were fitted by assuming rm rf 1 as a nonreactive tracer and then adjusting only two parameters to match the data the mean fluid residence time in the fracture τ l v hr where l is the fracture length and peclet number pe l α where α is the dispersivity given by α df v once τ and pe were estimated they were assumed to apply to pu in the same experiment leaving only sorption parameters retardation factors and kinetic rate constants to be adjusted to match the pu data sensitivity analysis and uncertainty were quantified for predominant parameters in the model with the approach and results presented in the section 8 of si if equilibrium sorption is assumed rf and or rm are the only model parameters adjusted to fit the pu data in the more general case of kinetic sorption where the sorption and desorption rate constants are not sufficiently fast for local equilibrium to be satisfied both the retardation factors and sorption rate constants are adjusted to match the data note that in this case although retardation factors are specified as input parameters they are used to calculate desorption rate constants which are actually used in the model instead of retardation factors the desorption rate constants are calculated from a rearrangement of the expression s immediately preceding table 1 k r k f ρ x r 1 x where kr kf and r can apply to either the fracture or the matrix and ρ x and x are the bulk density and porosity respectively in either the fracture or matrix 3 results 3 1 the pu species and migration for solutions a and b prepared with pu iv the original solution contained 96 9 pu iv aq and 3 1 pu v vi aq the aqueous pu iv readily hydrolyzes and forms stable amorphous oxyhydroxides polymeric species i e pu intrinsic colloid romanchuk et al 2016 pu v aq often forms puo2 in water romanchuk et al 2016 after the prepared pu iv solution sat for 2 h 16 0 of the total pu was formed as colloid 1 5 nm and the other 84 0 was soluble pu after 7 days the percentage of colloid increased to 32 3 and the other 67 7 was soluble pu for the aqueous pu 77 0 was pu iv aq and 23 0 was pu v vi aq in other words pu iv aq and pu v vi aq occupied 52 13 and 15 57 of the total pu respectively after 11 days the percentage of colloid was stabilized at around 31 6 meanwhile the proportions of pu iv aq and pu v vi aq changed to 65 2 and 34 8 respectively all redox states were present in the injected solutions and accounted for the total pu effluent observed in the experiments breakthrough curves of tritium and pu observed in the transport experiments high flow and low flow rate transport experiments are presented in fig 2 the breakthrough curves of tritium in the high flow experiment appear to reach a greater mass recovery rate 94 88 than that in the low flow experiment 81 35 but with similar maximum relative concentrations 0 85 each of the pu species investigated demonstrates different sorption trends over time fig 2c 2d the results indicate that pu can migrate either as solutes or colloids in fractures compared to the btc of tritium the colloid facilitated transport is characterized by arrival times as early as the non reacting solute in the high flow rate experiment the peak concentrations are reached after about 4 4 and 3 0 h for tritium and pu col respectively the situation is similar for the low flow case with peak times at about 42 and 35 h respectively the maximum concentrations are much lower for pu iv aq and pu v vi aq than for pu col as demonstrated in the figure pu col contributes the majority of total pu the pu colloids accounted for over 70 and 90 of the total pu transport in the fracture at the high and low flow rates respectively compared to a 10 drop of recovery for tritium from high flow to low flow the 4 77 recovery of total pu in the low flow experiment is about half that in the high flow experiment 10 03 the results reveal that flow velocity has a significant impact on pu transport a longer residence time allows the sorbing species to more fully contact the rock fracture walls and further diffuse into the rock matrix the flow rates of the two experiments were 1 92 ml h and 0 127 ml h which are over ten times different indicating that the recovery and flow rate are correlated but not directly proportional meanwhile the breakthrough curves of both the total and pu col concentrations were close particularly in the low flow experiment thus the role of colloids is important during transport only a limited amount of pu iv aq smaller than 1 of the total injected pu iv aq is eluted through the fracture in each of the experiments 3 2 sorption process and parameter estimation as described in section 2 5 a stepwise strategy was adopted to evaluate the sorption processes and parameters for each pu species first the mean residence time τ and pe number were estimated by fitting the tritium breakthrough data for the high and low flow experiments with the assumption that rm rf 1 the residence time in the tubing was subtracted from the overall residence time so that the mean residence time estimated by the model would be an estimate of only the residence time in the fracture as described in the section 9 si in principle the estimate of pe from these fits should also be for the fracture only but it is unavoidable that some dispersion also occurred in the tubing and therefore the pe estimates for the fracture are assumed to be somewhat low reflecting slightly greater estimated dispersion than actually occurred in the fracture it should be noted that only 90 of the tritium was assumed to participate in the low flow rate test because assuming 100 participation resulted in overestimation of the breakthrough curve and for consistency only 90 participation was assumed for all pu species as well for the high flow rate test 100 mass participation was assumed for all species the estimated τ from the tritium fits were set as fixed values for the inverse modeling of pu transport as the residence time only depends on the transport distance and velocity the sensitivity analysis results of the other main parameters are summarized in fig s4 si it was found the sorption rate constant had the largest sensitivity which suggests it is the most significant parameter that affects the model estimation the pe is treated as a fixed value too as all the tracers should have similar dispersivity dai et al 2009 in an attempt to elucidate sorption processes both equilibrium and kinetic sorption were considered in the modeling and sorption was also considered to occur in only the matrix in only the fracture or in both media fracture and matrix to determine which alternative offered the best fit to the data the physical parameters of the core used in the modeling such as fracture half aperture and matrix porosity were provided in section 2 1 the tritium matrix diffusion coefficient was not directly attained for solutes in the granite core but it was assumed to be 1 10 5 cm2 s which is less than its free water diffusion coefficient which was considered reasonable for rock with a porosity of 0 5 ohlsson and neretniks 1997 the fitted τ values are 1 75 h and 9 5 h and the pe numbers are 7 00 and 3 25 for the high flow rate and the low flow rate experiments respectively the curve fitting results are illustrated for the high and low flow tritium breakthrough curves in figs 3 a and 4 a both fitted curves were quite insensitive to the assumed value of the tritium matrix diffusion coefficient as they were almost identical to model curves obtained with the matrix diffusion coefficient set to zero in order to effectively evaluate the transport behavior of different pu species the breakthrough curves of pu col pu iv aq and pu v vi aq were fitted separately with the assumption that there was negligible transformation of one species to another over the relatively short time scales of the experiments and also that the species did not otherwise interfere or interact with each other in the fractured core the pu speciation measurements in solutions a and b section 3 1 indicated that such transformations or interactions should have been minimal with the most likely transformation being a slight conversion of pu v vi aq to pu iv aq especially during the low flow rate experiment such a transformation would have resulted in greater apparent transport of pu iv aq and less apparent transport of pu v vi aq than would have been observed if there had been no transformations and given that pu v vi aq already appeared to be significantly more mobile than pu iv aq the transformation of pu v vi aq to pu iv aq can only serve to make the observed pu v vi aq mobility a lower bound and the observed pu iv aq mobility an upper bound the matrix diffusion coefficients of the pu species are less than tritium zavarin et al 2006 presented a value of 1 2 10 5 cm2 s for a free water diffusion coefficient of pu solutes in former lanl experiments in this study the matrix diffusion coefficients for soluble pu iv aq and pu v vi aq are set as about half smaller than that of tritium diffusion coefficient the colloids ordinarily have a size of more than 1 nm which minimizes their penetration into the rock matrix the matrix diffusion for pu colloids was assumed to be about an order of magnitude smaller than the pu solutes the kinetic model curves associated with the best fits to the data sets for each pu species are shown in figs 3 and 4 for the two different flow velocities and the corresponding estimated sorption parameters are listed in tables 2 and 3 the equilibrium model curves are presented as well but with biased fits to the observation data thus it was concluded that the sorption retardation of the pu species could not be modeled as an equilibrium process for the high flow rate experiment the transport of insoluble pu col soluble pu v vi aq and pu iv aq are quite well simulated by the kinetic sorption models the tailing of pu v vi aq and the early arrival of pu iv aq are the least well simulated features for the low flow rate experiment the models do not match the data as well as for the high flow rate experiment and the model curves have a distinctively choppier appearance than the breakthrough data although the general behavior is still reasonably well simulated this is not surprising given that the model has many simplifying assumptions that essentially ignore physical and chemical heterogeneity in the fracture which will inevitably result in different and likely more dispersed transport behavior than a simplified model can predict however some of the discrepancies between the models and data can also be attributed to relatively large uncertainties in the pu concentration measurements particularly for the pu iv aq which had very low breakthrough concentrations interestingly the best fitting fracture only and fracture and matrix models yield virtually identical results which highlights the inability to use fitting alone to distinguish between these sorption processes the fracture and matrix fm models are rejected because they include two more adjustable parameters than the other models without offering any improvement to the fits and additional parameters can only be justified in a model if they offer a significant improvement to determine whether a fracture only or matrix only model provides a better description of the observed pu transport behavior it is necessary to evaluate the reasonableness of the estimated parameters for each model tables 2 and 3 in this regard the retardation factors and sorption rate constants for the matrix only models are incredibly large suggesting that these models are mathematically compensating for the fact that the actual behavior is not consistent with the model assumptions i e sorption only in the matrix in effect the matrix only models predict that pu will react very rapidly upon entering the matrix and will not penetrate very far into the matrix which is effectively the same as predicting that the pu will react almost exclusively right at the fracture walls in contrast the fracture only model parameters are physically chemically more plausible suggesting that these models provide a better representation of the pu transport processes as we also consider the results of the sensitivity analysis fig 4 of si that the model predictions were far more sensitive to fracture sorption rate constants than matrix rate constants we therefore conclude that fracture only models are most appropriate for predicting pu transport in low porosity granitic rocks from the beishan site however we hasten to point out that this conclusion might be different for fractured rocks with much higher matrix porosity than the granite studied here we also point out that this does not mean that diffusion and sorption in the matrix were not occurring in the granite fracture but rather it suggests that the matrix contribution to sorption is effectively captured in a fracture only model it should be noted that there is a mathematical basis for the equivalence of the best fitting fracture only and matrix only kinetic models provided rf and rm in the fracture only and matrix only models have sufficiently large value under these conditions it can be shown that a fracture only and matrix only kinetic model will produce approximately the same result if k f f r a c t u r e o n l y b k m d m m a t r i x o n l y and r f f r a c t u r e o n l y 1 k f f r a c t u r e o n l y r m k m ρ m 1 d m m a t r i x o n l y the derivation of these expressions goes beyond the scope of this paper but they can be readily verified by inserting values of ϕ b and dm mentioned earlier in this section and the rate constants kf and km from tables 2 and 3 we also note that there are many combinations of rf rm kf and km for the fm model that yield an equivalence to the fracture only or matrix only models so the parameters listed in tables 2 and 3 for the fm models are only one set of many best fitting combinations of parameters these parameters can be adjusted so that the observed pu sorption can be attributed to different percentages of fracture vs matrix sorption ranging from 100 fracture sorption to 100 matrix sorption with every possible combination in between mathematical expressions relating these fm model parameters to an equivalent rf and kf for a fracture only model were not formally derived but the following expressions which are logical extensions of the expressions provided above for relating matrix only parameters to fracture only parameters seem to be satisfied if the appropriate good fitting fm parameters that yield good fits are inserted 5 k f f r a c t u r e o n l y k f f m b k m d m f m 6 r f f r a c t u r e o n l y r f f

granite core section 3 2 the discussion in the following sections is limited to these models and their associated parameters 4 1 the mobility and kinetic process of different pu species the estimated values of retardation factors and sorption rate constants reveal that sorption is most strong for pu iv aq followed by pu v vi aq and finally by colloidal pu which is consistent with what is qualitatively observed from the breakthrough curves of the different pu species the mobility of pu v aq in the higher flow rate experiment is close to pu colloids when the concentrations of both species are normalized to their respective starting concentrations fig 3 which is in general agreement with observations at the savannah river and the hanford sites dai et al 2005 2002 in fact the geochemical behaviors of pu v aq are quite complicated in the subsurface they are affected by environmental factors such as ph oxidation conditions and minerals further the puo2 formed from pu v aq has a significant effect on the transport of pu due to the transformation from a dissolved species to nanoparticles gerber et al 2020 from the analysis of the experiments it is apparent that the pu iv aq is more sorptive and significantly less mobile than pu v aq therefore understanding the composition of pu species in groundwater is important when predictive modeling is conducted for a field site 4 2 upscaling considerations while we attempted to approximate expected field fracture flow rates in the low flow rate experiment it was not possible to experimentally approximate the time or distance scales that are relevant for nuclear waste repository risk assessments one of the most significant results of this study is that the fracture sorption rate constants estimated for each pu species in the higher flow rate experiment were larger than the rate constants estimated for the respective species in the lower flow rate experiment it should be noted that as long as the fracture retardation factor is greater than about 15 which it was for all the pu species at all flow rates in our experiments the sorption rate constants dictate the early and peak breakthrough behaviors in the models with the retardation factors being adjusted mainly to provide better matches to the tailing of the pu species via their indirect effect on desorption rate constants the fact that the estimated fracture sorption rate constants decreased with decreasing flow rate or more importantly with increasing residence time suggests that there will be greater mobility of pu species at longer time scales than would be predicted from shorter duration experiments a key question then is what rate constant values should be used to predict field scale behavior when residence times are on the order of years instead of hours this question is especially important given that the use of the rate constants obtained from the experiments at both flow rates in this study would result in predictions of negligible pu transport over times scales of months let alone years which could possibly result in a gross underestimation of pu transport in a nuclear waste repository risk assessment what is needed is a fundamental understanding of the processes that govern the observed scaling behavior so that a mechanistic basis can be used to predict rate constant at time and distance scales that are not practical to investigate experimentally the trends in the fracture sorption rate constant as a function of residence time in the two experiments that differed by about an order of magnitude in residence time provide some clues as to how the rate constant might scale with time and by extension distance we offer the following discussion as a starting point for understanding the upscaling of fracture sorption rate constant with residence time with the recognition that the ideas presented here should be tested with additional experiments and modeling the fracture sorption rate constants for the different pu species in the different experiments are listed in table 4 also provided in table 4 are values of kf τ which is a dimensionless damkohler number that serves as a measure of reaction progress and the calculated root mean square free water diffusion distances of the species at the different residence times given by 2 d m τ the shaded rows in table 3 provide the ratios of kf τ and 2 d m τ in the two experiments low flow divided by high flow for each species note that the ratio of 2 d m τ is given by τ 1 τ 2 because for a given species d m is the same from table 4 we see that for the solutes the ratios of kf τ and 2 d m τ at the two residence times are quite similar this may not be coincidental as the reaction progress reflected by kfτ would be expected to scale with the number of collisions between pu species and fracture walls where the reactions take place which in turn should scale with the free water diffusion distances of the species during their transit time in the fracture with greater diffusion distances there should be more collisions with fracture walls because the pu species will diffuse back and forth across the fracture aperture more times thus it appears that kf for a given pu solute species is being adjusted by the model to yield a reaction progress at a given residence time that is approximately proportional to the expected number of collisions with fracture walls associated with that residence time we note that while the kf τ ratios for pu v vi aq and pu iv aq at the two residence times are approximately the same and similar to the 2 d m τ ratios at the two residence times the fact that the estimated kf values are larger for pu iv aq than for pu v vi aq implies that the collision efficiency the fraction of collisions resulting in sorption is greater for pu iv aq than it is for pu v vi aq these observations suggest that it may be appropriate to upscale fracture sorption rate constant using predicted diffusion distances within a fracture system as a function of residence time an example perhaps best illustrates this if a rate constant of 0 2 h 1 is observed in an experiment with a mean residence time of 10 h then kf τ is equal to 2 if the time scale increases to 100 h then we predict that the diffusion distance and number of collisions will increase by 100 10 3 16 thus kf 100 100 2 3 16 and kf 100 is 0 0632 h 1 that is the upscaled rate constant associated with a mean residence time of 100 h is 0 0632 h 1 of course this is overly simplistic because it does not account for reaction reversibility i e desorption as well as many potential complicating factors associated with spatial heterogeneity in fractures but it serves to illustrate a potential approach to upscaling of fracture sorption rate constant that is qualitatively consistent with the experimental observations and model interpretations of this study the situation with the pu colloids is somewhat different than for the solutes as the ratio of kf τ at the two residence times 1 31 is only a little more than half the ratio of 2 d m τ 2 33 when the longer residence time value is divided by the shorter residence time value unlike the solutes the colloid reaction progress kf τ is not very different for the two experiments despite the significant difference in mean residence times thus it seems that the scaling of the colloid rate constant is more complex than for the solutes or at least the scaling does not seem to be consistent with diffusion distance considerations one approach to scaling for the colloid rate constant might be to generalize the square root dependence that comes from diffusion distance considerations using the observed ratio of kf τ at the two flow rates in principle the approach would be to solve for the exponent x in the following equation 7 k f τ 1 k f τ 2 τ 1 τ 2 x or for the pu colloids in the two fracture experiments 1 31 9 5 1 75 x which yields x 0 16 thus if one wanted to estimate an upscaled kf value that applies at a residence time of 500 h one would solve the following for kf 8 k f 500 3 71 500 9 5 0 16 which yields kf 0 014 h 1 of course there is no theoretical basis for taking this approach to upscale the colloid kf values like there is in the case of using the diffusion distances to upscale solute kf values so this is strictly an empirical approach that would have to be verified with further testing another consideration with colloids is that they tend to have a much wider range of properties than solutes because they typically have a wide range of sizes and shapes and other properties such as surface charge and density thus in principle a colloid population may possess a wide range of transport properties including sorption or filtration rate constant kf reimus and boukhalfa 2014 conducted an experimental study designed to interrogate a wide range of transport properties in a colloid population and such a study might be considered as a follow on to this study a simple example here can serve to illustrate how distribution of kf values could produce results qualitatively similar to what was observed in the two fracture experiments let s assume a colloid population with 75 of its colloids having kf 3 h 1 another 22 having kf 1 2 h 1 and 3 having kf 0 001 h 1 i e 3 of the colloids are very slow to filter sorb because of some property that makes them resistant to filtration sorption recognizing that the fraction of colloids that are not filtered as a function of time is approximated by exp kfτ we obtain the predicted recoveries as a function of residence time for the above hypothetical population as shown in table 5 we can calculate apparent kf and kf τ values associated with the total recoveries of table 5 and we see that these values for residence times of 1 75 and 9 5 h last 2 lines of table are very similar to what was observed in the fracture experiments with the same residence times we also see that for the specified hypothetical colloid population the apparent kf value for a residence time of 500 h 0 008 h 1 is significantly less than the kf values estimated from the results obtained at 1 75 and 9 5 h in this particular example the empirical power law upscaling approach suggested above would be erroneous by about a factor of 2 as the resulting predicted kf value at a residence time of 500 h would be 0 014 h 1 see above which would overpredict filtration and underpredict transport 5 conclusion considering the multiple species experiments with varied flow rates and mathematical simulations our findings provide a new perspective on pu reactive transport in fractures the total recovery rate of pu is between 10 and 20 in the experiments which is a significant contribution to the environment the total transport contributions include both aqueous pu and pu colloids in the solution the evidence from experiments provides strong support of different sorption process for different pu species the values of retardation factors and sorption rate constants reveal that the sorption is most strong for pu iv aq followed by pu v vi aq the colloidal pu has the largest mobility in the fracture therefore understanding the composition of pu species in groundwater is important when modeling is implemented in field site meanwhile the simulations by equilibrium and kinetic models further indicate that at the laboratory scale the sorption of pu colloid is controlled by the kinetic process the fact that the estimated fracture sorption rate constant decreased with decreasing flow rate suggests that a significant mass of pu can be delivered through granite fractures at long time scales even the groundwater flow rate is very slow in the field the trends in the fracture sorption rate constant as a function of residence time for both aqueous and colloidal pu are further discussed to illustrate potential parameter upscaling approaches over the long time and distance scales that are relevant for nuclear waste repository risk assessments our hope is that the upscaling insights gained in this study might prompt 1 experimental studies designed to interrogate the observed scale dependence of rate constant and 2 the development of models that can predict this scale dependence from first principles without having to resort to scale dependence of parameter values declaration of competing interest

15512,plutonium pu in the subsurface environment can transport in different oxidation states as an aqueous solute or as colloidal particles the transport behavior of pu is affected by the relative abundances of these species and can be difficult to predict when they simultaneously exist this study investigates the concurrent transport of pu intrinsic colloids pu iv aq and pu v vi aq through a combination of controlled experiments and semi analytical dual porosity transport modeling pu transport experiments were conducted in a fractured granite at high and low flow rates to elucidate sorption processes and their scaling behavior in the experiments pu iv aq was the least mobile of the pu species pu v vi aq had intermediate mobility and the colloidal pu which consisted mainly of precipitated and or hydrolyzed pu iv was the most mobile the semi analytical modeling revealed that the sorption of each pu species was rate limited as the sorption could not be described by assuming local equilibrium in the experiments the model was able to describe the sorption of the different pu species that occurring either on fracture surfaces in the pores of the rock matrix or simultaneously in both locations while equally good fits to the data could be achieved using any of these assumptions a fracture dominated process was considered to be the most plausible because it provided the most reasonable estimates of sorption rate constants importantly a key result of this work is that the sorption rate constant of all pu species tends to decrease with increasing time scales which implies that pu will tend to be more mobile at longer time scales than observations at shorter time scales suggest this result has important implications for predicting the environmental impacts of pu in the safety assessments of geologic repositories for radioactive waste disposal and we explore potential mechanistic bases for upscaling the sorption rate constants to time and distance scales that cannot be practically evaluated in experiments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reactive transport sorption mechanism fractured rock pu species upscaling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as more countries pursue plans for geologic disposal of accumulated high level nuclear waste quantifying the fate and transport of radionuclides in complex fractured rocks has become an important issue especially for repositories located within crystalline rocks faybishenko and swift 2016 wang et al 2018 among the radionuclides plutonium pu is of great concern because of its radiological impacts on health and its complicated geochemistry in the subsurface environment begg et al 2015 smith and amonette 2006 wolfsberg et al 2017 early studies recognized pu as a strongly sorbing dissolved solute with limited mobility due to its high affinity for solids and low solubility romanchuk et al 2016 later field observations at the nevada test site us and the mayak production association russia showed that pu transport is greatly enhanced with naturally occurring submicrometer particles i e colloids kersting et al 1999 novikov et al 2006 zhao et al 2020 pu was also discovered to migrate long distances at the savannah river site and the us doe hanford site as an oxidized species with small retardation dai et al 2005 2002 these diverse observations at different field sites demonstrate that the transport of pu is highly influenced by its chemical nature gerber et al 2020 our understanding of how pu migrates in subsurface environments is far from complete in modeling practice treating mobile pu as a single soluble species often delivers unsatisfactory results with significant uncertainties glynn 2002 as illustrated by zavarin et al 2005 simulated pu concentrations were in poor agreement with observations and lacked the appropriate mechanisms to adequately model the transport behavior of pu if pu transport is colloid facilitated improvements are offered by regarding the colloidal pu as a fraction of the total pu in solution as at the nevada site dai et al 2012 while ignoring the potential migration of non colloidal pu however the potential for colloid facilitated transport in groundwater may still be poorly estimated especially over long distances marty et al 1997 there have been very few studies examining the transport of pu in fractured rock when colloidal and aqueous pu exist together accurate modeling of bulk pu transport behavior requires understanding the transport behavior of various pu species in solution individually the most significant geochemical process limiting radionuclide transport in groundwater is sorption li and kaplan 2012 zhang et al 2016 which in this paper is taken to include many potential physical or chemical processes including ion exchange surface complexation precipitation and in the case of colloids physical and chemical filtration dai et al 2009 hakoun et al 2019 shahkarami et al 2016 zhang et al 2014 in part because of the diversity of hydrogeological conditions in widely varying settings the sorption processes determining the reactive transport of many radionuclides remain poorly understood zhang et al 2022 which is limiting our ability to produce useful predictions with mathematical and numerical models a detailed description of the sorption processes in fractures and or the surrounding matrix that control pu transport in fractured rocks is needed to improve model accuracy and reduce model uncertainty descriptions of the important processes could then be coupled into reactive transport models with appropriate parameter upscaling to produce acceptable results over a wide range of scales reimus and zavarin 2017 zhang et al 2021 utilizing the transport model the retardation caused by the complicated interactions mentioned above can be described with empirical parameters that are estimated from model fits to experimental data such as rate constants in a kinetic model or partition coefficients or retardation factors in an equilibrium model neretnieks 1990 samper et al 2008 it is desirable in models to describe sorption processes using a simple approach with as few parameters as necessary to effectively capture the expected behavior in the system of interest more complicated chemical mathematical models while sometimes offering advantages of having more robust mechanistic underpinnings that allow predictions over a wider range of potential hydrogeochemical conditions typically require longer computing times and have greater parameter uncertainty because of a larger number of parameters černý 2019 a relatively simple dual porosity transport model that can be readily incorporated into a risk assessment model in a computationally efficient manner would be useful for describing radionuclide transport in the fractured rock where flowing water in fractures is in diffusive communication with immobile water in a surrounding matrix neumann et al 2021 experimentally it is important to investigate reactive transport behavior under extremely slow groundwater flow conditions that mimic hydrogeologic conditions in most field systems conroy 2017 the aim of this paper is to investigate the reactive transport behaviors of different co existing pu species in fractured rock with experiments and semi analytical dual porosity transport modeling we investigate the effect of flow rate on pu transport with high flow and low flow rate experiments meanwhile we use the model to determine whether pu sorption is better described as a kinetic or equilibrium process and also to try to distinguish between sorption occurring predominantly in fractures the surrounding rock matrix or both domains additionally upscaling relationships of sorption parameters are inferred from the experiments and modeling with discussion of potential mechanistic bases for these relationships this is important for the long term predictive modeling of pu transport in field settings with much longer time and distance scales than can be investigated in practical experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 granite properties and fracture generation the granite core in the transport experiment was collected from the northwest area of china the rock sample is 10 cm in length and 5 cm in diameter an artificial fracture in the middle along the axial direction of the cylindrical core is created by the brazilian splitting technique singh et al 2015 the measured fracture half aperture is 0 125 mm quantitative x ray diffraction mineralogy shows that it contains 31 7 quartz 26 4 microcline 30 4 albite 7 2 biotite and 4 3 chlorite in mass percentage the examined minerals exposed on the fracture surface especially the clay minerals have adsorption capacity to produce effective fracture retardation the matrix porosity of the core is set as 0 5 as estimated by difference in saturated and dry 80 c oven for 24 h weights of a sample of known volume this porosity compares favorably with granites of similar composition measured by the saturation method keeney et al 1985 bulk density and grain density values were determined simultaneously 2 2 distribution of pu species an important assumption in this study is that the different pu species transport independently without interaction which allows us to take advantage of sequential measurements of pu colloid pu col pu iv aq and pu v vi aq in aqueous samples to deduce the transport behavior of each species this assumption is justified by the short time scales of the experiments relative to the time scales over which transformations and interactions take place at neutral ph region li and kaplan 2012 zang et al 2020 2016 pu vi aq is reduced very fast to pu v aq and pu v aq is the dominant dissolved aqueous species under oxic conditions zhao et al 2020 thus the two forms are lumped together as pu v vi aq in the experiments pu iii aq exists in the reduced environment and is barely detected under laboratory conditions pu iv aq is more insoluble than pu v vi aq and hence it is considered an independent species in the experiments it should be noted that the conversion between pu iv aq and pu v vi aq involve the break or formation of pu o bonds and takes place over time scales of tens of days neck et al 2007 the half time of pu v aq disproportionation is about 0 16 years 58 4d kersting et al 2003 most of the pu iv in our experiments was present as pu iv intrinsic colloids which are formed either by precipitation when the pu iv aq concentration exceeds its solubility as it did initially in our experiment see section 2 3 or through the hydrolytic process to form puo2 nanoparticles cleveland and mullin 1993 puo2 colloids are not easy to dissolve and their lifetime is on the order of 1 9 years in the natural water used in this study zhao et al 2020 these processes are all quite slow compared to the timescale of the experiments conducted here the pu iv aq pu v vi aq and pu col are treated as separate tracers in the experiments with different initial concentrations a step wise approach was adopted to quantify different pu species in the effluent solutions with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms method adapted from nitsche et al 1988 a flowchart was shown in fig s1 in the supplementary materials with the designed method the total pu the colloidal pu pu iv aq pu v vi aq were separated and measured accordingly 2 3 solution preparation natural groundwater was used as the background solution in all the experiments the groundwater was slightly alkaline with a ph value of 8 2 the total dissolved solids concentration was 2 23 g l the major cations in the groundwater were k na ca2 mg2 with concentrations of 8 78 707 45 101 74 and 41 02 mg l the major anions consisted of f hco3 cl so4 2 no3 with concentrations of 0 84 150 452 858 and 9 1 mg l prior to use in the experiments the groundwater was filtered with a 0 45 μm membrane filter to ensure there were no natural colloids present in the solutions aliquots of the 0 45 μm filtered water were further filtered using 10 kd ultrafiltration tubes 1 5 nm pore size to determine the mass and composition of colloids less than 0 45 μm in size in the solution as shown in table s1 si the results suggest that the 0 45 μm filtered water used in the experiments was essentially free of colloids containing mn fe and al with a small amount of sio2 colloids 1 5 mg l the approximate composition of the filtered natural colloids can be deduced from analyses of the water before and after filtration the stock solutions of pu iv were added to 0 45μm filtered groundwater to achieve an initial target concentration of 2390 pg ml 10 nmol l which was greater than the solubility of plutonium at room temperature 5 01 nmol l neck et al 2007 the chemical form of the stock pu iv solution is pu iv no3 4 1 μg g 0 5 mol l hno3 the atom ratios of the 239pu stock solution were 240pu 239pu 0 0346 241pu 239pu 0 000355 and 242pu 239pu 0 0000323 it can be seen that extremely trivial 241pu and 242pu exist and the dominated pu isotope is 239pu with limited 240pu the tritium in the form of tritiated water was added as a conservative tracer with a concentration of 0 19 pmol l 204 bq l tritium was quantified in samples collected from the fracture outlet using lsc since the dominant isotope 239pu has significantly different energy emitting properties from tritium the two elements are located at varied regions in the counting spectrum golashvili et al 2006 hence the pu in the solution barely interferes with the tritium measurement the detailed information is described in section 1 of the si with detection limit calculation the solution ph was readjusted to equal to that of the groundwater by adding naoh solution we note here that the apparent presence of sio2 colloids in the filtered groundwater could have resulted in some of the pu iv and or pu v vi being transported while sorbed to these colloids kersting et al 1999 soderholm et al 2008 the detailed form of colloidal pu in this study could not be distinguished as we used physical filtration to separate colloids powell et al 2008 reported sorption of both pu iv and pu v to silica surfaces at near neutral phs and the lack of formation of pu v colloids in our spiking experiments as described in section 4 of the si suggested that 1 silica colloids played a minor role in sorbing either pu v or pu iv and 2 almost all the pu iv colloids observed in our experiments were pu iv intrinsic colloids further recent studies indicated other forms of pu colloid maybe enrolled in specified environment such as the intermittent pu v solid phase has been reported under alkaline conditions by kvashnina et al 2019 at a neutral condition in our experiment it is unlikely to form the pu v solid phase as its corresponding ph was approach to 11 thus colloidal pu or pu col was assumed to consist of a combination of dominated intrinsic polymeric pu iv colloids with limited pu that was sorbed to natural sio2 colloids in this study two solutions were used in the transport experiments by allowing different static equilibration times after adding pu iv 7 days and 11 days the 7 day solution was used for the high flow rate experiment and the 11 day solution was used for the low flow rate experiment the total pu concentrations and distributions of the different species were analyzed at the times the transport experiments started and served as initial concentrations for the experiments 2 4 column transport experiments the pu transport experiments were conducted in the prepared fractured rock core as shown in fig 1 to test the impact of flow rate on pu sorption two experiments with significantly different flow rates were conducted in the high flow rate experiment the flow rate was controlled at 1 92 ml h the low flow rate was intended to more closely approximate expected hydrologic conditions in fractured rock at the proposed repository site in beishan china in the field especially in potential hlw repositories which are preferably sited in intact rock the stochastically distributed fractures are often tiny with extremely slow groundwater flow velocities previous studies reported an average outflow velocity of about 10 10 10 6 m s in the hard rock laboratory at äspö sweden kröhn 2017 with an average darcy velocity ranging from 2 8 10 13 to 3 5 10 11 m s abarca et al 2019 at the proposed repository site in beishan china the estimated flow velocity was about 10 9 m s in the far field ling 2018 wang et al 2018 in order to simulate the migration of plutonium at a very low velocity a low speed peristaltic pump was used to slowly inject groundwater at an average flow rate of 0 157 ml h which corresponded to an equivalent linear velocity of 3 5 10 6 m s the detailed experimental configuration and experimental steps are described in the si section 6 importantly the volume of the flow system includes the fluororesin tubing and flow manifolds on either end of the fracture which together exceed the fracture volume so it was necessary to account for this dead volume in the interpretations of the experiments to test the effect of the tubing on pu sorption the total pu concentrations in a polypropylene bottle at different times were measured as reference and shown in table s2 si it can be deduced that for the high rate flow experiment where the residence time in the tubing was about 1 32 h the effect on sorption should have been negligible 1 or less of the injection concentration for the low flow rate the residence time in the tubing was about 16 11 h and the reduction in pu concentration due to sorption should have been about 3 of the injection concentration based on the first order decay rate deduced from the results of table s2 si prior to each new experiment the apparatus was first flushed with 50 ml 2 hno3 to remove the residual pu from previous experiment then 200 ml ultrapure water was flushed to eliminate the residual acid finally 50 ml groundwater was pumped through the core at the experiment flow rate to achieve water rock interface equilibrium to evaluate the effectiveness of the flushing treatment the 50 ml of 2 hno3 was subjected to liquid scintillation counting lsc after the first experiment the first 20 ml of hno3 contained about 90 of the residual pu from the preceding experiment and in the second 20 ml hno3 the counts of pu dropped below the lsc detection limit these results indicated that the flushing method was effective in removing pu and therefore minimizing pu carryover between experiments furthermore a breakthrough curve btc of only tritium without pu at a flow rate of 1 9 ml h was obtained the two btcs are shown in fig s3 si and their excellent agreement suggests that the fracture volume and the flow pathways through the fracture were not altered by the flushing procedure 2 6 dual porosity transport model the dual porosity conceptual model developed by tang et al 1981 which takes into account advection dispersion diffusion and adsorption was adopted to simulate the fracture transport experiments in this model the groundwater flows primarily through the naturally open fracture pathways and the matrix porewater is considered immobile but is connected to the fracture flow pathways by diffusion sudicky and frind 1982 reimus and haga 1999 derived a semi analytical solution for the model by assuming 1 d transport in fractures of constant aperture no concentration gradients across the fracture aperture a steady flow rate in the fractures and diffusive exchange with the surrounding rock matrix in a direction perpendicular to fracture flow reimus et al 2003 while this model involves many simplifying assumptions the assumptions are consistent with the experimental design and perhaps more importantly the model is well suited for our goals of distinguishing between different types of sorption processes and exploring upscaling relationships of the processes and the parameters describing these processes for kinetic sorption the solute concentrations in the fracture and matrix are separately described by the following equations with variables explained in table 1 reimus and haga 1999 fractures solution phase 1 c f t v f c f x d f 2 c f x 2 ρ f η s f t ϕ d m b η c m z z b 0 fractures immobile phase 2 ρ f η s f t k f f c f β f 1 α f c f k f r s f 0 matrix solution phase 3 c m t d m 2 c m z 2 ρ m ϕ s m t 0 matrix immobile phase 4 ρ m ϕ s m t k f m c m β m 1 α m c m k m r s m 0 in this case instead of retardation factors sorption and desorption rate constants for fractures and matrix are used in the equations although retardation factors can still be defined as r f 1 k f f ρ f k f r η and r m 1 k f m ρ m k m r ϕ in eq 1 the parameters η ϕ and b were measured for the experimental fracture system the radionuclide diffusion coefficients in water were assigned based on previous studies the laplace transforms of eqs 1 and 2 were solved simultaneously and the solutions were inverted back to the time domain using the relap reactive transport laplace transform inversion code the parameter estimation software pest was used to automatically adjust input parameters to relap to achieve best fits to the experimental data doherty 2015 model parameters were estimated for a given experiment using the tritium and pu breakthrough data in a stepwise fashion first the tritium breakthrough data were fitted by assuming rm rf 1 as a nonreactive tracer and then adjusting only two parameters to match the data the mean fluid residence time in the fracture τ l v hr where l is the fracture length and peclet number pe l α where α is the dispersivity given by α df v once τ and pe were estimated they were assumed to apply to pu in the same experiment leaving only sorption parameters retardation factors and kinetic rate constants to be adjusted to match the pu data sensitivity analysis and uncertainty were quantified for predominant parameters in the model with the approach and results presented in the section 8 of si if equilibrium sorption is assumed rf and or rm are the only model parameters adjusted to fit the pu data in the more general case of kinetic sorption where the sorption and desorption rate constants are not sufficiently fast for local equilibrium to be satisfied both the retardation factors and sorption rate constants are adjusted to match the data note that in this case although retardation factors are specified as input parameters they are used to calculate desorption rate constants which are actually used in the model instead of retardation factors the desorption rate constants are calculated from a rearrangement of the expression s immediately preceding table 1 k r k f ρ x r 1 x where kr kf and r can apply to either the fracture or the matrix and ρ x and x are the bulk density and porosity respectively in either the fracture or matrix 3 results 3 1 the pu species and migration for solutions a and b prepared with pu iv the original solution contained 96 9 pu iv aq and 3 1 pu v vi aq the aqueous pu iv readily hydrolyzes and forms stable amorphous oxyhydroxides polymeric species i e pu intrinsic colloid romanchuk et al 2016 pu v aq often forms puo2 in water romanchuk et al 2016 after the prepared pu iv solution sat for 2 h 16 0 of the total pu was formed as colloid 1 5 nm and the other 84 0 was soluble pu after 7 days the percentage of colloid increased to 32 3 and the other 67 7 was soluble pu for the aqueous pu 77 0 was pu iv aq and 23 0 was pu v vi aq in other words pu iv aq and pu v vi aq occupied 52 13 and 15 57 of the total pu respectively after 11 days the percentage of colloid was stabilized at around 31 6 meanwhile the proportions of pu iv aq and pu v vi aq changed to 65 2 and 34 8 respectively all redox states were present in the injected solutions and accounted for the total pu effluent observed in the experiments breakthrough curves of tritium and pu observed in the transport experiments high flow and low flow rate transport experiments are presented in fig 2 the breakthrough curves of tritium in the high flow experiment appear to reach a greater mass recovery rate 94 88 than that in the low flow experiment 81 35 but with similar maximum relative concentrations 0 85 each of the pu species investigated demonstrates different sorption trends over time fig 2c 2d the results indicate that pu can migrate either as solutes or colloids in fractures compared to the btc of tritium the colloid facilitated transport is characterized by arrival times as early as the non reacting solute in the high flow rate experiment the peak concentrations are reached after about 4 4 and 3 0 h for tritium and pu col respectively the situation is similar for the low flow case with peak times at about 42 and 35 h respectively the maximum concentrations are much lower for pu iv aq and pu v vi aq than for pu col as demonstrated in the figure pu col contributes the majority of total pu the pu colloids accounted for over 70 and 90 of the total pu transport in the fracture at the high and low flow rates respectively compared to a 10 drop of recovery for tritium from high flow to low flow the 4 77 recovery of total pu in the low flow experiment is about half that in the high flow experiment 10 03 the results reveal that flow velocity has a significant impact on pu transport a longer residence time allows the sorbing species to more fully contact the rock fracture walls and further diffuse into the rock matrix the flow rates of the two experiments were 1 92 ml h and 0 127 ml h which are over ten times different indicating that the recovery and flow rate are correlated but not directly proportional meanwhile the breakthrough curves of both the total and pu col concentrations were close particularly in the low flow experiment thus the role of colloids is important during transport only a limited amount of pu iv aq smaller than 1 of the total injected pu iv aq is eluted through the fracture in each of the experiments 3 2 sorption process and parameter estimation as described in section 2 5 a stepwise strategy was adopted to evaluate the sorption processes and parameters for each pu species first the mean residence time τ and pe number were estimated by fitting the tritium breakthrough data for the high and low flow experiments with the assumption that rm rf 1 the residence time in the tubing was subtracted from the overall residence time so that the mean residence time estimated by the model would be an estimate of only the residence time in the fracture as described in the section 9 si in principle the estimate of pe from these fits should also be for the fracture only but it is unavoidable that some dispersion also occurred in the tubing and therefore the pe estimates for the fracture are assumed to be somewhat low reflecting slightly greater estimated dispersion than actually occurred in the fracture it should be noted that only 90 of the tritium was assumed to participate in the low flow rate test because assuming 100 participation resulted in overestimation of the breakthrough curve and for consistency only 90 participation was assumed for all pu species as well for the high flow rate test 100 mass participation was assumed for all species the estimated τ from the tritium fits were set as fixed values for the inverse modeling of pu transport as the residence time only depends on the transport distance and velocity the sensitivity analysis results of the other main parameters are summarized in fig s4 si it was found the sorption rate constant had the largest sensitivity which suggests it is the most significant parameter that affects the model estimation the pe is treated as a fixed value too as all the tracers should have similar dispersivity dai et al 2009 in an attempt to elucidate sorption processes both equilibrium and kinetic sorption were considered in the modeling and sorption was also considered to occur in only the matrix in only the fracture or in both media fracture and matrix to determine which alternative offered the best fit to the data the physical parameters of the core used in the modeling such as fracture half aperture and matrix porosity were provided in section 2 1 the tritium matrix diffusion coefficient was not directly attained for solutes in the granite core but it was assumed to be 1 10 5 cm2 s which is less than its free water diffusion coefficient which was considered reasonable for rock with a porosity of 0 5 ohlsson and neretniks 1997 the fitted τ values are 1 75 h and 9 5 h and the pe numbers are 7 00 and 3 25 for the high flow rate and the low flow rate experiments respectively the curve fitting results are illustrated for the high and low flow tritium breakthrough curves in figs 3 a and 4 a both fitted curves were quite insensitive to the assumed value of the tritium matrix diffusion coefficient as they were almost identical to model curves obtained with the matrix diffusion coefficient set to zero in order to effectively evaluate the transport behavior of different pu species the breakthrough curves of pu col pu iv aq and pu v vi aq were fitted separately with the assumption that there was negligible transformation of one species to another over the relatively short time scales of the experiments and also that the species did not otherwise interfere or interact with each other in the fractured core the pu speciation measurements in solutions a and b section 3 1 indicated that such transformations or interactions should have been minimal with the most likely transformation being a slight conversion of pu v vi aq to pu iv aq especially during the low flow rate experiment such a transformation would have resulted in greater apparent transport of pu iv aq and less apparent transport of pu v vi aq than would have been observed if there had been no transformations and given that pu v vi aq already appeared to be significantly more mobile than pu iv aq the transformation of pu v vi aq to pu iv aq can only serve to make the observed pu v vi aq mobility a lower bound and the observed pu iv aq mobility an upper bound the matrix diffusion coefficients of the pu species are less than tritium zavarin et al 2006 presented a value of 1 2 10 5 cm2 s for a free water diffusion coefficient of pu solutes in former lanl experiments in this study the matrix diffusion coefficients for soluble pu iv aq and pu v vi aq are set as about half smaller than that of tritium diffusion coefficient the colloids ordinarily have a size of more than 1 nm which minimizes their penetration into the rock matrix the matrix diffusion for pu colloids was assumed to be about an order of magnitude smaller than the pu solutes the kinetic model curves associated with the best fits to the data sets for each pu species are shown in figs 3 and 4 for the two different flow velocities and the corresponding estimated sorption parameters are listed in tables 2 and 3 the equilibrium model curves are presented as well but with biased fits to the observation data thus it was concluded that the sorption retardation of the pu species could not be modeled as an equilibrium process for the high flow rate experiment the transport of insoluble pu col soluble pu v vi aq and pu iv aq are quite well simulated by the kinetic sorption models the tailing of pu v vi aq and the early arrival of pu iv aq are the least well simulated features for the low flow rate experiment the models do not match the data as well as for the high flow rate experiment and the model curves have a distinctively choppier appearance than the breakthrough data although the general behavior is still reasonably well simulated this is not surprising given that the model has many simplifying assumptions that essentially ignore physical and chemical heterogeneity in the fracture which will inevitably result in different and likely more dispersed transport behavior than a simplified model can predict however some of the discrepancies between the models and data can also be attributed to relatively large uncertainties in the pu concentration measurements particularly for the pu iv aq which had very low breakthrough concentrations interestingly the best fitting fracture only and fracture and matrix models yield virtually identical results which highlights the inability to use fitting alone to distinguish between these sorption processes the fracture and matrix fm models are rejected because they include two more adjustable parameters than the other models without offering any improvement to the fits and additional parameters can only be justified in a model if they offer a significant improvement to determine whether a fracture only or matrix only model provides a better description of the observed pu transport behavior it is necessary to evaluate the reasonableness of the estimated parameters for each model tables 2 and 3 in this regard the retardation factors and sorption rate constants for the matrix only models are incredibly large suggesting that these models are mathematically compensating for the fact that the actual behavior is not consistent with the model assumptions i e sorption only in the matrix in effect the matrix only models predict that pu will react very rapidly upon entering the matrix and will not penetrate very far into the matrix which is effectively the same as predicting that the pu will react almost exclusively right at the fracture walls in contrast the fracture only model parameters are physically chemically more plausible suggesting that these models provide a better representation of the pu transport processes as we also consider the results of the sensitivity analysis fig 4 of si that the model predictions were far more sensitive to fracture sorption rate constants than matrix rate constants we therefore conclude that fracture only models are most appropriate for predicting pu transport in low porosity granitic rocks from the beishan site however we hasten to point out that this conclusion might be different for fractured rocks with much higher matrix porosity than the granite studied here we also point out that this does not mean that diffusion and sorption in the matrix were not occurring in the granite fracture but rather it suggests that the matrix contribution to sorption is effectively captured in a fracture only model it should be noted that there is a mathematical basis for the equivalence of the best fitting fracture only and matrix only kinetic models provided rf and rm in the fracture only and matrix only models have sufficiently large value under these conditions it can be shown that a fracture only and matrix only kinetic model will produce approximately the same result if k f f r a c t u r e o n l y b k m d m m a t r i x o n l y and r f f r a c t u r e o n l y 1 k f f r a c t u r e o n l y r m k m ρ m 1 d m m a t r i x o n l y the derivation of these expressions goes beyond the scope of this paper but they can be readily verified by inserting values of ϕ b and dm mentioned earlier in this section and the rate constants kf and km from tables 2 and 3 we also note that there are many combinations of rf rm kf and km for the fm model that yield an equivalence to the fracture only or matrix only models so the parameters listed in tables 2 and 3 for the fm models are only one set of many best fitting combinations of parameters these parameters can be adjusted so that the observed pu sorption can be attributed to different percentages of fracture vs matrix sorption ranging from 100 fracture sorption to 100 matrix sorption with every possible combination in between mathematical expressions relating these fm model parameters to an equivalent rf and kf for a fracture only model were not formally derived but the following expressions which are logical extensions of the expressions provided above for relating matrix only parameters to fracture only parameters seem to be satisfied if the appropriate good fitting fm parameters that yield good fits are inserted 5 k f f r a c t u r e o n l y k f f m b k m d m f m 6 r f f r a c t u r e o n l y r f f

granite core section 3 2 the discussion in the following sections is limited to these models and their associated parameters 4 1 the mobility and kinetic process of different pu species the estimated values of retardation factors and sorption rate constants reveal that sorption is most strong for pu iv aq followed by pu v vi aq and finally by colloidal pu which is consistent with what is qualitatively observed from the breakthrough curves of the different pu species the mobility of pu v aq in the higher flow rate experiment is close to pu colloids when the concentrations of both species are normalized to their respective starting concentrations fig 3 which is in general agreement with observations at the savannah river and the hanford sites dai et al 2005 2002 in fact the geochemical behaviors of pu v aq are quite complicated in the subsurface they are affected by environmental factors such as ph oxidation conditions and minerals further the puo2 formed from pu v aq has a significant effect on the transport of pu due to the transformation from a dissolved species to nanoparticles gerber et al 2020 from the analysis of the experiments it is apparent that the pu iv aq is more sorptive and significantly less mobile than pu v aq therefore understanding the composition of pu species in groundwater is important when predictive modeling is conducted for a field site 4 2 upscaling considerations while we attempted to approximate expected field fracture flow rates in the low flow rate experiment it was not possible to experimentally approximate the time or distance scales that are relevant for nuclear waste repository risk assessments one of the most significant results of this study is that the fracture sorption rate constants estimated for each pu species in the higher flow rate experiment were larger than the rate constants estimated for the respective species in the lower flow rate experiment it should be noted that as long as the fracture retardation factor is greater than about 15 which it was for all the pu species at all flow rates in our experiments the sorption rate constants dictate the early and peak breakthrough behaviors in the models with the retardation factors being adjusted mainly to provide better matches to the tailing of the pu species via their indirect effect on desorption rate constants the fact that the estimated fracture sorption rate constants decreased with decreasing flow rate or more importantly with increasing residence time suggests that there will be greater mobility of pu species at longer time scales than would be predicted from shorter duration experiments a key question then is what rate constant values should be used to predict field scale behavior when residence times are on the order of years instead of hours this question is especially important given that the use of the rate constants obtained from the experiments at both flow rates in this study would result in predictions of negligible pu transport over times scales of months let alone years which could possibly result in a gross underestimation of pu transport in a nuclear waste repository risk assessment what is needed is a fundamental understanding of the processes that govern the observed scaling behavior so that a mechanistic basis can be used to predict rate constant at time and distance scales that are not practical to investigate experimentally the trends in the fracture sorption rate constant as a function of residence time in the two experiments that differed by about an order of magnitude in residence time provide some clues as to how the rate constant might scale with time and by extension distance we offer the following discussion as a starting point for understanding the upscaling of fracture sorption rate constant with residence time with the recognition that the ideas presented here should be tested with additional experiments and modeling the fracture sorption rate constants for the different pu species in the different experiments are listed in table 4 also provided in table 4 are values of kf τ which is a dimensionless damkohler number that serves as a measure of reaction progress and the calculated root mean square free water diffusion distances of the species at the different residence times given by 2 d m τ the shaded rows in table 3 provide the ratios of kf τ and 2 d m τ in the two experiments low flow divided by high flow for each species note that the ratio of 2 d m τ is given by τ 1 τ 2 because for a given species d m is the same from table 4 we see that for the solutes the ratios of kf τ and 2 d m τ at the two residence times are quite similar this may not be coincidental as the reaction progress reflected by kfτ would be expected to scale with the number of collisions between pu species and fracture walls where the reactions take place which in turn should scale with the free water diffusion distances of the species during their transit time in the fracture with greater diffusion distances there should be more collisions with fracture walls because the pu species will diffuse back and forth across the fracture aperture more times thus it appears that kf for a given pu solute species is being adjusted by the model to yield a reaction progress at a given residence time that is approximately proportional to the expected number of collisions with fracture walls associated with that residence time we note that while the kf τ ratios for pu v vi aq and pu iv aq at the two residence times are approximately the same and similar to the 2 d m τ ratios at the two residence times the fact that the estimated kf values are larger for pu iv aq than for pu v vi aq implies that the collision efficiency the fraction of collisions resulting in sorption is greater for pu iv aq than it is for pu v vi aq these observations suggest that it may be appropriate to upscale fracture sorption rate constant using predicted diffusion distances within a fracture system as a function of residence time an example perhaps best illustrates this if a rate constant of 0 2 h 1 is observed in an experiment with a mean residence time of 10 h then kf τ is equal to 2 if the time scale increases to 100 h then we predict that the diffusion distance and number of collisions will increase by 100 10 3 16 thus kf 100 100 2 3 16 and kf 100 is 0 0632 h 1 that is the upscaled rate constant associated with a mean residence time of 100 h is 0 0632 h 1 of course this is overly simplistic because it does not account for reaction reversibility i e desorption as well as many potential complicating factors associated with spatial heterogeneity in fractures but it serves to illustrate a potential approach to upscaling of fracture sorption rate constant that is qualitatively consistent with the experimental observations and model interpretations of this study the situation with the pu colloids is somewhat different than for the solutes as the ratio of kf τ at the two residence times 1 31 is only a little more than half the ratio of 2 d m τ 2 33 when the longer residence time value is divided by the shorter residence time value unlike the solutes the colloid reaction progress kf τ is not very different for the two experiments despite the significant difference in mean residence times thus it seems that the scaling of the colloid rate constant is more complex than for the solutes or at least the scaling does not seem to be consistent with diffusion distance considerations one approach to scaling for the colloid rate constant might be to generalize the square root dependence that comes from diffusion distance considerations using the observed ratio of kf τ at the two flow rates in principle the approach would be to solve for the exponent x in the following equation 7 k f τ 1 k f τ 2 τ 1 τ 2 x or for the pu colloids in the two fracture experiments 1 31 9 5 1 75 x which yields x 0 16 thus if one wanted to estimate an upscaled kf value that applies at a residence time of 500 h one would solve the following for kf 8 k f 500 3 71 500 9 5 0 16 which yields kf 0 014 h 1 of course there is no theoretical basis for taking this approach to upscale the colloid kf values like there is in the case of using the diffusion distances to upscale solute kf values so this is strictly an empirical approach that would have to be verified with further testing another consideration with colloids is that they tend to have a much wider range of properties than solutes because they typically have a wide range of sizes and shapes and other properties such as surface charge and density thus in principle a colloid population may possess a wide range of transport properties including sorption or filtration rate constant kf reimus and boukhalfa 2014 conducted an experimental study designed to interrogate a wide range of transport properties in a colloid population and such a study might be considered as a follow on to this study a simple example here can serve to illustrate how distribution of kf values could produce results qualitatively similar to what was observed in the two fracture experiments let s assume a colloid population with 75 of its colloids having kf 3 h 1 another 22 having kf 1 2 h 1 and 3 having kf 0 001 h 1 i e 3 of the colloids are very slow to filter sorb because of some property that makes them resistant to filtration sorption recognizing that the fraction of colloids that are not filtered as a function of time is approximated by exp kfτ we obtain the predicted recoveries as a function of residence time for the above hypothetical population as shown in table 5 we can calculate apparent kf and kf τ values associated with the total recoveries of table 5 and we see that these values for residence times of 1 75 and 9 5 h last 2 lines of table are very similar to what was observed in the fracture experiments with the same residence times we also see that for the specified hypothetical colloid population the apparent kf value for a residence time of 500 h 0 008 h 1 is significantly less than the kf values estimated from the results obtained at 1 75 and 9 5 h in this particular example the empirical power law upscaling approach suggested above would be erroneous by about a factor of 2 as the resulting predicted kf value at a residence time of 500 h would be 0 014 h 1 see above which would overpredict filtration and underpredict transport 5 conclusion considering the multiple species experiments with varied flow rates and mathematical simulations our findings provide a new perspective on pu reactive transport in fractures the total recovery rate of pu is between 10 and 20 in the experiments which is a significant contribution to the environment the total transport contributions include both aqueous pu and pu colloids in the solution the evidence from experiments provides strong support of different sorption process for different pu species the values of retardation factors and sorption rate constants reveal that the sorption is most strong for pu iv aq followed by pu v vi aq the colloidal pu has the largest mobility in the fracture therefore understanding the composition of pu species in groundwater is important when modeling is implemented in field site meanwhile the simulations by equilibrium and kinetic models further indicate that at the laboratory scale the sorption of pu colloid is controlled by the kinetic process the fact that the estimated fracture sorption rate constant decreased with decreasing flow rate suggests that a significant mass of pu can be delivered through granite fractures at long time scales even the groundwater flow rate is very slow in the field the trends in the fracture sorption rate constant as a function of residence time for both aqueous and colloidal pu are further discussed to illustrate potential parameter upscaling approaches over the long time and distance scales that are relevant for nuclear waste repository risk assessments our hope is that the upscaling insights gained in this study might prompt 1 experimental studies designed to interrogate the observed scale dependence of rate

15513,the development of cost effective and energy efficient technologies to recover nutrients from digestate is important anaerobic digestate can be concentrated into bio nutrient products through an electrodialysis ed process in an energy efficient manner despite recent advances the operation modes of ed for nutrient recovery from swine digestate are yet to be systematically evaluated from the perspective of energy water efficiencies and the determination of optimal operations in ed units is still ambiguous in this study two different operating modes of electrodialysis i e constant voltage and constant current are designed to evaluate the energy efficiency and effectiveness of nutrient recovery from anaerobic swine digestate the ion removal ratio and current efficiency of the different modes and their associated electromigration performance e g rate constants are evaluated the results indicate that the maximum removal efficiency in terms of electrical conductivity is 92 8 at a cell voltage of 2 4 v cell using the constant voltage operation the current efficiencies of nh4 43 65 are higher than that of other ions such as k 12 19 cl 4 7 and po4 3 0 1 1 5 for nitrogen recovery the required energy consumption was about 0 24 15 2 kwh kg n 0 86 54 7 kj g n corresponding to a removal ratio of ammonium from 70 8 to 99 1 based on the experimental data the optimal operating conditions are identified using response surface models by considering process energy consumption and productivity to deliver energy efficient nutrient separation one candidate of the ideal conditions to achieve the total ion removal of 93 should be operated at a constant cell voltage of 1 15 v corresponding to a productivity of 5 24 gal hr m2 at an energy consumption of 0 44 kwh m3 last a conceptual design of cascading separation processes is proposed for digestate valorization as biofertilizers nutrients organic acids and reclaimed water a preliminary benefit cost evaluation is then performed to evaluate the engineering and economic performance of the developed process for nutrient recovery from swine digestate this article provides insight into practical large scale applications of digestate valorization through energy efficient separation thereby realizing a circular economy system and a decarbonizing supply chain of bio nutrients graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords energy consumption productivity kinetics response surface model cost benefit analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in accordance with responsible consumption and production resource recovery is crucial to create valuable products from waste while reducing the amount of waste generation and decreasing the need for landfill iacovidou et al 2017 kristensen and mosgaard 2020 a circular economy system replaces the regular linear economy model to form a regenerative and zero waste system bilal et al 2020 leyva díaz et al 2020 allwood 2014 indicated that the stability in the quantity and composition of waste derived products is the key to a successful circular economy in agriculture digestate valorization provides a tremendous opportunity to increase the productivity of bio resources and improve the management of organic biowaste such as piggery wastewater in particular the recovery of nutrients from livestock manure digestate has become a critical topic for sustainable agricultural development shi et al 2018 ye et al 2017 nitrogen phosphate and potassium are essential nutrients for plant growth and crop production perera et al 2019 szogi et al 2015 zubair et al 2020 and these nutrients can be separated from digestate therefore it is important to develop cost effective and energy efficient technologies to recover the nutrients from digestate perera et al 2019 wang et al 2020b the available technologies for nutrient recovery from waste streams include precipitation adsorption and membrane separation however these approaches usually require the introduction of extra chemical agents for material e g resin regeneration and or reaction therefore the operating costs of nutrient recovery through these methods would normally be high aghapour aktij et al 2020 hasan et al 2021 perera et al 2019 from the thermodynamic point of view ion separation from a brackish stream e g salinity 20 g l will be much more efficient through electrically driven methods than pressure driven methods pan et al 2018a in electrically driven separation the driving force for ion movement is through external electrical power which can be combined with renewable energy and thus solve its energy storage challenge van der bruggen 2018 electrodialysis ed is one of the electrokinetic separation methods and is suitable for treating water with salinities from a highly brackish level to a briny level therefore ed has been applied for seawater desalination mohammadi et al 2021 swine digestate is generally classified as a highly brackish level because the conductivity of the digestate is in the range of 10 40 ms cm shi et al 2021b wang et al 2020a in other words anaerobic digestate can be concentrated into a bio nutrient product through an ed process in an energy efficient manner this can also facilitate the valorization of digestate because the water content in the concentrated digestate will be significantly lower thereby reducing the transport costs for the digestate products several ed based approaches to digestate valorization have been reported for instance shi et al 2019 evaluated the performance of nutrient recovery from pig manure digestate and its membrane fouling potential using an ed reversal process the highest recovery efficiencies for ammonium and phosphate achieved by shi s group were 100 and 84 respectively similarly wang et al 2022 applied ed for digestate valorization and the achieved recovery ratios of n and p were 65 70 and 53 56 respectively in addition to nutrient recovery shi et al 2021a recently developed an anode ed process to recover nutrients from pig manure digestate while simultaneously removing antibiotics e g sulfadiazine and tetracycline through in situ electrochemical oxidation due to the complexity of digestate compositions it is worth noting the digestate valorization requires a total solution with a portfolio of strategies and processes for nutrient recovery from digestate the separation process should also be optimized to achieve high energy and water efficiencies in fact the modes of operations for an electrochemical device e g controlling the potential or current density significantly affect the separation reaction performance mechanism and energy consumption dykstra et al 2018 rafiee et al 2021 rodriguez arredondo et al 2017 therefore ed operations at constant voltage cv or constant current cc are still an essential question for system optimization despite recent advances the operation modes of ed for nutrient recovery from swine digestate are yet to be systematically evaluated from the perspective of energy water efficiencies and the determination of optimal operations in ed units is still ambiguous this study first evaluates the effect of different operation modes i e cv and cc on the nutrient separation efficiency from anaerobic swine digestate using ed then we focus on the current efficiency of different modes and their associated electromigration performance e g rate constants using kinetic models we also identify the optimal operating conditions by considering process energy consumption and water productivity to deliver energy efficient nutrient separation last we systematically address the engineering and economic performance of the developed process for future scale up deployment we believe this article provides insight into practical applications of digestate valorization through energy efficient separation thereby realizing a circular economy system and a decarbonizing supply chain of bio nutrients 2 materials and methods 2 1 swine liquid digestate in this study we used the liquid digestate from the don haifeng livestock farm in taiwan since the tested digestate was on site treated through membrane bioreactors mbr the portion of solid digestate can be neglected in this study the ph and conductivity of the swine digestate were 8 48 0 05 and 10 89 0 79 ms cm at 25 7 oc respectively the major anions of digestate include cl 408 5 82 1 mg l n 3 and po4 3 118 7 35 1 mg l n 3 with trace no3 16 4 3 9 mg l n 3 the major cations of digestate include nh4 2212 7 191 3 mg l n 3 and k 1393 0 160 8 mg l n 3 with trace ca2 28 2 0 5 mg l n 3 fe3 6 6 0 1 mg l n 3 and mg2 3 8 0 3 mg l n 3 the swine digestate also contained few heavy metals such as cu2 0 16 0 01 mg l n 3 and zn2 0 12 0 01 mg l n 3 2 2 electrodialysis ed set up and experiments fig 1 shows the configurations of the ed process specification as summarized in table s1 a lab scale batch operation using peristaltic bumps intertek 3174782 the uk for dilute and concentrate compartments was established in this study the ed stack contains four cell pairs and each cell pair contains a dilute compartment i e reclaimed water and a concentrate compartment i e bio nutrient product these two compartments were separated by cation neosepta cmx and anion neosepta amx exchange membranes bipolar membranes neosepta bp 0 22 mm were used at both ends of the ed stack for the electrode rinse solution 2 5 na2so4 the cross surface area of the ed stack was 195 cm2 a dc power supply it6942a itech electronic co ltd taiwan was used to provide the electrical field for the stack in this study two distinct operation modes i e constant voltage cv and constant current cc were designed to evaluate the ion separation performance note different operation modes can affect the electromigration behaviors of ions in the course of separation and thus the overall energy consumption here the cv mode applied a constant voltage between the anode and the cathode and thus both the measured electrode potentials and current vary throughout the separation the cc mode provided a constant current density to drive ion transport throughout the separation for the cv mode five levels of measured cell voltages i e 0 8 1 2 1 6 2 0 and 2 4 v cell were designated in the study the cell voltages were measured directly from the ed stack using an lcr multimeter tes 2712 tes electrical electronic co taiwan for the cc mode five levels of applied operating current i e 90 110 130 150 and 170 a m2 were designated in the study the operation time for all experiments is designated as 2 h and the sampling times for each experiment were 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 60 80 100 and 120 min for all experiments the flow rate of both the dilute and concentrate streams were fixed at 0 36 l min corresponding to a velocity of 1 56 cm s the dilute stream was anaerobic swine digestate and the concentrate product stream was 0 1 m sodium chloride as an electrolyte 2 3 analytical methods and characterization this study used both inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes and ion chromatography ic to analyze the compositions of the nutrients and metal substances in water samples the icp oes agilent 5110 usa coupled with an auto sample injector sps 4 was applied in this study to detect metal ions such as calcium ca and potassium k the ic sykam s155 germany coupled with an auto sample injector sykam s5250 germany with the anion column sykam ion a01 2 6 mm 150 mm germany was applied to detect ions such as cl no3 and po4 3 for the ic the carriers for the anion detection were 5 mm naco3 and 25 µm nascn with a flow rate of 1 5 ml min the total detection time for ic was 10 min and the operating temperature remained at 30 ºc 2 4 key performance indicators this study utilized several key performance indicators to evaluate the performance of nutrient recovery from digestate using ed the ion separation efficiency r of nutrients from the digestate is defined by eq 1 1 r d i d t d i 100 where d i is the initial concentration g l or electrical conductivity ec ms cm in the dilute compartment d t is the concentration of nutrients g l or ec ms cm at any time t in the dilute compartment current efficiency ce is defined as the ratio of the charges used for ion transport to the total supplied current charges as described in eq 2 2 c e z f d i d t v f i 0 i t 2 n p mw t 100 where i 0 a and i t a are the initial current and the current at specific time t respectively v f means the volume of the dilute solution l t is the treatment time s z is the ion valence n p is the number of cell pairs mw is the molecular weight of ion g mol f is the faraday constant 96 500 s a mol the energy consumption of the process ec kwh m3 is an important indicator of process energy efficiency and economic costs as described in eq 3 the productivity of the reclaimed water p gal h m2 is calculated by eq 4 3 e c kwh m 3 16700 v i q 4 p gal h m 2 v f 3 785 t r a where v v is the applied voltage i a is the applied current q is the flow rate of produced reclaimed water l min t r indicates the treatment time to reach the target concentration in the dilute stream hr a is the total active membrane area m2 2 5 cost benefit analysis cost benefit analysis can provide information on possible economic benefits after investment and compare the economic feasibility of implementing different proposals in this study the benefit cost ratio bcr is used to understand the relationship between costs and benefits as calculated in eq 5 5 b c r b r c r where b r and c r represent the product sales revenue and the raw material costs respectively if the bcr is less than 1 0 it means the present value of the benefits is lower than the present value of the costs i e a loss making investment therefore a bcr value greater than 1 0 indicates a favorable investment note the capital labor transport and maintenance costs are neglected in the bcr analysis of this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of different operating modes on ion separation efficiency this section evaluates the effect of different operating modes i e cv and cc on the change in ph value and the ion separation efficiency fig 2 a and 2 b show the changes in measured current in cv mode and in measured cell voltage in cc mode respectively in the cv mode as the separation time increases the measured current decreases due to the decreased ec in the dilute stream similarly in the cc mode the measured cell voltage increases as the treatment time increases i e along with the decrease in dilute ec note the theoretical cell voltage of water splitting reaction to produce proton and hydroxide in electrochemistry is 1 23 v park and kwak 2020 in general the water splitting reaction could change the ph value of the dilute and concentrate streams pan et al 2017 and also decrease the current efficiency for the sake of ion transport fig 2 c f show the change in ph values for dilute and concentrate streams under the cv and cc modes it is observed that the ph in the dilute stream decreases and the ph of the concentrate stream increases accordingly in this study the original ph in dilute pw and concentrate synthetic solution streams was 8 5 and 7 3 respectively within the beginning 5 min of separation the hydroxide ions in the dilute stream migrated to the concentrate stream due to the concentration difference and an external electric field therefore significant ph changes in the concentrate stream from 7 3 to 7 8 8 5 depending on the operating conditions were observed for the first 5 min for both the cv and cc modes moreover the change in ph is remarkable when the cell voltage is higher because a more severe hydrolysis reaction occurs this finding is consistent with the previous data reported by bazinet and geoffroy 2020 for the cc mode when the applied current is higher than 110 a m2 the cell voltage for water splitting reactions would be achieved the ph values in the dilute solution change significantly especially at a higher applied current e g 170 a m2 for the cv mode the results of the ph changes are similar to that of the cc mode fig 3 a d illustrate the change in ec values between the dilution and concentration chambers for the cv and cc modes in general the ec values in the dilute stream are gradually decreased with increased treatment time indicating an effective recovery of nutrients from digestate dilute to the product concentrate stream for the cv mode the ec in the digestate initial ec 12 ms cm can be reduced to 0 5 5 0 ms cm at cell voltages of 0 8 2 4 v after 120 min operation the ec in the dilution stream decreases rapidly and then slows over time for the product stream the ec value can increase to approximately 18 ms cm similarly for the cc mode the ec in the digestate initial ec 10 11 ms cm can be reduced to 3 7 ms cm at applied currents of 90 170 a m2 after 120 min operation since the applied current remains constant the driving force for ion transport is consistent throughout the treatment time and thus the slopes for the ec removal in the dilute stream or ec increase in the concentrate stream are neatly linear in this study the maximum ec removal efficiency is 92 8 at a measured cell voltage of 2 4 v cell for an operation time of 120 min for the cv mode fig 3 e summarizes the ion separation efficiency for the cv and cc modes ion separation efficiency eq 1 represents the effectiveness of ion separation from digestate to the concentrate product table s2 presents the details of nutrient we only include nh4 k cl and po4 3 recovery performance such as the ion separation efficiency for the cv and cc modes for the cv mode the ion separation efficiency of nh4 k and cl after a treatment time of 120 min are higher than 88 as the measured cell voltage increases the ion separation efficiency generally increases in this study the separation efficiency of ammonium at a cell voltage of 1 6 2 4 v cell is greater than 90 this is quite competitive with the removal efficiency of common wastewater treatment processes such as anammox perera et al 2019 saxena et al 2021 note the anammox process did not separate the useful resources i e ammonium into a new product thereby considering it a treatment process in this study the developed ed process features as a circular economy practice with a competitive performance to existing processes for ammonium removal for other ions the separation efficiencies of potassium and chloride are 90 7 99 9 and 92 9 95 8 respectively when the measured cell voltage ranges between 0 8 and 2 4 v moreover at a low cell voltage i e 0 8 1 2 v a low ion separation efficiency of po4 3 is observed when the measured cell voltage is 1 6 v the ion separation efficiency of po4 3 can reach 82 5 this might be attributed to the low potential difference at a low cell voltage driving the ion with a high stokes radius in the dilute compartment the major forms of phosphate in a weak alkaline condition 7 0 8 0 are h2po4 and hpo4 2 in addition to membrane hydrophilicity the permselectivities of a membrane towards anions depend on the stokes radius i e the hydrodynamic radius hydrated energy and ionic polarities xua et al 2005 for monovalent anions the permselectivity at an infinite dilution is inversely proportional to the ionic stokes radius therefore the low separation efficiency of phosphate at a low cell voltage could be attributed to its higher stokes radius similar observations were also found in the literature shi et al 2018 wang et al 2015 for the cc mode three ions including nh4 k and cl display excellent separation efficiency when the applied current is higher than 110 a m2 for instance the separation efficiencies of both nh4 and k are greater than 80 when the applied current is higher than 150 a m2 similarly the separation efficiency of cl is greater than 90 if the applied current is higher than 110 a m2 for po4 3 the ion separation efficiency is still low i e about 30 because of the insufficient driving force voltage in most of the designated operating windows note in the reverse ed system producing energy the uphill transport of multivalent ions is often observed moya 2020 the uphill transport takes place from the dilute solution to the concentrate one against the concentration gradient of multivalent ions such as magnesium and phosphate as the ed operation at a low voltage condition behaves like the reverse ed the low efficiency of phosphate might also be attributed to the uphill transport phenomena the obtained results can also provide insight into the selective separation of monovalent and multivalent ions through sequencing operations using different cell voltages in the cv mode for instance as shown in fig 3 e the separation efficiencies for monovalent ions such as nh4 and k at a low cell voltage of 0 8 v are significantly higher e g 85 than that for multivalent ions such as po4 3 e g 5 once monovalent ions are separated from the digestate the cell voltage of ed can increase to 1 6 v for efficient separation of multivalent ions e g 80 the above suggested approach is further discussed in section 3 5 for large scale design of digestate valorization 3 2 effect of operating modes on current efficiency electromigration current efficiency is defined as the ratio of the charges used for ion transport to the total current charges supplied by the external power high current efficiency indicates an effective use of energy for ion separation and thus less energy used on other electrochemical reactions and or the external circuit loss fig 3 f shows the current efficiency for different ions in both the cv and cc modes for the cv mode the current efficiency of monovalent ions e g nh4 k and cl is found to be higher than multivalent ions e g so4 2 and po4 3 at the cell voltage of 0 8 2 4 v the current efficiencies of nh4 i e 43 65 are higher than that of other ions such as k i e 12 19 cl i e 4 7 and po4 3 i e 0 1 1 5 similar findings were reported by ye et al 2019 that the current efficiencies of nh4 k and po4 3 for swine wastewater separation were 30 11 and 4 respectively at a fixed applied voltage of 1 6 v cell with an initial ec of 8 12 ms cm this study also finds the current efficiency reduces as the cell voltage gradually increases this might be attributed to the occurrence of water splitting reactions when the cell voltage is higher than 1 23 v for the cc mode the current efficiencies of nh4 i e 13 20 are higher than that of other ions such as k i e 3 7 6 4 cl i e 0 9 2 4 and po4 3 i e 0 2 the current efficiency decreases as the applied current increases throughout the entire operation of the cc experiments see fig 2 b the measured cell voltage reached the minimum voltage for water splitting and thus a portion of electrons participated in the electrochemical reaction instead of ion transport ye et al 2019 showed at a constant current of 46 9 a m2 the current efficiencies of nh4 k and po4 3 were about 25 10 and 3 respectively in addition the current efficiencies for the cv mode are significantly higher than that for the cc mode suggesting the preferable operation of the cv mode for digestate separation using ed 3 3 determination of electromigration rate constants for different ions for the sake of large scale design the electromigration rate constants under different conditions should be determined to identify the suitable operating window for ion separation it can also help to understand the theoretical reaction mechanism and behaviors of ion separation via the developed process this study applied the first order kinetic model pan et al 2018b to analyze the ion separation under different conditions the kinetic model is provided in the supplementary information table 1 compiles the electromigration rate constant k min 1 under different operating conditions using the first order kinetic model in general the first order kinetic model can effectively describe the behavior of ion separation via the developed ed process the r 2 values for nh4 k and cl range between 0 680 and 0 999 for both the cv and cc modes however po4 3 did not closely follow the first order kinetics because the r 2 values varied widely from 0 064 to 0 957 corresponding to the cell voltage from 0 8 to 2 4 v cell as the cell voltage increases the behavior of po4 3 separation is more fitted to the first order kinetics for the cv mode the maximum rate constants k of nh4 k cl and po4 3 are approximately 0 050 0 003 0 061 0 004 0 080 0 001 and 0 020 0 002 min 1 respectively p 0 05 for the cc mode the maximum rate constant of nh4 k and cl was 0 016 0 001 0 020 0 001 and 0 028 0 001 min 1 respectively p 0 05 fig 4 a shows the effect of operating conditions on the overall electromigration rate constant in terms of ec reduction for both the cv and cc modes it is found that the overall electromigration rate constants for cv mode are higher than that for the cc model in general the rate constant linearly increases with the increased cell voltage in the cv mode r 2 0 930 or applied current in the cc mode r 2 0 998 the maximum rate constants of separation in terms of ec for the cv and cc modes are 0 026 0 002 and 0 009 0 001 min 1 respectively p 0 05 the obtained results in this section provide a basis for reliable predictions of future large scale design in addition to the kinetic models a few mechanistic models have been developed for electrochemical separation systems in the literature for instance thompson brewster et al 2016 considered the effect of mass transport in conventional speciation models and they found most of the resistance energy consumption in electrochemical separation for nutrient recovery could be attributed to the membranes 35 70 in their case in this study the effect of current density 90 170 a m2 on the ec reduction rate under the cc mode was not significant especially in the beginning 40 min see fig 2 b it was observed that the initial voltage profiles of cc mode mostly before 40 min were operated at a low cell voltage in the region of limiting current zone in the course of separation from 0 to 120 min the ec reduction rate in cc mode almost remained constant i e a similar slope for the ec time curve as shown in fig 3 c since the applied current is proportional to the mass of ion transport through ion exchange membranes the operations with a cc mode can provide a constant rate flux of ion transport throughout the separation under the cc mode the applied current density is the key parameter for process design i e the treatment capacity rather than separation time in contrast under the cv mode both the cell voltage and separation time play important roles in the ec reduction rate the ec reduction rate in the beginning 40 min was faster and then gradually slowed after 40 min see fig 3 a also the initial separation rate at a cell voltage higher than 1 6 v cell was significantly greater than that at a low cell voltage e g 0 8 or 1 2 v cell from the perspective of practical operations a high initial separation rate i e the cv mode at a cell voltage higher than 1 6 v would be favorable because the associated productivity of reclaimed water is greater thereby resulting in a higher treatment capacity or a lower land footprint a smaller reactor size 3 4 addressing energy consumption and productivity for optimization the cost effectiveness of separation processes requires relatively low energy consumption with relatively high productivity pan et al 2018b fig s1 a and s1 b show the effect of the effluent ec on the process energy consumption eq 3 and productivity of treated water eq 4 for the cv and cc modes respectively the results indicate that for the same level of effluent ec both process energy consumption and productivity generally increase as the applied cell voltage of current increases a higher voltage or current can facilitate the separation and thus increase the productivity of treated water while resulting in higher energy consumption similarly with a more complete separation i e a lower effluent ec the required process energy consumption will be higher thereby leading to less productivity for the same intensity of applied cell voltage or current in addition for the cc mode fig s1 b the trends of process energy consumption using various current densities from 90 to 170 a m2 are similar which are quite different to the cv mode see fig s1 a table 2 presents the process energy consumption and productivity in representative cases for an effluent ec of 4 6 ms cm in cv i e separation efficiency 60 or 7 0 ms cm in cc i e separation efficiency 30 based on these assumptions the cv mode can deliver treated water with 4 6 ms cm at an energy consumption of 0 58 1 61 kwh m3 corresponding to a productivity of 2 4 7 3 gal m2 hr similarly the cc mode can deliver treated water with 7 0 ms cm at an energy consumption of 0 03 0 08 kwh m3 corresponding to a productivity of 2 0 5 0 gal m2 hr note the achieved performances are competitive with other available methods for digestate treatment from the perspective of treated water quality fig 4 b and 4 c show the effect of water productivity on process energy consumption at various effluent ec for cv and cc modes respectively these results can be directly used to identify the energy consumption at a designated productivity corresponding to the size of the stack for achieving the targeted effluent ec mostly depending on the standard of the use purpose for instance with the targeted effluent ec of 2 ms cm the cv mode operation see fig 4 b can achieve a productivity level of 2 31 2 96 gal hr m2 for treated water at an energy consumption of 1 62 2 31 kwh m3 the results also indicate that energy consumption and productivity are positively correlated to each other to further balance the process energy consumption and productivity at a designated effluent ec response surface models i e two factors five levels are established in this study table s3 see supplementary information summarizes the parameters used in the response surface models the developed responses include separation efficiency particularly for ec nh4 and po4 3 process energy consumption see fig 4 d e as an example for the cv mode and the productivity of treated water the detailed results of the developed response surface models are provided in the supplementary information see tables s4 s13 according to the response surface models one candidate of the ideal operating conditions for the cv mode to achieve the total ec removal of 93 should be at an applied cell voltage of 1 15 v for 60 min corresponding to a productivity of 5 24 gal hr m2 at an energy consumption of 0 44 kwh m3 see table 2 similarly for the cc mode one candidate of the ideal operating conditions to achieve a total ec removal of 61 should be at an applied current of 150 a m2 for 120 min corresponding to a productivity of 2 22 gal hr m2 at an energy consumption of 0 63 kwh m3 the results also indicate a favorable operation of the cv mode compared to the cc mode due to its higher productivity of reclaimed water with lower energy consumption in this study the required energy consumption for nitrogen recovery using the developed ed was about 0 24 15 2 kwh kg n 0 86 54 7 kj g n corresponding to the removal ratio of ammonium from 70 8 to 99 1 see details in fig 4 f the obtained results exhibited a competitive performance for nutrient recovery from wastewater kuntke et al 2018 developed an energy efficient h2 recycling electrochemical system to recover nitrogen from synthetic urine at a bench scale of 76 gal m2 day an average nitrogen recovery of 58 can be obtained at a current density of 100 a m2 with an energy input of 6 5 kwh kg n 23 4 kj g n ward et al 2018 also deployed a pilot scale system with ed separation and struvite precipitation for nitrogen recovery from digestate and the energy consumption in ed was about 4 9 1 5 kwh kg n other ed like systems for nitrogen recovery from wastewater showed an energy consumption of 1 25 8 5 kwh kg n 4 5 30 6 kj g n depending on the design of the configurations influent concentration and current density rodrigues et al 2020 3 5 insights into large scale nutrients recovery engineering and economic aspects liquid digestate contains nutrients and valuable elements that possess high potential for recovering resources and thus realizing a circular economy fig 5 shows the conceptual design of cascading separation processes for digestate valorization as biofertilizers nutrients organic acids and reclaimed water note the organics in digestate are typically retained after ed processes for instance wang et al 2022 reported a toc loss of 4 9 11 4 after ed due to the water transfer by the osmotic pressure difference the chemical oxygen demand of swine digestate varies from site to site ranging from 1 6 to 14 9 g l as presented in table s14 the high content of organic components in swine digestate can disturb the performance of the membrane processes due to the organic fouling therefore as indicated in this conceptual design it is essential to remove and or recover the organic portion in wastewater or digestate prior to membrane processes for the removal of organics selective oxidation while retaining nutrients for potential reuse as a fertilizer has been reported jermakka et al 2021 notably another approach to recovering organics from swine wastewater is through adsorption based extraction processes which can produce humin humin acid and fulvic acid at high purities chen et al 2021 in fact these organic components can be used as biofertilizers and thus reduce the indirect carbon emissions from the production of inorganic fertilizers the adsorption based extraction processes also generate a nutrient rich stream which can be treated by the ed process the nutrients in this stream can be concentrated by ed and then recovered via struvite precipitation and air stripping in this study the developed ed process could efficiently recover nutrients as a concentrate solution which can further convert to value added chemical precipitate crystals such as struvite and ammonium sulfate the purity of struvite and ammonium sulfate products that could be achieved using state of the art struvite and air stripping recovery processes is about 95 and 98 respectively tao and ukwuani 2015 wu and vaneeckhaute 2022 the market prices of struvite and ammonium sulfate were approximately 121 500 and 119 500 usd per ton respectively depending on the purity wu and vaneeckhaute 2022 to promote a circular economy the development of nutrient recovery processes from liquid digestate is of great importance the operating costs such as chemical agents and energy consumption and benefits from the recovered bioproducts should be systematically determined in addition the remaining organic acids in the digestate can be further separated via electrodeionization for instance datta et al 2013 demonstrated the capability of electrodeionization to separate acetic and sulfuric acids from hydrolysate liquor the achieved separation efficiencies of sulfuric and acetic acids by electrodeionization were over 99 and 95 respectively datta et al 2013 table 3 presents the preliminary analyses on the benefits and costs of the ed based nutrient recovery process the system boundary for benefit cost analysis is highlighted in the red portion in fig 5 see details in fig s2 tables s15 and s16 see supplementary information summarize the details of the assumptions and calculation equations the treatment capacity of the digestate via the developed process is assumed to be 100 000 m3 d the results indicate that the daily costs for the proposed boundary of treatment are about 240 490 usd and the operation and maintenance costs for membranes share a significant portion 48 of the total costs the average treatment cost for one tonne of digestate is approximately 2 41 usd a similar observation was reported by wang et al 2022 that the digestate desalination cost was 5 22 usd t with a daily treatment capacity of 100 m3 in this study the daily benefits from the designated system boundary are expected to be 356 000 usd and thus the associated bcr see eq 5 value is about 1 48 showing a favorable investment despite its potential for wide deployment the uncertainty of the economic analyses includes the composition of swine digestate and the prices of the bioproduct sales depending on the purity e g struvite and ammonium sulfate the composition of swine liquid digestate see table s14 varies widely from site to site and could influence the separation performance and the purity of the bioproduct the distance between the source of the swine liquid digestate and the recycling plant also affect the economic viability of the nutrient recovery processes therefore the uncertainty analysis and the feasibility of large scale operations including the energy consumption of the whole cascading systems will be performed from the life cycle perspective in our future studies 4 conclusions this study designed two operating modes of ed i e constant voltage cv and constant current cc to evaluate the nutrient separation efficiency from anaerobic swine digestate and its associated energy efficiency for the cv mode the maximum ec removal efficiency is 92 8 at a measured cell voltage of 2 4 v cell for an operation time of 120 min and the associated ion separation efficiency of nh4 k and cl are higher than 88 the results also indicate the current efficiency of monovalent ions e g nh4 k and cl is higher than multivalent ions e g so4 2 and po4 3 in particular the current efficiencies of nh4 i e 43 65 are higher than that of other ions such as k i e 12 19 cl i e 4 7 and po4 3 i e 0 1 1 5 to identify a suitable operating window for ion separation the ion electromigration performance e g rate constants is determined using a first order kinetic model the first order kinetic model can effectively describe the behavior of ion separation via the developed ed process in this study for the cv mode the maximum rate constants k of nh4 k cl and po4 3 are approximately 0 050 0 003 0 061 0 004 0 080 0 001 and 0 020 0 002 min 1 respectively p 0 05 the obtained rate constant also linearly increases with the increased cell voltage in the cv mode r 2 0 930 or applied current in the cc mode r 2 0 998 in addition the process energy consumption and productivity are balanced using response surface models to deliver energy efficient nutrient separation the results indicate the cv mode can deliver treated water with 4 6 ms cm at an energy consumption of 0 58 1 61 kwh m3 corresponding to a productivity of 2 4 7 3 gal m2 hr similarly the cc mode can deliver a treated water with 7 0 ms cm at the energy consumption of 0 03 0 08 kwh m3 corresponding to a productivity of 2 0 5 0 gal m2 hr for all cases the required energy consumption for nitrogen recovery using the developed ed was about 0 24 15 2 kwh kg n 0 86 54 7 kj g n corresponding to a removal ratio of ammonium from 70 8 to 99 1 last according to the preliminary economic analyses with an assumed digestate treatment capacity of 100 000 m3 d the nutrient recovery process via energy efficient ed shows a favorable operation because the bcr ratio is 1 48 the results provide insight into

15513,the development of cost effective and energy efficient technologies to recover nutrients from digestate is important anaerobic digestate can be concentrated into bio nutrient products through an electrodialysis ed process in an energy efficient manner despite recent advances the operation modes of ed for nutrient recovery from swine digestate are yet to be systematically evaluated from the perspective of energy water efficiencies and the determination of optimal operations in ed units is still ambiguous in this study two different operating modes of electrodialysis i e constant voltage and constant current are designed to evaluate the energy efficiency and effectiveness of nutrient recovery from anaerobic swine digestate the ion removal ratio and current efficiency of the different modes and their associated electromigration performance e g rate constants are evaluated the results indicate that the maximum removal efficiency in terms of electrical conductivity is 92 8 at a cell voltage of 2 4 v cell using the constant voltage operation the current efficiencies of nh4 43 65 are higher than that of other ions such as k 12 19 cl 4 7 and po4 3 0 1 1 5 for nitrogen recovery the required energy consumption was about 0 24 15 2 kwh kg n 0 86 54 7 kj g n corresponding to a removal ratio of ammonium from 70 8 to 99 1 based on the experimental data the optimal operating conditions are identified using response surface models by considering process energy consumption and productivity to deliver energy efficient nutrient separation one candidate of the ideal conditions to achieve the total ion removal of 93 should be operated at a constant cell voltage of 1 15 v corresponding to a productivity of 5 24 gal hr m2 at an energy consumption of 0 44 kwh m3 last a conceptual design of cascading separation processes is proposed for digestate valorization as biofertilizers nutrients organic acids and reclaimed water a preliminary benefit cost evaluation is then performed to evaluate the engineering and economic performance of the developed process for nutrient recovery from swine digestate this article provides insight into practical large scale applications of digestate

responsible consumption and production resource recovery is crucial to create valuable products from waste while reducing the amount of waste generation and decreasing the need for landfill iacovidou et al 2017 kristensen and mosgaard 2020 a circular economy system replaces the regular linear economy model to form a regenerative and zero waste system bilal et al 2020 leyva díaz et al 2020 allwood 2014 indicated that the stability in the quantity and composition of waste derived products is the key to a successful circular economy in agriculture digestate valorization provides a tremendous opportunity to increase the productivity of bio resources and improve the management of organic biowaste such as piggery wastewater in particular the recovery of nutrients from livestock manure digestate has become a critical topic for sustainable agricultural development shi et al 2018 ye et al 2017 nitrogen phosphate and potassium are essential nutrients for plant growth and crop production perera et al 2019 szogi et al 2015 zubair et al 2020 and these nutrients can be separated from digestate therefore it is important to develop cost effective and energy efficient technologies to recover the nutrients from digestate perera et al 2019 wang et al 2020b the available technologies for nutrient recovery from waste streams include precipitation adsorption and membrane separation however these approaches usually require the introduction of extra chemical agents for material e g resin regeneration and or reaction therefore the operating costs of nutrient recovery through these methods would normally be high aghapour aktij et al 2020 hasan et al 2021 perera et al 2019 from the thermodynamic point of view ion separation from a brackish stream e g salinity 20 g l will be much more efficient through electrically driven methods than pressure driven methods pan et al 2018a in electrically driven separation the driving force for ion movement is through external electrical power which can be combined with renewable energy and thus solve its energy storage challenge van der bruggen 2018 electrodialysis ed is one of the electrokinetic separation methods and is suitable for treating water with salinities from a highly brackish level to a briny level therefore ed has been applied for seawater desalination mohammadi et al 2021 swine digestate is generally classified as a highly brackish level because the conductivity of the digestate is in the range of 10 40 ms cm shi et al 2021b wang et al 2020a in other words anaerobic digestate can be concentrated into a bio nutrient product through an ed process in an energy efficient manner this can also facilitate the valorization of digestate because the water content in the concentrated digestate will be significantly lower thereby reducing the transport costs for the digestate products several ed based approaches to digestate valorization have been reported for instance shi et al 2019 evaluated the performance of nutrient recovery from pig manure digestate and its membrane fouling potential using an ed reversal process the highest recovery efficiencies for ammonium and phosphate achieved by shi s group were 100 and 84 respectively similarly wang et al 2022 applied ed for digestate valorization and the achieved recovery ratios of n and p were 65 70 and 53 56 respectively in addition to nutrient recovery shi et al 2021a recently developed an anode ed process to recover nutrients from pig manure digestate while simultaneously removing antibiotics e g sulfadiazine and tetracycline through in situ electrochemical oxidation due to the complexity of digestate compositions it is worth noting the digestate valorization requires a total solution with a portfolio of strategies and processes for nutrient recovery from digestate the separation process should also be optimized to achieve high energy and water efficiencies in fact the modes of operations for an electrochemical device e g controlling the potential or current density significantly affect the separation reaction performance mechanism and energy consumption dykstra et al 2018 rafiee et al 2021 rodriguez arredondo et al 2017 therefore ed operations at constant voltage cv or constant current cc are still an essential question for system optimization despite recent advances the operation modes of ed for nutrient recovery from swine digestate are yet to be systematically evaluated from the perspective of energy water efficiencies and the determination of optimal operations in ed units is still ambiguous this study first evaluates the effect of different operation modes i e cv and cc on the nutrient separation efficiency from anaerobic swine digestate using ed then we focus on the current efficiency of different modes and their associated electromigration performance e g rate constants using kinetic models we also identify the optimal operating conditions by considering process energy consumption and water productivity to deliver energy efficient nutrient separation last we systematically address the engineering and economic performance of the developed process for future scale up deployment we believe this article provides insight into practical applications of digestate valorization through energy efficient separation thereby realizing a circular economy system and a decarbonizing supply chain of bio nutrients 2 materials and methods 2 1 swine liquid digestate in this study we used the liquid digestate from the don haifeng livestock farm in taiwan since the tested digestate was on site treated through membrane bioreactors mbr the portion of solid digestate can be neglected in this study the ph and conductivity of the swine digestate were 8 48 0 05 and 10 89 0 79 ms cm at 25 7 oc respectively the major anions of digestate include cl 408 5 82 1 mg l n 3 and po4 3 118 7 35 1 mg l n 3 with trace no3 16 4 3 9 mg l n 3 the major cations of digestate include nh4 2212 7 191 3 mg l n 3 and k 1393 0 160 8 mg l n 3 with trace ca2 28 2 0 5 mg l n 3 fe3 6 6 0 1 mg l n 3 and mg2 3 8 0 3 mg l n 3 the swine digestate also contained few heavy metals such as cu2 0 16 0 01 mg l n 3 and zn2 0 12 0 01 mg l n 3 2 2 electrodialysis ed set up and experiments fig 1 shows the configurations of the ed process specification as summarized in table s1 a lab scale batch operation using peristaltic bumps intertek 3174782 the uk for dilute and concentrate compartments was established in this study the ed stack contains four cell pairs and each cell pair contains a dilute compartment i e reclaimed water and a concentrate compartment i e bio nutrient product these two compartments were separated by cation neosepta cmx and anion neosepta amx exchange membranes bipolar membranes neosepta bp 0 22 mm were used at both ends of the ed stack for the electrode rinse solution 2 5 na2so4 the cross surface area of the ed stack was 195 cm2 a dc power supply it6942a itech electronic co ltd taiwan was used to provide the electrical field for the stack in this study two distinct operation modes i e constant voltage cv and constant current cc were designed to evaluate the ion separation performance note different operation modes can affect the electromigration behaviors of ions in the course of separation and thus the overall energy consumption here the cv mode applied a constant voltage between the anode and the cathode and thus both the measured electrode potentials and current vary throughout the separation the cc mode provided a constant current density to drive ion transport throughout the separation for the cv mode five levels of measured cell voltages i e 0 8 1 2 1 6 2 0 and 2 4 v cell were designated in the study the cell voltages were measured directly from the ed stack using an lcr multimeter tes 2712 tes electrical electronic co taiwan for the cc mode five levels of applied operating current i e 90 110 130 150 and 170 a m2 were designated in the study the operation time for all experiments is designated as 2 h and the sampling times for each experiment were 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 60 80 100 and 120 min for all experiments the flow rate of both the dilute and concentrate streams were fixed at 0 36 l min corresponding to a velocity of 1 56 cm s the dilute stream was anaerobic swine digestate and the concentrate product stream was 0 1 m sodium chloride as an electrolyte 2 3 analytical methods and characterization this study used both inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes and ion chromatography ic to analyze the compositions of the nutrients and metal substances in water samples the icp oes agilent 5110 usa coupled with an auto sample injector sps 4 was applied in this study to detect metal ions such as calcium ca and potassium k the ic sykam s155 germany coupled with an auto sample injector sykam s5250 germany with the anion column sykam ion a01 2 6 mm 150 mm germany was applied to detect ions such as cl no3 and po4 3 for the ic the carriers for the anion detection were 5 mm naco3 and 25 µm nascn with a flow rate of 1 5 ml min the total detection time for ic was 10 min and the operating temperature remained at 30 ºc 2 4 key performance indicators this study utilized several key performance indicators to evaluate the performance of nutrient recovery from digestate using ed the ion separation efficiency r of nutrients from the digestate is defined by eq 1 1 r d i d t d i 100 where d i is the initial concentration g l or electrical conductivity ec ms cm in the dilute compartment d t is the concentration of nutrients g l or ec ms cm at any time t in the dilute compartment current efficiency ce is defined as the ratio of the charges used for ion transport to the total supplied current charges as described in eq 2 2 c e z f d i d t v f i 0 i t 2 n p mw t 100 where i 0 a and i t a are the initial current and the current at specific time t respectively v f means the volume of the dilute solution l t is the treatment time s z is the ion valence n p is the number of cell pairs mw is the molecular weight of ion g mol f is the faraday constant 96 500 s a mol the energy consumption of the process ec kwh m3 is an important indicator of process energy efficiency and economic costs as described in eq 3 the productivity of the reclaimed water p gal h m2 is calculated by eq 4 3 e c kwh m 3 16700 v i q 4 p gal h m 2 v f 3 785 t r a where v v is the applied voltage i a is the applied current q is the flow rate of produced reclaimed water l min t r indicates the treatment time to reach the target concentration in the dilute stream hr a is the total active membrane area m2 2 5 cost benefit analysis cost benefit analysis can provide information on possible economic benefits after investment and compare the economic feasibility of implementing different proposals in this study the benefit cost ratio bcr is used to understand the relationship between costs and benefits as calculated in eq 5 5 b c r b r c r where b r and c r represent the product sales revenue and the raw material costs respectively if the bcr is less than 1 0 it means the present value of the benefits is lower than the present value of the costs i e a loss making investment therefore a bcr value greater than 1 0 indicates a favorable investment note the capital labor transport and maintenance costs are neglected in the bcr analysis of this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of different operating modes on ion separation efficiency this section evaluates the effect of different operating modes i e cv and cc on the change in ph value and the ion separation efficiency fig 2 a and 2 b show the changes in measured current in cv mode and in measured cell voltage in cc mode respectively in the cv mode as the separation time increases the measured current decreases due to the decreased ec in the dilute stream similarly in the cc mode the measured cell voltage increases as the treatment time increases i e along with the decrease in dilute ec note the theoretical cell voltage of water splitting reaction to produce proton and hydroxide in electrochemistry is 1 23 v park and kwak 2020 in general the water splitting reaction could change the ph value of the dilute and concentrate streams pan et al 2017 and also decrease the current efficiency for the sake of ion transport fig 2 c f show the change in ph values for dilute and concentrate streams under the cv and cc modes it is observed that the ph in the dilute stream decreases and the ph of the concentrate stream increases accordingly in this study the original ph in dilute pw and concentrate synthetic solution streams was 8 5 and 7 3 respectively within the beginning 5 min of separation the hydroxide ions in the dilute stream migrated to the concentrate stream due to the concentration difference and an external electric field therefore significant ph changes in the concentrate stream from 7 3 to 7 8 8 5 depending on the operating conditions were observed for the first 5 min for both the cv and cc modes moreover the change in ph is remarkable when the cell voltage is higher because a more severe hydrolysis reaction occurs this finding is consistent with the previous data reported by bazinet and geoffroy 2020 for the cc mode when the applied current is higher than 110 a m2 the cell voltage for water splitting reactions would be achieved the ph values in the dilute solution change significantly especially at a higher applied current e g 170 a m2 for the cv mode the results of the ph changes are similar to that of the cc mode fig 3 a d illustrate the change in ec values between the dilution and concentration chambers for the cv and cc modes in general the ec values in the dilute stream are gradually decreased with increased treatment time indicating an effective recovery of nutrients from digestate dilute to the product concentrate stream for the cv mode the ec in the digestate initial ec 12 ms cm can be reduced to 0 5 5 0 ms cm at cell voltages of 0 8 2 4 v after 120 min operation the ec in the dilution stream decreases rapidly and then slows over time for the product stream the ec value can increase to approximately 18 ms cm similarly for the cc mode the ec in the digestate initial ec 10 11 ms cm can be reduced to 3 7 ms cm at applied currents of 90 170 a m2 after 120 min operation since the applied current remains constant the driving force for ion transport is consistent throughout the treatment time and thus the slopes for the ec removal in the dilute stream or ec increase in the concentrate stream are neatly linear in this study the maximum ec removal efficiency is 92 8 at a measured cell voltage of 2 4 v cell for an operation time of 120 min for the cv mode fig 3 e summarizes the ion separation efficiency for the cv and cc modes ion separation efficiency eq 1 represents the effectiveness of ion separation from digestate to the concentrate product table s2 presents the details of nutrient we only include nh4 k cl and po4 3 recovery performance such as the ion separation efficiency for the cv and cc modes for the cv mode the ion separation efficiency of nh4 k and cl after a treatment time of 120 min are higher than 88 as the measured cell voltage increases the ion separation efficiency generally increases in this study the separation efficiency of ammonium at a cell voltage of 1 6 2 4 v cell is greater than 90 this is quite competitive with the removal efficiency of common wastewater treatment processes such as anammox perera et al 2019 saxena et al 2021 note the anammox process did not separate the useful resources i e ammonium into a new product thereby considering it a treatment process in this study the developed ed process features as a circular economy practice with a competitive performance to existing processes for ammonium removal for other ions the separation efficiencies of potassium and chloride are 90 7 99 9 and 92 9 95 8 respectively when the measured cell voltage ranges between 0 8 and 2 4 v moreover at a low cell voltage i e 0 8 1 2 v a low ion separation efficiency of po4 3 is observed when the measured cell voltage is 1 6 v the ion separation efficiency of po4 3 can reach 82 5 this might be attributed to the low potential difference at a low cell voltage driving the ion with a high stokes radius in the dilute compartment the major forms of phosphate in a weak alkaline condition 7 0 8 0 are h2po4 and hpo4 2 in addition to membrane hydrophilicity the permselectivities of a membrane towards anions depend on the stokes radius i e the hydrodynamic radius hydrated energy and ionic polarities xua et al 2005 for monovalent anions the permselectivity at an infinite dilution is inversely proportional to the ionic stokes radius therefore the low separation efficiency of phosphate at a low cell voltage could be attributed to its higher stokes radius similar observations were also found in the literature shi et al 2018 wang et al 2015 for the cc mode three ions including nh4 k and cl display excellent separation efficiency when the applied current is higher than 110 a m2 for instance the separation efficiencies of both nh4 and k are greater than 80 when the applied current is higher than 150 a m2 similarly the separation efficiency of cl is greater than 90 if the applied current is higher than 110 a m2 for po4 3 the ion separation efficiency is still low i e about 30 because of the insufficient driving force voltage in most of the designated operating windows note in the reverse ed system producing energy the uphill transport of multivalent ions is often observed moya 2020 the uphill transport takes place from the dilute solution to the concentrate one against the concentration gradient of multivalent ions such as magnesium and phosphate as the ed operation at a low voltage condition behaves like the reverse ed the low efficiency of phosphate might also be attributed to the uphill transport phenomena the obtained results can also provide insight into the selective separation of monovalent and multivalent ions through sequencing operations using different cell voltages in the cv mode for instance as shown in fig 3 e the separation efficiencies for monovalent ions such as nh4 and k at a low cell voltage of 0 8 v are significantly higher e g 85 than that for multivalent ions such as po4 3 e g 5 once monovalent ions are separated from the digestate the cell voltage of ed can increase to 1 6 v for efficient separation of multivalent ions e g 80 the above suggested approach is further discussed in section 3 5 for large scale design of digestate valorization 3 2 effect of operating modes on current efficiency electromigration current efficiency is defined as the ratio of the charges used for ion transport to the total current charges supplied by the external power high current efficiency indicates an effective use of energy for ion separation and thus less energy used on other electrochemical reactions and or the external circuit loss fig 3 f shows the current efficiency for different ions in both the cv and cc modes for the cv mode the current efficiency of monovalent ions e g nh4 k and cl is found to be higher than multivalent ions e g so4 2 and po4 3 at the cell voltage of 0 8 2 4 v the current efficiencies of nh4 i e 43 65 are higher than that of other ions such as k i e 12 19 cl i e 4 7 and po4 3 i e 0 1 1 5 similar findings were reported by ye et al 2019 that the current efficiencies of nh4 k and po4 3 for swine wastewater separation were 30 11 and 4 respectively at a fixed applied voltage of 1 6 v cell with an initial ec of 8 12 ms cm this study also finds the current efficiency reduces as the cell voltage gradually increases this might be attributed to the occurrence of water splitting reactions when the cell voltage is higher than 1 23 v for the cc mode the current efficiencies of nh4 i e 13 20 are higher than that of other ions such as k i e 3 7 6 4 cl i e 0 9 2 4 and po4 3 i e 0 2 the current efficiency decreases as the applied current increases throughout the entire operation of the cc experiments see fig 2 b the measured cell voltage reached the minimum voltage for water splitting and thus a portion of electrons participated in the electrochemical reaction instead of ion transport ye et al 2019 showed at a constant current of 46 9 a m2 the current efficiencies of nh4 k and po4 3 were about 25 10 and 3 respectively in addition the current efficiencies for the cv mode are significantly higher than that for the cc mode suggesting the preferable operation of the cv mode for digestate separation using ed 3 3 determination of electromigration rate constants for different ions for the sake of large scale design the electromigration rate constants under different conditions should be determined to identify the suitable operating window for ion separation it can also help to understand the theoretical reaction mechanism and behaviors of ion separation via the developed process this study applied the first order kinetic model pan et al 2018b to analyze the ion separation under different conditions the kinetic model is provided in the supplementary information table 1 compiles the electromigration rate constant k min 1 under different operating conditions using the first order kinetic model in general the first order kinetic model can effectively describe the behavior of ion separation via the developed ed process the r 2 values for nh4 k and cl range between 0 680 and 0 999 for both the cv and cc modes however po4 3 did not closely follow the first order kinetics because the r 2 values varied widely from 0 064 to 0 957 corresponding to the cell voltage from 0 8 to 2 4 v cell as the cell voltage increases the behavior of po4 3 separation is more fitted to the first order kinetics for the cv mode the maximum rate constants k of nh4 k cl and po4 3 are approximately 0 050 0 003 0 061 0 004 0 080 0 001 and 0 020 0 002 min 1 respectively p 0 05 for the cc mode the maximum rate constant of nh4 k and cl was 0 016 0 001 0 020 0 001 and 0 028 0 001 min 1 respectively p 0 05 fig 4 a shows the effect of operating conditions on the overall electromigration rate constant in terms of ec reduction for both the cv and cc modes it is found that the overall electromigration rate constants for cv mode are higher than that for the cc model in general the rate constant linearly increases with the increased cell voltage in the cv mode r 2 0 930 or applied current in the cc mode r 2 0 998 the maximum rate constants of separation in terms of ec for the cv and cc modes are 0 026 0 002 and 0 009 0 001 min 1 respectively p 0 05 the obtained results in this section provide a basis for reliable predictions of future large scale design in addition to the kinetic models a few mechanistic models have been developed for electrochemical separation systems in the literature for instance thompson brewster et al 2016 considered the effect of mass transport in conventional speciation models and they found most of the resistance energy consumption in electrochemical separation for nutrient recovery could be attributed to the membranes 35 70 in their case in this study the effect of current density 90 170 a m2 on the ec reduction rate under the cc mode was not significant especially in the beginning 40 min see fig 2 b it was observed that the initial voltage profiles of cc mode mostly before 40 min were operated at a low cell voltage in the region of limiting current zone in the course of separation from 0 to 120 min the ec reduction rate in cc mode almost remained constant i e a similar slope for the ec time curve as shown in fig 3 c since the applied current is proportional to the mass of ion transport through ion exchange membranes the operations with a cc mode can provide a constant rate flux of ion transport throughout the separation under the cc mode the applied current density is the key parameter for process design i e the treatment capacity rather than separation time in contrast under the cv mode both the cell voltage and separation time play important roles in the ec reduction rate the ec reduction rate in the beginning 40 min was faster and then gradually slowed after 40 min see fig 3 a also the initial separation rate at a cell voltage higher than 1 6 v cell was significantly greater than that at a low cell voltage e g 0 8 or 1 2 v cell from the perspective of practical operations a high initial separation rate i e the cv mode at a cell voltage higher than 1 6 v would be favorable because the associated productivity of reclaimed water is greater thereby resulting in a higher treatment capacity or a lower land footprint a smaller reactor size 3 4 addressing energy consumption and productivity for optimization the cost effectiveness of separation processes requires relatively low energy consumption with relatively high productivity pan et al 2018b fig s1 a and s1 b show the effect of the effluent ec on the process energy consumption eq 3 and productivity of treated water eq 4 for the cv and cc modes respectively the results indicate that for the same level of effluent ec both process energy consumption and productivity generally increase as the applied cell voltage of current increases a higher voltage or current can facilitate the separation and thus increase the productivity of treated water while resulting in higher energy consumption similarly with a more complete separation i e a lower effluent ec the required process energy consumption will be higher thereby leading to less productivity for the same intensity of applied cell voltage or current in addition for the cc mode fig s1 b the trends of process energy consumption using various current densities from 90 to 170 a m2 are similar which are quite different to the cv mode see fig s1 a table 2 presents the process energy consumption and productivity in representative cases for an effluent ec of 4 6 ms cm in cv i e separation efficiency 60 or 7 0 ms cm in cc i e separation efficiency 30 based on these assumptions the cv mode can deliver treated water with 4 6 ms cm at an energy consumption of 0 58 1 61 kwh m3 corresponding to a productivity of 2 4 7 3 gal m2 hr similarly the cc mode can deliver treated water with 7 0 ms cm at an energy consumption of 0 03 0 08 kwh m3 corresponding to a productivity of 2 0 5 0 gal m2 hr note the achieved performances are competitive with other available methods for digestate treatment from the perspective of treated water quality fig 4 b and 4 c show the effect of water productivity on process energy consumption at various effluent ec for cv and cc modes respectively these results can be directly used to identify the energy consumption at a designated productivity corresponding to the size of the stack for achieving the targeted effluent ec mostly depending on the standard of the use purpose for instance with the targeted effluent ec of 2 ms cm the cv mode operation see fig 4 b can achieve a productivity level of 2 31 2 96 gal hr m2 for treated water at an energy consumption of 1 62 2 31 kwh m3 the results also indicate that energy consumption and productivity are positively correlated to each other to further balance the process energy consumption and productivity at a designated effluent ec response surface models i e two factors five levels are established in this study table s3 see supplementary information summarizes the parameters used in the response surface models the developed responses include separation efficiency particularly for ec nh4 and po4 3 process energy consumption see fig 4 d e as an example for the cv mode and the productivity of treated water the detailed results of the developed response surface models are provided in the supplementary information see tables s4 s13 according to the response surface models one candidate of the ideal operating conditions for the cv mode to achieve the total ec removal of 93 should be at an applied cell voltage of 1 15 v for 60 min corresponding to a productivity of 5 24 gal hr m2 at an energy consumption of 0 44 kwh m3 see table 2 similarly for the cc mode one candidate of the ideal operating conditions to achieve a total ec removal of 61 should be at an applied current of 150 a m2 for 120 min corresponding to a productivity of 2 22 gal hr m2 at an energy consumption of 0 63 kwh m3 the results also indicate a favorable operation of the cv mode compared to the cc mode due to its higher productivity of reclaimed water with lower energy consumption in this study the required energy consumption for nitrogen recovery using the developed ed was about 0 24 15 2 kwh kg n 0 86 54 7 kj g n corresponding to the removal ratio of ammonium from 70 8 to 99 1 see details in fig 4 f the obtained results exhibited a competitive performance for nutrient recovery from wastewater kuntke et al 2018 developed an energy efficient h2 recycling electrochemical system to recover nitrogen from synthetic urine at a bench scale of 76 gal m2 day an average nitrogen recovery of 58 can be obtained at a current density of 100 a m2 with an energy input of 6 5 kwh kg n 23 4 kj g n ward et al 2018 also deployed a pilot scale system with ed separation and struvite precipitation for nitrogen recovery from digestate and the energy consumption in ed was about 4 9 1 5 kwh kg n other ed like systems for nitrogen recovery from wastewater showed an energy consumption of 1 25 8 5 kwh kg n 4 5 30 6 kj g n depending on the design of the configurations influent concentration and current density rodrigues et al 2020 3 5 insights into large scale nutrients recovery engineering and economic aspects liquid digestate contains nutrients and valuable elements that possess high potential for recovering resources and thus realizing a circular economy fig 5 shows the conceptual design of cascading separation processes for digestate valorization as biofertilizers nutrients organic acids and reclaimed water note the organics in digestate are typically retained after ed processes for instance wang et al 2022 reported a toc loss of 4 9 11 4 after ed due to the water transfer by the osmotic pressure difference the chemical oxygen demand of swine digestate varies from site to site ranging from 1 6 to 14 9 g l as presented in table s14 the high content of organic components in swine digestate can disturb the performance of the membrane processes due to the organic fouling therefore as indicated in this conceptual design it is essential to remove and or recover the organic portion in wastewater or digestate prior to membrane processes for the removal of organics selective oxidation while retaining nutrients for potential reuse as a fertilizer has been reported jermakka et al 2021 notably another approach to recovering organics from swine wastewater is through adsorption based extraction processes which can produce humin humin acid and fulvic acid at high purities chen et al 2021 in fact these organic components can be used as biofertilizers and thus reduce the indirect carbon emissions from the production of inorganic fertilizers the adsorption based extraction processes also generate a nutrient rich stream which can be treated by the ed process the nutrients in this stream can be concentrated by ed and then recovered via struvite precipitation and air stripping in this study the developed ed process could efficiently recover nutrients as a concentrate solution which can further convert to value added chemical precipitate crystals such as struvite and ammonium sulfate the purity of struvite and ammonium sulfate products that could be achieved using state of the art struvite and air stripping recovery processes is about 95 and 98 respectively tao and ukwuani 2015 wu and vaneeckhaute 2022 the market prices of struvite and ammonium sulfate were approximately 121 500 and 119 500 usd per ton respectively depending on the purity wu and vaneeckhaute 2022 to promote a circular economy the development of nutrient recovery processes from liquid digestate is of great importance the operating costs such as chemical agents and energy consumption and benefits from the recovered bioproducts should be systematically determined in addition the remaining organic acids in the digestate can be further separated via electrodeionization for instance datta et al 2013 demonstrated the capability of electrodeionization to separate acetic and sulfuric acids from hydrolysate liquor the achieved separation efficiencies of sulfuric and acetic acids by electrodeionization were over 99 and 95 respectively datta et al 2013 table 3 presents the preliminary analyses on the benefits and costs of the ed based nutrient recovery process the system boundary for benefit cost analysis is highlighted in the red portion in fig 5 see details in fig s2 tables s15 and s16 see supplementary information summarize the details of the assumptions and calculation equations the treatment capacity of the digestate via the developed process is assumed to be 100 000 m3 d the results indicate that the daily costs for the proposed boundary of treatment are about 240 490 usd and the operation and maintenance costs for membranes share a significant portion 48 of the total costs the average treatment cost for one tonne of digestate is approximately 2 41 usd a similar observation was reported by wang et al 2022 that the digestate desalination cost was 5 22 usd t with a daily treatment capacity of 100 m3 in this study the daily benefits from the designated system boundary are expected to be 356 000 usd and thus the associated bcr see eq 5 value is about 1 48 showing a favorable investment despite its potential for wide deployment the uncertainty of the economic analyses includes the composition of swine digestate and the prices of the bioproduct sales depending on the purity e g struvite and ammonium sulfate the composition of swine liquid digestate see table s14 varies widely from site to site and could influence the separation performance and the purity of the bioproduct the distance between the source of the swine liquid digestate and the recycling plant also affect the economic viability of the nutrient recovery processes therefore the uncertainty analysis and the feasibility of large scale operations including the energy consumption of the whole cascading systems will be performed from the life cycle perspective in our future studies 4 conclusions this study designed two operating modes of ed i e constant voltage cv and constant current cc to evaluate the nutrient separation efficiency from anaerobic swine digestate and its associated energy efficiency for the cv mode the maximum ec removal efficiency is 92 8 at a measured cell voltage of 2 4 v cell for an operation time of 120 min and the associated ion separation efficiency of nh4 k and cl are higher than 88 the results also indicate the current efficiency of monovalent ions e g nh4 k and cl is higher than multivalent ions e g so4 2 and po4 3 in particular the current efficiencies of nh4 i e 43 65 are higher than that of other ions such as k i e 12 19 cl i e 4 7 and po4 3 i e 0 1 1 5 to identify a suitable operating window for ion separation the ion electromigration performance e g rate constants is determined using a first order kinetic model the first order kinetic model can effectively describe the behavior of ion separation via the developed ed process in this study for the cv mode the maximum rate constants k of nh4 k cl and po4 3 are approximately 0 050 0 003 0 061 0 004 0 080 0 001 and 0 020 0 002 min 1 respectively p 0 05 the obtained rate constant also linearly increases with the increased cell voltage in the cv mode r 2 0 930 or applied current in the cc mode r 2 0 998 in addition the process energy consumption and productivity are balanced using response surface models to deliver energy efficient nutrient separation the results indicate the cv mode can deliver treated water with 4 6 ms cm at an energy consumption of 0 58 1 61 kwh m3 corresponding to a productivity of 2 4 7 3 gal m2 hr similarly the cc mode can deliver a treated water with 7 0 ms cm at the energy consumption of 0 03 0 08 kwh m3 corresponding to a productivity of 2 0 5 0 gal m2 hr for all cases the required energy consumption for nitrogen recovery using the developed ed was about 0 24 15 2 kwh kg n 0 86 54 7 kj g n corresponding to a removal ratio of ammonium from 70 8 to 99 1 last according to the preliminary economic analyses with an assumed digestate treatment capacity of 100 000 m3 d the nutrient recovery process via energy efficient ed shows a favorable operation because the bcr ratio is 1 48 the results provide insight into the practical applications of digestate valorization through energy efficient ed separation thereby realizing a circular economy system and a decarbonizing supply chain of bio nutrients declaration of

15514,the inevitably high energy consumption of traditional electrochemical processes to treat low conductivity water has limited their wider application herein we present an energy efficient alternative i e a ti4o7 reactive electrochemical ceramic membrane ti4o7 rem system with a superior mass transfer ability for the removal of 10 200 μm norfloxacin nor from low conductivity 178 832 μs cm 1 water the ti4o7 rem system increased the kinetics rate constant by 4 3 34 0 times thus decreasing the energy cost by 80 5 97 3 compared with a flow by system the rapid nor removal was related to the enhanced direct electron transfer process in the ti4o7 rem system which allowed for higher resistance to hco3 scavenging and a favorable reaction between nor and the active sites meanwhile this mechanism likely contributed to the less formation of inorganic chlorinated product clo3 in the presence of cl although organic chlorinated byproducts were not detected during nor degradation in the ti4o7 rem system cl influenced the speciation of the intermediates a single pass ti4o7 rem system demonstrated 94 97 removal of trace antibiotics from real water samples in 30 s the additional energy consumption 0 02 kwh m 3 using a ti4o7 rem system only contributed to 5 0 6 4 of the total in a typical tertiary wastewater treatment plant based on the above results we can conclude that the convection enhanced rem technique is viable for the purification of low conductivity natural waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ti4o7 electrochemical ceramic membrane low conductivity water antibiotics energy efficiency matrix effect byproduct formation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the electrochemical advanced oxidation process especially anodic oxidation is ushering in a new area in water treatment anodic oxidation can degrade various refractory organic pollutants via a combination of the direct electron transfer det process and hydroxyl radical oh mediated oxidation that commences with the det of h2o chaplin 2014 anodic oxidation has been successfully applied to salt laden wastewaters deng et al 2020 li et al 2020 zhi et al 2020 because the ionic strength can sustain an ideal electron flow for the det and oh production reactions in contrast large scale applications of anodic oxidation in treating dilute solutions are challenged by the high energy cost due to the concentration limitation although adding electrolytes could prompt the kinetics this strategy is not economical to treat realistic wastewaters of low ionic strength 1 10 mm but in a large volume schnoor and vecitis 2013 a novel reactive electrochemical membrane rem system is recognized as a breakthrough configuration for electrochemical water treatment trellu et al 2018a the rem systems are built upon flow through anodes which greatly compress the diffusion boundary layer and thus enhance the mass transport of contaminants recent works have shown that the normalized mass transfer rate k m achieved by an rem system is 1 2 orders of magnitude larger than the highest k m 10 5 m s 1 reported in a flow by system trellu et al 2018a due to the excellent mass transfer ability the rem systems can increase the oxidation kinetics by 10 times and then reduce the electric energy cost by 90 which may devise a promising platform to treat dilute solutions chen et al 2020 yang et al 2018 a few tentative studies have shown that rem systems can efficiently remove antibiotics from natural waters at an ultralow energy consumption of 0 005 0 240 kwh m 3 ren et al 2022 yang et al 2022a 2020 however our knowledge of the detailed mechanisms for the enhanced electrooxidation in a dilute environment is not complete in essence naturally occurring compounds can act as radical scavengers and or be directly oxidized on the anode via det bicarbonate hco3 and chloride cl are the most abundant anions under circumneutral conditions which can transform oh to less reactive but selective species k oh hco 3 8 5 106 4 9 107 m 1 s 1 and k oh cl 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 buxton and elliot 1986 buxton et al 1988 since the enhancement of mass transfer by convection in rems is generally non selective the interaction of hco3 and cl with the anode may influence the det process and oh yield thus influencing the oxidation activity of an rem system however this is contradictory to the empirical observations of the high electrooxidation efficiency in addition it is not clear whether the enrichment of cl at the rem if any would prompt the production of toxic chlorinated byproducts such as chlorate clo3 and perchlorate clo4 yang 2020 clo4 is a thyroid disrupting chemical us environmental protection agency epa has set a maximum contaminant level mcl at 56 μg l 1 for clo4 and a health reference level hrl at 210 μg l 1 for clo3 lin et al 2020 also note that chlorine species may be involved in the oxidation of contaminants potentially generating chlorinated intermediates that may be more toxic than their parent compounds for example chlorination of norfloxacin nor a fluoroquinolone bactericidal agent that is widely detected in natural waters can generate a more lethal by product sp 5 médice et al 2021 multi chlorinated alcohol compounds c3h2cl4o and c3h4cl4o and mono chlorinated phenolic compounds c8h7o4cl have been detected in the use of ti4o7 anode to degrade a model phenolic compound in chloride containing solution lin et al 2020 it is therefore crucial to explore the nature of the reactions between the rem and aqueous species in dilute environments a better understanding of which is of significance to tailor advanced rem materials and improve the process performance in the current work we evaluated the capability of an rem system to remove antibiotics from low conductivity solutions comprising different electrolytes e g h2po4 hco3 or cl a tubular ti4o7 ceramic membrane was fabricated and used as the anode in both rem and flow by systems antibiotics due to the strong resistance to traditional wastewater treatment have been continually released into natural water environments thus threatening human health and the eco environment seyoum et al 2021 fluoroquinolone antibiotics are one of the three largest groups of antibiotics and are largely unmetabolized up to 70 doorslaer et al 2014 we therefore selected a fluoroquinolone antibiotic nor as a model contaminant inorganic and organic byproducts were investigated using ion chromatography ic and high resolution mass spectrum hrms the strong difference between the rem and flow by systems was correlated to the interface reaction mechanisms furthermore the feasibility of the rem system in practical applications

conductivity solutions that is surface water taken from the dongjiang river dongguan china and wwtp effluent collected from the banxuegang water quality purification plant shenzhen china in a single

2016 zaky and chaplin 2013 the above results demonstrated that porous ti4o7 ceramic membrane was successfully fabricated 3 2 ti4o7 rem prompts antibiotic removal from dilute solutions performance and mechanisms before evaluation of the oxidation efficacy of the ti4o7 ceramic membrane the mass transfer performance of the constructed reaction systems i e rem and flow by systems was first characterized by k o of fe cn 6 4 section s3 and fig s5 when the water flux was higher than 2 4 10 3 m3 m 2 s 1 the ti4o7 ceramic membrane in the rem system could reach its intrinsic kinetics the kinetics limitation value was as high as 8 9 10 4 m s 1 11 1 times higher than that in the flow by system obviously the rem system significantly accelerates the mass diffusion to the ti4o7 ceramic membrane surface which is crucial for the removal of contaminants from dilute solutions subsequently the efficacy of the ti4o7 ceramic membrane in 2 10 mm kh2po4 i e 178 832 μs cm 1 solutions was assessed to degrade nor fig 1 a and b and table s4 the water flux was set at 2 4 10 3 m3 m 2 s 1 at which the rem system reached the kinetics limitation the rem system increased the pseudo first order rate constant k nor by 4 3 9 2 and 24 1 34 0 times for the degradation of 200 and 10 μm nor respectively compared with the flow by system as a result the ee o values were reduced by 80 5 and 96 3 at an initial nor concentration of 200 and 10 μm respectively fig 1c and table s4 moreover the ee o values of the rem system outperformed its counterparts including the addition of extra electrolytes the use of solid polymer electrolyte spe and the microfluidic system in a dilute environment fig 1d details of the comparison are shown in table s5 the ti4o7 rem system is expected to be a promising electrochemical platform to remove refractory organic matter from low conductivity solutions the electrooxidation of contaminants on the rem mainly involves the det process and oh mediated indirect oxidation the increased lsv current response in the presence of nor indicated that the det process should contribute to nor oxidation fig 2 a wang et al 2021 a higher current in the rem system could be ascribed to the convection enhanced mass transfer that accelerated the electron donation from nor molecules to the anode oxalate was further selected as a det probe because of its low reactivity with oh 1 4 10 6 m 1 s 1 and favorable direct oxidation via a two electron transfer reaction h2c2o4 2e 2co2 2h guo et al 2016 fluorescent 7 hc a specific product from cou reacting with oh 4 0 10 9 m 1 s 1 guo et al 2016 was chosen as a probe to evaluate the yield of oh the 7 hc yield nm min 1 was calculated according to the accumulative 7 hc concentration in the bulk solution in the first 5 min in which cou was sufficient to react with oh fig s6 yang et al 2022b the apparent rate constant k oxalate and 7 hc yield in the rem system were higher than in the flow by system fig 2b and c k oxalate in the rem system was dependent on the solution conductivity but almost constant in the flow by system the change in k nor 4 3 9 2 times had a good relationship with that in k oxalate 2 9 8 1 times but was significantly higher than the change in oh yield 1 5 1 8 times in addition fig s7 shows that the arc of nyquist plots related to the charge transfer resistance r ct in the rem system was much smaller than the flow by system under the same conditions 2 10 mm kh2po4 solutions and the fitting r ct in the rem system was only 15 6 36 0 ω much smaller than the flow by system 54 5 82 3 ω table s6 to further verify the contribution of the det process 10 mm tertiary butanol tba a oh quencher was added to the rem system fig 2d and e under the nor concentrations of 200 10 μm and the current densities of 6 8 20 5 ma cm 2 the inhibition rate was less than 15 suggesting nor oxidation efficiency was less affected by scavenging the aqueous oh these experimental results provided conclusive evidence that the det process plays a critical role in the degradation of nor in low conductivity solutions a mathematical model that has been used in porous electrodes jing and chaplin 2016 lasia 1995 trellu et al 2018b was then introduced to elucidate the mechanism for the stronger det process in the rem system the onset of anode potential at 13 7 ma cm 2 was set at 3 30 v vs she according to the lsv of the ti4o7 rem fig s8a the minimal potential required for nor oxidation via det i e 1 25 v vs she obtained from fig 2a was used as the cut off the calculation details are shown in section s4 we demonstrate the potential drop as a function of the depth from the top of the rem in fig 2d a remarkable decrease in the anode potential was observed on the surface layer 2 38 and 1 50 v vs she have been indicated as the threshold potentials of ti4o7 to produce aqueous and adsorbed oh xie et al 2021 our work showed that less than 10 of the active depth 2460 nm of the ti4o7 rem was involved in oh production in a dilute environment figs 2d and s9 strengthening our conclusion that the det process dominated the enhanced electrooxidation although the 1d simulation has its limitations to predict the real and complicated reaction process on the rem this could benefit our mechanistic understanding of the prompted nor removal that is the convection of bulk solution can accelerate the diffusion of pollutants i e nor in this study to the ti4o7 ceramic membrane surface in a dilute environment and the abundant inner active sites mediate a more efficient det process for contaminants removal at low energy consumption 3 3 matrix effects on nor removal from dilute solutions 3 3 1 comparison of kinetics first we investigated the electrooxidation of 200 and 10 μm nor in dilute nahco3 4 3 mm and nacl 3 4 mm solutions that had the same conductivity of 346 μs cm 1 as the control i e 4 mm kh2po4 solutions table s7 fig 3 a and b show that the presence of hco3 has slight inhibition on nor decay in the flow by system the k nor values were reduced by 26 while hco3 can transform oh into less reactive species k oh hco 3 8 5 106 4 9 107 m 1 s 1 buxton and elliot 1986 buxton et al 1988 and thus suppress the electrooxidation activity the scavenging effect on the anode could be compromised due to the electrolysis of water in which hco3 is protonated to h2co3 a less reactive species with oh 106 m 1 s 1 chaplin 2014 in comparison the k nor values of the rem system were insignificantly influenced by the presence of hco3 indicating that the anode demonstrated a reaction selectivity with the micropollutants a similar conclusion was drawn in a previous study of a pbo2 rem system yang et al 2022a in which hco3 0 8 2 mm had low impacts on the oxidation kinetics as such we envision that the rem system could sustain its high efficiency in the purification of bicarbonate laden water fig 3c and d demonstrate the degradation of nor in dilute nacl solutions the reaction kinetics were significantly increased in the presence of cl and the performance of the flow by system became similar to the rem system in a more realistic matrix i e close to the level of natural water that contained 1 mm nacl with the equivalent conductivity 346 μs cm 1 balanced with nahco3 fig 3 e and f degradation of nor was still enhanced in the flow by system this likely indicated that the reaction was no longer controlled by the diffusion of nor since there should be minimal changes in the hydraulic condition of the flow by system following the introduction of cl one would expect that the boosted k nor values could be ascribed to the generation of active chlorine species that have a much longer lifetime and can diffuse into the bulk solution to drive homogeneous reactions k hocl nor 6 6 104 3 1 107 m 1 s 1 dood et al 2005 fig 3g and h show the active chlorine generated in the two systems in the relatively realistic matrix in the absence of nor the generated active chlorine was almost the same in the two systems and accumulated in the bulk solution over the reactive time suggesting the stability of the active chlorine the observation of similar active chlorine yields was likely ascribed to the fact that cl are constantly negatively charged under the conditions tested in this study the nucleophilic nature of cl could benefit the adsorption onto the ti4o7 crystal plane e g the high adsorption energy of 5 1 ev wang et al 2020 thus overcoming the surface diffusion limitation in a flow by system in the presence of nor the active chlorine concentration significantly decreased and was almost completely consumed with the nor concentration increasing to 200 μm verifying the contribution of active chlorine to the degradation of nor although cl was more effective in strengthening the flow by system the k nor values of the rem system for the degradation of 200 10 μm nor were still 3 4 14 4 and 66 3 77 6 larger than those of the flow by system when cl concentrations were 3 4 and 1 mm respectively overall the rem system demonstrates improved electrooxidation kinetics in various matrices though its advantages to treat chloride laden waters are not as remarkable as that containing nonreactive electrolytes e g kh2po4 our work suggests that the use of a realistic matrix would be crucial to objectively assess the performance of rem in practical applications 3 3 2 formation of inorganic chlorinated byproducts clo3 and clo4 are the dominant chlorinated byproducts that are produced in the anodic oxidation processes in the presence of cl in this study only low toxicity clo3 was detected in both rem and flow by systems to treat chloride laden waters in order to verify this result clo3 oxidation experiment was performed as shown in fig s10 and no clo4 was observed during 60 min reaction time fig 4 shows that the formation of clo3 in the rem system was consistently less than in the flow by system under all tested conditions take 200 μm nor decay in 1 mm nacl solution as an example fig 4a the accumulated clo3 in the rem system was 176 8 μm after 60 min of reaction which was only 42 8 of that 413 5 μm produced from the flow by system the lower yield of clo3 in the rem system could be ascribed to the competition of different species e g nor oh and cl for the electroactive sites which might inhibit the conversion of cl into clo3 the higher yield of clo3 as a result of a decrease in the nor concentration fig 4c vs a or an increase in cl concentration fig 4b vs a also confirmed this hypothesis prior work has also indicated that the preferential oxidation of organic compounds on the anode would result in less clo3 and clo4 formation lin et al 2020 while it is indicated that ti4o7 anode to treat chloride laden waters could simultaneously produce clo3 and clo4 lin et al 2020 wang et al 2020 only clo3 was found in this study perchlorate is reported to be the dominant final product on the nonactive anodes jasper et al 2017 ti4o7 anodes used in the literature are usually built upon the sintered compacts lin et al 2020 wang et al 2020 in comparison the ti4o7 ceramic membrane of our work was fabricated by spraying ti4o7 powders on a sno2 sb layer this may create a heterojunction structure xie et al demonstrated that creating a heterojunction structure on the ti4o7 anode could significantly influence the charge transfer process xie et al 2020 the increased det ability may render the composite ti4o7 rem act like an active anode that generally converts cl into clo3 yang 2020 though another plausible explanation of this phenomenon could be the rapid potential loss within the rem in the dilute environment fig 2f therefore we expect that no clo4 formation in this work should be ascribed to the unique structure of the ti4o7 rem following studies are required to strengthen our mechanistic understanding of the electronic nature of the interactions which can pave the way to establishing more advanced rems in facilitating contaminant degradation whilst inhibiting chlorinated product formation 3 3 3 impacts of chloride on the nor decay pathway and speciation time resolved samples were taken from reactors under three scenarios i e an rem system treating 10 μm nor in dilute kh2po4 solution defined as scenario 1 an rem system treating 10 μm nor in dilute nacl solution scenario 2 and a flow by system treating 10 μm nor in dilute nacl solution scenario 3 the main intermediates upon nor decay were analyzed by hrms the total ion chromatograms tic of detected products and corresponding second order mass spectrums ms2 are shown in figs s11 13 we found that the extracted tic and ms2 were identical indicating that the main products were the same among the three scenarios the identified product at an m z of 322 1197 had two tic peaks at different retention times which suggested the formation of isomers based on the hrms results and existing studies guo et al 2020 jing et al 2021 three routines i e piperazinyl ring opening decarboxylation and defluorination involving eight main products are presented figs 5 and s11 13 fig 5b c respectively compare the temporal variations of the peak areas of nor1 nor2 and nor3 the initial products of the three decay pathways as compared with scenario 1 larger peak areas of nor1 and nor2 and a smaller peak area of nor3 were observed in scenario 2 indicating that the presence of cl likely facilitated the piperazinyl ring opening and decarboxylation processes whilst inhibiting the defluorination process in the rem system the inhibition of defluorination could be related to the scavenging of oh by cl 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 and the resultant reactive chlorine species are less reactive to break the strong c f bond 130 kcal mol 1 in scenario 3 the peak area of nor2 was the largest among the three groups while those of nor1 and nor3 were the smallest the k nor value in scenario 3 was identical to that in scenario 2 but higher than in scenario 1 fig 3d it can be concluded that decarboxylation should be the main mechanism for the rapid degradation of nor by using the flow by system in the presence of cl our work shows that while the nor decay in the rem and flow by systems is based on similar pathways the presence of the common anion cl could significantly influence the speciation of the electrooxidation products in addition we have searched the m z of the reported organic chlorinated intermediates c16h17n3o3fcl m z 354 1015 c16h16n3o3cl2 m z 369 0641 c16h18n3o3cl m z 336 1109 c14h15n3o3fcl m z 328 0859 c12h10n2o3fcl m z

byproducts were not formed or further degraded in both rem and flow by systems 3 4 a single pass ti4o7 rem system for environmental application a single pass ti4o7 rem system has been devised to treat wwtp effluent conductivity 500 μs cm 1 and surface water conductivity 181 μs cm 1 spiked with antibiotics of tch lev and nor each antibiotic was set at 100 nm according to the oxidation kinetics of antibiotics in a single module operated at the optimized anode current of 0 5 ma cm 2 and water flux of 2 4 10 3 m3 m 2 s 1 section s6 and figs s14 and s15 the minimal numbers of rem modules that could achieve one log removal of antibiotics were 2 9 and 3 3 respectively for wwtp effluent and surface water therefore the single pass system was constructed by connecting four identical rem modules in series fig 6 a the hrt of the single pass system was only 30 s with the number of rem modules increasing from 1 to 4 the overall removal of antibiotics from wwtp effluent and surface water went up from 60 to 97 and 50 to 94 respectively fig 6b the higher removal for the wwtp effluent may be related to the higher conductivity and cl concentration as compared to the surface water table s1 there was an insignificant change in the concentrations 5 when the power was off fig 6c indicating a negligible contribution of sorption to antibiotic removal when an anode current density of 0 5 ma cm 2 was applied stable and high removal was observed moreover the single pass system could also efficiently remove antibiotics at a lower concentration as shown in fig s16 the percentage removal of 1 nm nor in surface water was above 90 after two rem modules and the single pass system n 4 could achieve almost 100 removal furthermore the cytotoxicity of the treated samples was assessed with a disk agar diffusion biocidal susceptibility method liang et al 2018 yang et al 2022a since the antibiotics at the concentration of 100 nm demonstrated minimal cytotoxicity wwtp effluents spiked individually with 160 μm tch lev or nor were used as the feed fig s17 demonstrates that the inhibition zones became diminished and eventually disappeared after the treatment by the single pass system indicating that the cytotoxicity of the treated samples was reduced the energy consumption of the single pass system was 0 015 and 0 019 kwh m 3 respectively for the wwtp effluent and surface water these values were competitive with the reported results 0 005 2 29 kwh m 3 obtained in similar application scenarios i e removing trace level contaminants by rem technology xu et al 2019 yang et al 2022a zhou et al 2019 more importantly the application of which for tertiary treatment only increased 5 0 6 4 of the total cost 0 300 kwh m 3 of a typical wwtp ozgun et al 2021 we further analyzed the total cost of the electrical energy pumping and capital cost based on the documented procedures lin et al 2021a the details are shown in section s7 the total costs in the use of a single pass system to treat said waters were 0 0125 0 0129 m 3 compared to the total cost of a tertiary wwtps 0 160 m 3 ozgun et al 2021 the implementation of the electrooxidation unit would not significantly increase the total cost 7 8 8 1 4 conclusions in summary we have devised a ti4o7 rem system for energy efficient and rapid removal of nor from low conductivity water the superior interfacial mass transfer in the rem resulted in the enhanced det process playing a vital role in electrooxidation we demonstrated that the ti4o7 rem system could sustain its high efficiency in the treatment of bicarbonate laden water while the presence of cl prompted the nor decay kinetics in a flow by system this inevitably caused the formation of chlorinated products in comparison the ti4o7 rem system significantly inhibited the production of clo3 likely due to the preferential reaction of the active site with the antibiotics although organic chlorinated byproducts were not detected upon electrooxidation of nor in the ti4o7 rem system cl influenced the speciation of the intermediates a single pass four stages ti4o7 rem system could remove 94 97 of trace antibiotics from surface water and wwtp effluent in 30 s at ultralow energy consumption the results of this study have advanced our understanding of the reactive electrochemical ceramic membrane technique for the remediation of contaminated natural waters

15514,the inevitably high energy consumption of traditional electrochemical processes to treat low conductivity water has limited their wider application herein we present an energy efficient alternative i e a ti4o7 reactive electrochemical ceramic membrane ti4o7 rem system with a superior mass transfer ability for the removal of 10 200 μm norfloxacin nor from low conductivity 178 832 μs cm 1 water the ti4o7 rem system increased the kinetics rate constant by 4 3 34 0 times thus decreasing the energy cost by 80 5 97 3 compared with a flow by system the rapid nor removal was related to the enhanced direct electron transfer process in the ti4o7 rem system which allowed for higher resistance to hco3 scavenging and a favorable reaction between nor and the active sites meanwhile this mechanism likely contributed to the less formation of inorganic chlorinated product clo3 in the presence of cl although organic chlorinated byproducts were not detected during nor degradation in the ti4o7 rem system cl influenced the speciation of the intermediates a single pass ti4o7 rem system demonstrated 94 97 removal of trace antibiotics from real water samples in 30 s the additional energy consumption 0 02 kwh m 3 using a ti4o7 rem system only contributed to 5 0 6 4 of the total in a typical tertiary wastewater treatment plant based on the above results we can conclude that the convection enhanced rem technique is viable for the purification of low conductivity natural waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ti4o7 electrochemical ceramic membrane low conductivity water antibiotics energy efficiency matrix effect byproduct formation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the electrochemical advanced oxidation process especially anodic oxidation is ushering in a new area in water treatment anodic oxidation can degrade various refractory organic pollutants via a combination of the direct electron transfer det process and hydroxyl radical oh mediated oxidation that commences with the det of h2o chaplin 2014 anodic oxidation has been successfully applied to salt laden wastewaters deng et al 2020 li et al 2020 zhi et al 2020 because the ionic strength can sustain an ideal electron flow for the det and oh production reactions in contrast large scale applications of anodic oxidation in treating dilute solutions are challenged by the high energy cost due to the concentration limitation although adding electrolytes could prompt the kinetics this strategy is not economical to treat realistic wastewaters of low ionic strength 1 10 mm but in a large volume schnoor and vecitis 2013 a novel reactive electrochemical membrane rem system is recognized as a breakthrough configuration for electrochemical water treatment trellu et al 2018a the rem systems are built upon flow through anodes which greatly compress the diffusion boundary layer and thus enhance the mass transport of contaminants recent works have shown that the normalized mass transfer rate k m achieved by an rem system is 1 2 orders of magnitude larger than the highest k m 10 5 m s 1 reported in a flow by system trellu et al 2018a due to the excellent mass transfer ability the rem systems can increase the oxidation kinetics by 10 times and then reduce the electric energy cost by 90 which may devise a promising platform to treat dilute solutions chen et al 2020 yang et al 2018 a few tentative studies have shown that rem systems can efficiently remove antibiotics from natural waters at an ultralow energy consumption of 0 005 0 240 kwh m 3 ren et al 2022 yang et al 2022a 2020 however our knowledge of the detailed mechanisms for the enhanced electrooxidation in a dilute environment is not complete in essence naturally occurring compounds can act as radical scavengers and or be directly oxidized on the anode via det bicarbonate hco3 and chloride cl are the most abundant anions under circumneutral conditions which can transform oh to less reactive but selective species k oh hco 3 8 5 106 4 9 107 m 1 s 1 and k oh cl 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 buxton and elliot 1986 buxton et al 1988 since the enhancement of mass transfer by convection in rems is generally non selective the interaction of hco3 and cl with the anode may influence the det process and oh yield thus influencing the oxidation activity of an rem system however this is contradictory to the empirical observations of the high electrooxidation efficiency in addition it is not clear whether the enrichment of cl at the rem if any would prompt the production of toxic chlorinated byproducts such as chlorate clo3 and perchlorate clo4 yang 2020 clo4 is a thyroid disrupting chemical us environmental protection agency epa has set a maximum contaminant level mcl at 56 μg l 1 for clo4 and a health reference level hrl at 210 μg l 1 for clo3 lin et al 2020 also note that chlorine species may be involved in the oxidation of contaminants potentially generating chlorinated intermediates that may be more toxic than their parent compounds for example chlorination of norfloxacin nor a fluoroquinolone bactericidal agent that is widely detected in natural waters can generate a more lethal by product sp 5 médice et al 2021 multi chlorinated alcohol compounds c3h2cl4o and c3h4cl4o and mono chlorinated phenolic compounds c8h7o4cl have been detected in the use of ti4o7 anode to degrade a model phenolic compound in chloride containing solution lin et al 2020 it is therefore crucial to explore the nature of the reactions between the rem and aqueous species in dilute environments a better understanding of which is of significance to tailor advanced rem materials and improve the process performance in the current work we evaluated the capability of an rem system to remove antibiotics from low conductivity solutions comprising different electrolytes e g h2po4 hco3 or cl a tubular ti4o7 ceramic membrane was fabricated and used as the anode in both rem and flow by systems antibiotics due to the strong resistance to traditional wastewater treatment have been continually released into natural water environments thus threatening human health and the eco environment seyoum et al 2021 fluoroquinolone antibiotics are one of the three largest groups of antibiotics and are largely unmetabolized up to 70 doorslaer et al 2014 we therefore selected a fluoroquinolone antibiotic nor as a model contaminant inorganic and organic byproducts were investigated using ion chromatography ic and high resolution mass spectrum hrms the strong difference between the rem and flow by systems was correlated to the interface reaction mechanisms furthermore the feasibility of the rem system in practical applications was assessed to treat wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent and contaminated surface water 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemical reagents used in this work were reagent grade or higher

2016 zaky and chaplin 2013 the above results demonstrated that porous ti4o7 ceramic membrane was successfully fabricated 3 2 ti4o7 rem prompts antibiotic removal from dilute solutions performance and mechanisms before evaluation of the oxidation efficacy of the ti4o7 ceramic membrane the mass transfer performance of the constructed reaction systems i e rem and flow by systems was first characterized by k o of fe cn 6 4 section s3 and fig s5 when the water flux was higher than 2 4 10 3 m3 m 2 s 1 the ti4o7 ceramic membrane in the rem system could reach its intrinsic kinetics the kinetics limitation value was as high as 8 9 10 4 m s 1 11 1 times higher than that in the flow by system obviously the rem system significantly accelerates the mass diffusion to the ti4o7 ceramic membrane surface which is crucial for the removal of contaminants from dilute solutions subsequently the efficacy of the ti4o7 ceramic membrane in 2 10 mm kh2po4 i e 178 832 μs cm 1 solutions was assessed to degrade nor fig 1 a and b and table s4 the water flux was set at 2 4 10 3 m3 m 2 s 1 at which the rem system reached the kinetics limitation the rem system increased the pseudo first order rate constant k nor by 4 3 9 2 and 24 1 34 0 times for the degradation of 200 and 10 μm nor respectively compared with the flow by system as a result the ee o values were reduced by 80 5 and 96 3 at an initial nor concentration of 200 and 10 μm respectively fig 1c and table s4 moreover the ee o values of the rem system outperformed its counterparts including the addition of extra electrolytes the use of solid polymer electrolyte spe and the microfluidic system in a dilute environment fig 1d details of the comparison are shown in table s5 the ti4o7 rem system is expected to be a promising electrochemical platform to remove refractory organic matter from low conductivity solutions the electrooxidation of contaminants on the rem mainly involves the det process and oh mediated indirect oxidation the increased lsv current response in the presence of nor indicated that the det process should contribute to nor oxidation fig 2 a wang et al 2021 a higher current in the rem system could be ascribed to the convection enhanced mass transfer that accelerated the electron donation from nor molecules to the anode oxalate was further selected as a det probe because of its low reactivity with oh 1 4 10 6 m 1 s 1 and favorable direct oxidation via a two electron transfer reaction h2c2o4 2e 2co2 2h guo et al 2016 fluorescent 7 hc a specific product from cou reacting with oh 4 0 10 9 m 1 s 1 guo et al 2016 was chosen as a probe to evaluate the yield of oh the 7 hc yield nm min 1 was calculated according to the accumulative 7 hc concentration in the bulk solution in the first 5 min in which cou was sufficient to react with oh fig s6 yang et al 2022b the apparent rate constant k oxalate and 7 hc yield in the rem system were higher than in the flow by system fig 2b and c k oxalate in the rem system was dependent on the solution conductivity but almost constant in the flow by system the change in k nor 4 3 9 2 times had a good relationship with that in k oxalate 2 9 8 1 times but was significantly higher than the change in oh yield 1 5 1 8 times in addition fig s7 shows that the arc of nyquist plots related to the charge transfer resistance r ct in the rem system was much smaller than the flow by system under the same conditions 2 10 mm kh2po4 solutions and the fitting r ct in the rem system was only 15 6 36 0 ω much smaller than the flow by system 54 5 82 3 ω table s6 to further verify the contribution of the det process 10 mm tertiary butanol tba a oh quencher was added to the rem system fig 2d and e under the nor concentrations of 200 10 μm and the current densities of 6 8 20 5 ma cm 2 the inhibition rate was less than 15 suggesting nor oxidation efficiency was less affected by scavenging the aqueous oh these experimental results provided conclusive evidence that the det process plays a critical role in the degradation of nor in low conductivity solutions a mathematical model that has been used in porous electrodes jing and chaplin 2016 lasia 1995 trellu et al 2018b was then introduced to elucidate the mechanism for the stronger det process in the rem system the onset of anode potential at 13 7 ma cm 2 was set at 3 30 v vs she according to the lsv of the ti4o7 rem fig s8a the minimal potential required for nor oxidation via det i e 1 25 v vs she obtained from fig 2a was used as the cut off the calculation details are shown in section s4 we demonstrate the potential drop as a function of the depth from the top of the rem in fig 2d a remarkable decrease in the anode potential was observed on the surface layer 2 38 and 1 50 v vs she have been indicated as the threshold potentials of ti4o7 to produce aqueous and adsorbed oh xie et al 2021 our work showed that less than 10 of the active depth 2460 nm of the ti4o7 rem was involved in oh production in a dilute environment figs 2d and s9 strengthening our conclusion that the det process dominated the enhanced electrooxidation although the 1d simulation has its limitations to predict the real and complicated reaction process on the rem this could benefit our mechanistic understanding of the prompted nor removal that is the convection of bulk solution can accelerate the diffusion of pollutants i e nor in this study to the ti4o7 ceramic membrane surface in a dilute environment and the abundant inner active sites mediate a more efficient det process for contaminants removal at low energy consumption 3 3 matrix effects on nor removal from dilute solutions 3 3 1 comparison of kinetics first we investigated the electrooxidation of 200 and 10 μm nor in dilute nahco3 4 3 mm and nacl 3 4 mm solutions that had the same conductivity of 346 μs cm 1 as the control i e 4 mm kh2po4 solutions table s7 fig 3 a and b show that the presence of hco3 has slight inhibition on nor decay in the flow by system the k nor values were reduced by 26 while hco3 can transform oh into less reactive species k oh hco 3 8 5 106 4 9 107 m 1 s 1 buxton and elliot 1986 buxton et al 1988 and thus suppress the electrooxidation activity the scavenging effect on the anode could be compromised due to the electrolysis of water in which hco3 is protonated to h2co3 a less reactive species with oh 106 m 1 s 1 chaplin 2014 in comparison the k nor values of the rem system were insignificantly influenced by the presence of hco3 indicating that the anode demonstrated a reaction selectivity with the micropollutants a similar conclusion was drawn in a previous study of a pbo2 rem system yang et al 2022a in which hco3 0 8 2 mm had low impacts on the oxidation kinetics as such we envision that the rem system could sustain its high efficiency in the purification of bicarbonate laden water fig 3c and d demonstrate the degradation of nor in dilute nacl solutions the reaction kinetics were significantly increased in the presence of cl and the performance of the flow by system became similar to the rem system in a more realistic matrix i e close to the level of natural water that contained 1 mm nacl with the equivalent conductivity 346 μs cm 1 balanced with nahco3 fig 3 e and f degradation of nor was still enhanced in the flow by system this likely indicated that the reaction was no longer controlled by the diffusion of nor since there should be minimal changes in the hydraulic condition of the flow by system following the introduction of cl one would expect that the boosted k nor values could be ascribed to the generation of active chlorine species that have a much longer lifetime and can diffuse into the bulk solution to drive homogeneous reactions k hocl nor 6 6 104 3 1 107 m 1 s 1 dood et al 2005 fig 3g and h show the active chlorine generated in the two systems in the relatively realistic matrix in the absence of nor the generated active chlorine was almost the same in the two systems and accumulated in the bulk solution over the reactive time suggesting the stability of the active chlorine the observation of similar active chlorine yields was likely ascribed to the fact that cl are constantly negatively charged under the conditions tested in this study the nucleophilic nature of cl could benefit the adsorption onto the ti4o7 crystal plane e g the high adsorption energy of 5 1 ev wang et al 2020 thus overcoming the surface diffusion limitation in a flow by system in the presence of nor the active chlorine concentration significantly decreased and was almost completely consumed with the nor concentration increasing to 200 μm verifying the contribution of active chlorine to the degradation of nor although cl was more effective in strengthening the flow by system the k nor values of the rem system for the degradation of 200 10 μm nor were still 3 4 14 4 and 66 3 77 6 larger than those of the flow by system when cl concentrations were 3 4 and 1 mm respectively overall the rem system demonstrates improved electrooxidation kinetics in various matrices though its advantages to treat chloride laden waters are not as remarkable as that containing nonreactive electrolytes e g kh2po4 our work suggests that the use of a realistic matrix would be crucial to objectively assess the performance of rem in practical applications 3 3 2 formation of inorganic chlorinated byproducts clo3 and clo4 are the dominant chlorinated byproducts that are produced in the anodic oxidation processes in the presence of cl in this study only low toxicity clo3 was detected in both rem and flow by systems to treat chloride laden waters in order to verify this result clo3 oxidation experiment was performed as shown in fig s10 and no clo4 was observed during 60 min reaction time fig 4 shows that the formation of clo3 in the rem system was consistently less than in the flow by system under all tested conditions take 200 μm nor decay in 1 mm nacl solution as an example fig 4a the accumulated clo3 in the rem system was 176 8 μm after 60 min of reaction which was only 42 8 of that 413 5 μm produced from the flow by system the lower yield of clo3 in the rem system could be ascribed to the competition of different species e g nor oh and cl for the electroactive sites which might inhibit the conversion of cl into clo3 the higher yield of clo3 as a result of a decrease in the nor concentration fig 4c vs a or an increase in cl concentration fig 4b vs a also confirmed this hypothesis prior work has also indicated that the preferential oxidation of organic compounds on the anode would result in less clo3 and clo4 formation lin et al 2020 while it is indicated that ti4o7 anode to treat chloride laden waters could simultaneously produce clo3 and clo4 lin et al 2020 wang et al 2020 only clo3 was found in this study perchlorate is reported to be the dominant final product on the nonactive anodes jasper et al 2017 ti4o7 anodes used in the literature are usually built upon the sintered compacts lin et al 2020 wang et al 2020 in comparison the ti4o7 ceramic membrane of our work was fabricated by spraying ti4o7 powders on a sno2 sb layer this may create a heterojunction structure xie et al demonstrated that creating a heterojunction structure on the ti4o7 anode could significantly influence the charge transfer process xie et al 2020 the increased det ability may render the composite ti4o7 rem act like an active anode that generally converts cl into clo3 yang 2020 though another plausible explanation of this phenomenon could be the rapid potential loss within the rem in the dilute environment fig 2f therefore we expect that no clo4 formation in this work should be ascribed to the unique structure of the ti4o7 rem following studies are required to strengthen our mechanistic understanding of the electronic nature of the interactions which can pave the way to establishing more advanced rems in facilitating contaminant degradation whilst inhibiting chlorinated product formation 3 3 3 impacts of chloride on the nor decay pathway and speciation time resolved samples were taken from reactors under three scenarios i e an rem system treating 10 μm nor in dilute kh2po4 solution defined as scenario 1 an rem system treating 10 μm nor in dilute nacl solution scenario 2 and a flow by system treating 10 μm nor in dilute nacl solution scenario 3 the main intermediates upon nor decay were analyzed by hrms the total ion chromatograms tic of detected products and corresponding second order mass spectrums ms2 are shown in figs s11 13 we found that the extracted tic and ms2 were identical indicating that the main products were the same among the three scenarios the identified product at an m z of 322 1197 had two tic peaks at different retention times which suggested the formation of isomers based on the hrms results and existing studies guo et al 2020 jing et al 2021 three routines i e piperazinyl ring opening decarboxylation and defluorination involving eight main products are presented figs 5 and s11 13 fig 5b c respectively compare the temporal variations of the peak areas of nor1 nor2 and nor3 the initial products of the three decay pathways as compared with scenario 1 larger peak areas of nor1 and nor2 and a smaller peak area of nor3 were observed in scenario 2 indicating that the presence of cl likely facilitated the piperazinyl ring opening and decarboxylation processes whilst inhibiting the defluorination process in the rem system the inhibition of defluorination could be related to the scavenging of oh by cl 4 3 109 m 1 s 1 and the resultant reactive chlorine species are less reactive to break the strong c f bond 130 kcal mol 1 in scenario 3 the peak area of nor2 was the largest among the three groups while those of nor1 and nor3 were the smallest the k nor value in scenario 3 was identical to that in scenario 2 but higher than in scenario 1 fig 3d it can be concluded that decarboxylation should be the main mechanism for the rapid degradation of nor by using the flow by system in the presence of cl our work shows that while the nor decay in the rem and flow by systems is based on similar pathways the presence of the common anion cl could significantly influence the speciation of the electrooxidation products in addition we have searched the m z of the reported organic chlorinated intermediates c16h17n3o3fcl m z 354 1015 c16h16n3o3cl2 m z 369 0641 c16h18n3o3cl m z 336 1109 c14h15n3o3fcl m z 328 0859 c12h10n2o3fcl m z

byproducts were not formed or further degraded in both rem and flow by systems 3 4 a single pass ti4o7 rem system for environmental application a single pass ti4o7 rem system has been devised to treat wwtp effluent conductivity 500 μs cm 1 and surface water conductivity 181 μs cm 1 spiked with antibiotics of tch lev and nor each antibiotic was set at 100 nm according to the oxidation kinetics of antibiotics in a single module operated at the optimized anode current of 0 5 ma cm 2 and water flux of 2 4 10 3 m3 m 2 s 1 section s6 and figs s14 and s15 the minimal numbers of rem modules that could achieve one log removal of antibiotics were 2 9 and 3 3 respectively for wwtp effluent and surface water therefore the single pass system was constructed by connecting four identical rem modules in series fig 6 a the hrt of the single pass system was only 30 s with the number of rem modules increasing from 1 to 4 the overall removal of antibiotics from wwtp effluent and surface water went up from 60 to 97 and 50 to 94 respectively fig 6b the higher removal for the wwtp effluent may be related to the higher conductivity and cl concentration as compared to the surface water table s1 there was an insignificant change in the concentrations 5 when the power was off fig 6c indicating a negligible contribution of sorption to antibiotic removal when an anode current density of 0 5 ma cm 2 was applied stable and high removal was observed moreover the single pass system could also efficiently remove antibiotics at a lower concentration as shown in fig s16 the percentage removal of 1 nm nor in surface water was above 90 after two rem modules and the single pass system n 4 could achieve almost 100 removal furthermore the cytotoxicity of the treated samples was assessed with a disk agar diffusion biocidal susceptibility method liang et al 2018 yang et al 2022a since the antibiotics at the concentration of 100 nm demonstrated minimal cytotoxicity wwtp effluents spiked individually with 160 μm tch lev or nor were used as the feed fig s17 demonstrates that the inhibition zones became diminished and eventually disappeared after the treatment by the single pass system indicating that the cytotoxicity of the treated samples was reduced the energy consumption of the single pass system was 0 015 and 0 019 kwh m 3 respectively for the wwtp effluent and surface water these values were competitive with the reported results 0 005 2 29 kwh m 3 obtained in similar application scenarios i e removing trace level contaminants by rem technology xu et al 2019 yang et al 2022a zhou et al 2019 more importantly the application of which for tertiary treatment only increased 5 0 6 4 of the total cost 0 300 kwh m 3 of a typical wwtp ozgun et al 2021 we further analyzed the total cost of the electrical energy pumping and capital cost based on the documented procedures lin et al 2021a the details are shown in section s7 the total costs in the use of a single pass system to treat said waters were 0 0125 0 0129 m 3 compared to the total cost of a tertiary wwtps 0 160 m 3 ozgun et al 2021 the implementation of the electrooxidation unit would not significantly increase the total cost 7 8 8 1 4 conclusions in summary we have devised a ti4o7 rem system for energy efficient and rapid removal of nor from low conductivity water the superior interfacial mass transfer in the rem resulted in the enhanced det process playing a vital role in electrooxidation we demonstrated that the ti4o7 rem system could sustain its high efficiency in the treatment of bicarbonate laden water while the presence of cl prompted the nor decay kinetics in a flow by system this inevitably caused the formation of chlorinated products in comparison the ti4o7 rem system significantly inhibited the production of clo3 likely due to the preferential reaction of the active site with the antibiotics although organic chlorinated byproducts were not detected upon electrooxidation of nor in the ti4o7 rem system cl influenced the speciation of the intermediates a single pass four stages ti4o7 rem system could remove 94 97 of trace antibiotics from surface water and wwtp effluent in 30 s at ultralow energy consumption the results of this study have advanced our understanding of the reactive electrochemical ceramic membrane technique for the remediation of contaminated natural waters
