in global hydrologic cycle with direct linkage to water resources availability and hydrologic extremes assessing the uncertainty in tws projections are fundamentally important for developing counter measures against impacts of climate change on water resources and disasters this study presents a global scale evaluation of model agreement and uncertainty in tws anomaly twsa simulations within the isimip 2b framework by comparison with the 2006 2016 gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data the total 24 members of isimip2b ensembles considered here include the permutations of 6 global water models gwms clm4 5 h08 lplml matsiro pcr globwb watergap2 simulations forced by 4 global climate models gcms gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc5 under rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 scenarios results show that the fraction of global land area with the same sign between the isimip2b ensemble mean and grace twsa is 47 5 and 47 3 under rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 respectively the ensemble mean reproduces the negative positive twsa in southern north america southwestern asia northern and central africa central south america and northern europe under both scenarios more than 50 of ensemble members agree with grace tws better in the sign of drying trend than wetting trend over the global land the interannual tws variations among ensemble members show better agreement in north america and europe than other continents more than 80 of ensemble members simulate larger smaller tws seasonal amplitude than grace in north america europe and asia south america africa and australia gwm is found to be the main source of uncertainty in tws simulations in north america europe and asia 55 while gcm uncertainty is the dominant uncertainty source in south america africa and australia 45 keywords terrestrial water storage model agreement grace satellite isimip 2b model uncertainty data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction terrestrial water storage tws is the total water available in the terrestrial freshwater stocks including surface water water in lakes rivers reservoirs and swamps and wetlands groundwater soil moisture snow water equivalent and canopy water chao et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 it is a vital component in the global hydrologic cycle and its interactions with other hydrologic variables and processes within the earth system famiglietti 2004 which dictates the changes in water availability and hydrologic extremes flood and drought tws anomalies twsa can be used to monitor and predict the extreme hydrological events due to the close dependence between them asoka and mishra 2020 hanasaki et al 2018 padrón et al 2020 reager and famiglietti 2013 rodell et al 2018 detailed investigation of the spatio temporal dynamics and changes in tws is hence significant to the effective water resources management and water disaster prediction eicker et al 2016 pokhrel et al 2021 various techniques have been developed for monitoring tws at different spatial and temporal scales which can be broadly divided as 1 in situ measurements 2 remote sensing applications and 3 numerical model simulations the in situ measurements can potentially capture tws changes at local or regional scales accurately yeh and wu 2018 but difficult at the large scale studies due to high cost of data collection and the issues of scale mismatch and spatial heterogeneities famiglietti et al 2008 huang et al 2013 remote sensing applications and hydrologic simulations can overcome these limitations and hence have been widely used to investigate large scale tws variabilities trends and changes eicker et al 2016 jia et al 2020 rodell et al 2018 scanlon et al 2018 and 2016 soltani et al 2021 syed et al 2008 zhang et al 2017 the most commonly used global scale remote sensing based tws dataset is the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite data tapley et al 2004 and tapley et al 2019 since march 2002 grace twsa has been widely applied in estimating groundwater storage changes döll et al 2014 li et al 2019 wang et al 2020 yeh et al 2006 river discharge ehalt macedo et al 2019 xie et al 2019 evapotranspiration long et al 2014 pan et al 2017 and the changing mass of ice sheets baur et al 2009 velicogna et al 2020 and glaciers ciracì et al 2020 schrama et al 2014 these grace applications have provided important insights on the variability of regional to global tws and more general for the entire water cycle the model simulation data from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 and 6 cmip5 and cmip6 eyring et al 2016 taylor et al 2012 have been used to investigate large scale tws dynamics and changes globally or regionally jensen et al 2019 wu et al 2021 however the tws simulations in cmip5 or cmip6 often are limited to soil moisture and snow water equivalent only since surface water and groundwater processes are usually not explicitly represented in most global climate models gcms freedman et al 2014 the global water models gwms including global hydrologic models ghms and land surface models lsms were developed based on the physical processes in the terrestrial water cycles gwm is an effective tool to simulate tws for historical reconstructions eicker et al 2016 jing et al 2020 śliwińska et al 2019 syed et al 2008 zhang et al 2017 and future projections freedman et al 2014 jensen et al 2019 kumar et al 2014 pokhrel et al 2021 qian et al 2015 over the last two decades several global model inter comparison projects were organized to model global surface water and energy balance to estimate current and future water availability and to investigate the differences uncertainties among models these intercomparison projects include the project to intercompare land surface parameterization schemes pilps henderson sellers et al 1995 the water model intercomparison watermip within the european union water and global change euwatch haddeland et al 2011 harding et al 2011 the more recent land surface snow and soil moisture model intercomparison project ls3mip van den hurk et al 2016 and the intersectoral impact model intercomparison project isimip warszawski et al 2014 isimip phase 2b isimip 2b frieler et al 2017 addressed historical simulations and future projections of hydrologic impacts considering human disturbance chen et al 2021 dankers et al 2014 huang et al 2021 joo et al 2020 liu et al 2021 wang et al 2022 the participating gwms were run in an offline mode driven by the bias corrected simulation data from four cmip5 gcms hempel et al 2013 lange 2018 the aim of isimip 2b is to evaluate the hydrologic impact of 1 5 c global warming based on the representative concentration pathway rcp 2 6 and 6 0 frieler et al 2017 reinecke et al 2021 the isimip 2b provides the simulated global scale multi model data of water fluxes or state variables during the historical 1861 2005 and future 2006 2099 periods elkouk et al 2021 gu et al 2019 reinecke et al 2021 warszawski et al 2014 accurate projection of future tws depends on the ability of gcm and gwm to reproduce the historical observations uncertainties exist in gwm simulations kay et al 2009 ju et al 2021 since different gwms have various parameterization of physical processes and different parameter estimations strategies ito et al 2020 müller schmied et al 2014 telteu et al 2021 zaherpour et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 the retrospective river discharge and tws simulations by gwms can contain significant biases mainly due to the various imperfect parameterizations and general lack of model parameter calibrations gosling et al 2016 hattermann et al 2017 scanlon et al 2018 assessed tws simulations of 7 gwms over 186 global river basins and found that all gwms underestimate tws trends when compared with grace tws data in addition to gwm gcm is another source of uncertainty in hydrological impact modeling studies bosshard et al 2013 giuntoli et al 2015 hattermann et al 2018 ju et al 2021 jensen et al 2019 found large disagreement in 2002 16 tws trends between 21 cmip5 gcms simulations and grace tws data based on 25 gcms in cmip6 wu et al 2021 found the relatively large small biases in simulated 2003 2014 tws in high northern latitudes tropics and mid latitudes also that the future projection of tws is sensitive to both climate change and human disturbance under different socio economic scenarios davie et al 2013 hattermann et al 2018 in spite of some advances made in tws simulations dong et al 2022 müller schmied et al 2016 pokhrel et al 2013 yang et al 2022 very few studies have evaluated the tws ensemble simulations in terms of the model agreement and against available tws observations and estimated the uncertainties of gcm and gwm in the projected tws at the global or continental scale in this study we investigate the differences in tws between simulations and grace observations for the period 2006 2016 under rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 see more details on the simulation period selection in section 2 1 based on 24 isimip 2b hydrologic model simulations including 6 gwms clm4 5 h08 lplml matsiro pcr globwb watergap2 each forced by 4 gcms gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc5 see table 1 for abbreviations the purpose is to evaluate globally the model agreement in the tws ensemble simulations of isimip 2b and to quantify the uncertainties associated with the used gcms and gwms as well as the interactions between them the tws uncertainty is estimated by using the analysis of variance anova approach in combination with the sub sampling technique specifically the objectives of this study are 1 to evaluate globally the differences in the long term mean twsa from multiple gwms driven by various gcm forcing data 2 to compare the global distribution of 2006 2016 tws trends simulated by isimip 2b ensemble members with that of grace tws data 3 to investigate the seasonal and interannual variability of tws between isimip 2b ensemble simulations and grace data over the six global continents north america europe asia south america africa australia and 4 to estimate the respective contribution of gcm and gwm to the overall uncertainties in simulated tws under the rcp 2 6 and 6 0 scenarios 2 data and methods 2 1 model simulation of tws the isimip 2b provided the global scale multi model hydrological simulation data for the projection period 2006 2099 under two rcp scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 the rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 are considered in this study because they both provide the output tws simulation data from 2006 to 2016 which is consistent with grace data see section 2 2 in isimip 2b six gwms including three lsms clm4 5 lpjml matsiro and three ghms h08 pcr globwb watergap2 were run globally to simulate the key terrestrial hydrologic processes at the 0 5 0 5 resolution human activities such as land use change co2 concentration and water use management were represented in six gwms telteu et al 2021 the details of model characteristics of six gwms are summarized in table 2 among them lpjml matsiro and h08 used the varying interannual land use changes while clm4 5 and pcr globwb used the constant land use changes with the fixed year 2005 socio economic conditions fixed 2005soc and watergap2 used a static land use map varied irrigation area four models clm4 5 lpjml matsiro pcr globwb used the varied co2 concentration with interannual variability while h08 used a constant co2 concentration and watergap2 did not consider the impact of co2 the isimip 2b provides the information of water use in different sectors e g agriculture industry domestic simulated in isimip 2a by watergap2 pcr globwb and h08 for the historical period 1861 2005 and future period 2006 2099 wada et al 2016 only watergap2 was calibrated against the grdc global runoff data centre mean river discharge at 1312 stations globally covering 54 of global lands müller schmied et al 2016 in this study the isimip 2b tws data during 2006 2016 under both rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 scenarios were taken from three lsms clm4 5 lpjml matsiro and three ghms h08 pcr globwb watergap2 these 6 gwms were selected based on the availability of the complete tws simulation data including that of all 4 gcms forcing gfdl hadgem ipsl miroc all of which were bias corrected by the trend preserving statistical bias correction algorithm lange 2018 this bias correction algorithm first corrects the average monthly temperature and precipitation by adjusting the long term deviations between simulations and observations and then corrects the variability of daily temperature precipitation using the linear regression quantile mapping hempel et al 2013 lange 2018 the simulated tws is the summation of simulated soil moisture groundwater snow water equivalent canopy water and surface water as shown in table 2 soil moisture and snow water equivalent were included in all gwms but canopy water and surface water storages were only included in watergap2 and matsiro the groundwater storage is explicitly computed in watergap2 and matsiro and is taken into account under groundwater recharge and groundwater runoff in other gwms 2 2 grace data since march 2002 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission has provided effective global scale remote sensing data for detecting large scale tws variability tapley et al 2004 tapley et al 2019 the publicly available grace solutions include the traditional spherical harmonic solutions and the mass concentration mascon solutions rodell et al 2018 scanlon et al 2018 compared to the spherical harmonic grace data the mascon grace data have no striping errors and can capture the signals observed by grace within the measurement noise level yin et al 2020 the monthly grace rl06 mascon dataset from 2006 to 2016 with the 1 1 resolution available at http www2 csr utexas edu grace rl06 mascons html save 2020 scanlon et al 2016 from the center for space research csr at the university of texas are used in this study to evaluate tws simulations because of its high resolution and wide usability jia et al 2020 jing et al 2019 wei et al 2021 the data after 2016 were not considered because the data from june 2017 to may 2018 were lost due to the satellite crash save 2020 there are 13 months of missing data during 2006 2016 which were interpolated by linear interpolation long et al 2015 the twsa is calculated by removing the 2004 2009 mean tws at each grid globally consistent with the commonly accepted definition of grace twsa lin et al 2019 wang et al 2020 wei et al 2021 2 3 analysis methods in this study the comparisons of tws simulations with grace tws are conducted at the global northern hemisphere nh southern hemisphere sh and at six continents the taylor diagram taylor 2001 represented by three evaluation indices the correlation coefficient r the centered root mean square error rmsd the normalized standard deviation nstd the mean absolute error mae and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients nse are used together to evaluate the model performance the mann kendall m k trend test mann 1945 kendall 1975 is used to estimate the statistical significance of trends in simulated and grace tws the trend magnitude is estimated by the kendall s rank correlation tau sen 1968 a significance level of 5 is used to evaluate the statistical significance in this study the uncertainty analysis includes the representation of uncertainty range and the quantification of uncertainty contribution the uncertainty range is represented by the difference between 95th and 5th percentile estimates of the projected tws wu et al 2020 the anova approach combined with the sub sampling technique is used to quantify the uncertainty from gcms and gwms in tws simulations bosshard et al 2013 the contribution of the different uncertainty sources is quantified by using the decomposition of the sum of squares within the anova approach sampling of gwms by using the sub sampling technique to match the sizes of gwms samples with that of gcms samples is used to eliminate the effect of different sample sizes of the two uncertainty sources the detailed description of this method is seen in supplementary material 3 results in order to ensure the convenience of statistical comparisons below the gcm simulation denotes the ensemble average of simulations using 6 gwms with the identical gcm forcing whereas the gwm simulation denotes the ensemble averages of simulations by the identical gwm but with 4 gcms forcing 3 1 model agreement in the spatial distribution of twsa fig 1 plots the global distributions of 1 2006 2016 mean grace twsa fig 1a and the isimip 2b ensemble mean twsa of 24 simulations for rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 fig 1b and c 2 the positive wet and negative dry twsa of the ensemble mean consistent with grace fig 1d and e and 3 the standard deviation std of twsa of the 24 simulations fig 1f and g the model agreement fig 1d and 1e is considered by the same sign in the dry wet pattern between grace twsa and ensemble mean twsa recall that twsa is defined as the deviation from the 2004 2009 mean tws at each grid so the 2006 2016 long term averages plotted fig 1a 1b and 1c are not zero hence the global pattern of twsa shown in fig 1 indicates the dry wet pattern of the 2006 2016 mean twsa relative to the corresponding 2004 2009 mean twsa at each grid overall the fraction of global land areas with the same sign between grace twsa and ensemble mean twsa is 47 5 and 47 3 under rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 respectively table 3 in addition the global land fraction with grace consistency of for positive twsa is 22 1 22 4 under rcp2 6 6 0 and that with grce consistency for negative twsa is 25 4 24 8 under rcp2 6 6 0 as seen in fig 1b and 1d rcp 2 6 the ensemble mean twsa agrees well with grace for negative twsa in the western australia southwestern asia eastern europe central africa northern south america and southwestern north america for positive twsa the agreement is found in amazon northern europe and eastern usa fig 1d for rcp6 0 fig 1c and 1e the ensemble mean twsa reproduces the negative positive twsa in southwestern north america northern and central africa southern asia and western russia eastern australia eastern africa and amazon however for both scenarios the ensemble mean twsa fails to simulate the negative positive twsa in eastern brazil and northern asia central north america and southeastern china the large model spread among 24 simulations can be found fig 1f and 1 g in southeastern north america central south america eastern europe central africa southern asia and northern china under both scenarios the global pattern of model spread is generally similar between two scenarios except for australia where the model spread is considerably larger under rcp6 0 than under rcp2 6 fig 2 compares under both scenarios the global distribution of 2006 2016 mean grace twsa and four simulated ensemble mean twsa forced by 4 different gcms i e each ensemble mean is the average from six gwms forced by the same gcm consistent with grace fig 2a some models simulated negative twsa over the northern north america such as the miroc driven simulations under both scenarios fig 2h and i and ipsl driven simulation under rcp6 0 fig 2g the simulated twsa by both gfdl under rcp6 0 and ipsl under rcp2 6 agree with the negative grace twsa in the southern north america the positive grace twsa in the central south america is well captured by nearly all simulations under both scenarios except for those driven by hadgem fig 2d and e however nearly all gcm forcings fail to capture the negative grace twsa in the northern and eastern south america except for hadgem under rcp2 6 and miroc under both scenarios fig 2d 2 h and 2i and also fail to reproduce the negative tws fig 2a in southern south america except for the ipsl driven simulation under both scenarios fig 2f and 2 g in addition most gcms fail to reproduce the positive twsa in the central north america except for the simulations driven by ipsl and miroc under rcp6 0 fig 2g and 2i most gcm forcings fail to reproduce the negative twsa in the eastern europe in contrast most gcm forcings can capture the negative twsa in the northern and central africa but cannot reproduce the positive twsa in the western and eastern africa furthermore the gcm simulations perform better under rcp6 0 than under rcp2 6 in the northern africa while the opposite is true in the central africa most gcm simulations can detect the negative twsa in the western central and southern asia including northeastern and northwestern china india and pakistan but the twsa magnitudes vary greatly among different gcm forcings fig 3 compares under rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 the global distribution of 2006 2016 ensemble mean twsa simulated by six different gwms for each of them the ensemble mean twsa includes 4 simulations forced by 4 gcms as seen clm4 5 simulations under rcp2 6 only project negative twsa over the northern north america fig 3a the simulated twsa by clm4 5 matsiro and watergap2 under both scenarios all agree with the negative grace twsa in the southern north america while an overestimation in twsa is found in the simulations of h08 lpjml and pcr globwb in addition the positive wet twsa over the central south america and the negative dry twsa over the northern south america are well captured by all gwms under both scenarios nearly all gwms fail to capture the negative twsa pattern in the eastern south america under both scenarios and also fail to reproduce negative twsa in the southern south america furthermore almost all gwms under rcp2 6 agree with the negative twsa in the eastern europe but fail to reproduce the positive twsa in the western europe while the opposite is true for gwms under rcp6 0 overall all gwms perform better under rcp6 0 than that under rcp2 6 in the northern africa and australia in addition all gwms fail to reproduce the dry twsa pattern in the northern asia and the wet tws pattern positive twsa in the northeastern asia fig 3 3 2 model agreement in tws trend fig 4 a plots the global distribution of the statistically significant p 0 05 wetting and drying grace tws trends 2006 2016 fig 4b rcp2 6 and 4c rcp6 0 plot the global distributions of the percentage of the total 24 ensemble members simulations simulating the consistent tws trend in sign with grace from fig 4a significant drying trends can be found in sahara desert the middle east region northern and southwestern north america eastern brazil northern russia northern and southwestern china and western australia in contrast significant wetting trends are found in the central north america southeastern south america northern europe western and eastern africa central and eastern china and southeastern australia from fig 4b and c 30 7 of simulations agree with tws trend in northern russia under both scenarios and the wetting trend in the northern africa under rcp6 0 in contrast 50 12 of simulations agree with the drying trends in the northern and southwestern north america sahara desert and southwestern asia while 50 12 of simulations agree with the wetting trends in the southeastern south america and eastern africa the central north america and southeastern australia under rcp2 6 6 0 fig 4d k displays for each gcm forcing the global distributions of the numbers of gwms simulating the significant wetting or drying trends p 0 05 consistent with grace few gwms project the consistent tws trend with grace over most global regions especially in the northern russia and eastern china fig 4d k which is in line with the findings in fig 4b and c more than half 3 of gwms can project the drying tws trend mainly in the sahara desert and southwestern asia particularly all 6 gwms forced by ipsl simulate the consistent drying trend with grace in the western australia under rcp2 6 fig 4h whereas this drying trend is not detected in any simulations forced by the other 3 gcms fig 4d f and j indicating large uncertainties of gcm forcing data over this region fig 5 displays for each of 6 gwms the global distributions of the numbers of gcms simulating the significant wetting or drying tws trends p 0 05 consistent with the grace observations few gcms are able to project the drying tws trend in northern russia and the wetting tws trend in eastern china while 2 gcms project the drying tws trend mainly in the sahara desert and southwestern asia particularly all the simulations of clm4 5 and matsiro generally can capture the drying trend in the southwestern north america while the other 4 gwms perform poorly over this region fig 5 indicating large uncertainties in gwm simulations over this region 3 3 model agreement in interannual and seasonal tws fig 6 compares the 2006 2016 monthly tws time series of the ensemble simulations by 4 gcms and 6 gwms respectively and the corresponding grace data on the global nh and sh scales as well as in the six continents the corresponding taylor diagrams summarizing the statistical metrics of comparisons are plotted in fig 7 most model simulations are able to capture the tws temporal variability at the global scale fig 6a and table s1 with the r between simulations and grace mostly 0 6 at the global and the hemisphere scales fig 7a c and table s2 however large discrepancies in certain simulations can be found for example in the global mean tws simulated by clm4 5 fig 6a moreover pcr globwb underestimates the global mean and nh mean tws while h08 lpjml and watergap2 underestimate the sh mean tws for each gcm the error in ipsl forced sh mean tws is larger than that forced by other gcms fig 7c compared to grace most of the simulated global mean and nh mean tws exhibit higher variabilities 1 nstd except for pcr globwb simulations but the sh mean tws shows lower variabilities 1 nstd fig 7a c and table s1 for the mean over each continent the difference in tws simulations between rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 is larger in australia and africa than other continents especially for simulations forced by ipsl fig 6h and i a higher r between simulated and grace tws can be found in north america 0 61 0 95 and europe 0 66 0 94 larger than that found in asia 0 44 0 84 and south america 0 47 0 73 in contrast larger discrepancies are found in north america and europe fig 6h and i with a smaller r of 0 30 0 55 and 0 39 0 64 respectively table s2 for most of the simulations 16 out of 24 the temporal variability of simulated tws tends to be higher lower than grace in north america and europe asia south america africa and australia fig 7 and table s1 in particular the clm4 5 simulations show the largest discrepancies with the nstd of 1 5 1 6 and 1 3 in north america europe and asia respectively the simulated tws by pcr globwb has the lowest amplitude nstd 0 4 in asia fig 7d 7f in addition the hadgem forced tws simulations show large variability in europe with the underestimation during 2006 2008 and overestimation during 2012 2016 fig 6i overall the performance of multi model tws simulations is better with higher r and nse and lower mae and rmsd in global north america and africa under rcp2 6 than that under rcp6 0 table 4 and tables s2 s5 in contrast the performance of multi model tws simulations under rcp6 0 is better than those under rcp2 6 in both asia and south america continents table 4 and tables s2 s5 the 2006 2016 seasonal variability of grace and simulated tws is compared in fig 8 under both scenarios as shown the simulations generally predict consistent seasonal tws changes under both scenarios except for the ipsl forced simulations in australia most simulations particularly clm4 5 and h08 overestimate underestimate tws during january march and september december april august at both global and nh north america europe and asia scales almost all models particularly h08 overestimate underestimate tws during january and september december february july at the sh scale mainly south america fig 8 in contrast model simulations underestimate overestimate tws during january april june december in africa and underestimate overestimate tws during march october january february and november december in australia additionally compared with grace most models produce larger seasonal tws amplitudes from peak to trough in north america europe and asia and lower seasonal tws amplitudes in south america africa and australia fig 8 and table s6 3 4 model uncertainty assessment in tws simulations fig 9 plots the uncertainty range of 6 gwm simulations and 4 gcm simulations under both scenarios as shown in fig 9a and b the uncertainty ranges of gwm are larger than that of gcm at the global scale and nh while the opposite pattern is found in sh fig 9c for the six continents the uncertainty ranges of gwm are generally larger than that of gcm in north america europe and asia during 2006 2016 in contrast the uncertainty ranges of gcm are larger than that of gwm in south america africa and australia the anova method combined with the sub sampling technique see the supplementary material was further used to quantify the uncertainties associated with tws simulations contributed respectively by different gcms and gwms fig 10 plots the temporal evolutions of the relative contributions of gcm gwm and their interactions to the overall uncertainties in tws simulations on the globe scale in nh and sh as well as at six continents for the global scale and nh gwm is the dominant contributor 62 89 to tws uncertainties also with an increasing trend of contribution over time while gcm has limited contribution 6 28 and with a decreasing trend in contribution in contrast the contributions of gcm and gcm gwm interaction to simulated tws uncertainties are larger in sh 38 and 17 respectively while in nh the same sources contribute respectively to only 16 and 7 of the total uncertainty for the six continents the uncertainty contributions of gcm and gwm show large interannual variations in particular gwm contribution decreases increase over time in north america europe under both scenarios overall gwm has the largest contribution to simulated tws uncertainty in north america 63 europe 55 and asia 68 whereas gcm has the largest contribution in south america 45 africa 55 and australia 55 relative to rcp2 6 the mean uncertainty contribution of gwm under rcp6 0 is increased in north america 1 4 europe 3 9 and asia 3 3 while the mean uncertainty contribution of gcm under rcp6 0 is decreased in south america 2 9 africa 1 9 and australia 1 2 in summary gwm is the dominant contributor to the simulated tws uncertainties on the global scale and in nh north america europe and asia the gcm uncertainty is the main contributors to tws uncertainties in the sh south america africa and australia 4 discussions 4 1 discrepancy in tws simulations between different gwms our results in fig 6 show that the discrepancies in the ensemble simulations of six gwms compared to grace are larger in north america europe and asia than that in south america africa and australia fig 6 this is supported by fig 10 which indicates that the gwm uncertainty is larger in nh than sh although some gwms e g matsiro and pcr globwb show fairly well tws temporal variability at the global nh sh and continental scales the discrepancies of tws among six gwm simulations are apparent table s4 model comparisons indicate that matsiro outperforms other gwms at the global nse 0 85 nh nse 0 78 and sh nse 0 84 scales table s4 likely due to that matsiro has a thicker soil depth including the total 13 layers telteu et al 2021 and the representation of all tws components table 2 in contrast h08 nse 0 44 and lpjml nse 0 55 show large biases in tws simulations at all scales considered table s4 suggesting the marked influences of process representation in gwms the uncertainty analysis fig 10 suggests that gwm uncertainty is larger in nh north america europe asia than sh south america africa australia since the high latitude regions of nh are snow dominated the parameterizations of snow melt and soil freezing processes in gwms are the likely factor of high uncertainty source giuntoli et al 2015 haddeland et al 2011 hattermann et al 2017 suggesting the necessity of more advancements in developing model parametrization in high latitude snow dominated regions 4 2 uncertainty of tws projections in gcms and rcps despite in isimip 2b gcm data have been bias corrected for hydrologic simulations the discrepancies among 4 gcm simulations are larger in south america africa and australia than that in north america europe and asia fig 6 consistent with fig 10 where it shows the gcm uncertainty is larger in sh than nh this is also supported by wu et al 2021 who found the larger gcm uncertainty in meteorological drought projections in sh than in nh one main reason for this is that gcms simulations exhibit substantially higher precipitation variability in sh than nh nasrollahi et al 2015 in addition most gcms simulate larger tws seasonal amplitudes in nh and smaller tws seasonal amplitudes in sh than grace tws fig 8 and table s6 due to the larger smaller precipitation seasonal amplitudes in gcm forcing data in nh sh table s7 it should also be noted that the gcm uncertainty assessment based on statistical attributes should be unilateral because the gcms are not independent random samples from some space of all possible gcms with shared methods and codes between gcms knutti 2010 knutti and sedláček 2012 therefore it is difficult to accurately evaluate the uncertainty caused by various numerical approximations of the underlying physics in gcms overall the spatio temporal variability of tws simulations under is similar between rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 except for australia which is consistent with jia et al 2020 who reported similar twsa simulations in china under these two scenarios the reason of this agreement is likely attributed to the similarity in temperature changes in the beginning of 21st century under two scenarios frieler et al 2017 however large differences in tws simulations between rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 can be found in australia which can be attributed to the larger spatial difference in the wet and dry climate conditions between rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 in this continent pokhrel et al 2021 future research should be conducted to explore the differences in tws projections under different rcps across global sub regions in particular for the far future in order to better characterize rcp uncertainty over time 5 conclusions this study presents a global scale evaluation of model agreement and uncertainty in tws anomaly twsa simulations within the isimip 2b framework by comparison with the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data during 2006 2016 the total 24 members of isimip2b ensembles considered here include the permutations of 6 global water models gwms clm4 5 h08 lplml matsiro pcr globwb and watergap2 simulations forced by 4 global climate models gcms gfdl hadgem ipsl and miroc under rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 scenarios the results showed that the multi model ensemble simulations under both scenarios can reproduce the spatial patterns of long term mean negative positive twsa in southern north america southwestern asia northern and central africa central south america and northern europe however large differences in twsa simulations between rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 can be found in australia trend analyses indicated close agreement in the drying trend among 24 ensemble members but weak agreement in the wetting trend among them interannually the ensemble members show better agreement with grace tws in north america and europe than other continents seasonally however most models simulated larger respectively smaller seasonal amplitudes of tws than grace in north america europe and asia south america africa and australia results of uncertainty analysis indicate that gwm is the dominant source of uncertainty in tws simulations in north america europe and asia with the mean contribution of 63 55 and 68 of the total tws uncertainties respectively whereas gcm is the largest uncertainty source in south america africa and australia with the mean contribution of 45 55 and 55 respectively

show that the fraction of global land area with the same sign between the isimip2b ensemble mean and grace twsa is 47 5 and 47 3 under rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 respectively the ensemble mean reproduces the negative positive twsa in southern north america southwestern asia northern and central africa central south america and northern europe under both scenarios more than 50 of ensemble members agree

water storage model agreement grace satellite isimip 2b model uncertainty data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction terrestrial water storage tws is the total water available in the terrestrial freshwater stocks including surface water water in lakes rivers reservoirs and swamps and wetlands groundwater soil moisture snow water equivalent and canopy water chao et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 it is a vital component in the global hydrologic cycle and its interactions with other hydrologic variables and processes within the earth system famiglietti 2004 which dictates the changes in water availability and hydrologic extremes flood and drought tws anomalies twsa can be used to monitor and predict the extreme hydrological events due to the close dependence between them asoka and mishra 2020 hanasaki et al 2018 padrón et al 2020 reager and famiglietti 2013 rodell et al 2018 detailed investigation of the spatio temporal dynamics and changes in tws is hence significant to the effective water resources management and water disaster prediction eicker et al 2016 pokhrel et al 2021 various techniques have been developed for monitoring tws at different spatial and temporal scales which can be broadly divided as 1 in situ measurements 2 remote sensing applications and 3 numerical model simulations the in situ measurements can potentially capture tws changes at local or regional scales accurately yeh and wu 2018 but difficult at the large scale studies due to high cost of data collection and the issues of scale mismatch and spatial heterogeneities famiglietti et al 2008 huang et al 2013 remote sensing applications and hydrologic simulations can overcome these limitations and hence have been widely used to investigate large scale tws variabilities trends and changes eicker et al 2016 jia et al 2020 rodell et al 2018 scanlon et al 2018 and 2016 soltani et al 2021 syed et al 2008 zhang et al 2017 the most commonly used global scale remote sensing based tws dataset is the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite data tapley et al 2004 and tapley et al 2019 since march 2002 grace twsa has been widely applied in estimating groundwater storage changes döll et al 2014 li et al 2019 wang et al 2020 yeh et al 2006 river discharge ehalt macedo et al 2019 xie et al 2019 evapotranspiration long et al 2014 pan et al 2017 and the changing mass of ice sheets baur et al 2009 velicogna et al 2020 and glaciers ciracì et al 2020 schrama et al 2014 these grace applications have provided important insights on the variability of regional to global tws and more general for the entire water cycle the model simulation data from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 and 6 cmip5 and cmip6 eyring et al 2016 taylor et al 2012 have been used to investigate large scale tws dynamics and changes globally or regionally jensen et al 2019 wu et al 2021 however the tws simulations in cmip5 or cmip6 often are limited to soil moisture and snow water equivalent only since surface water and groundwater processes are usually not explicitly represented in most global climate models gcms freedman et al 2014 the global water models gwms including global hydrologic models ghms and land surface models lsms were developed based on the physical processes in the terrestrial water cycles gwm is an effective tool to simulate tws for historical reconstructions eicker et al 2016 jing et al 2020 śliwińska et al 2019 syed et al 2008 zhang et al 2017 and future projections freedman et al 2014 jensen et al 2019 kumar et al 2014 pokhrel et al 2021 qian et al 2015 over the last two decades several global model inter comparison projects were organized to model global surface water and energy balance to estimate current and future water availability and to investigate the differences uncertainties among models these intercomparison projects include the project to intercompare land surface parameterization

et al 2014 accurate projection of future tws depends on the ability of gcm and gwm to reproduce the historical observations uncertainties exist in gwm simulations kay et al 2009 ju et al 2021 since different gwms have various parameterization of physical processes and different parameter estimations strategies ito et al 2020 müller schmied et al 2014 telteu et al 2021 zaherpour et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 the retrospective river discharge and tws simulations by gwms can contain significant biases mainly due to the various imperfect parameterizations and general lack of model parameter calibrations gosling et al 2016 hattermann et al 2017 scanlon et al 2018 assessed tws simulations of 7 gwms over 186 global river basins and found that all gwms underestimate tws trends when compared with grace tws data in addition to gwm gcm is another source of uncertainty in hydrological impact modeling studies bosshard et al 2013 giuntoli et al 2015 hattermann et al 2018 ju et al 2021 jensen et al 2019 found large disagreement in 2002 16 tws trends between 21 cmip5 gcms simulations and grace tws data based on 25 gcms in cmip6 wu et al 2021 found the relatively large small biases in simulated 2003 2014 tws in high northern latitudes tropics and mid latitudes also that the future projection of tws is sensitive to both climate change and human disturbance under different socio economic scenarios davie et al 2013 hattermann et al 2018 in spite of some advances made in tws simulations dong et al 2022 müller schmied et al 2016 pokhrel et al 2013 yang et al 2022 very few studies have evaluated the tws ensemble simulations in terms of the model agreement and against available tws observations and estimated the uncertainties of gcm and gwm in the projected tws at the global or continental scale in this study we investigate the differences in tws between simulations and grace observations for the period 2006 2016 under rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 see more details on the simulation period selection in section 2 1 based on 24 isimip 2b hydrologic model simulations including 6 gwms clm4 5 h08 lplml matsiro pcr globwb watergap2 each forced by 4 gcms gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc5 see table 1 for abbreviations the purpose is to evaluate globally the model agreement in the tws ensemble simulations of isimip 2b and to quantify the uncertainties associated with the used gcms and gwms as well as the interactions between them the tws uncertainty is estimated by using the analysis of variance anova approach in combination with the sub sampling technique specifically the objectives of this study are 1 to evaluate globally the differences in the long term mean twsa from multiple gwms driven by various gcm forcing data 2 to compare the global distribution of 2006 2016 tws trends simulated by isimip 2b ensemble members with that of grace tws data 3 to investigate the seasonal and interannual variability of tws between isimip 2b ensemble simulations and grace data over the six global continents north america europe asia south america africa australia and 4 to estimate the respective contribution of gcm and gwm to the overall uncertainties in simulated tws under the rcp 2 6 and 6 0 scenarios 2 data and methods 2 1 model simulation of tws the isimip 2b provided the global scale multi model hydrological simulation data for the projection period 2006 2099 under two rcp scenarios rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 the rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 are considered in this study because they both provide the output tws simulation data from 2006 to 2016 which is consistent with grace data see section 2 2 in isimip 2b six gwms including three lsms clm4 5 lpjml matsiro and three ghms h08 pcr globwb watergap2 were run globally to simulate the key terrestrial hydrologic processes at the 0 5 0 5 resolution human activities such as land use change co2 concentration and water use management were represented in six gwms telteu et al 2021 the details of model characteristics of six gwms are summarized in table 2 among them lpjml matsiro and h08 used the varying interannual land use changes while clm4 5 and pcr globwb used the constant land use changes with the fixed year 2005 socio economic conditions fixed 2005soc and watergap2 used a static land use map varied irrigation area four models clm4 5 lpjml matsiro pcr globwb used the varied co2 concentration with interannual variability while h08 used a constant co2 concentration and watergap2 did not consider the impact of co2 the isimip 2b provides the information of water use in different sectors e g agriculture industry domestic simulated in isimip 2a by watergap2 pcr globwb and h08 for the historical period 1861 2005 and future period 2006 2099 wada et al 2016 only watergap2 was calibrated against the grdc global runoff data centre mean river discharge at 1312 stations globally covering 54 of global lands müller schmied et al 2016 in this study the isimip 2b tws data during 2006 2016 under both rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 scenarios were taken from three lsms clm4 5 lpjml matsiro and three ghms h08 pcr globwb watergap2 these 6 gwms were selected based on the availability of the complete tws simulation data including that of all 4 gcms forcing gfdl hadgem ipsl miroc all of which were bias corrected by the trend preserving statistical bias correction algorithm lange 2018 this bias correction algorithm first corrects the average monthly temperature and precipitation by adjusting the long term deviations between simulations and observations and then corrects the variability of daily temperature precipitation using the linear regression quantile mapping hempel et al 2013 lange 2018 the simulated tws is the summation of simulated soil moisture groundwater snow water equivalent canopy water and surface water as shown in table 2 soil moisture and snow water equivalent were included in all gwms but canopy water and surface water storages were only included in watergap2 and matsiro the groundwater storage is explicitly computed in watergap2 and matsiro and is taken into account under groundwater recharge and groundwater runoff in other gwms 2 2 grace data since march 2002 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission has provided effective global scale remote sensing data for detecting large scale tws variability tapley et al 2004 tapley et al 2019 the publicly available grace solutions include the traditional spherical harmonic solutions and the mass concentration mascon solutions rodell et al 2018 scanlon et al 2018 compared to the spherical harmonic grace data the mascon grace data have no striping errors and can capture the signals observed by grace within the measurement noise level yin et al 2020 the monthly grace rl06 mascon dataset from 2006 to 2016 with the 1 1 resolution available at http www2 csr utexas edu grace rl06 mascons html save 2020 scanlon et al 2016 from the center for space research csr at the university of texas are used in this study to evaluate tws simulations because of its high resolution and wide usability jia et al 2020 jing et al 2019 wei et al 2021 the data after 2016 were not considered because the data from june 2017 to may 2018 were lost due to the satellite crash save 2020 there are 13 months of missing data during 2006 2016 which were interpolated by linear interpolation long et al 2015 the twsa is calculated by removing the 2004 2009 mean tws at each grid globally consistent with the commonly accepted definition of grace twsa lin et al 2019 wang et al 2020 wei et al 2021 2 3 analysis methods in this study the comparisons of tws simulations with grace tws are conducted at the global northern hemisphere nh southern hemisphere sh and at six continents the taylor diagram taylor 2001 represented by three evaluation indices the correlation coefficient r the centered root mean square error rmsd the normalized standard deviation nstd the mean absolute error mae and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients nse are used together to evaluate the model performance the mann kendall m k trend test mann 1945 kendall 1975 is used to estimate the statistical significance of trends in simulated and grace tws the trend magnitude is estimated by the kendall s rank correlation tau sen 1968 a significance level of 5 is used to evaluate the statistical significance in this study the uncertainty analysis includes the representation of uncertainty range and the quantification of uncertainty contribution the uncertainty range is represented by the difference between 95th and 5th percentile estimates of the projected tws wu et al 2020 the anova approach combined with the sub sampling technique is used to quantify the uncertainty from gcms and gwms in tws simulations bosshard et al 2013 the contribution of the different uncertainty sources is quantified by using the decomposition of the sum of squares within the anova approach sampling of gwms by using the sub sampling technique to match the sizes of gwms samples with that of gcms samples is used to eliminate the effect of different sample sizes of the two uncertainty sources the detailed description of this method is seen in supplementary material 3 results in order to ensure the convenience of statistical comparisons below the gcm simulation denotes the ensemble average of simulations using 6 gwms with the identical gcm forcing whereas the gwm simulation denotes the ensemble averages of simulations by the identical gwm but with 4 gcms forcing 3 1 model agreement in the spatial distribution of twsa fig 1 plots the global distributions of 1 2006 2016 mean grace twsa fig 1a and the isimip 2b ensemble mean twsa of 24 simulations for rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 fig 1b and c 2 the positive wet and negative dry twsa of the ensemble mean consistent with grace fig 1d and e and 3 the standard deviation std of twsa of the 24 simulations fig 1f and g the model agreement fig 1d and 1e is considered by the same sign in the dry wet pattern between grace twsa and ensemble mean twsa recall that twsa is defined as the deviation from the 2004 2009 mean tws at each grid so the 2006 2016 long term averages plotted fig 1a 1b and 1c are not zero hence the global pattern of twsa shown in fig 1 indicates the dry wet pattern of the 2006 2016 mean twsa relative to the corresponding 2004 2009 mean twsa at each grid overall the fraction of global land areas with the same sign between grace twsa and ensemble mean twsa is 47 5 and 47 3 under rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 respectively table 3 in addition the global land fraction with grace consistency of for positive twsa is 22 1 22 4 under rcp2 6 6 0 and that with grce consistency for negative twsa is 25 4 24 8 under rcp2 6 6 0 as seen in fig 1b and 1d rcp 2 6 the ensemble mean twsa agrees well with grace for negative twsa in the western australia southwestern asia eastern europe central africa northern south america and southwestern north america for positive twsa the agreement is found in amazon northern europe and eastern usa fig 1d for rcp6 0 fig 1c and 1e the ensemble mean twsa reproduces the negative positive twsa in southwestern north america northern and central africa southern asia and western russia eastern australia eastern africa and amazon however for both scenarios the ensemble mean twsa fails to simulate the negative positive twsa in eastern brazil and northern asia central north america and southeastern china the large model spread among 24 simulations can be found fig 1f and 1 g in southeastern north america central south america eastern europe central africa southern asia and northern china under both scenarios the global pattern of model spread is generally similar between two scenarios except for australia where the model spread is considerably larger under rcp6 0 than under rcp2 6 fig 2 compares under both scenarios the global distribution of 2006 2016 mean grace twsa and four simulated ensemble mean twsa forced by 4 different gcms i e each ensemble mean is the average from six gwms forced by the same gcm consistent with grace fig 2a some models simulated negative twsa over the northern north america such as the miroc driven simulations under both scenarios fig 2h and i and ipsl driven simulation under rcp6 0 fig 2g the simulated twsa by both gfdl under rcp6 0 and ipsl under rcp2 6 agree with the negative grace twsa in the southern north america the positive grace twsa in the central south america is well captured by nearly all simulations under both scenarios except for those driven by hadgem fig 2d and e however nearly all gcm forcings fail to capture the negative grace twsa in the northern and eastern south america except for hadgem under rcp2 6 and miroc under both scenarios fig 2d 2 h and 2i and also fail to reproduce the negative tws fig 2a in southern south america except for the ipsl driven simulation under both scenarios fig 2f and 2 g in addition most gcms fail to reproduce the positive twsa in the central north america except for the simulations driven by ipsl and miroc under rcp6 0 fig 2g and 2i most gcm forcings fail to reproduce the negative twsa in the eastern europe in contrast most gcm forcings can capture the negative twsa in the northern and central africa but cannot reproduce the positive twsa in the western and eastern africa furthermore the gcm simulations perform better under rcp6 0 than under rcp2 6 in the northern africa while the opposite is true in the central africa most gcm simulations can detect the negative twsa in the western central and southern asia including northeastern and northwestern china india and pakistan but the twsa magnitudes vary greatly among different gcm forcings fig 3 compares under rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 the global distribution of 2006 2016 ensemble mean twsa simulated by six different gwms for each of them the ensemble mean twsa includes 4 simulations forced by 4 gcms as seen clm4 5 simulations under rcp2 6 only project negative twsa over the northern north america fig 3a the simulated twsa by clm4 5 matsiro and watergap2 under both scenarios all agree with the negative grace twsa in the southern north america while an overestimation in twsa is found in the simulations of h08 lpjml and pcr globwb in addition the positive wet twsa over the central south america and the negative dry twsa over the northern south america are well captured by all gwms under both scenarios nearly all gwms fail to capture the negative twsa pattern in the eastern south america under both scenarios and also fail to reproduce negative twsa in the southern south america furthermore almost all gwms under rcp2 6 agree with the negative twsa in the eastern europe but fail to reproduce the positive twsa in the western europe while the opposite is true for gwms under rcp6 0 overall all gwms perform better under rcp6 0 than that under rcp2 6 in the northern africa and australia in addition all gwms fail to reproduce the dry twsa pattern in the northern asia and the wet tws pattern positive twsa in the northeastern asia fig 3 3 2 model agreement in tws trend fig 4 a plots the

ensemble members simulations simulating the consistent tws trend in sign with grace from fig 4a significant drying trends can be found in sahara desert the middle east region northern and southwestern north america eastern brazil northern russia northern and southwestern china and western australia in contrast significant wetting trends are found in the central north america southeastern south america northern europe western and eastern africa central and eastern china and southeastern australia from fig 4b and c 30 7 of simulations agree with tws trend in northern russia under both scenarios and the wetting trend in the northern africa under rcp6 0 in contrast 50 12 of simulations agree with the drying trends in the northern and southwestern north america sahara desert and southwestern asia while 50 12 of simulations agree with the wetting trends in the southeastern south america and eastern africa the central north america and southeastern australia under rcp2 6 6 0 fig 4d k displays for each gcm forcing the global distributions of the numbers of gwms simulating the significant wetting or drying trends p 0 05 consistent with grace few gwms project the consistent tws trend with grace over most global regions especially in the northern russia and eastern china fig 4d k which is in line with the findings in fig 4b and c more than half 3 of gwms can project the drying tws trend mainly in the sahara desert and southwestern asia particularly all 6 gwms forced by ipsl simulate the consistent drying trend with grace in the western australia under rcp2 6 fig 4h whereas this drying trend is not detected in any simulations forced by the other 3 gcms fig 4d f and j indicating large uncertainties of gcm forcing data over this region fig 5 displays for each of 6 gwms the global distributions of the numbers of gcms simulating the significant wetting or drying tws trends p 0 05 consistent with the grace observations few gcms are able to project the drying tws trend in northern russia and the wetting tws trend in eastern china while 2 gcms project the drying tws trend mainly in the sahara desert and southwestern asia particularly all the simulations of clm4 5 and matsiro generally can capture the drying trend in the southwestern north america while the other 4 gwms perform poorly over this region fig 5 indicating large uncertainties in gwm simulations over this region 3 3 model agreement in interannual and seasonal tws fig 6 compares the 2006 2016 monthly tws time series of the ensemble simulations by 4 gcms and 6 gwms respectively and the corresponding grace data on the global nh and sh scales as well as in the six continents the corresponding taylor diagrams summarizing the statistical metrics of comparisons are plotted in fig 7 most model simulations are able to capture the tws temporal variability at the global scale fig 6a and table s1 with the r between simulations and grace mostly 0 6 at the global and the hemisphere scales fig 7a c and table s2 however large discrepancies in certain simulations can be found for example in the global mean tws simulated by clm4 5 fig 6a moreover pcr globwb underestimates the global mean and nh mean tws while h08 lpjml and watergap2 underestimate the sh mean tws for each gcm the error in ipsl forced sh mean tws is larger than that forced by other gcms fig 7c compared to grace most of the simulated global mean and nh mean tws exhibit higher variabilities 1 nstd except for pcr globwb simulations but the sh mean tws shows lower variabilities 1 nstd fig 7a c and table s1 for the mean over each continent the difference in tws simulations between rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 is larger in australia and africa than other continents especially for simulations forced by ipsl fig 6h and i a higher r between simulated and grace tws can be found in north america 0 61 0 95 and europe 0 66 0 94 larger than that found in asia 0 44 0 84 and south america 0 47 0 73 in contrast larger discrepancies are found in north america and europe fig 6h and i with a smaller r of 0 30 0 55 and 0 39 0 64 respectively table s2 for most of the simulations 16 out of 24 the temporal variability of simulated tws tends to be higher lower than grace in north america and europe asia south america africa and australia fig 7 and table s1 in particular the clm4 5 simulations show the largest discrepancies with the nstd of 1 5 1 6 and 1 3 in north america europe and asia respectively the simulated tws by pcr globwb has the lowest amplitude nstd 0 4 in asia fig 7d 7f in addition the hadgem forced tws simulations show large variability in europe with the underestimation during 2006 2008 and overestimation during 2012 2016 fig 6i overall the performance of multi model tws simulations is better with higher r and nse and lower mae and rmsd in global north america and africa under rcp2 6 than that under rcp6 0 table 4 and tables s2 s5 in contrast the performance of multi model tws simulations under rcp6 0 is better than those under rcp2 6 in both asia and south america continents table 4 and tables s2 s5 the 2006 2016 seasonal variability of grace and simulated tws is compared in fig 8 under both scenarios as shown the simulations generally predict consistent seasonal tws changes under both scenarios except for the ipsl forced simulations in australia most simulations particularly clm4 5 and h08 overestimate underestimate tws during january march and september december april august at both global and nh north america europe and asia scales almost all models particularly h08 overestimate underestimate tws during january and september december february july at the sh scale mainly south america fig 8 in contrast model simulations underestimate overestimate tws during january april june december in africa and underestimate overestimate tws during march october january february and november december in australia additionally compared with grace most models produce larger seasonal tws amplitudes from peak to trough in north america europe and asia and lower seasonal tws amplitudes in south america africa and australia fig 8 and table s6 3 4 model uncertainty assessment in tws simulations fig 9 plots the uncertainty range of 6 gwm simulations and 4 gcm simulations under both scenarios as shown in fig 9a and b the uncertainty ranges of gwm are larger than that of gcm at the global scale and nh while the opposite pattern is found in sh fig 9c for the six continents the uncertainty ranges of gwm are generally larger than that of gcm in north america europe and asia during 2006 2016 in contrast the uncertainty ranges of gcm are larger than that of gwm in south america africa and australia the anova method combined with the sub sampling technique see the supplementary material was further used to quantify the uncertainties associated with tws simulations contributed respectively by different gcms and gwms fig 10 plots the temporal evolutions of the relative contributions of gcm gwm and their interactions to the overall uncertainties in tws simulations on the globe scale in nh and sh as well as at six continents for the global scale and nh gwm is the dominant contributor 62 89 to tws uncertainties also with an increasing trend of contribution over time while gcm has limited contribution 6 28 and with a decreasing trend in contribution in contrast the contributions of gcm and gcm gwm interaction to simulated tws uncertainties are larger in sh 38 and 17 respectively while in nh the same sources contribute respectively to only 16 and 7 of the total uncertainty for the six continents the uncertainty contributions of gcm and gwm show large interannual variations in particular gwm contribution decreases increase over time in north america europe under both scenarios overall gwm has the largest contribution to simulated tws uncertainty in north america 63 europe 55 and asia 68 whereas gcm has the largest contribution in south america 45 africa 55 and australia 55 relative to rcp2 6 the mean uncertainty contribution of gwm under rcp6 0 is increased in north america 1 4 europe 3 9 and asia 3 3 while the mean uncertainty contribution of gcm under rcp6 0 is decreased in south america 2 9 africa 1 9 and australia 1 2 in summary gwm is the dominant contributor to the simulated tws uncertainties on the global scale and in nh north america europe and asia the gcm uncertainty is the main contributors to tws uncertainties in the sh south america africa and australia 4 discussions 4 1 discrepancy in tws simulations between different gwms our results in fig 6 show that the discrepancies in the ensemble simulations of six gwms compared to grace are larger in north america europe and asia than that in south america africa and australia fig 6 this is supported by fig 10 which indicates that the gwm uncertainty is larger in nh than sh although some gwms e g matsiro and pcr globwb show fairly well tws temporal variability at the global nh sh and continental scales the discrepancies of tws among six gwm simulations are apparent table s4 model comparisons indicate that matsiro outperforms other gwms at the global nse 0 85 nh nse 0 78 and sh nse 0 84 scales table s4 likely due to that matsiro has a thicker soil depth including the total 13 layers telteu et al 2021 and the representation of all tws components table 2 in contrast h08 nse 0 44 and lpjml nse 0 55 show large biases in tws simulations at all scales considered table s4 suggesting the marked influences of process representation in gwms the uncertainty analysis fig 10 suggests that gwm uncertainty is larger in nh north america europe asia than sh south america africa australia since the high latitude regions of nh are snow dominated the parameterizations of snow melt and soil freezing processes in gwms are the likely factor of high uncertainty source giuntoli et al 2015 haddeland et al 2011 hattermann et al 2017 suggesting the necessity of more advancements in developing model parametrization in high latitude snow dominated regions 4 2 uncertainty of tws projections in gcms and rcps despite in isimip 2b gcm data have been bias corrected for hydrologic simulations the discrepancies among 4 gcm simulations are larger in south america africa and australia than that in north america europe and asia fig 6 consistent with fig 10 where it shows the gcm uncertainty is larger in sh than nh this is also supported by wu et al 2021 who found the larger gcm uncertainty in meteorological drought projections in sh than in nh one main reason for this is that gcms simulations exhibit substantially higher precipitation variability in sh than nh nasrollahi et al 2015 in addition most gcms simulate larger tws seasonal amplitudes in nh and smaller tws seasonal amplitudes in sh than grace tws fig 8 and table s6 due to the larger smaller precipitation seasonal amplitudes in gcm forcing data in nh sh table s7 it should also be noted that the gcm uncertainty assessment based on statistical attributes should be unilateral because the gcms are not independent random samples from some space of all possible gcms with shared methods and codes between gcms knutti 2010 knutti and sedláček 2012 therefore it is difficult to accurately evaluate the uncertainty caused by various numerical approximations of the underlying physics in gcms overall the spatio temporal variability of tws simulations under is similar between rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 except for australia which is consistent with jia et al 2020 who reported similar twsa simulations in china under these two scenarios the reason of this agreement is likely attributed to the similarity in temperature changes in the beginning of 21st century under two scenarios frieler et al 2017 however large differences in tws simulations between rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 can be found in australia which can be attributed to the larger spatial difference in the wet and dry climate conditions between rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 in this continent pokhrel et al 2021 future research should be conducted to explore the differences in tws projections under different rcps across global sub regions in particular for the far future in order to better characterize rcp uncertainty over time 5 conclusions this study presents a global scale evaluation of model agreement and uncertainty in tws anomaly twsa simulations within the isimip 2b framework by comparison with the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace data during 2006 2016 the total 24 members of isimip2b ensembles considered here include the permutations of 6 global water models gwms clm4 5 h08 lplml matsiro pcr globwb and watergap2 simulations forced by 4 global climate models gcms gfdl hadgem ipsl and miroc under rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 scenarios the results showed that the multi model ensemble simulations under both scenarios can reproduce the spatial patterns of long term mean negative positive twsa in southern north america southwestern asia northern and central africa central south america and northern europe however large differences in twsa simulations between rcp2 6 and rcp6 0 can be found in australia trend analyses indicated close agreement in the drying trend among 24 ensemble members but weak agreement in the wetting trend among them interannually the ensemble members show better agreement with grace tws in north america and europe than other continents seasonally however most models simulated larger respectively smaller seasonal amplitudes of tws than grace in north america europe and asia south america africa and australia results of uncertainty analysis indicate that gwm is the dominant source of uncertainty in tws simulations in north america europe and asia with the mean contribution of 63 55 and 68 of the total tws uncertainties respectively whereas gcm is the largest uncertainty source in south america africa and australia with the mean contribution of 45 55 and 55 respectively

2331,a wide range of applications in the field of urban hydrology requires rainfall data with high spatio temporal resolutions commercial microwave links cmls densely cover urban areas and can provide high resolution path averaged quantitative precipitation estimates qpes this study aims to reduce systematic errors in cml qpes using rainfall and discharge observations commonly available in urban areas and to assess the potential of such precipitation estimates for discharge predictions in small urban catchments cml qpes are optimized using flow data observed at the catchment outlet and using hourly rain rates from rain gauges located at different distances from the catchment both optimized cml qpes and traditional rain gauge data are propagated through a rainfall runoff model and evaluated against observed discharges to quantify uncertainties of runoff predictions the deterministic hydrodynamic model is extended by a stochastic error model explicitly accounting for model bias resulting runoff prediction intervals namely their width and reliability show that optimized cml qpes predict discharges only slightly worse than those based on benchmark rain gauge data 1 gauge 0 5 1 km2 especially for rainfall events with high spatial variability unbiased cml qpes obtained in this study represent high quality rainfall data suitable for many urban hydrology tasks including assessment and real time control of urban stormwater systems keywords commercial microwave links prediction uncertainty rainfall runoff modeling systematic errors urban hydrology wet antenna attenuation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as the driving force of runoff processes rainfall plays an essential role in urban hydrology urban catchments are relatively small and have highly variable land use characterized by a high degree of impervious surfaces their hydrological response is thus sensitive to spatial and temporal rainfall variability at the scale of kilometers and minutes or even finer cristiano et al 2017 ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 rico ramirez et al 2015 rainfall monitoring at such high resolutions is however challenging therefore rainfall data represent one of the most prominent sources of uncertainty when modeling rainfall runoff processes in urban areas schellart et al 2012 thorndahl et al 2008 the required spatial and temporal resolution of rainfall data depends on catchment characteristics and type of intended application berne et al 2004 suggests that the required temporal resolution of rainfall data is proportional to the third root of the catchment area and that spatial resolution depends on rainfall spatial variability they also conclude that in a mediterranean climate context models of urban catchments in the order of 1 km2 require a rainfall resolution of about 3 min and 2 km ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 recommend using rainfall temporal resolutions below 5 min and a spatial resolution of about 500 m for distributed models of drainage areas between 1 ha and 100 ha whereas a 1 km resolution is recommended for drainage areas larger than 100 ha these requirements are unfeasible to reach with standard rain gauge networks therefore quantitative precipitation estimates qpes from weather radars have been increasingly used in recent decades as an input for urban rainfall runoff models country wide radar networks usually operate at c and s bands and feature sampling strategies enabling them to derive a gridded precipitation product with 0 5 2 km resolution at a time step of 5 15 min these networks are increasingly complemented by local weather radars often operated at the x band enabling high resolution scans 1 min and 100 100 m2 or even finer closer to the earth surface thorndahl et al 2017 van de beek et al 2010 despite improvements in the instrumentation and data processing weather radar data are still affected by substantial errors especially during heavy rainfalls even when adjusted to ground rain gauge observations schleiss et al 2020 radar polarimetry is a promising approach for reducing errors related to beam attenuation variable drop size distribution or the presence of mixed precipitation ryzhkov et al 2014 nevertheless errors during heavy rainfall are still significant for example schleiss et al 2020 reported a polarimetric radar network operated by the finish meteorological institute having an average bias at 10 min resolution of about 30 and peak intensity bias of about 45 this does not come close to approaching the recommendation of schilling 1991 who advised that bias in area averaged rainfall should not exceed 10 when modeling urban rainfall runoff processes it should be also noted that operating weather radars is costly and thus large parts of the planet s continental surface remain uncovered heistermann et al 2013 opportunistic sensing taking advantage of crowdsourced rainfall data or sensors not primarily intended for rainfall monitoring represents an alternative source of rainfall data which may help fill some of the observational gaps and contribute to improved rainfall runoff predictions tauro et al 2018 commercial microwave links cmls i e radio connections used worldwide in cellular networks ericsson 2018 can act as prominent albeit unintentional rainfall sensors they operate at frequencies where radio waves are attenuated by raindrops and this observed attenuation is nearly linearly related to rain rate chwala and kunstmann 2019 cml networks are usually dense in urban areas measure rainfall several meters above ground and have path lengths ranging from hundreds of meters to several kilometers moreover cml data can be accessed online at high temporal resolutions and in near real time from network operation centers either through network monitoring systems or through specifically designed server sided applications chwala et al 2016 thanks to these features cmls represent appealing opportunistic rainfall sensors for urban rainfall runoff modeling to date only a few studies have investigated the ability of qpes derived from real world cml networks for quantitative hydrology either for rural brauer et al 2016 smiatek et al 2017 peri urban cazzaniga et al 2022 or urban catchments disch et al 2019 pastorek et al 2019 stránský et al 2018 the use of cmls for urban rainfall runoff modeling has been assessed by fencl et al 2013 though only in a numerical experiment with virtual rainfall fields they demonstrated that for a small catchment 1 3 km2 path integrated rainfall information from cmls is potentially more reliable than observations of a single rain gauge located in the middle of the catchment pastorek et al 2019 simulated runoff in the same catchment with two years of rainfall data from real world cml observations shorter cmls matching the catchment area provided qpes which resulted in the best predictions of runoff temporal dynamics however the systematic overestimation of these qpes due to the inaccurate estimation of wet antenna attenuation waa caused large errors in estimated runoff volumes these errors were reduced by adjusting cml qpes to hourly rainfall observations from rain gauges nevertheless the adjustment worsened the predictions of runoff temporal dynamics and in the end led to only a small improvement compared to stand alone rain gauge data similar results were reported by disch et al 2019 for another small urban catchment and also by stránský et al 2018 who modeled discharge based on cml qpes in a larger catchment of the tábor agglomeration czech republic with more than 40000 inhabitants moreover the adjustment method used in all of these studies fencl et al 2017 was only designed for a hindcasting mode therefore the accurate estimation of waa remains a major challenge to be overcome when using cml qpes as an input for urban rainfall runoff modeling the most straightforward approach is to estimate waa as a constant overeem et al 2013 however different studies suggested that waa is influenced by antenna drying and wetting dynamics schleiss et al 2013 and can depend on the rain rate fencl et al 2019 leijnse et al 2007 moreover waa dynamics probably depends on other atmospheric conditions such as wind temperature or air humidity but also on antenna hydrophobic coating and its aging van leth et al 2018 waa models should therefore be carefully selected and if possible calibrated to independent local rainfall observations pastorek et al 2022 compared several waa models showing that all of them can be successfully calibrated with 15 min rainfall observations from rain gauges located several kilometers from cmls and were able to obtain almost unbiased qpes even from sub kilometer long cmls these are promising results for urban rainfall runoff modeling as short cmls have similar length scales as small urban catchments nevertheless it is not yet clear how well cmls capture rainfall temporal variability at minute time scales and to what extent cml path averaging affects the final rainfall runoff simulations algorithms for reconstructing gridded rainfall fields from cml qpes d amico et al 2016 goldshtein et al 2009 overeem et al 2013 roy et al 2016 might mitigate the path averaging effect however their performance is largely affected by cml uncertainties rios gaona et al 2015 moreover these algorithms have been designed and validated for larger space time scales and more research is needed to suggest designs suitable for reconstructing rainfall at minute and sub kilometer scale evaluation of rainfall fields reconstructed from cml qpes is beyond the paper scope in this paper we assess cml qpes in terms of their potential for rainfall runoff modeling in small urban catchments with a special focus on predicting and evaluating the uncertainty of the simulated runoff we aim to reduce systematic errors in the cml qpes by optimizing the waa estimation using observations commonly available in urban areas runoff data observed at the catchment outlet and hourly rain rates from rain gauges located at different distances from the investigated catchment discharges at the catchment outlet are simulated using a deterministic hydrodynamic rainfall runoff model extended by a stochastic error model which explicitly accounts for model bias a bayesian uncertainty analysis framework as formulated by reichert and schuwirth 2012 including a stochastic error model calibration is applied here for the first time with opportunistic rainfall data such as cml qpes rainfall runoff modeling performance is assessed in terms of its ability to reproduce observed runoff hydrographs and to predict their uncertainty 2 material and methods the study was performed using rainfall and runoff data collected over a three year period in an urban catchment encompassing an area of 1 3 km2 section 2 1 qpes are derived from cmls using recent state of the art rainfall retrieval algorithms which are feasible to be implemented with the available data section 2 2 three versions of the main rainfall observation layout based on cml qpes and two layouts based on rain gauges are constructed section 2 3 and propagated through a swmm rainfall runoff model section 2 4 extended by stochastic error model enabling quantification of uncertainties section 2 5 simulated discharges are then evaluated against observed discharges section 2 6 2 1 case study area and data acquisition data used in this study originate from an urban catchment with an area of 1 3 km2 which is drained by a stormwater sewer system and located in the letňany neighborhood of prague czech republic pastorek et al 2019 2022 approximately 35 of the catchment area is covered by impervious surfaces with the catchment slightly inclined to the north at an altitude gradually declining from roughly 280 to 250 m above sea level baltic 1957 height epsg 8357 the lag time between rainfall peak and runoff peak observed at the outlet from the catchment s drainage system estimated on the basis of observed rainfall and discharge time series is approximately 20 min both rainfall and runoff observations collected in the investigated small urban catchment are employed in this study most importantly we have collected signal level data from 16 cmls located within the catchment and its surroundings fig 1 with the data being retrieved at a 10 s resolution the cmls mini link ericsson belong to a major telecom operator broadcast at 25 to 39 ghz frequencies and feature path lengths between 816 and 5795 m table s 1 in supplementary material next we use rain gauge data from a permanent monitoring network operated by the municipal sewer authority with a density of 1 gauge per 20 25 km2 fig 1 these gauges are further referred to as municipal moreover we observed rainfall using additional rain gauges temporarily installed at three locations at the catchment borders further referred to as local fig 1 data from the local gauges were collected for simulations of benchmark runoff hydrographs since their spatial density meets formal criteria for hydrological modeling in small scale urban catchments all the rain gauges are tipping bucket rain gauges mr3 meteoservis with a funnel area of 500 cm2 a bucket volume of 5 ml and their single tip nominally corresponds to 0 1 mm of rainfall the rain gauges were dynamically calibrated humphrey et al 1997 times of individual tips were recorded with temporal resolution of one second the volume of a tip was disaggregated to the intervals between two tips if shorter than 15 min or to the three previous minutes if longer the volumes were transformed to rainfall intensities and resampled to 1 minute time series in addition we use discharges measured at the stormwater drainage system outlet fig 1 by an area velocity flowmeter triton ads the temporal resolution of the discharge measurements is 2 min for wet periods and 10 min for dry periods the flow meter was calibrated in a standard way using stream gaging and the velocity area method employing an electromagnetic velocity probe observed discharges q range from approximately 2 to 2000 l s 1 following suggestions of muste et al 2012 uncertainty at a 95 level of confidence u q was analytically estimated for all individual discharge records based on uncertainties in the pipe radius measured flow depth and measured cross sectional velocity which are assumed to be uncorrelated details in pastorek et al 2019 the discharge uncertainty varies for different flow depths e g for 10 pipe filling u q 28 2 l s 1 corresponding to 31 0 of the discharge q 91 l s 1 for 50 pipe filling the uncertainty u q 245 l s 1 which is equivalent to 11 0 of the total value q 2170 l s 1 these discharge measurement uncertainty estimates are presented for informative purposes only and are not considered in subsequent analyses the dataset spans the period between july 2014 and october 2016 and excludes the winter months december march for two main reasons firstly cml signal attenuation by frozen precipitation common in winter periods is considerably different than in the case of liquid precipitation secondly the monitoring setup is designed for periods with liquid precipitation only as the rain gauges are not heated from the three year observation period we select data from hydrologically relevant rainfall events the mean rainfall depth of the three local rain gauges hmean greater than 2 mm after eliminating events with substantial data gaps 46 rainfall runoff events 670 h are available from which we randomly select 23 340 h to be used for the waa model calibration section 2 3 1 the remaining 23 events 330 h basic characteristics summarized in table s 2 in supplementary material are then used in the validation stage section 2 6 2 2 deriving cml qpes rainfall intensity r mm h 1 is quantified from the radio signal attenuation caused by raindrops along cml path ar db using the following robust and well understood relationship 1 r α a r l β where l m is the path length of a given cml and α mm h 1 km β db β and β are empirical parameters dependent upon cml frequency polarization and drop size distribution olsen et al 1978 however ar must first be separated from other components of the observed difference between the transmitted and received signal levels trsl db for this purpose the following relation is used 2 trsl b a wa a r where b db represents background attenuation from e g free space loss and gaseous attenuation the so called baseline and awa db represents attenuation due to water on the surface of one or both antennas so called wet antenna attenuation waa cml data processing steps before baseline separation including a quality check and aggregation to a 1 min resolution are done the same way as described in pastorek et al 2019 baseline b is estimated as a moving median with a centered window having a length of 1 week applied on a trsl time series averaged over 60 min intervals fencl et al 2020 to estimate waa awa we use the model proposed by valtr et al 2019 where awa is explicitly dependent on rainfall intensity r mm h 1 3 a wa 2 k r α where k mm α hα db and α are the power law parameters the exact values of which are obtained by calibration to the calibration datasets section 2 3 1 it is assumed here that awa is the same for both antennas since r cannot be observed directly using cmls the waa model equation eq 3 must be rearranged using eq 1 and 2 to include only one unknown variable awa pastorek et al 2022 4 a wa 2 k α trsl b a wa l β α where trsl b db represents total rainfall induced attenuation before waa separation k and α are parameters of eq 3 l km is the cml path length and α and β are empirical parameters defined in eq 1 we solve this equation numerically using two iterations in the first iteration initial awa on right hand site is assumed to be zero the calculated awa is then used for the second iteration after subtracting baseline b and waa awa from the observed trsl ar is used to compute r using eq 1 with parameters and β according to the international telecommunication union 2005 these parameter values are in extremely good agreement with values derived directly from drop size distribution observations chwala and kunstmann 2019 valtr et al 2019 however they may not be optimal for other rain type regions rios gaona et al 2018 2 3 rainfall observation layouts 2 3 1 cml qpe observation layouts the main cml observation layout evaluated in this study layout a is constructed from cmls with the paths best covering the catchment of interest i e cmls 3 7 8 12 and 15 best located cmls fig 1 these cmls were selected based on their relative lengths intersecting the drainage area of the catchment fig 1 in addition cmls 8 12 and 15 cover the catchment s western part containing areas with impermeable surfaces producing a major part of the catchment runoff the layout is constructed by averaging qpes from all five cmls we reduce the bias in cml qpes by calibrating the waa estimation model eq 3 to datasets available in the catchment of interest and or in its vicinity records observed over 23 randomly selected rainfall runoff events are used for this purpose section 2 1 in this manner three versions of layout a are constructed which differ only in the dataset used for the waa model calibration a1 cml qpes calibrated using 60 min rainfall data from a municipal rain gauge located at the prague central wastewater treatment plant wwtp at an 8 km distance southwest of the catchment fig 1 a2 cml qpes calibrated using 60 min rainfall data from the three closest municipal rain gauges located 2 3 km outside the catchment fig 1 a single time series constructed as the mean of the instantaneous r mm h 1 values of the three gauges is used a3 cml qpes calibrated using stormwater discharges observed at the catchment s drainage system outlet fig 1 with a temporal resolution of 2 min for wet periods and 10 min for dry ones when using rain gauge data for the calibration a1 a2 the waa model parameters are optimized by comparing cml qpes aggregated to 60 min time steps with the 60 min gauge data the root mean square error is used as the objective function when employing the discharge measurements a3 we repeatedly propagate the cml qpes in the original 1 min resolution through the deterministic rainfall runoff model section 2 4 and optimize the waa model parameters by comparing the modelled and observed discharges at this point the nash sutcliffe efficiency is the objective function in the case of both calibration approaches the objective functions evaluate the qpes as a whole time series consisting of all 23 events the waa model calibration is performed separately for each cml pastorek et al 2022 to investigate how the selection of cmls when constructing a layout affects runoff simulations more than 450 additional cml subsets have been analyzed due to the large number of possible subsets when selecting any number of links from the 16 cmls 65535 combinations each possible combination has not been evaluated since the effect of adding subtracting a single cml to a subset is likely to decrease with an increasing number of cmls in the subset we have focused primarily on subsets with low numbers of cmls qpes derived using all the additional cml subsets were propagated through the deterministic rainfall runoff model section 2 4 and the predicted discharges were evaluated against observed ones without quantifying the prediction uncertainty in particular we evaluated each cml individually 16 all subsets consisting of two cmls 120 and a randomly selected set of half of the subsets with three cmls 280 next after having evaluated all individual cmls we sorted them according to their performance in terms of the nnse dv and scc metrics see section 2 6 for each of the metrics additional cml subsets consisting of two to up to fifteen best performing cmls have been created lastly we analyzed the mean qpes from all cmls available the performance of these alternative cml subsets is addressed in the discussion 2 3 2 rain gauge observation layouts to provide a comparison with capabilities of traditional rain gauge observations in urbanized areas we also assess two rain gauge based rainfall data layouts first we evaluate records from the three closest municipal gauges fig 1 in the original resolution of 1 min layout b the municipal rain gauge network features a density of ca 1 gauge per 20 25 km2 and this layout thus in terms of the spatial coverage corresponds to the standard observation density for long term rainfall monitoring in urbanized areas second we evaluate the performance of 1 min observations from the three local rain gauges layout c installed at the borders of the catchment of interest fig 1 this is the benchmark layout representing the best case scenario input rainfall data for urban rainfall runoff modelling 2 3 3 rainfall spatial representation for hydrological modelling since the layout c based on the local rain gauge s represents the main benchmark rainfall dataset we aim to capture the rainfall spatial distribution over the catchment thus the rainfall input is in this case prepared for the rainfall runoff model section 2 4 using a standard thiessen polygon method in the cases of all other layouts i e the gauge based layout b and all three versions of the cml based layout a1 a2 a3 the model is forced with an areal rainfall meaning that rainfall intensity in a given time step has a constant value over all model sub catchments 2 4 deterministic rainfall runoff model a fully distributed rainfall runoff model built using epa swmm software rossman 2017 rossman and huber 2016 serves to simulate discharges at the outlet of the local stormwater drainage system it was constructed using detailed information about the catchment e g the ratio of impervious areas for individual sub catchments and the drainage system e g pipe materials and diameters the process of runoff generation is formulated empirically and separately for each model sub catchment 195 sub catchments over the total catchment area of 1 3 km2 using the respective surface depression storage depth parameters the subsequent runoff itself is modelled as a one dimensional flow expressed by saint venant equations these are numerically solved in the approximate form of a kinematic wave for surface runoff and in the full form of a dynamic wave for the subsequent runoff in the drainage network the temporal resolution of the discharge predictions is 2 min corresponding to the resolution of discharge measurements during wet periods the model was calibrated using data collected before the period of this study the reliability analysis of the model performance has been presented in pastorek et al 2019 2 5 stochastic error model for quantifying uncertainty of simulated rainfall runoff rainfall data from all observation layouts are propagated through the rainfall runoff model and the model outputs are evaluated against observed discharges we have decided to quantify uncertainties of the rainfall runoff model predictions and employ the bayesian uncertainty analysis framework of kennedy and o hagan 2001 as formulated by reichert and schuwirth 2012 and first used in an urban hydrology context by del giudice et al 2013 more recently this approach has been successfully applied by sikorska and seibert 2018 to analyze the value of different precipitation data for flood predictions in an alpine catchment the basic principle of the method is to extend the deterministic rainfall runoff model by a stochastic error model which explicitly accounts for systematic model errors i e bias for more information on the principles or particular details of this uncertainty quantification method please consult the above referenced studies in this study we only optimize the stochastic error model parameters we do not calibrate the whole extended deterministic stochastic model since the deterministic rainfall runoff model has been calibrated in the past and has been shown to perform well pastorek et al 2019 the calibration of the stochastic model is performed individually for each rainfall observation layout the part of the error model representing random noise has only a single parameter the asymptotic standard deviation of random errors σe l s 1 the part of the stochastic model representing the bias is formulated in this study as an autoregressive stationary random process with a long term equilibrium value of zero and a constant variance del giudice et al 2013 two parameters associated with the bias model are to be calibrated the asymptotic standard deviation of the random fluctuations around equilibrium σb l s 1 and associated correlation time τ h informative prior probability distributions of the error model parameters table 1 reflect our knowledge concerning random measurement errors in our system and address the identifiability problem between the deterministic model and the bias reichert and schuwirth 2012 by specifying that we are seeking the smallest possible bias when calibrating the stochastic error model data from the same 23 events are employed as when calibrating the waa model to fulfill the underlying statistical assumptions discharge data are transformed using the two parameter box cox transformation function with parameters λ1 0 45 and λ2 1 formulated for λ1 0 in the following manner box and cox 1964 5 g y y λ 2 λ 1 1 λ 1 therefore error model parameters σe and σb table 1 are also employed in the transformed space with units g l s 1 the error model calibration by means of bayesian inference is performed in two steps first we use a generalized simulated annealing function which was designed to search for a global minimum of a very complex non linear objective function with a very large number of optima xiang et al 2013 second we use a numerical monte carlo markov chain sampler which achieves often a high efficiency by tuning the proposal distributions to a user defined acceptance rate as implemented by scheidegger 2012 according to the proposal of vihola 2012 2 6 performance of rainfall runoff modeling to validate the rainfall runoff modelling performance associated with a given rainfall observation layout we use data from the 23 events not employed in the calibration stage we produce hydrographs of each event showing 90 confidence intervals and median predictions which can be interpreted as the most likely predictions the interval predictions are evaluated in terms of both precision and accuracy for this purpose the normalized average bandwidth nabw i e the mean band width normalized by the mean discharge observed during the given event and the prediction reliability i e the fraction of discharge observations falling into the predicted 90 confidence bands are quantified next for the median prediction of each event as well as for each stochastic model prediction associated with the given event we quantify following metrics i the normalized nash sutcliffe efficiency nnse summarizing the overall performance ii the relative error of total runoff volume dv iii the spearman rank correlation coefficient scc which quantifies the strength of a monotonic relationship between two variables and unlike pearson correlation coefficient is independent of nonlinear bias and thus better quantifies the match between simulated and observed discharges in terms of timing and iv dqmax which is the relative error of the sum of the discharges during the ten minutes around the observed maximum discharge the uncertainty of the performance metrics is analyzed by visualizing the most favorable 90 intervals within their distributions for the 23 events used in the validation stage the rainfall spatial variability is quantified table s 2 in supplementary material using all six rain gauges three local and three nearest municipal gauges in particular the rain gauge data are aggregated to 60 min time steps and coefficients of variation are determined for each time step from all six rain gauges the event spatial variability is then determined as the arithmetic mean of the coefficients of variation when analyzing the results special attention is paid to eight events i e ⅓ out of the total 23 with the highest rainfall spatial variability as such events are often associated with a low representativeness of traditional rain gauge observations and thus constitute a promising niche for the usage of cml qpes 3 results we compare the rainfall runoff modelling performance when using cml qpes with the performance of traditional rain gauge data the differences between the capabilities of the cml qpes and the municipal rain gauge data are investigated in detail section 3 1 next we analyze cml qpes obtained using the three various waa calibration approaches the performance of all three versions of the cml qpe layout a is evaluated against the performance of the local rain gauge data both in terms of rainfall intensities and associated runoffs section 3 2 lastly rainfall runoff modelling with associated output uncertainty is evaluated in section 3 3 for all 23 events and all main rainfall observation layouts a1 3 b c 3 1 runoff predictions with cml qpes and with rain gauges in this section the rainfall runoff modelling performance when using the cml qpes is compared with the performance of traditional rain gauge data in particular we analyze 1 min qpes from the best located cmls derived using the waa model calibrated to the 60 min data from the three nearest municipal rain gauges layout a2 compared to rain gauge layouts from 1 min records from the municipal rain gauges layout b and from the three local gauges layout c hydrographs obtained using these three rainfall observation layouts a2 b c for all 23 validation events are presented in supplementary material first the discharges predicted using the deterministic rainfall runoff model only are summarized in fig 2 in terms of both dv reflecting the bias and scc reflecting temporal dynamics reproduction the performance of cml qpes a2 dv 0 040 scc 0 908 is better than the performance of the municipal rain gauge records b dv 0 052 scc 0 868 and worse than that of the local rain gauge data c dv 0 009 scc 0 93 despite the overestimation of the highest discharges the overall bias is within reasonable limits in all three cases however compared to the records from the municipal rain gauges b the local gauges c and the cml qpes a2 notably reduce the general point spread around the x y line such situations when cml qpes a2 reproduce runoff especially its dynamics notably better than the municipal gauges b are presented below next we investigate the cml qpes a2 and municipal rain gauge data b with local rain gauge data c for two chosen events with high spatial rainfall variability table s 2 in supplementary material i e when cml qpes are expected to best exploit their advantage of better spatial representativeness this is done by evaluating the rainfall runoff modelling including the prediction uncertainty quantification for the first event fig 3 the discharge peak is reproduced considerably better compared to layout b in terms of both amplitude and timing when using the cml qpes a2 this is also demonstrated in the respective nnse values which are notably higher for the cml qpes a2 median 0 84 than for the municipal rain gauge data b median 0 59 and reach even better performance metrics than for the benchmark hydrograph c median 0 79 in fact all modelling performance metrics reach better values in terms of their medians for the cml qpes a2 compared to b comparison with the benchmark layout c shows very similar results the only exception is nabw reflecting the width of the 90 prediction bands which is very similar for both rainfall layouts a2 and b and significantly smaller for c however prediction reliability is higher for the cml qpes a2 than for b suggesting that the cml data lead to better overall prediction performance it should also be noted that the performance of median discharge predictions in purple in terms of scc reflecting the temporal dynamics is remarkable in all cases a2 0 91 b 0 87 c 0 92 for another event with high spatial rainfall variability the hydrographs simulated using the rainfall observation layout b fig 4 tend to overestimate the observed discharges most interestingly layout b predicts a small runoff peak at the event s beginning which is not present in the observed discharges the cml qpes a2 compared to layout b do not predict this peak although they provide slightly biased predictions dv median 0 15 dqmax median 0 07 they still lead to narrower prediction bands higher prediction reliability and better overall performance than the rain gauge data median nnse 0 74 vs 0 58 layout a2 shows similar metrics to the benchmark layout c expect the nabw metric the results presented in this section suggest that the rainfall runoff modelling performance of the cml qpes a2 is closer to that of the local rain gauge records c than that of the municipal gauge records b compared to the latter cmls exploit their advantage of better spatial coverage and yield qpes which lead to better runoff peak reproduction for events with high rainfall spatial variability 3 2 comparison of the three wwa calibration approaches we also analyze the differences among cml qpes obtained using the three various waa calibration approaches cml layout versions a1 a2 and a3 first we briefly evaluate precipitation estimates retrieved using all three calibration approaches directly against records from the three local rain gauges the mean of the three gauges layout c this comparison of rainfall data for all 23 validation events is plotted in fig 5 left cml qpes derived using the waa model calibrated to 60 min records from the 8 km distant rain gauge at the wwtp a1 tend to systematically underestimate higher rainfall intensities such a tendency is not present when evaluating the other two versions of cml qpe layout a2 and a3 which are more alike although they also lead to somewhat biased total rainfall depths dh higher than 0 05 in absolute terms interestingly all three versions of the cml qpe layout lead to practically the same quality of temporal dynamics reproduction scc values of 0 782 0 783 next for all three versions of the cml qpe layout a1 a2 a3 predicted discharges are compared with the discharges simulated with the local rain gauge data c fig 5 right these simulations use only the deterministic rainfall runoff model without the stochastic error model corresponding to the above rainfall data analysis cml qpes derived using the waa calibrated to the wwtp rain gauge data a1 result in the most biased runoff volumes dv 0 123 affecting in particular the highest discharges when using cml qpes with the waa model calibrated to 60 min data from the three municipal rain gauges a2 or to the observed discharges a3 the resulting bias is notably lower dv 0 045 and 0 043 respectively similar to the above temporal dynamics reproduction is highly comparable for all three versions of cml qpe layout however due to the rainfall transformation into runoff the scc values are notably higher 0 954 0 964 and the associated spread in relation to the x y line is lower these results indicate that the discharge predictions based on well calibrated cml qpes a2 a3 are similar to the predictions obtained using the local rain gauge records c a detailed evaluation against observed discharges for runoff predictions based on both the cml qpes and the local rain gauge data is provided below taking into account the prediction uncertainty the rainfall runoff modeling performance of all three versions of the cml qpe observation layous a1 a2 a3 is compared with the performance of 1 min records from the three local rain gauges c for all eight events with the highest rainfall spatial variability fig 6 all four rainfall layouts lead to very similar modelling performance in terms of nnse with medians around 0 75 interestingly the worst performance for the median prediction for an individual event nnse 0 49 occurs during the local rain gauge c predictions nevertheless the local gauge records c outperform the cml qpes a1 a2 a3 in terms of scc both for medians 0 72 vs 0 63 0 667 and variability systematic errors in cml qpes with the waa model calibrated to records from the rain gauge at the wwtp a1 affect the relative error of maximum discharges dqmax which is 0 292 for this observation layout however for the two other cml qpe layouts dqmax is in absolute values lower 0 127 for a2 0 103 for a3 than for the rain gauge records c 0 167 rain gauge data c lead to narrower prediction bands as quantified by nabw but also to lower prediction reliability only 0 95 in the median compared to medians of circa 0 97 for the cml qpes a1 a2 a3 the interplay between these two aspects and its effect on the result interpretation is addressed in the discussion the results presented in this section show that calibrating the waa model to the observed discharges a3 leads to the same quality cml qpes as when calibrating it to the records from the three municipal rain gauges a2 moreover such cml qpes lead to rainfall runoff modelling performance very similar to that obtained with the local rain gauges c when the most spatially variable rainfall events are considered 3 3 stochastic predictions for all events and all observation layouts lastly we summarize the rainfall runoff modelling performance for all evaluated rainfall observation layouts using data from all 23 events fig 7 in terms of the nnse the highest median is observed for the local rain gauges c 0 82 followed by the cml qpe layouts a1 a2 a3 0 76 0 79 and three closest municipal gauges b 0 68 the variability of nnse increases accordingly the mutual relations among the rainfall layouts are similar when quantifying the performance in terms of both scc reflecting the temporal dynamics reproduction and dv reflecting the volumetric bias however dv medians are lower in absolute values for cml qpes with the waa model calibrated to records from the three municipal gauges a2 0 011 and to discharge observations a3 0 007 than for the local rain gauges c 0 046 cml qpes calibrated to records from the rain gauge at the wwtp a1 feature higher bias median dv 0 1 however they can reproduce runoff temporal dynamics almost as well as the other two cml qpe layouts median scc 0 72 vs 0 75 predicted 90 confidence bands for the cml qpe layouts in terms of nabw are in the median approximately the same as for the three municipal gauges b and wider than for the local gauges c however prediction reliability is in the median highest i e above 0 95 for the three versions of the cml qpe layout a1 a2 a3 and for the local gauges c while the associated variability in terms of the interquartile range is lowest for all the versions of the cml qpe observation layout a1 a2 a3 the results presented in this section confirm that rainfall runoff simulations with cml qpes derived using an accurate waa model a2 a3 outperform in our small urban catchment simulations with municipal rain gauges b including the reduction of the prediction bias nevertheless the overall prediction performance of cml qpes a2 a3 is not as close to that of the local rain gauges c as when evaluating only the events with the highest rainfall variability 4 discussion 4 1 result interpretation and comparison with previous findings the main finding of the study is that the rainfall runoff model performance with cml qpes is in the investigated small urban catchment better than when using 1 min records from the municipal rain gauge network and almost as good as when using three local rain gauges installed around the catchment when only the most spatially variable rainfall events are considered cml qpes lead to a rainfall runoff modelling performance very similar to that obtained when using the local rain gauges it must be also mentioned that overall results still show the best metrics for our benchmark rainfall dataset b0 which is visible on individual runoff hydrographs presented in supplementary material in some specific events we report some deficits in predictions based on cml qpes data a2 compared to b0 on the other side the presented approach allows to estimate relevant rainfall data also for events with low and moderate rainfall intensity this is a significant improvement compared to our previous work e g pastorek et al 2019 which showed substantially worse prediction metrics of simulated runoff from the three versions of cml qpes observation layout a the best discharge predictions were achieved when calibrating the waa model using the observed discharges a3 and the 60 min records from the three closest municipal rain gauges a2 in fact there was effectively no difference between the performance of cml qpes for these two versions of observation layout a moreover the predicted discharges were biased to a lesser extent than in the case of the local rain gauge data especially for runoff maxima associated with rainfall events with a high spatial variability in contrast calibrating the waa model to 60 min records from the single rain gauge at an 8 km distance resulted in cml qpes which underestimate the discharges by 8 5 in the median and by up to 30 for runoff maxima visual inspection of hydrographs revealed that all three versions of cml observation layout a often do not correctly capture rainfall peaks at the beginning of light and moderate rainfall events e g event on 20th september 2014 shown in supplementary material this can be caused by spatial averaging but also by limited accuracy of cmls during light rainfalls the effect of spatial averaging is further discussed in section 4 2 we estimated runoff prediction uncertainty using a stochastic error model which explicitly accounts for the rainfall runoff model bias the predicted 90 confidence bands were evaluated in terms of both width and reliability if prediction reliability was the same for all evaluated rainfall layouts the interval width would be the only factor of interest when comparing predictions associated with individual rainfall layouts however probably due to more extreme observations in the calibration dataset prediction reliability has been notably higher than the nominal 90 for all rainfall layouts 0 94 0 97 fig 7 this means that the width of the prediction bands would be narrower if reliability reached 90 however as reliability is very similar in all five cases the simulated nabw provides relevant information for comparison of all layouts and their versions and would not affect the interpretation of results the presented results suggest that satisfactory rainfall runoff modelling performance can be achieved with cml qpes when the availability of data used to optimize the waa model is severely reduced this issue has already been addressed in the study of pastorek et al 2022 showing that calibrating the waa model to 15 min data from the three closest rain gauges from the municipal network can lead to virtually unbiased cml qpes however in that study the suitability of cml qpes to be used in hydrological modelling was not tested in the presented study cml qpes have been used to predict rainfall runoff and have shown that practically unbiased cml qpes and high quality discharge predictions can be obtained when calibrating the waa model to 60 min records from the municipal gauges or even 2 min discharge observations we have also shown that cml qpes with the waa model calibrated using 60 min records from a rain gauge at an 8 km distance can lead to reasonable rainfall runoff modelling performance the presented results thus confirm the high potential of cml qpes for rainfall runoff modelling in small urban catchments where traditional long term rainfall observations are not available at resolutions suitable for urban hydrological purposes it has also been shown that using a well calibrated waa model efficiently eliminates the bias in cml qpes without averaging out rainfall and runoff peaks which was the greatest shortcoming of the cml adjustment method proposed by fencl et al 2017 this implies that cml qpes are promising not only for catchments with considerable data scarcity but also for urban areas already covered by rain gauge networks of densities between 1 gauge per 20 25 km2 and 1 gauge per 0 5 1 km2 corresponding to the municipal and local gauges respectively this is in agreement with the findings of disch et al 2019 and stránský et al 2018 who however evaluated cml qpes continuously adjusted to rain gauges fencl et al 2017 i e a method designed to be used only in a hindcasting mode in contrast a well calibrated waa model can lead to reliable cml qpes even when the data used for model calibration are no longer available finally our findings are based on exploiting a larger dataset spanning over three years and on employing a robust output uncertainty quantification method thus our results confirm that cml qpes can be considered a more than sufficient alternative to standard long term rainfall observation in urbanized areas i e 1 rain gauge per 20 25 km2 4 2 performance of different cml subsets and the effect of rainfall averaging we have presented results obtained when using the mean qpes of cmls the paths of which best cover the catchment of interest i e cmls 3 7 8 12 and 15 fig 1 however performance of more than 450 additional subsets has been analyzed by propagating the cml qpes through the deterministic rainfall runoff model and comparing predicted and observed discharges none of the additional cml subsets tested has led to significantly better rainfall runoff modelling performance than the subset of the best located cmls however several subsets have reached similar performance including the mean qpes from all cmls the performance of qpes from individual cmls in terms of dv and nnse is presented in fig 8 the results demonstrate that errors in qpes from individual cmls are despite of the waa correction still important for example simulations with cml 3 located inside of the catchment perform similarly well as simulations with cml 18 reaching far from the catchment on the other hand the best performing individual cmls in terms of nnse are 8 12 and 15 which are all close to catchment center and make part of the best located subset the averaging of observations from all the cmls fig 8 reduces the bias dv and nnse even the best performing cml when used alone does not outperform in terms of nnse simulations with all cmls averaged i e simulations with areal rainfall covering an area substantially larger than the catchment itself this is in agreement with the conclusions of fencl et al 2015 that combining qpes from all available cmls reduces both systematic and random errors in estimated rainfall and is recommended when no prior information on cml data quality is available in contrast to previous studies pastorek et al 2019 no dependence of dv on cml path length is observed showing that the implemented waa model can reduce systematic errors in qpes even from short cmls otherwise prone to bias cml qpes in all the presented cases enter the rainfall runoff model as areal rainfalls in contrast simulations with the benchmark layout c use spatially distributed rainfall information from three local rain gauges assigned to the model subcatchments by thiessen polygons the usage of the areal rainfall instead of the thiessen polygons worsens the performance the median scc decreases from 0 93 to 0 92 and median nnse from 0 88 to 0 84 performance by certain highly variable events worsens significantly more this clearly demonstrates the importance of distributed rainfall information for rainfall runoff modeling even in small catchments rainfall spatial reconstruction from neighboring cmls might help in this regard nevertheless several challenges should be overcome first as discussed above errors in cml qpes are still significant and differ between individual cmls efficient spatial reconstruction will require robust estimation of cml qpe uncertainties second the current algorithms for reconstructing gridded rainfall from cml qpes were designed for larger space time scales and further research is needed to adapt them for reconstructing rainfall at minute and sub kilometer scale it is however not yet clear if cml qpes are sufficiently accurate to efficiently perform such fine scale reconstructions 4 3 calibration of the deterministic rainfall runoff model rainfall runoff modelling output uncertainty was quantified by extending the deterministic rainfall runoff model by a stochastic error model to ensure reliable uncertainty estimates stochastic error model parameters were calibrated for each of the evaluated rainfall observation layouts in contrast the deterministic rainfall runoff model was calibrated before the observation period of the presented study using data from the three local rain gauges layout c if the deterministic model was calibrated to other data e g to the cml qpes themselves the modelling performance of individual rainfall observation layouts might change probably for the better for the cml qpes 4 4 study limitations the relevance of our findings for other small urban catchments should be subject to further research firstly based on our previous study where several waa models pastorek et al 2022 had been analyzed we have tested only the waa model originally derived by using one of our 16 cmls and data from one of the three summer seasons investigated herein valtr et al 2019 moreover all cmls used in this study are from the same product family of the same manufacturer ericsson mini link and have aged similarly due to exposure to similar climatic conditions nevertheless cml networks in other areas may consist of antennas of different hardware characteristics exposed to different climates for different time periods identifying optimal waa models may be more complicated in such conditions especially if the calibration data are available only at low resolution lastly we assumed that during rainfall both ends of a cml would suffer from the same amount of waa for longer cmls waa will often notably vary between the two ends however the contribution of waa is relatively small in the case of longer cmls compared to raindrop attenuation along the cml path 5 conclusions in this study we have assessed the value of quantitative precipitation estimates qpes retrieved from commercial microwave links cmls for rainfall runoff modelling in a small urban catchment this includes quantifying model output uncertainties associated both with the cml qpes and with traditional rain gauge data moreover we have analyzed the possibilities of reducing systematic errors in the cml qpes with the help of three calibration datasets equivalents of which might be commonly available to urban hydrology professionals it has been shown that when predicting rainfall runoff with cml qpes derived using a wet antenna attenuation waa model calibrated to 60 min records from a single rain gauge at an 8 km distance from the catchment of interest the simulated discharges were underestimated by 8 5 in the median and by up to 30 for runoff maxima due to the low representativeness of the gauge data for the catchment area however except for the considerable bias the performance of these cml qpes was an improvement compared to records from the three rain gauges from the municipal rainfall monitoring network we have also demonstrated that when calibrating the waa model to both discharges observed at the catchment outlet and to 60 min records from the three closest municipal rain gauges virtually unbiased cml qpes can be retrieved these cml qpes can then reproduce observed discharges median nnse 0 79 almost as well as three local rain gauges installed at the borders of the studied catchment for research purposes median nnse 0 82 in fact for rainfall events of high spatial variability runoff maxima are biased to a lesser extent when using the cml qpes 10 than for the local rain gauge data 17 this shows that cml qpes can also be successfully used for rainfall runoff modelling when no rainfall data only runoff observations are available another important conclusion is related to the significant reduction of bias for discharges predicted using cml qpes calibrated to waa for light and moderate rainfalls where waa plays a dominant role in terms of bias in conclusion the presented findings imply that cml qpes are promising not only for catchments with considerable data scarcity but also for urban areas already covered by rain gauge networks for areas with network densities of roughly 1 gauge per 20 25 km2 corresponding to a standard observation density for long term rainfall monitoring in urbanized areas cml qpes represent a notable potential improvement for rainfall runoff modelling in small urban catchments for denser networks with roughly 1 gauge per 0 5 1 km2 cml qpes can be considered a satisfactory alternative especially for rainfall events with high spatial variability which are often associated with high rainfall intensities and thus important for many urban hydrology tasks such as the design and evaluation of urban stormwater systems further improvement might be achieved by reconstructing the rainfall spatial distribution instead of using areal rainfall this will however require robust estimation of cml qpe uncertainties and adaptation of current algorithms to be able to reconstruct rainfall distribution at minute and sub kilometer scale credit authorship contribution statement jaroslav pastorek conceptualization formal analysis investigation methodology validation

2331,a wide range of applications in the field of urban hydrology requires rainfall data with high spatio temporal resolutions commercial microwave links cmls densely cover urban areas and can provide high resolution path averaged quantitative precipitation estimates qpes this study aims to reduce systematic errors in cml qpes using rainfall and discharge observations commonly available in urban areas and to assess the potential of such precipitation estimates for discharge predictions in small urban catchments cml qpes are optimized using flow data observed at the catchment outlet and using hourly rain rates from rain gauges located at different distances from the catchment both optimized cml qpes and traditional rain gauge data are propagated through a rainfall runoff model and evaluated against observed discharges to quantify uncertainties of runoff predictions the deterministic hydrodynamic model is extended by a stochastic error model explicitly accounting for model bias resulting runoff prediction intervals namely their width and reliability show that optimized cml qpes predict discharges only slightly worse than those based on benchmark rain gauge data 1 gauge 0 5 1 km2 especially for rainfall events with high spatial variability unbiased cml qpes obtained in this study represent high quality rainfall data suitable for many urban hydrology tasks including assessment and real time control of urban stormwater systems keywords commercial microwave links prediction uncertainty rainfall runoff modeling systematic errors urban hydrology wet antenna attenuation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as the driving force of runoff processes rainfall plays an essential role in urban hydrology urban catchments are relatively small and have highly variable land use characterized by a high degree of impervious surfaces their hydrological response is thus sensitive to spatial and temporal rainfall variability at the scale of kilometers and minutes or even finer cristiano et al 2017 ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 rico ramirez et al 2015 rainfall monitoring at such high resolutions is however challenging therefore rainfall data represent one of the most prominent sources of uncertainty when modeling rainfall runoff processes in urban areas schellart et al 2012 thorndahl et al 2008 the required spatial and temporal resolution of rainfall data depends on catchment characteristics and type of intended application berne et al 2004 suggests that the required temporal resolution of rainfall data is proportional to the third root of the catchment area and that spatial resolution depends on rainfall spatial variability they also conclude that in a mediterranean climate context models of urban catchments in the order of 1 km2 require a rainfall resolution of about 3 min and 2 km ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 recommend using rainfall temporal resolutions below 5 min and a spatial resolution of about 500 m for distributed models of drainage areas between 1 ha and 100 ha whereas a 1 km resolution is recommended for drainage areas larger than 100 ha these requirements are unfeasible to reach with standard rain gauge networks therefore quantitative precipitation estimates qpes from weather radars have been increasingly used in recent decades as an input for urban rainfall runoff models country wide radar networks usually operate at c and s bands and feature sampling strategies enabling them to derive a gridded precipitation product with 0 5 2 km resolution at a time step of 5 15 min these networks are increasingly complemented by local weather radars often operated at the x band enabling high resolution scans 1 min and 100 100 m2 or even finer closer to the earth surface thorndahl et al 2017 van de beek et al 2010 despite improvements in the instrumentation and data processing weather radar data are still affected by substantial errors especially during heavy rainfalls even when adjusted to ground rain gauge observations schleiss et al 2020 radar polarimetry is a promising approach for reducing errors related to beam attenuation variable drop size distribution or the presence of mixed precipitation ryzhkov et al 2014 nevertheless errors during heavy rainfall are still significant for example schleiss et al 2020 reported a polarimetric radar network operated by the finish meteorological institute having an average bias at 10 min resolution of about 30 and peak intensity bias of about 45 this does not come close to approaching the recommendation of schilling 1991 who advised that bias in area averaged rainfall should not exceed 10 when modeling urban rainfall runoff processes it should be also noted that operating weather radars is costly and thus large parts of the planet s continental surface remain uncovered heistermann et al 2013 opportunistic sensing taking advantage of crowdsourced rainfall data or sensors not primarily intended for rainfall monitoring represents an alternative source of rainfall data which may help fill some of the observational gaps and contribute to improved rainfall runoff predictions tauro et al 2018 commercial microwave links cmls i e radio connections used worldwide in cellular networks ericsson 2018 can act as prominent albeit unintentional rainfall sensors they operate at frequencies where radio waves are attenuated by raindrops and this observed attenuation is nearly linearly related to rain rate chwala and kunstmann 2019 cml networks are usually dense in urban areas measure rainfall several meters above ground and have path lengths ranging from hundreds of meters to several kilometers moreover cml data can be accessed online at high temporal resolutions and in near real time from network operation centers either through network monitoring systems or through specifically designed server sided applications chwala et al 2016 thanks to these features cmls represent appealing opportunistic rainfall sensors for urban rainfall runoff modeling to date only a few studies have investigated the ability of qpes derived from real world cml networks for quantitative hydrology either for rural brauer et al 2016 smiatek et al 2017 peri urban cazzaniga et al 2022 or urban catchments disch et al 2019 pastorek et al 2019 stránský et al 2018 the use of cmls for urban rainfall runoff modeling has been assessed by fencl et al 2013 though only in a numerical experiment with virtual rainfall fields they demonstrated that for a small catchment 1 3 km2 path integrated rainfall information from cmls is potentially more reliable than observations of a single rain gauge located in the middle of the catchment pastorek et al 2019 simulated runoff in the same catchment with two years of rainfall data from real world cml observations shorter cmls matching the catchment area provided qpes which resulted in the best predictions of runoff temporal dynamics however the systematic overestimation of these qpes due to the inaccurate estimation of wet antenna attenuation waa caused large errors in estimated runoff volumes these errors were reduced by adjusting cml qpes to hourly rainfall observations from rain gauges nevertheless the adjustment worsened the predictions of runoff temporal dynamics and in the end led to only a small improvement compared to stand alone rain gauge data similar results were reported by disch et al 2019 for another small urban catchment and also by stránský et al 2018 who modeled discharge based on cml qpes in a larger catchment of the tábor agglomeration czech republic with more than 40000 inhabitants moreover the adjustment method used in all of these studies fencl et al 2017 was only designed for a hindcasting mode therefore the accurate estimation of waa remains a major challenge to be overcome when using cml qpes as an input for urban rainfall runoff modeling the most straightforward approach is to estimate waa as a constant overeem et al 2013 however different studies suggested that waa is influenced by antenna drying and wetting dynamics schleiss et al 2013 and can depend on the rain rate fencl et al 2019 leijnse et al 2007 moreover waa dynamics probably depends on other atmospheric conditions such as wind temperature or air humidity but also on antenna hydrophobic coating and its aging van leth et al 2018 waa models should therefore be carefully selected and if possible calibrated to independent local rainfall observations pastorek et al 2022 compared several waa models showing that all of them can be successfully calibrated with 15 min rainfall observations from rain gauges located several kilometers from cmls and were able to obtain almost unbiased qpes even from sub kilometer long cmls these are promising results for urban rainfall runoff modeling as short cmls have similar length scales as small urban catchments nevertheless it is not yet clear how well cmls capture rainfall temporal variability at minute time scales and to what extent cml path averaging affects the final rainfall runoff simulations algorithms for reconstructing gridded rainfall fields from cml qpes d amico et al 2016 goldshtein et al 2009 overeem et al 2013 roy et al 2016 might mitigate the path averaging effect however their performance is largely affected by cml uncertainties rios gaona et al 2015 moreover these algorithms have been designed and validated for larger space time scales and more research is needed to suggest designs suitable for reconstructing rainfall at minute and sub kilometer scale evaluation of rainfall fields reconstructed from cml qpes is beyond the paper scope in this paper we assess cml qpes in terms of their potential for rainfall runoff modeling in small urban catchments with a special focus on predicting and evaluating the uncertainty of the simulated runoff we aim to reduce systematic errors in the cml qpes by optimizing the waa estimation using observations commonly available in urban areas runoff data observed at the catchment outlet and hourly rain rates from rain gauges located at different distances from the investigated catchment discharges at the catchment outlet are simulated using a deterministic hydrodynamic rainfall runoff model extended by a stochastic error model which explicitly accounts for model bias a bayesian uncertainty analysis framework as formulated by reichert and schuwirth 2012 including a stochastic error model calibration is applied here for the first time with opportunistic rainfall data such as cml qpes rainfall runoff modeling performance is assessed in terms of its ability to reproduce observed runoff hydrographs and to predict their uncertainty 2 material and methods the study was performed using rainfall and runoff data collected over a three year period in an urban catchment encompassing an area of 1 3 km2 section 2 1 qpes are derived from cmls using recent state of the art rainfall retrieval algorithms which are feasible to be implemented with the available data section 2 2 three versions of the main rainfall observation layout based on cml qpes and two layouts based on rain gauges are constructed section 2 3 and propagated through a swmm rainfall runoff model section 2 4 extended by stochastic error model enabling quantification of uncertainties section 2 5 simulated discharges are then evaluated against observed discharges section 2 6 2 1 case study area and data acquisition data used in this study originate from an urban catchment with an area of 1 3 km2 which is drained by a stormwater sewer system and located in the letňany neighborhood of prague czech republic pastorek et al 2019 2022 approximately 35 of the catchment area is covered by impervious surfaces with the catchment slightly inclined to the north at an altitude gradually declining from roughly 280 to 250 m above sea level baltic 1957 height epsg 8357 the lag time between rainfall peak and runoff peak observed at the outlet from the catchment s drainage system estimated on the basis of observed rainfall and discharge time series is approximately 20 min both rainfall and runoff observations collected in the investigated small urban catchment are employed in this study most importantly we have collected signal level data from 16 cmls located within the catchment and its surroundings fig 1 with the data being retrieved at a 10 s resolution the cmls mini link ericsson belong to a major telecom operator broadcast at 25 to 39 ghz frequencies and feature path lengths between 816 and 5795 m table s 1 in supplementary material next we use rain gauge data from a permanent monitoring network operated by the municipal sewer authority with a density of 1 gauge per 20 25 km2 fig 1 these gauges are further referred to as municipal moreover we observed rainfall using additional rain gauges temporarily installed at three locations at the catchment borders further referred to as local fig 1 data from the local gauges were collected for simulations of benchmark runoff hydrographs since their spatial density meets formal criteria for hydrological modeling in small scale urban catchments all the rain gauges are tipping bucket rain gauges mr3 meteoservis with a funnel area of 500 cm2 a bucket volume of 5 ml and their single tip nominally corresponds to 0 1 mm of rainfall the rain gauges were dynamically calibrated humphrey et al 1997 times of individual tips were recorded with temporal resolution of one second the volume of a tip was disaggregated to the intervals between two tips if shorter than 15 min or to the three previous minutes if longer the volumes were transformed to rainfall intensities and resampled to 1 minute time series in addition we use discharges measured at the stormwater drainage system outlet fig 1 by an area velocity flowmeter triton ads the temporal resolution of the discharge measurements is 2 min for wet periods and 10 min for dry periods the flow meter was calibrated in a standard way using stream gaging and the velocity area method employing an electromagnetic velocity probe observed discharges q range from approximately 2 to 2000 l s 1 following suggestions of muste et al 2012 uncertainty at a 95 level of confidence u q was analytically estimated for all individual discharge records based on uncertainties in the pipe radius measured flow depth and measured cross sectional velocity which are assumed to be uncorrelated details in pastorek et al 2019 the discharge uncertainty varies for different flow depths e g for 10 pipe filling u q 28 2 l s 1 corresponding to 31 0 of the discharge q 91 l s 1 for 50 pipe filling the uncertainty u q 245 l s 1 which is equivalent to 11 0 of the total value q 2170 l s 1 these discharge measurement uncertainty estimates are presented for informative purposes only and are not considered in subsequent analyses the dataset spans the period between july 2014 and october 2016 and excludes the winter months december march for two main reasons firstly cml signal attenuation by frozen precipitation common in winter periods is considerably different than in the case of liquid precipitation secondly the monitoring setup is designed for periods with liquid precipitation only as the rain gauges are not heated from the three year observation period we select data from hydrologically relevant rainfall events the mean rainfall depth of the three local rain gauges hmean greater than 2 mm after eliminating events with substantial data gaps 46 rainfall runoff events 670 h are available from which we randomly select 23 340 h to be used for the waa model calibration section 2 3 1 the remaining 23 events 330 h basic characteristics summarized in table s 2 in supplementary material are then used in the validation stage section 2 6 2 2 deriving cml qpes rainfall intensity r mm h 1 is quantified from the radio signal attenuation caused by raindrops along cml path ar db using the following robust and well understood relationship 1 r α a r l β where l m is the path length of a given cml and α mm h 1 km β db β and β are empirical parameters dependent upon cml frequency polarization and drop size distribution olsen et al 1978 however ar must first be separated from other components of the observed difference between the transmitted and received signal levels trsl db for this purpose the following relation is used 2 trsl b a wa a r where b db represents background attenuation from e g free space loss and gaseous attenuation the so called baseline and awa db represents attenuation due to water on the surface of one or both antennas so called wet antenna attenuation waa cml data processing steps before baseline separation including a quality check and aggregation to a 1 min resolution are done the same way as described in pastorek et al 2019 baseline b is estimated as a moving median with a centered window having a length of 1 week applied on a trsl time series averaged over 60 min intervals fencl et al 2020 to estimate waa awa we use the model proposed by valtr et al 2019 where awa is explicitly dependent on rainfall intensity r mm h 1 3 a wa 2 k r α where k mm α hα db and α are the power law parameters the exact values of which are obtained by calibration to the calibration datasets section 2 3 1 it is assumed here that awa is the same for both antennas since r cannot be observed directly using cmls the waa model equation eq 3 must be rearranged using eq 1 and 2 to include only one unknown variable awa pastorek et al 2022 4 a wa 2 k α trsl b a wa l β α where trsl b db represents total rainfall induced attenuation before waa separation k and α are parameters of eq 3 l km is the cml path length and α and β are empirical parameters defined in eq 1 we solve this equation numerically using two iterations in the first iteration initial awa on right hand site is assumed to be zero the calculated awa is then used for the second iteration after subtracting baseline b and waa awa from the observed trsl ar is used to compute r using eq 1 with parameters and β according to the international telecommunication union 2005 these parameter values are in extremely good agreement with values derived directly from drop size distribution observations chwala and kunstmann 2019 valtr et al 2019 however they may not be optimal for other rain type regions rios gaona et al 2018 2 3 rainfall observation layouts 2 3 1 cml qpe observation layouts the main cml observation layout evaluated in this study layout a is constructed from cmls with the paths best covering the catchment of interest i e cmls 3 7 8 12 and 15 best located cmls fig 1 these cmls were selected based on their relative lengths intersecting the drainage area of the catchment fig 1 in addition cmls 8 12 and 15 cover the catchment s western part containing areas with impermeable surfaces producing a major part of the catchment runoff the layout is constructed by averaging qpes from all five cmls we reduce the bias in cml qpes by calibrating the waa estimation model eq 3 to datasets available in the catchment of interest and or in its vicinity records observed over 23 randomly selected rainfall runoff events are used for this purpose section 2 1 in this manner three versions of layout a are constructed which differ only in the dataset used for the waa model calibration a1 cml qpes calibrated using 60 min rainfall data from a municipal rain gauge located at the prague central wastewater treatment plant wwtp at an 8 km distance southwest of the catchment fig 1 a2 cml qpes calibrated using 60 min rainfall data from the three closest municipal rain gauges located 2 3 km outside the catchment fig 1 a single time series constructed as the mean of the instantaneous r mm h 1 values of the three gauges is used a3 cml qpes calibrated using stormwater discharges observed at the catchment s drainage system outlet fig 1 with a temporal resolution of 2 min for wet periods and 10 min for dry ones when using rain gauge data for the calibration a1 a2 the waa model parameters are optimized by comparing cml qpes aggregated to 60 min time steps with the 60 min gauge data the root mean square error is used as the objective function when employing the discharge measurements a3 we repeatedly propagate the cml qpes in the original 1 min resolution through the deterministic rainfall runoff model section 2 4 and optimize the waa model parameters by comparing the modelled and observed discharges at this point the nash sutcliffe efficiency is the objective function in the case of both calibration approaches the objective functions evaluate the qpes as a whole time series consisting of all 23 events the waa model calibration is performed separately for each cml pastorek et al 2022 to investigate how the selection of cmls when constructing a layout affects runoff simulations more than 450 additional cml subsets have been analyzed due to the large number of possible subsets when selecting any number of links from the 16 cmls 65535 combinations each possible combination has not been evaluated since the effect of adding subtracting a single cml to a subset is likely to decrease with an increasing number of cmls in the subset we have focused primarily on subsets with low numbers of cmls qpes derived using all the additional cml subsets were propagated through the deterministic rainfall runoff model section 2 4 and the predicted discharges were evaluated against observed ones without quantifying the prediction uncertainty in particular we evaluated each cml individually 16 all subsets consisting of two cmls 120 and a randomly selected set of half of the subsets with three cmls 280 next after having evaluated all individual cmls we sorted them according to their performance in terms of the nnse dv and scc metrics see section 2 6 for each of the metrics additional cml subsets consisting of two to up to fifteen best performing cmls have been created lastly we analyzed the mean qpes from all cmls available the performance of these alternative cml subsets is addressed in the discussion 2 3 2 rain gauge observation layouts to provide a comparison with capabilities of traditional rain gauge observations in urbanized areas we also assess two rain gauge based rainfall data layouts first we evaluate records from the three closest municipal gauges fig 1 in the original resolution of 1 min layout b the municipal rain gauge network features a density of ca 1 gauge per 20 25 km2 and this layout thus in terms of the spatial coverage corresponds to the standard observation density for long term rainfall monitoring in urbanized areas second we evaluate the performance of 1 min observations from the three local rain gauges layout c installed at the borders of the catchment of interest fig 1 this is the benchmark layout representing the best case scenario input rainfall data for urban rainfall runoff modelling 2 3 3 rainfall spatial representation for hydrological modelling since the layout c based on the local rain gauge s represents the main benchmark rainfall dataset we aim to capture the rainfall spatial distribution over the catchment thus the rainfall input is in this case prepared for the rainfall runoff model section 2 4 using a standard thiessen polygon method in the cases of all other layouts i e the gauge based layout b and all three versions of the cml based layout a1 a2 a3 the model is forced with an areal rainfall meaning that rainfall intensity in a given time step has a constant value over all model sub catchments 2 4 deterministic rainfall runoff model a fully distributed rainfall runoff model built using epa swmm software rossman 2017 rossman and huber 2016 serves to simulate discharges at the outlet of the local stormwater drainage system it was constructed using detailed information about the catchment e g the ratio of impervious areas for individual sub catchments and the drainage system e g pipe materials and diameters the process of runoff generation is formulated empirically and separately for each model sub catchment 195 sub catchments over the total catchment area of 1 3 km2 using the respective surface depression storage depth parameters the subsequent runoff itself is modelled as a one dimensional flow expressed by saint venant equations these are numerically solved in the approximate form of a kinematic wave for surface runoff and in the full form of a dynamic wave for the subsequent runoff in the drainage network the temporal resolution of the discharge predictions is 2 min corresponding to the resolution of discharge measurements during wet periods the model was calibrated using data collected before the period of this study the reliability analysis of the model performance has been presented in pastorek et al 2019 2 5 stochastic error model for quantifying uncertainty of simulated rainfall runoff rainfall data from all observation layouts are propagated through the rainfall runoff model and the model outputs are evaluated against observed discharges we have decided to quantify uncertainties of the rainfall runoff model predictions and employ the bayesian uncertainty analysis framework of kennedy and o hagan 2001 as formulated by reichert and schuwirth 2012 and first used in an urban hydrology context by del giudice et al 2013 more recently this approach has been successfully applied by sikorska and seibert 2018 to analyze the value of different precipitation data for flood predictions in an alpine catchment the basic principle of the method is to extend the deterministic rainfall runoff model by a stochastic error model which explicitly accounts for systematic model errors i e bias for more information on the principles or particular details of this uncertainty quantification method please consult the above referenced studies in this study we only optimize the stochastic error model parameters we do not calibrate the whole extended deterministic stochastic model since the deterministic rainfall runoff model has been calibrated in the past and has been shown to perform well pastorek et al 2019 the calibration of the stochastic model is performed individually for each rainfall observation layout the part of the error model representing random noise has only a single parameter the asymptotic standard deviation of random errors σe l s 1 the part of the stochastic model representing the bias is formulated in this study as an autoregressive stationary random process with a long term equilibrium value of zero and a constant variance del giudice et al 2013 two parameters associated with the bias model are to be calibrated the asymptotic standard deviation of the random fluctuations around equilibrium σb l s 1 and associated correlation time τ h informative prior probability distributions of the error model parameters table 1 reflect our knowledge concerning random measurement errors in our system and address the identifiability problem between the deterministic model and the bias reichert and schuwirth 2012 by specifying that we are seeking the smallest possible bias when calibrating the stochastic error model data from the same 23 events are employed as when calibrating the waa model to fulfill the underlying statistical assumptions discharge data are transformed using the two parameter box cox transformation function with parameters λ1 0 45 and λ2 1 formulated for λ1 0 in the following manner box and cox 1964 5 g y y λ 2 λ 1 1 λ 1 therefore error model parameters σe and σb table 1 are also employed in the transformed space with units g l s 1 the error model calibration by means of bayesian inference is performed in two steps first we use a generalized simulated annealing function which was designed to search for a global minimum of a very complex non linear objective function with a very large number of optima xiang et al 2013 second we use a numerical monte carlo markov chain sampler which achieves often a high efficiency by tuning the proposal distributions to a user defined acceptance rate as implemented by scheidegger 2012 according to the proposal of vihola 2012 2 6 performance of rainfall runoff modeling to validate the rainfall runoff modelling performance associated with a given rainfall observation layout we use data from the 23 events not employed in the calibration stage we produce hydrographs of each event showing 90 confidence intervals and median predictions which can be interpreted as the most likely predictions the interval predictions are evaluated in terms of both precision and accuracy for this purpose the normalized average bandwidth nabw i e the mean band width normalized by the mean discharge observed during the given event and the prediction reliability i e the fraction of discharge observations falling into the predicted 90 confidence bands are quantified next for the median prediction of each event as well as for each stochastic model prediction associated with the given event we quantify following metrics i the normalized nash sutcliffe efficiency nnse summarizing the overall performance ii the relative error of total runoff volume dv iii the spearman rank correlation coefficient scc which quantifies the strength of a monotonic relationship between two variables and unlike pearson correlation coefficient is independent of nonlinear bias and thus better quantifies the match between simulated and observed discharges in terms of timing and iv dqmax which is the relative error of the sum of the discharges during the ten minutes around the observed maximum discharge the uncertainty of the performance metrics is analyzed by visualizing the most favorable 90 intervals within their distributions for the 23 events used in the validation stage the rainfall spatial variability is quantified table s 2 in supplementary material using all six rain gauges three local and three nearest municipal gauges in particular the rain gauge data are aggregated to 60 min time steps and coefficients of variation are determined for each time step from all six rain gauges the event spatial variability is then determined as the arithmetic mean of the coefficients of variation when analyzing the results special attention is paid to eight events i e ⅓ out of the total 23 with the highest rainfall spatial variability as such events are often associated with a low representativeness of traditional rain gauge observations and thus constitute a promising niche for the usage of cml qpes 3 results we compare the rainfall runoff modelling performance when using cml qpes with the performance of traditional rain gauge data the differences between the capabilities of the cml qpes and the municipal rain gauge data are investigated in detail section 3 1 next we analyze cml qpes obtained using the three various waa calibration approaches the performance of all three versions of the cml qpe layout a is evaluated against the performance of the local rain gauge data both in terms of rainfall intensities and associated runoffs section 3 2 lastly rainfall runoff modelling with associated output uncertainty is evaluated in section 3 3 for all 23 events and all main rainfall observation layouts a1 3 b c 3 1 runoff predictions with cml qpes and with rain gauges in this section the rainfall runoff modelling performance when using the cml qpes is compared with the performance of traditional rain gauge data in particular we analyze 1 min qpes from the best located cmls derived using the waa model calibrated to the 60 min data from the three nearest municipal rain gauges layout a2 compared to rain gauge layouts from 1 min records from the municipal rain gauges layout b and from the three local gauges layout c hydrographs obtained using these three rainfall observation layouts a2 b c for all 23 validation events are presented in supplementary material first the discharges predicted using the deterministic rainfall runoff model only are summarized in fig 2 in terms of both dv reflecting the bias and scc reflecting temporal dynamics reproduction the performance of cml qpes a2 dv 0 040 scc 0 908 is better than the performance of the municipal rain gauge records b dv 0 052 scc 0 868 and worse than that of the local rain gauge data c dv 0 009 scc 0 93 despite the overestimation of the highest discharges the overall bias is within reasonable limits in all three cases however compared to the records from the municipal rain gauges b the local gauges c and the cml qpes a2 notably reduce the general point spread around the x y line such situations when cml qpes a2 reproduce runoff especially its dynamics notably better than the municipal gauges b are presented below next we investigate the cml qpes a2 and municipal rain gauge data b with local rain gauge data c for two chosen events with high spatial rainfall variability table s 2 in supplementary material i e when cml qpes are expected to best exploit their advantage of better spatial representativeness this is done by evaluating the rainfall runoff modelling including the prediction uncertainty quantification for the first event fig 3 the discharge peak is reproduced considerably better compared to layout b in terms of both amplitude and timing when using the cml qpes a2 this is also demonstrated in the respective nnse values which are notably higher for the cml qpes a2 median 0 84 than for the municipal rain gauge data b median 0 59 and reach even better performance metrics than for the benchmark hydrograph c median 0 79 in fact all modelling performance metrics reach better values in terms of their medians for the cml qpes a2 compared to b comparison with the benchmark layout c shows very similar results the only exception is nabw reflecting the width of the 90 prediction bands which is very similar for both rainfall layouts a2 and b and significantly smaller for c however prediction reliability is higher for the cml qpes a2 than for b suggesting that the cml data lead to better overall prediction performance it should also be noted that the performance of median discharge predictions in purple in terms of scc reflecting the temporal dynamics is remarkable in all cases a2 0 91 b 0 87 c 0 92 for another event with high spatial rainfall variability the hydrographs simulated using the rainfall observation layout b fig 4 tend to overestimate the observed discharges most interestingly layout b predicts a small runoff peak at the event s beginning which is not present in the observed discharges the cml qpes a2 compared to layout b do not predict this peak although they provide slightly biased predictions dv median 0 15 dqmax median 0 07 they still lead to narrower prediction bands higher prediction reliability and better overall performance than the rain gauge data median nnse 0 74 vs 0 58 layout a2 shows similar metrics to the benchmark layout c expect the nabw metric the results presented in this section suggest that the rainfall runoff modelling performance of the cml qpes a2 is closer to that of the local rain gauge records c than that of the municipal gauge records b compared to the latter cmls exploit their advantage of better spatial coverage and yield qpes which lead to better runoff peak reproduction for events with high rainfall spatial variability 3 2 comparison of the three wwa calibration approaches we also analyze the differences among cml qpes obtained using the three various waa calibration approaches cml layout versions a1 a2 and a3 first we briefly evaluate precipitation estimates retrieved using all three calibration approaches directly against records from the three local rain gauges the mean of the three gauges layout c this comparison of rainfall data for all 23 validation events is plotted in fig 5 left cml qpes derived using the waa model calibrated to 60 min records from the 8 km distant rain gauge at the wwtp a1 tend to systematically underestimate higher rainfall intensities such a tendency is not present when evaluating the other two versions of cml qpe layout a2 and a3 which are more alike although they also lead to somewhat biased total rainfall depths dh higher than 0 05 in absolute terms interestingly all three versions of the cml qpe layout lead to practically the same quality of temporal dynamics reproduction scc values of 0 782 0 783 next for all three versions of the cml qpe layout a1 a2 a3 predicted discharges are compared with the discharges simulated with the local rain gauge data c fig 5 right these simulations use only the deterministic rainfall runoff model without the stochastic error model corresponding to the above rainfall data analysis cml qpes derived using the waa calibrated to the wwtp rain gauge data a1 result in the most biased runoff volumes dv 0 123 affecting in particular the highest discharges when using cml qpes with the waa model calibrated to 60 min data from the three municipal rain gauges a2 or to the observed discharges a3 the resulting bias is notably lower dv 0 045 and 0 043 respectively similar to the above temporal dynamics reproduction is highly comparable for all three versions of cml qpe layout however due to the rainfall transformation into runoff the scc values are notably higher 0 954 0 964 and the associated spread in relation to the x y line is lower these results indicate that the discharge predictions based on well calibrated cml qpes a2 a3 are similar to the predictions obtained using the local rain gauge records c a detailed evaluation against observed discharges for runoff predictions based on both the cml qpes and the local rain gauge data is provided below taking into account the prediction uncertainty the rainfall runoff modeling performance of all three versions of the cml qpe observation layous a1 a2 a3 is compared with the performance of 1 min records from the three local rain gauges c for all eight events with the highest rainfall spatial variability fig 6 all four rainfall layouts lead to very similar modelling performance in terms of nnse with medians around 0 75 interestingly the worst performance for the median prediction for an individual event nnse 0 49 occurs during the local rain gauge c predictions nevertheless the local gauge records c outperform the cml qpes a1 a2 a3 in terms of scc both for medians 0 72 vs 0 63 0 667 and variability systematic errors in cml qpes with the waa model calibrated to records from the rain gauge at the wwtp a1 affect the relative error of maximum discharges dqmax which is 0 292 for this observation layout however for the two other cml qpe layouts dqmax is in absolute values lower 0 127 for a2 0 103 for a3 than for the rain gauge records c 0 167 rain gauge data c lead to narrower prediction bands as quantified by nabw but also to lower prediction reliability only 0 95 in the median compared to medians of circa 0 97 for the cml qpes a1 a2 a3 the interplay between these two aspects and its effect on the result interpretation is addressed in the discussion the results presented in this section show that calibrating the waa model to the observed discharges a3 leads to the same quality cml qpes as when calibrating it to the records from the three municipal rain gauges a2 moreover such cml qpes lead to rainfall runoff modelling performance very similar to that obtained with the local rain gauges c when the most spatially variable rainfall events are considered 3 3 stochastic predictions for all events and all observation layouts lastly we summarize the rainfall runoff modelling performance for all evaluated rainfall observation layouts using data from all 23 events fig 7 in terms of the nnse the highest median is observed for the local rain gauges c 0 82 followed by the cml qpe layouts a1 a2 a3 0 76 0 79 and three closest municipal gauges b 0 68 the variability of nnse increases accordingly the mutual relations among the rainfall layouts are similar when quantifying the performance in terms of both scc reflecting the temporal dynamics reproduction and dv reflecting the volumetric bias however dv medians are lower in absolute values for cml qpes with the waa model calibrated to records from the three municipal gauges a2 0 011 and to discharge observations a3 0 007 than for the local rain gauges c 0 046 cml qpes calibrated to records from the rain gauge at the wwtp a1 feature higher bias median dv 0 1 however they can reproduce runoff temporal dynamics almost as well as the other two cml qpe layouts median scc 0 72 vs 0 75 predicted 90 confidence bands for the cml qpe layouts in terms of nabw are in the median approximately the same as for the three municipal gauges b and wider than for the local gauges c however prediction reliability is in the median highest i e above 0 95 for the three versions of the cml qpe layout a1 a2 a3 and for the local gauges c while the associated variability in terms of the interquartile range is lowest for all the versions of the cml qpe observation layout a1 a2 a3 the results presented in this section confirm that rainfall runoff simulations with cml qpes derived using an accurate waa model a2 a3 outperform in our small urban catchment simulations with municipal rain gauges b including the reduction of the prediction bias nevertheless the overall prediction performance of cml qpes a2 a3 is not as close to that of the local rain gauges c as when evaluating only the events with the highest rainfall variability 4 discussion 4 1 result interpretation and comparison with previous findings the main finding of the study is that the rainfall runoff model performance with cml qpes is in the investigated small urban catchment better than when using 1 min records from the municipal rain gauge network and almost as good as when using three local rain gauges installed around the catchment when only the most spatially variable rainfall events are considered cml qpes lead to a rainfall runoff modelling performance very similar to that obtained when using the local rain gauges it must be also mentioned that overall results still show the best metrics for our benchmark rainfall dataset b0 which is visible on individual runoff hydrographs presented in supplementary material in some specific events we report some deficits in predictions based on cml qpes data a2 compared to b0 on the other side the presented approach allows to estimate relevant rainfall data also for events with low and moderate rainfall intensity this is a significant improvement compared to our previous work e g pastorek et al 2019 which showed substantially worse prediction metrics of simulated runoff from the three versions of cml qpes observation layout a the best discharge predictions were achieved when calibrating the waa model using the observed discharges a3 and the 60 min records from the three closest municipal rain gauges a2 in fact there was effectively no difference between the performance of cml qpes for these two versions of observation layout a moreover the predicted discharges were biased to a lesser extent than in the case of the local rain gauge data especially for runoff maxima associated with rainfall events with a high spatial variability in contrast calibrating the waa model to 60 min records from the single rain gauge at an 8 km distance resulted in cml qpes which underestimate the discharges by 8 5 in the median and by up to 30 for runoff maxima visual inspection of hydrographs revealed that all three versions of cml observation layout a often do not correctly capture rainfall peaks at the beginning of light and moderate rainfall events e g event on 20th september 2014 shown in supplementary material this can be caused by spatial averaging but also by limited accuracy of cmls during light rainfalls the effect of spatial averaging is further discussed in section 4 2 we estimated runoff prediction uncertainty using a stochastic error model which explicitly accounts for the rainfall runoff model bias the predicted 90 confidence bands were evaluated in terms of both width and reliability if prediction reliability was the same for all evaluated rainfall layouts the interval width would be the only factor of interest when comparing predictions associated with individual rainfall layouts however probably due to more extreme observations in the calibration dataset prediction reliability has been notably higher than the nominal 90 for all rainfall layouts 0 94 0 97 fig 7 this means that the width of the prediction bands would be narrower if reliability reached 90 however as reliability is very similar in all five cases the simulated nabw provides relevant information for comparison of all layouts and their versions and would not affect the interpretation of results the presented results suggest that satisfactory rainfall runoff modelling performance can be achieved with cml qpes when the availability of data used to optimize the waa model is severely reduced this issue has already been addressed in the study of pastorek et al 2022 showing that calibrating the waa model to 15 min data from the three closest rain gauges from the municipal network can lead to virtually unbiased cml qpes however in that study the suitability of cml qpes to be used in hydrological modelling was not tested in the presented study cml qpes have been used to predict rainfall runoff and have shown that practically unbiased cml qpes and high quality discharge predictions can be obtained when calibrating the waa model to 60 min records from the municipal gauges or even 2 min discharge observations we have also shown that cml qpes with the waa model calibrated using 60 min records from a rain gauge at an 8 km distance can lead to reasonable rainfall runoff modelling performance the presented results thus confirm the high potential of cml qpes for rainfall runoff modelling in small urban catchments where traditional long term rainfall observations are not available at resolutions suitable for urban hydrological purposes it has also been shown that using a well calibrated waa model efficiently eliminates the bias in cml qpes without averaging out rainfall and runoff peaks which was the greatest shortcoming of the cml adjustment method proposed by fencl et al 2017 this implies that cml qpes are promising not only for catchments with considerable data scarcity but also for urban areas already covered by rain gauge networks of densities between 1 gauge per 20 25 km2 and 1 gauge per 0 5 1 km2 corresponding to the municipal and local gauges respectively this is in agreement with the findings of disch et al 2019 and stránský et al 2018 who however evaluated cml qpes continuously adjusted to rain gauges fencl et al 2017 i e a method designed to be used only in a hindcasting mode in contrast a well calibrated waa model can lead to reliable cml qpes even when the data used for model calibration are no longer available finally our findings are based on exploiting a larger dataset spanning over three years and on employing a robust output uncertainty quantification method thus our results confirm that cml qpes can be considered a more than sufficient alternative to standard long term rainfall observation in urbanized areas i e 1 rain gauge per 20 25 km2 4 2 performance of different cml subsets and the effect of rainfall averaging we have presented results obtained when using the mean qpes of cmls the paths of which best cover the catchment of interest i e cmls 3 7 8 12 and 15 fig 1 however performance of more than 450 additional subsets has been analyzed by propagating the cml qpes through the deterministic rainfall runoff model and comparing predicted and observed discharges none of the additional cml subsets tested has led to significantly better rainfall runoff modelling performance than the subset of the best located cmls however several subsets have reached similar performance including the mean qpes from all cmls the performance of qpes from individual cmls in terms of dv and nnse is presented in fig 8 the results demonstrate that errors in qpes from individual cmls are despite of the waa correction still important for example simulations with cml 3 located inside of the catchment perform similarly well as simulations with cml 18 reaching far from the catchment on the other hand the best performing individual cmls in terms of nnse are 8 12 and 15 which are all close to catchment center and make part of the best located subset the averaging of observations from all the cmls fig 8 reduces the bias dv and nnse even the best performing cml when used alone does not outperform in terms of nnse simulations with all cmls averaged i e simulations with areal rainfall covering an area substantially larger than the catchment itself this is in agreement with the conclusions of fencl et al 2015 that combining qpes from all available cmls reduces both systematic and random errors in estimated rainfall and is recommended when no prior information on cml data quality is available in contrast to previous studies pastorek et al 2019 no dependence of dv on cml path length is observed showing that the implemented waa model can reduce systematic errors in qpes even from short cmls otherwise prone to bias cml qpes in all the presented cases enter the rainfall runoff model as areal rainfalls in contrast simulations with the benchmark layout c use spatially distributed rainfall information from three local rain gauges assigned to the model subcatchments by thiessen polygons the usage of the areal rainfall instead of the thiessen polygons worsens the performance the median scc decreases from 0 93 to 0 92 and median nnse from 0 88 to 0 84 performance by certain highly variable events worsens significantly more this clearly demonstrates the importance of distributed rainfall information for rainfall runoff modeling even in small catchments rainfall spatial reconstruction from neighboring cmls might help in this regard nevertheless several challenges should be overcome first as discussed above errors in cml qpes are still significant and differ between individual cmls efficient spatial reconstruction will require robust estimation of cml qpe uncertainties second the current algorithms for reconstructing gridded rainfall from cml qpes were designed for larger space time scales and further research is needed to adapt them for reconstructing rainfall at minute and sub kilometer scale it is however not yet clear if cml qpes are sufficiently accurate to efficiently perform such fine scale reconstructions 4 3 calibration of the deterministic rainfall runoff model rainfall runoff modelling output uncertainty was quantified by extending the deterministic rainfall runoff model by a stochastic error model to ensure reliable uncertainty estimates stochastic error model parameters were calibrated for each of the evaluated rainfall observation layouts in contrast the deterministic rainfall runoff model was calibrated before the observation period of the presented study using data from the three local rain gauges layout c if the deterministic model was calibrated to other data e g to the cml qpes themselves the modelling performance of individual rainfall observation layouts might change probably for the better for the cml qpes 4 4 study limitations the relevance of our findings for other small urban catchments should be subject to further research firstly based on our previous study where several waa models pastorek et al 2022 had been analyzed we have tested only the waa model originally derived by using one of our 16 cmls and data from one of the three summer seasons investigated herein valtr et al 2019 moreover all cmls used in this study are from the same product family of the same manufacturer ericsson mini link and have aged similarly due to exposure to similar climatic conditions nevertheless cml networks in other areas may consist of antennas of different hardware characteristics exposed to different climates for different time periods identifying optimal waa models may be more complicated in such conditions especially if the calibration data are available only at low resolution lastly we assumed that during rainfall both ends of a cml would suffer from the same amount of waa for longer cmls waa will often notably vary between the two ends however the contribution of waa is relatively small in the case of longer cmls compared to raindrop attenuation along the cml path 5 conclusions in this study we have assessed the value of quantitative precipitation estimates qpes retrieved from commercial microwave links cmls for rainfall runoff modelling in a small urban catchment this includes quantifying model output uncertainties associated both with the cml qpes and with traditional rain gauge data moreover we have analyzed the possibilities of reducing systematic errors in the cml qpes with the help of three calibration datasets equivalents of which might be commonly available to urban hydrology professionals it has been shown that when predicting rainfall runoff with cml qpes derived using a wet antenna attenuation waa model calibrated to 60 min records from a single rain gauge at an 8 km distance from the catchment of interest the simulated discharges were underestimated by 8 5 in the median and by up to 30 for runoff maxima due to the low representativeness of the gauge data for the catchment area however except for the considerable bias the performance of these cml qpes was an improvement compared to records from the three rain gauges from the municipal rainfall monitoring network we have also demonstrated that when calibrating the waa model to both discharges observed at the catchment outlet and to 60 min records from the three closest municipal rain gauges virtually unbiased cml qpes can be retrieved these cml qpes can then reproduce observed discharges median nnse 0 79 almost as well as three local rain gauges installed at the borders of the studied catchment for research purposes median nnse 0 82 in fact for rainfall events of high spatial variability runoff maxima are biased to a lesser extent when using the cml qpes 10 than for the local rain gauge data 17 this shows that cml qpes can also be successfully used for rainfall runoff modelling when no rainfall data only runoff observations are available another important conclusion is related to the significant reduction of bias for discharges predicted using cml qpes calibrated to waa for light and moderate rainfalls where waa plays a dominant role in terms of bias in conclusion the presented findings imply that cml qpes are promising not only for catchments with considerable data scarcity but also for urban areas already covered by rain gauge networks for areas with network densities of roughly 1 gauge per 20 25 km2 corresponding to a standard observation density for long term rainfall monitoring in urbanized areas cml qpes represent a notable potential improvement for rainfall runoff modelling in small urban catchments for denser networks with roughly 1 gauge per 0 5 1 km2 cml qpes can be considered a satisfactory alternative especially for rainfall events with high spatial variability which are often associated with high rainfall intensities and thus important for many urban hydrology tasks such as the design and evaluation of urban stormwater systems further improvement might be achieved by reconstructing the rainfall spatial distribution instead of using areal rainfall this will however require robust estimation of cml qpe uncertainties and adaptation of current algorithms to be able to reconstruct rainfall distribution at minute and sub kilometer scale credit authorship contribution statement jaroslav pastorek conceptualization formal analysis investigation methodology validation

2332,the urban water system involves complex interactions between physical and social factors such as physical infrastructures and information communications among these the water supply network wsn and water consumers network wcn are critical determinants of water supply and demand which are featured with prominent structural heterogeneity and interrelationships the structures of wsn and wcn have been traditionally modeled in isolation under the assumption of structural homogeneity this work proposes a new agent based modeling abm framework with a local world fitness network to explore the effects of structural heterogeneity and wsn wcn interrelationship on water supply demand dynamics a case study in lhasa reveals that the traditionally assumed fully connected water supply system and structurally homogeneous water user network may result in simultaneous overestimation of water demand and underestimation of inter region variances in water demand and groundwater table our analysis provides new insights into the disentanglement of the complex interdependencies of wsn and wcn and their associated structural heterogeneities which could be extended to the modeling of other complex and interrelated networks keywords urban water system agent based modeling structural heterogeneity and interrelationship coupled physical and social network lhasa city data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction accurate modeling of water supply demand dynamics is fundamental for municipal water supply infrastructure operation kanta and zechman 2014 demand management house peters and chang 2011 and the expansion of new water sources and water supply infrastructures xiao et al 2018 zheng et al 2013 especially under global climate change rapid urbanization and population growth certain regions face the risks of both shrinking water resources and expanding water demands gold et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 hence a deeper understanding of water supply demand dynamics becomes a pressing issue human behaviors regarding water supply and demand are affected by various physical socio economic and environmental drivers and the impacts of the above factors are usually intertwined with complex feedback addo et al 2018 aghaie et al 2020 tóth et al 2021 the agent based model abm is a bottom up modeling tool that derives the system level dynamics of a system from the individual decision of agents and their interactions with the environment berglund 2015 al amin et al 2018 the abm has been adopted by many researchers to simulate the behavioral mechanism and dynamic interactions of complex human natural systems berglund 2015 skardi et al 2021 du et al 2022 including the urban water supply demand system koutiva and makropoulos 2016 mashhadi ali et al 2017 rasoulkhani et al 2018 in urban water supply demand abm the physical infrastructure networks and water consumers social networks are critical in determining human behaviors haer et al 2016 haensch et al 2019 for instance the quality and quantity of delivered water may be compromised by the limited capacities of water supply infrastructures in extracting and distributing water shafiee et al 2018 skardi et al 2020 moreover consumers conservation behavior is strongly influenced by their interactions with consumer organizations such as property management hu et al 2015 or with other community members in their social network abrahamse and steg 2013 haensch et al 2019 the physical infrastructure networks and social networks are also interrelated for example the formation of a water consumer social network largely depends on the structure of the waterworks infrastructures frija et al 2017 mercure et al 2016 tóth et al 2021 a key difficulty in assessing agents behaviors and water demand lies in the disentanglement of the tightly coupled physical infrastructure networks and water consumers social networks as indicated by house peters and chang 2011 and corbella and sauri 2009 however previous studies tend to analyze the influence of physical or social networks in isolation du et al 2020 mashhadi ali et al 2017 rasoulkhani et al 2018 shafiee et al 2018 while researchers in the abm community emphasize the need to context human decision and social networks with feedback from the physical environment mercure et al 2016 an et al 2021 skardi et al 2021 tóth et al 2021 for simulating the physical networks graph theory or complex network techniques are used to investigate the relationship between the water distribution network structure and its performances e g redundancy connectivity and robustness yazdani and jeffrey 2012 duan et al 2019 moreover integrated numerical surface water groundwater models are incorporated to simulate the hydrological processes and water use under centralized or distributed water tax policies du et al 2020 du et al 2022 among notable findings in this area is the notion of the wsn s fragility to a few highly connected nodes also known as hubs albert et al 2000 yazdani and jeffrey 2012 more specifically the removal of the critical nodes hubs would lead to the breakdown of network connectivity hence cascading failures of network operation yazdani and jeffrey 2012 for simulating the social networks researchers use dynamic modeling approaches and opinion assessment models to investigate the influence of information diffusion on water conservation behavior in a water user s social network wcn information diffusion via a social network is suggested to be an essential driver in modeling individual decision making processes liu et al 2007 examples include analysis regarding the availability of water scarcity information chu et al 2009 galán et al 2009 stakeholders for the social learning diffusion skardi et al 2020 skardi et al 2021 the existence of social networks cheng et al 2019 and the diffusion scale of the network athanasiadis et al 2005 furthermore network density frija et al 2017 network connection strength tang et al 2013 and network structure e g the existence of property management hu et al 2015 or water user association wua cai and xiong 2017 qiao et al 2009 are recognized to be essential factors affecting water consumers behaviors frija et al 2017 revealed that better performances of water management policy are observed in areas with higher social density and higher centrality of water users associations tang et al 2013 found that a farmer with a closer connection to social networks with water shortage knowledge would be more likely to realize irrigation water scarcity and the need for water conservation to summarize the characteristics and structures of both wsn and wcn play an essential role in determining the behaviors of water users and their water demands another difficulty in assessing human behaviors and water demand lies in the structural heterogeneity of the interrelated wsns and wcns mercure et al 2016 du et al 2017b al amin et al 2018 yang et al 2019 the wsns are usually not evenly distributed over space among different jurisdictions within a municipality because wsns are generally operated with multiple water sources and divided into district metered areas dmas smith and ali 2006 uneven water extraction or groundwater table decline is typically noticed in multi sources wsns al amin et al 2018 du et al 2020 moreover if the wsns are not fully connected they may result in vastly different water prices or scarcities in different dmas and thus different levels of attention to water price or scarcity information for consumers located at different dmas however such complex interconnections between wsns and wcns are generally ignored skardi et al 2020 skardi et al 2021 furthermore residents interactions are also heterogeneous in that some users may interact with a large number of users while others interact with a limited number of users or even remain completely isolated berglund 2015 the spread of the water conservation information in such a structurally heterogeneous wcn thus becomes uncertain and uneven tóth et al 2021 although past decades have witnessed the adoption and comparison of different networks in assessing opinion dynamics of residential water users in the literature rasoulkhani et al 2018 the above structural heterogeneities are not explicitly investigated it is generally assumed that residents are uniformly distributed in the urban boundary and are linked to each other randomly without explicit spatial dependency anbari et al 2021 skardi et al 2021 furthermore a spatially uniform framework is commonly adopted by assuming a representative rational water user and a lumped water supply source koutiva and makropoulos 2016 rathnayaka et al 2017 such studies over simplified the opinion dynamics of water conservation in an actual water consumer network leading to unexpected and impractical results chen and zhou 2019 stein et al 2011 regional heterogeneities in wsns and wcns as well as their impact on water demands remain poorly understood du et al 2021 therefore a new simulation framework that accounts for the interactions of wsn and wcn and their structural heterogeneities is needed mercure et al 2016 this paper addresses this problem by proposing an integrative abm framework that realistically represents the groundwater processes water supply processes water conservation opinion dynamics and their interactions in an urban region two scenarios are compared to investigate the role of network heterogeneity in water demand dynamic simulation one with distributed sources disconnected local wsns and a structurally heterogeneous wcn the other with a lumped source a fully connected wsn and a structurally homogeneous wcn the abm framework is adopted to address the following issues i the interactions of wsn and wcn and ii the effects of structurally heterogeneous wsn and wcn on residents behaviors and the emergence of water conservation behaviors a key hypothesis is that the structural heterogeneity of wsns and wcns is necessary for accurately simulating the dynamics of water conservation and water demand in a typical urban water supply demand system in an era of rapid information sharing by the internet and smartphone this study provides a timely contribution to understanding water demand prediction and the social learning process of water conservation findings from this study would be beneficial for the demand management of urban water users and the long term planning of water supply infrastructures following this section 2 explains details about the abm framework and the associated simulation scenarios the model was developed and applied using a comprehensive set of data collected mainly by water utilities in lhasa city china detailed in section 3 the obtained results are shown in section 4 with extended discussions in section 5 finally section 6 concludes the paper and provides some suggestions 2 methodology 2 1 model overview following galán et al 2009 and mashhadi ali et al 2017 an agent based modeling framework is adopted to investigate the effects of structural heterogeneity and interrelationship of wsn and wcn on the spatio temporal dynamics of water demand and groundwater tables the structural heterogeneity of wsn denotes a distributed water supply system that consists of localized groundwater wells and disconnected water distribution networks fig 1 a that of wcn means a non uniform connection density among residents fig 1a conversely the structural homogeneity scenario implies a lumped groundwater well and a fully connected water distribution network fig 1b that of wcn means a uniform connection density among residents fig 1b different from previous studies with the assumption of evenly diffused water use restriction and water conservation information across regions galán et al 2009 berglund 2015 koutiva and makropoulos 2016 mashhadi ali et al 2017 this paper assumes that such information diffusion is uneven and usually localized this is because residents are primarily concerned about their local water supply information fig 1a which is structurally heterogeneous across regions in a disconnected water supply infrastructure system the general scheme of the hybrid abm framework is given in fig 2 the modeling framework consists of a water supply system and a water consumer system the waterworks play a crucial role in the water supply system by pumping water from the aquifer and delivering it to residents the aggregation over the water supply capacity of individual waterworks within the corresponding demand site defines the regional water supply capacity meanwhile the abm model estimates each resident agent s water demand by assessing their baseline water demand and the magnitude of water conservation the domestic water demand consists of individual and tourist water demand and the calculation of the latter is simplified as a constant ratio of the former the regional water shortage is specified by the deviation between regional water demand and water supply capacity moreover a modflow model is developed to couple the water extraction processes with the groundwater table the pumping cost measured with the pumping lift associated with the groundwater table simulated by the modflow model is integrated into the water price to investigate the impacts of regional water deficiency and water price on residents water demand the modeling of the water supply system and resident agents water use behaviors are detailed in the following sections 2 2 modeling of water supply system the water supply system involves the water extraction and distribution processes fig 3 the water distribution process simulates the mass balance of water distribution networks the regional water supply capacity is determined by the water supply capacity of the corresponding waterworks the water extraction process portrays the groundwater dynamics resulting from hydrological inputs and water extraction this study simulates the aquifer groundwater processes using the modular groundwater flow model modflow a finite difference groundwater flow simulation code harbaug 2005 modflow calculates the hydraulic head in each regular rectangular cell for each time step of various groundwater processes such as aquifer discharge and recharge unsaturated and saturated subsurface flow and surface water groundwater interactions harbaug 2005 the inputs of the modflow model are aquifer conditions including boundary conditions stream location permeability coefficient water yield and recharge coefficient recharge and evapotranspiration et and the pumping locations and pumping rate of waterworks the outputs of the modflow model are the groundwater table dynamics which measure the pumping cost and water prices as inputs to the abm simulation process modflow provides a robust tool to simulate groundwater tables under different distributions and amounts of water extractions more details about the modflow setups calibration and validation are available in the supplementary material 2 3 modeling of agents water use behaviors residents water use behavior is specified by their preferences and their interactions with other agents and the external environment as shown in fig 4 agent attributes and external environmental variables are listed in table s4 of the supplementary material s 3 four submodules are developed to model water use behaviors and estimate individual water demand of agents firstly the basic water demand estimation submodule is used to assess the basic water demand of residents with the input of water price information secondly residents water conservation behavior is simulated by the remaining three submodules specifically by using the information exchange simulation submodule the residents establish social networks with others based on population and their background characteristics such as income age and education level yuan et al 2014 kanta and zechman 2014 the water conservation attitude of resident agents is assessed in the water conservation attitude evaluation submodule with the inputs of regional water shortage status and external information via the social networks established by the information exchange simulation submodule the water conservation level assessment submodule evaluates the residents water conservation level by the inputs of water conservation attitude information residents with a negative water conservation attitude have a zero water conservation level and residents with a positive water conservation attitude would select one of the three water conservation levels i e low middle or high koutiva and makropoulos 2016 the individual water demand is obtained with the basic water demand estimated by the basic water demand estimation submodule and the water conservation level assessed by the remaining three submodules the water use behaviors of each resident are updated annually assuming that agents re evaluate their water demand and conservation attitude at the end of each year we further assume that the residents population and income growth follow the logistics model feng et al 2019 the income growth leads to higher basic water demand as measured by the quadratic almost ideal demand system quaids submodule and the population growth implies additional resident agents who consume water and join the social network to participate in information exchange besides the water shortage is recognized as a driver to hinder income growth while the low growth rate of income is a key factor in resident migration galán et al 2009 klabunde and willekens 2016 the regional water deficiency is specified by the difference between regional water demand and water supply capacity which in turn affects the population and income growth of residents galán et al 2009 mashhadi ali et al 2017 fig 4 furthermore the water price will increase in response to the increasing pumping cost and declining groundwater table with the expanding water demand du et al 2022 the price for using water thus consists of initial water price and additional pumping cost rothausen and conway 2011 i e pw pw i pw a which in turn affects the basic water demand and conservation behavior of residents four submodules are developed and coupled to simulate residents water demand and behaviors as detailed in the following section the development of this abm model follows the standard odd d protocol for abm müller et al 2013 and more details of the model description are presented in table s5 of the supplementary material s 4 2 3 1 submodule for basic water demand estimation the quadratic almost ideal demand system quaids is employed to simulate the basic water demand following banks et al 1997 the demand function applies a nonlinear relationship between the expenditure share devoted to water and total expenditure by regarding water as a kind of goods to specify the basic water demand chen and yang 2009 yuan et al 2014 the quaids model assumes the budget share of good i equals the sum of constant terms price terms linear total expenditure terms and quadratic total expenditure terms the following form defines the quaids model for the budget shares of ith goods of resident agents 1 w i α i j 1 k γ ij ln p j β i ln m a p λ i b p ln m a p 2 where i j 1 k denotes the type of goods consumed by agents wi is the budget share of ith goods that satisfies i 1 k w i 1 αi γij βi and λi are the parameters to be fitted pj is the price of jth goods m is the gross expenditure of agents the price and expenditure are expressed in the same monetary unit rmb α p is the price index given by equation 2 2 ln a p α 0 i 1 k α i ln p i 1 2 i 1 k j 1 k γ ij ln p i ln p j b p is the cobb douglas price aggregator 3 b p i 1 k p i β i the four parameters used in equation 1 are restricted by the following three properties additivity 4 i 1 k α i 1 i 1 k β i 0 i 1 k λ i 0 i 1 k γ ij 0 homogeneity 5 j 1 k γ ij 0 symmetry 6 γ ij γ ji j i j the additivity property implies that the sum of all expenditures on different goods is equal to total expenditures the homogeneity property denotes that the expenditure share of all goods remains constant if prices and revenues are magnified or reduced by the same multiplier and the symmetry property ensures that the compensated demand curve is symmetric to price banks et al 1997 the parameters involved in equation 1 could be estimated with regression methods fitted by the collected data in this study the seemingly unrelated regression sur method is adopted and performed using the stata statistical software stata version 12 0 poi 2012 suárez varela 2020 the random error terms in the quaids model are autocorrelated and measured by the sur method poi 2012 sur iteratively adjusts the parameters in equation 1 to minimize the covariance matrix of the random error until the criterion of convergence is met moreover the value of price index α p is set as the initial value for the price aggressors b p for detailed estimation processes please refer to poi 2012 or suárez varela 2020 2 3 2 submodule for information diffusion simulation the information diffusion process could be simulated as the information exchange in a social network with specific topological features barabasi and albert 1999 bianconi and barabasi 2001 in the social network model resident agents interact and exchange water conservation information with each other this study adopts the local world fitness evolving network model li and chen 2003 to represent the information diffusion in our study region compared to other commonly applied models such as small world networks watts and strogatz 1998 and scale free networks barabasi and albert 1999 the local world fitness evolving network introduces a regional clustering attachment mechanism to allow an agent to have uneven connections with agents in different regions li and chen 2003 more specifically as an agent is more concerned about the water conservation condition in his her region his her social connections will be unevenly concentrated among agents in the same region moreover as residents tend to communicate with higher status peers residents attributes may also determine their connection density in this study the state variables including age income and education level are used to measure the magnitude of social connections between residents denote nodes in the network as residents and edges between the nodes as the interactions between residents the procedure of the local world fitness evolving network is given as follows barabasi and albert 1999 bianconi and barabasi 2001 li and chen 2003 a growth add a new node with m m0 edges and link the new node to m different nodes already present in the network at every time step starting with m0 nodes and e0 edges b preferential attachment select m nodes from the existing network which is referred to as the local world and add a new node with m edges which links to m nodes of the local world using a preferential attachment with probability defined at time step t by 7 local k i m m 0 t η i k i j local η j k j where η denotes the fitness of the residents η ηage ηincome ηedu where ηage is the ratio of age to the maximum age of the resident in the social network ηincome is the ratio of income to the maximum income of the resident in the social network and ηedu is the ratio of education level to the highest education level of the resident in the social network k is the degree of the node at time step t which refers to the number of other nodes connected to this node the small world network model is adopted as a structurally homogeneous wcn compared with our local world fitness evolving network model the general principle of the small world model follows the procedure proposed by watts and strogatz 1998 a starting from the rule diagram each node is connected to all of its neighbors up to some fixed range k to make a loop network with n points b adding edges randomly add an edge between randomly selected pairs of nodes with probability p where at most one edge exists between any two different nodes fig s6 of the supplementary material s 5 shows the general scheme of the growth procedures of the small world network and local world fitness evolving network 2 3 3 submodule for water conservation attitude evaluation agents would adjust their water conservation attitude by interacting with other agents and external environments the classic social impact theory is widely used to explore the decision process toward water conservation of agents latané 1981 this method has manifested a strong ability to specify the agents decision rules under the influence of their preferences external effects and opinions of their neighborhoods koutiva and makropoulos 2016 three attributes of the information exchange process are essential to

application of abm model lhasa city water system 3 1 study area lhasa 91 06 e 29 36 n is the capital of china s tibet autonomous region and is located in the middle of the qinghai tibetan plateau on the north side of the himalayan mountains liu et al 2018 the qinghai tibetan plateau known as the world s third pole is extremely sensitive and fragile to human activities and environmental changes che et al 2014 the gross domestic product gdp of lhasa has maintained a more than 8 annual increase since 1997 and reached 61 8 billion rmb in 2019 lhasa municipal bureau of statistics 2020 furthermore its resident population is nearly 1 million and the tourist arrivals have exceeded 20 million per year resulting in a significant burden on its water supply system lhasa municipal bureau of statistics 2020 the main city area of lhasa consists of seven sub districts central region eastern suburb northern suburb western suburb economic development zone liuwu new district and education center fig 6 social and economic development varies across regions due to the different development orientations and unbalanced development status the central region the eastern suburb and the northern suburb hereafter referred to as territory one t1 are historic old towns with completely inter connected wsns this part surrounds the potala palace and forms the main urban area of lhasa accounting for more than 60 of residents in lhasa city chen et al 2018 bidr 2015 the western suburb hereafter referred to as territory two t2 is currently a sub center of urban concentration with convenient transportation for over 30 000 residents bidr 2015 liuwu new district hereafter referred to as territory three t3 is a high tech industrial development zone located on the south bank of the lhasa river liuwu new district management committee 2019 bidr 2015 the education center hereafter referred to as territory four t4 will be a new urban area dominated by school construction bidr 2015 the economic development zone hereafter referred to as territory five t5 is the only state level economic and technological developing zone in tibet lhasa economic development zone management committee 2020 this zone is planned to attract young people with working positions lhasa economic development zone management committee 2020 the geographical locations of different regions of lhasa city are illustrated in fig 6 and the characteristics of the residents are shown in table 1 groundwater is the primary water source of lhasa because of its good quality and easy exploitation however the groundwater tables show declining trends with an average rate of 1 17 m per 10 years derived from intensive water pumping in recent years zhang 2020 at the site of waterwork groundwater extraction much more significant regional depressions of groundwater tables or even descent funnels are observed zhang 2020 the city has seven waterworks i e yaowangshan waterworks eastern suburb waterworks northern suburb waterworks western suburb waterworks liuwu waterworks xianduo waterworks and dongga waterworks these waterworks are developed based on the location of groundwater sources and are responsible for the corresponding demand sites wsns among different waterworks are not completely connected because of the timing of infrastructure construction and the long distances between different water sources for example the yaowangshan waterwork was built in the 1980s the unique spatial fragmentation of waterworks and water distribution networks reinforces the social segregation of residents providing a perfect case to analyze the complex interactions of wsn and wcn and assess the influence of their structural heterogeneity on residents behaviors and the emergence of water conservation behaviors the corresponding water demand sites of each waterwork are presented in table 2 3 2 implementation and initial parameterization resident agents initial parameters are assigned in table 1 assuming that the agent annual disposable income follows the normal distribution the mean value of such a distribution is listed in table 1 and the standard diversion is set to 0 3 times the mean value according to liao et al 2017 the life expectancy of residents is set to be 68 and increases by one year old for every five years the state council of the people s republic of china 2015 the initial water conservation ratio is assumed to be 25 and the positive water conservation residents are randomly allotted to have low middle or high conservation levels residents with low middle or high conservation levels are assumed to reduce their water demand by 10 20 and 30 respectively additionally the population and residents income growths are assumed to follow logistics models feng et al 2019 calibrated by the historical data from 1998 to 2015 based on results from a field survey rakib et al 2019 urban population and income growth will be curbed under the effects of water shortages each sub district s population and residents income growth rate are assumed to be determined by the following equations 11 r t p o p r 0 p o p 1 0 3 r i w s 12 r t e c o r 0 e c o 1 0 3 r i w s where r0 pop denotes the ideal growth rate of the population r0 eco is the ideal growth rate of residents income ri ws is the water shortage ratio ri ws 0 when yt s ri ws yt s s when yt s yt is the water demand at year t s is the water supply capacity for the parameterization of submodules the disposal income and expenditure structure data the expenditure is divided into eight categories such as food clothes and service according to the statistical norms of lhasa from 2000 to 2014 are collected to calibrate the quaids model eight budget share equations equation 1 are established and the seemingly unrelated regression sur method is applied to calibrate the model poi 2012 suárez varela 2020 the values of parameters in the local world fitness network are m0 e0 3 m 10 and m 3 see equation 7 based on the property of the local world evolving network established by li and chen 2003 the value of β and α is set to be 2 following latané 1981 by the social impact model the strength of the interaction impact decreases with the increase in social distance the social distance di j is estimated by the shortest path length between two nodes i and j in the social network calculated by the floyd algorithm floyd 1962 finally the parameter t see equation 8 9 is assumed at 10 initially koutiva and makropoulos 2016 and its influence on the adoption of water conservation behavior is analyzed to investigate the relationships between individual decision patterns and social interaction intensity galán et al 2009 the initial water price is set as 1 rmb per cubic meter people s government of lhasa municipality 2014 the available water supply of each region is determined by the water supply capacity of the corresponding waterworks illustrated in table 2 multi year average recharge and et are incorporated as hydrological inputs to drive the modflow model the proportion of domestic water demand to total water demand is calibrated by historical data on domestic water demand and total water demand from 2010 to 2018 in addition following page et al 2014 the tourists per capita water demand is simplified to be 1 7 times the average residents water demand the travel time of tourists is randomly set to a value between 1 and 7 days we further assume that the annual number of tourists follows the law of a logarithmic function fitted by historical data balli et al 2019 and is distributed to each sub district assuming a consistent tourist resident ratio at different sub districts the models run from 2010 to 2045 and a time step of one year is adopted as the long term water demand dynamics rather than seasonal behavioral variations are focused and captured by the abm framework moreover relatively insignificant seasonality of water demand is reported by the historical water distribution data of waterworks 50 63 in the summer period i e june september and 49 37 in the winter period i e october march see fig s7 of the supplementary material s 6 for detailed monthly water distribution data of waterworks we conducted the modflow model to analyze the groundwater dynamics for lhasa city in a yearly time step as detailed in supplementary material s 1 all multi agent modeling processes are conducted and compiled in a fortran language environment on the intel visual fortran ivf platform 3 3 performance measures of abm with structurally heterogeneous wsn and wcn in abm studies it is important to demonstrate the reliability of the developed model ideally in water supply and demand studies one would validate the abm behavior rule against individual level domestic water demand data however individual level data is usually hard to obtain especially in lhasa city because of the stringent regulation and the ongoing absence of water meters in households bidr 2015 an alternative approach would be to validate the abm model structure and system level simulation results which can be considered proxies of real world agent behaviors du et al 2017a yang et al 2019 such abm validation procedures typically consider two aspects as suggested by aghaie et al 2020 structure validation which refers to the agreement of conceptual structure and outcome validation which refers to the agreement of system level outputs for the structure validation we ensure that the model follows validated theories including the estimation of residents basic water demand yuan et al 2014 suárez varela 2020 the opinion diffusion approach berglund 2015 hu et al 2020 and the assessment of conservation behaviors koutiva and makropoulos 2016 pouladi et al 2019 moreover historical data is used for submodule parameterization which guarantees the validity of the model s assumptions and structure the adoption of validated theories and calibrated parameters guarantees the model s rationality and accuracy and exempts the equifinality issue as for the outcome validation the simulated output is verified with historical annual water demand data from 2010 to 2018 the model performance is evaluated by the root mean square error rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the rmse measures model accuracy in terms of deviations between simulations and observations pouladi et al 2019 and the nse measures the deviation of the residual variance compared to the observation nash and sutcliffe 1970 13 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i o b s y i s i m 2 14 nse 1 i 1 n y i o b s y i s i m 2

performs well in reproducing the historical water demand data fig 7 it has a relatively low rmse 0 54 106 m3 and a relatively high nse 0 96 the groundwater model for this study was calibrated and validated with monthly groundwater level data of 8 gauging stations from 2013 to 2015 the calibration validation periods and the model fits achieved by the groundwater model are shown in fig s5 and table s3 of the supplementary material s 2 3 4 scenario analysis two scenarios are employed for comparative analysis to explore the effects of the heterogeneous structure and the interrelation of wsn and wcn on the spatio temporal dynamics of domestic water demand and groundwater tables each scenario is defined by a set of rules to specify the characteristics of the wsn and wcn in the heterogeneous scenario scenario i the wsn consists of seven pumping wells and incompletely connected distribution networks of the seven waterworks and water prices are regionally derived based on pumping cost the wcn is locally and heterogeneously connected following the local world fitness network the homogeneous scenario scenario ii is developed in contrast with scenario i to confirm the limitations of the structurally homogeneous assumptions applied in many previous studies in this scenario the wsn consists of a virtual lumped pumping surface from the aquifer and fully connected distribution networks and the global water price is derived from the average pumping cost of the whole study area the wcn is globally and homogeneously connected following the small world network the values of the small world network parameters are k 2 and p 0 1 and the adding edge process is repeated until the average degree reaches about 3 for consistency with the degree of the established local world fitness network in this study the effects of different structures of wsn and wcn on urban water systems are measured by four indicators 1 domestic water demand m3 2 the depth to water table dwt m and 3 water conservation ratio 4 results first we report results on water demand and groundwater table provided by the hybrid framework sections 4 1 and 4 2 then we analyze the heterogeneous water conservation behaviors of residents across different regions and different income levels so as to understand the effects of network structure on water system dynamics sections 4 3 and 4 4 finally we explore the spatial dependency properties and sensitivity of water system under the effects of different network structures sections 4 5 and 4 6 4 1 dynamics of water demand the simulated annual water demands over 2010 2045 in lhasa city and the five sub districts under scenarios i and ii are given in fig 8 generally the domestic water demand presents an increasing trend over time in both scenarios moreover water demand under the homogeneous scenario is relatively higher than that under the heterogeneous scenario around 2022 which implies an overestimation of water demand under the homogeneous scenarios however the water demand expansion paths vary across the five sub districts the overestimation of water demand under the homogeneous scenario tends to enlarge progressively initially decline over time and finally almost no longer exist for the new urban regions t2 t4 and t5 where water supply capacities are relatively large in contrast a continued water demand overestimation under the homogeneous scenario is observed in the old urban districts t1 and t3 where water supply capabilities are relatively limited furthermore the emergence of the equilibrium status of water supply and demand is asynchronous across different territories under the heterogeneous scenario which is as early as 2020 for the old urban districts t1 and t3 and as late as 2035 for the new ones t2 t4 and t5 conversely water shortage co occurs in all five sub districts around 2025 under the homogeneous scenario due to the absence of the regionality of water supply the divergent water demand expansion patterns and asynchronous supply demand equilibrium status suggest the existence of compensatory water supply from regions with high water supply potential t2 t4 and t5 to regions with low water supply potential t1 and t3 under the assumption of fully connected wsn by the homogeneous scenario therefore the analysis of the main characteristics of water demand evolution for both lhasa city and its five sub districts reveals the overestimation of water demand caused by the structurally homogeneous assumption with the ignorance of regional heterogeneity 4 2 dynamics of groundwater table the previous analyses have focused on the spatially heterogeneous impacts of the structures of wsn and wcn on water demand dynamics this section assesses the influence of structurally heterogeneous networks temporal dynamics on the aquifer using the average depth to water table dwt at waterworks in the five territories as typical examples fig 9 a e show how the groundwater table responds to different structures of wsn and wcn at the five territories generally the groundwater table manifests declining trends over time in both scenarios however the heterogeneous scenario shows more significant declining trends in the groundwater table than the homogeneous scenario suggesting that lumping distributed pumping wells significantly underestimates the regional groundwater table decline this result confirms the regional groundwater drop observed in lhasa city which is consistent with previous studies liu 2020 zhang 2020 furthermore it is noticed that the dynamics of the average dwt significantly vary across territories under the heterogeneous scenario for example the groundwater table of t1 has active responses to water extraction in comparison negligible change in dwt is observed in t3 and t5 the results indicate that homogeneous simplification of the structures of the wsn and wcn will more significantly underestimate the groundwater table decline in t1 than in t3 and t5 this diversity can be attributed to the difference in groundwater recharge rates of the territories waterworks which is further attributed to the difference in distance to the lhasa river fig 6 in comparison the insignificant variance of the average dwt at the five territories under the structurally homogeneous assumption suggests the ignorance of spatial variability in groundwater dynamics moreover the dynamics of the average dwt under scenario ⅰ can be categorized into two representative temporal dynamic patterns firstly the underestimation of the average dwt by the homogeneous scenario tends to enlarge initially and reaches stability around 2020 fig 9f the old urban districts t1 and t3 secondly the underestimation of dwt by the homogeneous scenario tends to enlarge initially and reaches stability around 2035 fig 9f the new urban districts t2 t4 and t5 this diversity is derived from the discrepancy in the water supply potential of the five sub districts under the heterogeneous scenario with earlier occurrences of supply demand equilibrium status in t1 and t3 fig 8 these results illustrate that not only spatial variability but also temporal variability in groundwater dynamics is disregarded under the structurally homogeneous assumption 4 3 heterogeneous water conservation behavior of residents across different regions this section examines the agents micro behavioral patterns to support the emergences of water conservation and groundwater table decline analyzed in previous sections fig 10 shows the water conservation ratios of the five sub districts under both the heterogeneous and homogeneous scenarios increasing trends in the water conservation ratio are observed in all five districts under both scenarios however the dynamics of the water conservation ratio follow discrepant trajectories under the two scenarios firstly the mean value of the conservation ratio is relatively higher under the homogeneous scenario 0 811 than that under the heterogeneous scenario 0 707 this result reveals that the residents conservation attitudes may be overestimated under the structurally homogeneous hypothesis which explains the slightly lower water demand before 2020 under scenario ii fig 8 secondly we find that the water conservation behavior varies more significantly across the five sub districts under the heterogeneous scenario than that under the homogeneous scenario the old urban districts t1 and t3 get a higher conservation ratio and the new urban districts t2 t4 and t5 get a lower conservation ratio with a 13 year difference between the earliest and latest sub districts to reach a water conservation ratio of 0 8 in contrast the increasing tendency of the water conservation ratio is similar across the five sub districts under the homogeneous scenario and the time span for reaching the 0 8 water conservation ratio is narrowed to 6 year the convergence of water conservation behavior across sub districts under the homogeneous scenario emerges from the uniform information diffusion approaches and simultaneous water deficiency suggesting that the structurally homogeneous assumption neglects the spatial differentiation of agents behaviors among the five sub districts 4 4 heterogeneous water conservation behavior of residents with different income levels the water conservation ratios of residents across different income groups under the two scenarios are presented in fig 11 generally the average water conservation ratio under the homogeneous scenario is greater than that of the heterogeneous scenario this result implies a similar overestimation of the water conservation ratio by different income groups under the homogeneous scenario compared to the heterogeneous scenario however a relatively lower mean value of the water conservation ratio from the high income level is observed under both scenarios which implies that residents with higher income levels are less likely to adopt water conservation behaviors this result can be attributed to the relative insensitivity to external influences of high income groups owing to their resistance to change moreover the overestimation becomes more significant for the higher income groups than the lower income groups there is a 9 6 overestimation for the high income group and a 6 1 overestimation for the low income group this uneven degree of overestimation indicates that the lower income groups are prone to adopt water conservation behavior derived from more efficient information diffusion under the homogeneous scenario 4 5 regional spillover effects of water conservation behavior understanding the information diffusion mechanism among end users in the five sub districts is highly relevant to measuring water demand and the regional dependence of water demand behaviors accordingly 10 year time series 2015 2024 of water demand and water conservation ratio of each sub district under both scenarios are selected to assess the effects of information diffusion on the distribution characteristics of water demand behaviors as illustrated in fig 12 under the heterogeneous scenario since the water shortage occurs at t1 and t3 in 2019 decreasing trends in water demand and increasing trends in water conservation ratio are observed in all five sub districts while such changes in t1 and t3 are expected as the local water shortage naturally leads to lower water demand and higher water conservation ratio similar changes in t2 t4 and t5 where water is relatively abundant can only be explained by the diffusion of water shortage information from t1 and t3 these results thus suggest that water conservation behaviors could occur in water abundant regions under the influence of users in water scarce regions by an interrelated structurally heterogeneous wsn wcn system the diffusion of non conservation behavior from water abundant regions to water scarce regions is not observed because the water conservation ratio increases progressively after 2019 by water deficiency however as shown in fig 12b the water conservation ratio difference between 2018 and 2023 in water abundant sub districts t2 t4 and t5 with an average of 12 is not as high as that ratio in water scarce sub districts t1 and t3 which is 20 this disparity indicates that the inter regional information exchange is not as intensive as the intra regional information exchange and this uneven diffusion of information leads to divergent growth patterns in water demand across the five sub districts in contrast convergent increasing patterns of water demands are observed among the five sub districts under the homogeneous scenario the convergent trajectories of water demand across the five sub districts under the structurally homogeneous assumption indicate the existence of spatial homogeneity and dependency of water demand patterns 4 6 sensitivity analysis of groundwater table to water conservation behavior to be effective the simulation of urban water systems under structurally heterogeneous wsn and wcn should deal with uncertainty a key task is to assess their performance over a range of social behavioral conditions we investigate the impact of three different influencing factors on the dynamics of δdwt the change of dwt over time at two waterworks yaowangshan waterworks in t1 and western suburb waterworks in t2 under the heterogeneous scenario the two waterworks are selected to represent districts with low t1 and high t2 water supply potentials respectively fig 8 moreover each of these factors has its way of influence initial water conservation ratio c sets up the initial characteristic of residents and a lower value of c means weaker water conservation influence from neighbors social temperature t sets up the average volatility of residents higher volatility suggests higher stochasticity in choosing the water conservation attitude which reflects the behavioral pattern of agents lower values of t mean that agents behavior is highly likely to be maintained under the influences of the external environment and other agents the local scale of the local world fitness network m sets up the interaction patterns among residents with weaker inter regional interactions at lower values of m the sensitivity analysis is conducted by varying the values of one of the three factors and keeping the other parameters fixed the temporal dynamics of δdwt with the changes in these factors are shown in fig 13 firstly the impact of initial water conservation ratio c is intuitive as its increase leads to lower water demand and thus lower δdwt the groundwater table under different values of c will eventually converge as a result of the feedback between water scarcity and water conservation fig 13a secondly the effects of social temperature t manifest dissimilar patterns with a higher t leading to a lower δdwt in 2020 the groundwater table under different values of t rapidly diverges initially and eventually converges over time fig 13b the initial lower δdwt under a high t attributes to the stochastic adoption of water conservation behavior of certain agents due to their high volatility in adopting water conservation attitude however δdwt at a high t t 50 gradually surpasses that at a low t by 2035 mostly due to the limited influence of the external environment or other agents on the water conservation behavior of individuals besides δdwt is relatively higher at an extremely low value of t e g t 5 by 2035 than high values of t t 10 and 25 because of weak water conservation promotion from other agents by low water conservation ratio in 2020 thirdly lower δdwt is observed under higher values of m fig 13c under which water conservation attitudes among residents are diffused more effectively meanwhile different from the sensitivity analysis result of the other two factors the sensitivity analysis of m witnesses an expanding range in δdwt from 2020 to 2035 these dissimilar trajectories arise from the disparate inter regional information diffusion intensities under different m a higher value of m leads to a lower level of social network fragmentation and a higher level of inter regional interaction and hence more efficient information diffusions from water scarce sub districts t1 with the yaowangshan waterworks to water abundant sub districts t2 with the western suburb waterworks as well as a decline in water demand and δdwt at waterworks in water abundant sub districts furthermore the discrepant δdwt derives from changes in agents water conservation behaviors under the influence of these factors lower δdwt under high values of c t and m results from the higher adoption proportion of water conservation behavior and later occurrence of the equilibrium status of water supply and demand divergent δdwt of the two waterworks under low values of m illustrates heterogeneous water conservation behaviors across different regions derived from the high level of social network fragmentation the above results thus show the complex influence of network structural heterogeneity on urban water systems future practitioners should be aware of the uneven effects of uncertainty on the structurally heterogeneous system 5 discussion 5 1 mechanisms of water demand overestimation derived by homogeneous hypothesis this study aims to explore the effects of structural heterogeneity in urban wsn and wcn and their interactions on the dynamics of water demand and groundwater tables our results suggest that the commonly adopted homogeneous based framework overestimates domestic water demand fig 8 in lhasa city and its five individual sub districts these findings are consistent with previous practices of water resources planning in lhasa where water demand was overestimated lhasa municipal bureau of statistics 2010 indicating the homogeneous based framework is not appropriate for designing reasonable and practical urban water management policies a possible explanation for these overestimations may be associated with an overestimated water supply potential for water scarce sub districts indicated by low supply demand ratios under the inaccurate assumption of well connected wsn the explanation is consistent with duan et al 2019 s findings which reported that the enhancement of regional water connectivity could significantly buffer the potential stress escalations secondly the spatially lumping method in building wcns i e water end users in the five sub districts as a whole community ignores the impact of dma borders or other spatial constraints on water conservation opinion exchange the explanation is in accordance with recent studies which showed that people residing in water deficient areas are more likely to adopt water conservation behaviors than those living in non deficient areas rodriguez sanchez and sarabia sanchez 2020 gonzales and ajami 2019 moreover water demand overestimation driven by the ignorance of the structural heterogeneity of wcn may partly be explained by stein et al 2011 s findings which suggest that linkages between communities are markedly sparser than the linkages within the communities 5 2 effects of regional dependence on water conservation behavior our results manifest that the increasing tendency of water demand will be curbed by local district water shortage and the diffusion of water shortage information among districts fig 12 the water shortage in one area leads to the conservation behavior in other areas which means the existence of spatial spillover effects fig 12 these spillover effects corroborate the findings of previous works in water use patterns franczyk and chang 2009 regional water demand avni et al 2015 and water resources governance stein et al 2011 for instance franczyk and chang 2009 found that regional water use patterns depend on their geographical locations and interactions with adjacent regions interestingly water conservation behaviors display spatial spillover effects from water scarce sub districts to water abundant sub districts which is not observed under the homogeneous based framework our results suggest that imbalanced water conservation willingness and uneven information diffusion lead to uneven spatial spillover effects in the five sub districts the topological structure of wcn affects the intensity of spillover effects and the spillover effect is stronger when the wcn is less structurally heterogeneous fig 13 these spatial relationships further expand the findings of areal et al 2012 who asserted that spatial dependence in technical efficiency might result from farmers imitation with each other nevertheless the spatial spillover effects have not been previously described as drivers or barriers to adopting water conservation behavior addo et al 2018 on the other hand our results suggest that the spillover effects are not strong enough to eliminate regional variance there are some similarities between the results of ours and jill et al 2020 who reported that water shortage at the farm locations induced a decline of technical efficiency by 12 while that for adjacent farms with no water shortage is 4 to achieve sustainable urban water resources management spatial dependency and spillover effects need to be better understood and accounted for in water demand modeling our research extends the knowledge regarding the evolution mechanisms of water demand associated with structural heterogeneity and interactions between wsn and wcn 5 3 limitations and potential of the agent based framework in this study we skipped the effects of climate change and management strategy on the water supply system future studies may incorporate multidimensional driving factors by the water supply side to yield holistic dynamics of water supply and demand secondly this study simplified the formalization of the tpb model following koutiva and makropoulos 2016 future studies can quantify the parameters via questionnaires and statistical methods to enhance reliability pouladi et al 2019 thirdly the water demand of tourists is estimated at an annual time step while the number of tourists is highly seasonal calianno et al 2018 extending the model to a finer temporal resolution would improve the accuracy but it may face difficulties accessing detailed behavioral data and additional uncertainties despite the above limitation the bottom up methodology developed by this study helps explore the structurally heterogeneous water system diverse factors including behavioral heterogeneity infrastructure availability and the structures of wsns and wcns can be incorporated into the decision making process thus the framework can provide an environment that yields insights into efficient and sustainable management policies for urban water resources and understands the growth mechanisms of water demand 6 conclusions in this study we develop an agent based framework to explore the effects of the structural heterogeneity and interrelation between wsn and wcn on the urban water systems by simulating residents behaviors and the dynamic interactions among residents and the environment the following conclusions are reached 1 homogeneous simplification of wsn and wcn tends to overestimate the water supply potential and demand while underestimating the groundwater table decline at pumping wells overestimation of water supply capacity results in an earlier occurrence of regional water shortages overestimation of water demand leads to unnecessary and excessive planning of infrastructures underestimation of uneven groundwater table declines yields descent funnels even subsidence during the planning and construction phase water sources planning and water distribution network connectivity should be strengthened to enhance water supply capacity and improve system robustness 2 asynchronous regional water demand expansion paths and inconsistent water supply demand equilibrium status are observed under the heterogeneous scenario in contrast a convergence of regional water demand expansion paths and consistent equilibrium status are detected with the homogenous hypothesis city level metrics under homogeneous simplification cannot describe regional variability and individual heterogeneity our results thus emphasize the importance of representing the structural heterogeneity and interactions of wsns and wcns within a bottom up modeling framework 3 consumers adoption of water conservation behavior is derived from the local water shortage and the diffusion of water shortage information from other districts positive spatial spillover effects of water conservation behaviors from water scarce regions to water abundant regions are detected while the spillover effects are not strong enough to eliminate regional variance due to the structurally heterogeneous wsn and wcn the proposed agent based framework is reasonable and efficient for modeling urban water systems by incorporating the structurally heterogeneous wsn and wcn however this study can only be taken as a simplified application of abm new research can be conducted with the designation of different structures of wsn and wcn to investigate the performance of management policy portfolios furthermore highly detailed empirical data about residents decision

2332,the urban water system involves complex interactions between physical and social factors such as physical infrastructures and information communications among these the water supply network wsn and water consumers network wcn are critical determinants of water supply and demand which are featured with prominent structural heterogeneity and interrelationships the structures of wsn and wcn have been traditionally modeled in isolation under the assumption of structural homogeneity this work proposes a new agent based modeling abm framework with a local world fitness network to explore the effects of structural heterogeneity and wsn wcn interrelationship on water supply demand dynamics a case study in lhasa reveals that the traditionally assumed fully connected water supply system and structurally homogeneous water user network may result in simultaneous overestimation of water demand and underestimation of inter region variances in water demand and groundwater table our analysis provides new insights into the disentanglement of the complex interdependencies of wsn and wcn and their associated structural heterogeneities which could be extended to the modeling of other complex and interrelated networks keywords urban water system agent based modeling structural heterogeneity and interrelationship coupled physical and social network lhasa city data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction accurate modeling of water supply demand dynamics is fundamental for municipal water supply infrastructure operation kanta and zechman 2014 demand management house peters and chang 2011 and the expansion of new water sources and water supply infrastructures xiao et al 2018 zheng et al 2013 especially under global climate change rapid urbanization and population growth certain regions face the risks of both shrinking water resources and expanding water demands gold et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 hence a deeper understanding of water supply demand dynamics becomes a pressing issue human behaviors regarding water supply and demand are affected by various physical socio economic and environmental drivers and the impacts of the above factors are usually intertwined with complex feedback addo et al 2018 aghaie et al 2020 tóth et al 2021 the agent based model abm is a bottom up modeling tool that derives the system level dynamics of a system from the individual decision of agents and their interactions with the environment berglund 2015 al amin et al 2018 the abm has been adopted by many researchers to simulate the behavioral mechanism and dynamic interactions of complex human natural systems berglund 2015 skardi et al 2021 du et al 2022 including the urban water supply demand system koutiva and makropoulos 2016 mashhadi ali et al 2017 rasoulkhani et al 2018 in urban water supply demand abm the physical infrastructure networks and water consumers social networks are critical in determining human behaviors haer et al 2016 haensch et al 2019 for instance the quality and quantity of delivered water may be compromised by the limited capacities of water supply infrastructures in extracting and distributing water shafiee et al 2018 skardi et al 2020 moreover consumers conservation behavior is strongly influenced by their interactions with consumer organizations such as property management hu et al 2015 or with other community members in their social network abrahamse and steg 2013 haensch et al 2019 the physical infrastructure networks and social networks are also interrelated for example the formation of a water consumer social network largely depends on the structure of the waterworks infrastructures frija et al 2017 mercure et al 2016 tóth et al 2021 a key difficulty in assessing agents behaviors and water demand lies in the disentanglement of the tightly coupled physical infrastructure networks and water consumers social networks as indicated by house peters and chang 2011 and corbella and sauri 2009 however previous studies tend to analyze the influence of physical or social networks in isolation du et al 2020 mashhadi ali et al 2017 rasoulkhani et al 2018 shafiee et al 2018 while researchers in the abm community emphasize the need to context human decision and social networks with feedback from the physical environment mercure et al 2016 an et al 2021 skardi et al 2021 tóth et al 2021 for simulating the physical networks graph theory or complex network techniques are used to investigate the relationship between the water distribution network structure and its performances e g redundancy connectivity and robustness yazdani and jeffrey 2012 duan et al 2019 moreover integrated numerical surface water groundwater models are incorporated to simulate the hydrological processes and water use under centralized or distributed water tax policies du et al 2020 du et al 2022 among notable findings in this area is the notion of the wsn s fragility to a few highly connected nodes also known as hubs albert et al 2000 yazdani and jeffrey 2012 more specifically the removal of the critical nodes hubs would lead to the breakdown of network connectivity hence cascading failures of network operation yazdani and jeffrey 2012 for simulating the social networks researchers use dynamic modeling approaches and opinion assessment models to investigate the influence of information diffusion on water conservation behavior in a water user s social network wcn information diffusion via a social network is suggested to be an essential driver in modeling individual decision making processes liu et al 2007 examples include analysis regarding the availability of water scarcity information chu et al 2009 galán et al 2009 stakeholders for the social learning diffusion skardi et al 2020 skardi et al 2021 the existence of social networks cheng et al 2019 and the diffusion scale of the network athanasiadis et al 2005 furthermore network density frija et al 2017 network connection strength tang et al 2013 and network structure e g the existence of property management hu et al 2015 or water user association wua cai and xiong 2017 qiao et al 2009 are recognized to be essential factors affecting water consumers behaviors frija et al 2017 revealed that better performances of water management policy are observed in areas with higher social density and higher centrality of water users associations tang et al 2013 found that a farmer with a closer connection to social networks with water shortage knowledge would be more likely to realize irrigation water scarcity and the need for water conservation to summarize the characteristics and structures of both wsn and wcn play an essential role in determining the behaviors of water users and their water demands another difficulty in assessing human behaviors and water demand lies in the structural heterogeneity of the interrelated wsns and wcns mercure et al 2016 du et al 2017b al amin et al 2018 yang et al 2019 the wsns are usually not evenly distributed over space among different jurisdictions within a municipality because wsns are generally operated with multiple water sources and divided into district metered areas dmas smith and ali 2006 uneven water extraction or groundwater table decline is typically noticed in multi sources wsns al amin et al 2018 du et al 2020 moreover if the wsns are not fully connected they may result in vastly different water prices or scarcities in different dmas and thus different levels of attention to water price or scarcity information for consumers located at different dmas however such complex interconnections between wsns and wcns are generally ignored skardi et al 2020 skardi et al 2021 furthermore residents interactions are also heterogeneous in that some users may interact with a large number of users while others interact with a limited number of users or even remain completely isolated berglund 2015 the spread of the water conservation information in such a structurally heterogeneous wcn thus becomes uncertain and uneven tóth et al 2021 although past decades have witnessed the adoption and comparison of different networks in assessing opinion dynamics of residential water users in the literature rasoulkhani et al 2018 the above structural heterogeneities are not explicitly investigated it is generally assumed that residents are uniformly distributed in the urban boundary and are linked to each other randomly without explicit spatial dependency anbari et al 2021 skardi et al 2021 furthermore a spatially uniform framework is commonly adopted by assuming a representative rational water user and a lumped water supply source koutiva and makropoulos 2016 rathnayaka et al 2017 such studies over simplified the opinion dynamics of water conservation in an actual water consumer network leading to unexpected and impractical results chen and zhou 2019 stein et al 2011 regional heterogeneities in wsns and wcns as well as their impact on water demands remain poorly understood du et al 2021 therefore a new simulation framework that accounts for the interactions of wsn and wcn and their structural heterogeneities is needed mercure et al 2016 this paper addresses this problem by proposing an integrative abm framework that realistically represents the groundwater processes water supply processes water conservation opinion dynamics and their interactions in an urban region two scenarios are compared to investigate the role of network heterogeneity in water demand dynamic simulation one with distributed sources disconnected local wsns and a structurally heterogeneous wcn the other with a lumped source a fully connected wsn and a structurally homogeneous wcn the abm framework is adopted to address the following issues i the interactions of wsn and wcn and ii the effects of structurally heterogeneous wsn and wcn on residents behaviors and the emergence of water conservation behaviors a key hypothesis is that the structural heterogeneity of wsns and wcns is necessary for accurately simulating the dynamics of water conservation and water demand in a typical urban water supply demand system in an era of rapid information sharing by the internet and smartphone this study provides a timely contribution to understanding water demand prediction and the social learning process of water conservation findings from this study would be beneficial for the demand management of urban water users and the long term planning of water supply infrastructures following this section 2 explains details about the abm framework and the associated simulation scenarios the model was developed and applied using a comprehensive set of data collected mainly by water utilities in lhasa city china detailed in section 3 the obtained results are shown in section 4 with extended discussions in section 5 finally section 6 concludes the paper and provides some suggestions 2 methodology 2 1 model overview following galán et al 2009 and mashhadi ali et al 2017 an agent based modeling framework is adopted to investigate the effects of structural heterogeneity and interrelationship of wsn and wcn on the spatio temporal dynamics of water demand and groundwater tables the structural heterogeneity of wsn denotes a distributed water supply system that consists of localized groundwater wells and disconnected water distribution networks fig 1 a that of wcn means a non uniform connection density among residents fig 1a conversely the structural homogeneity scenario implies a lumped groundwater well and a fully connected water distribution network fig 1b that of wcn means a uniform connection density among residents fig 1b different from previous studies with the assumption of evenly diffused water use restriction and water conservation information across regions galán et al 2009 berglund 2015 koutiva and makropoulos 2016 mashhadi ali et al 2017 this paper assumes that such information diffusion is uneven and usually localized this is because residents are primarily concerned about their local water supply information fig 1a which is structurally heterogeneous across regions in a disconnected water supply infrastructure system the general scheme of the hybrid abm framework is given in fig 2 the modeling framework consists of a water supply system and a water consumer system the waterworks play a crucial role in the water supply system by pumping water from the aquifer and delivering it to residents the aggregation over the water supply capacity of individual waterworks within the corresponding demand site defines the regional water supply capacity meanwhile the abm model estimates each resident agent s water demand by assessing their baseline water demand and the magnitude of water conservation the domestic water demand consists of individual and tourist water demand and the calculation of the latter is simplified as a constant ratio of the former the regional water shortage is specified by the deviation between regional water demand and water supply capacity moreover a modflow model is developed to couple the water extraction processes with the groundwater table the pumping cost measured with the pumping lift associated with the groundwater table simulated by the modflow model is integrated into the water price to investigate the impacts of regional water deficiency and water price on residents water demand the modeling of the water supply system and resident agents water use behaviors are detailed in the following sections 2 2 modeling of water supply system the water supply system involves the water extraction and distribution processes fig 3 the water distribution process simulates the mass balance of water distribution networks the regional water supply capacity is determined by the water supply capacity of the corresponding waterworks the water extraction process portrays the groundwater dynamics resulting from hydrological inputs and water extraction this study simulates the aquifer groundwater processes using the modular groundwater flow model modflow a finite difference groundwater flow simulation code harbaug 2005 modflow calculates the hydraulic head in each regular rectangular cell for each time step of various groundwater processes such as aquifer discharge and recharge unsaturated and saturated subsurface flow and surface water groundwater interactions harbaug 2005 the inputs of the modflow model are aquifer conditions including boundary conditions stream location permeability coefficient water yield and recharge coefficient recharge and evapotranspiration et and the pumping locations and pumping rate of waterworks the outputs of the modflow model are the groundwater table dynamics which measure the pumping cost and water prices as inputs to the abm simulation process modflow provides a robust tool to simulate groundwater tables under different distributions and amounts of water extractions more details about the modflow setups calibration and validation are available in the supplementary material 2 3 modeling of agents water use behaviors residents water use behavior is specified by their preferences and their interactions with other agents and the external environment as shown in fig 4 agent attributes and external environmental variables are listed in table s4 of the supplementary material s 3 four submodules are developed to model water use behaviors and estimate individual water demand of agents firstly the basic water demand estimation submodule is used to assess the basic water demand of residents with the input of water price information secondly residents water conservation behavior is simulated by the remaining three submodules specifically by using the information exchange simulation submodule the residents establish social networks with others based on population and their background characteristics such as income age and education level yuan et al 2014 kanta and zechman 2014 the water conservation attitude of resident agents is assessed in the water conservation attitude evaluation submodule with the inputs of regional water shortage status and external information via the social networks established by the information exchange simulation submodule the water conservation level assessment submodule evaluates the residents water conservation level by the inputs of water conservation attitude information residents with a negative water conservation attitude have a zero water conservation level and residents with a positive water conservation attitude would select one of the three water conservation levels i e low middle or high koutiva and makropoulos 2016 the individual water demand is obtained with the basic water demand estimated by the basic water demand estimation submodule and the water conservation level assessed by the remaining three submodules the water use behaviors of each resident are updated annually assuming that agents re evaluate their water demand and conservation attitude at the end of each year we further assume that the residents population and income growth follow the logistics model feng et al 2019 the income growth leads to higher basic water demand as measured by the quadratic almost ideal demand system quaids submodule and the population growth implies additional resident agents who consume water and join the social network to participate in information exchange besides the water shortage is recognized as a driver to hinder income growth while the low growth rate of income is a key factor in resident migration galán et al 2009 klabunde and willekens 2016 the regional water deficiency is specified by the difference between regional water demand and water supply capacity which in turn affects the population and income growth of residents galán et al 2009 mashhadi ali et al 2017 fig 4 furthermore the water price will increase in response to the increasing pumping cost and declining groundwater table with the expanding water demand du et al 2022 the price for using water thus consists of initial water price and additional pumping cost rothausen and conway 2011 i e pw pw i pw a which in turn affects the basic water demand and conservation behavior of residents four submodules are developed and coupled to simulate residents water demand and behaviors as detailed in the following section the development of this abm model follows the standard odd d protocol for abm müller et al 2013 and more details of the model description are presented in table s5 of the supplementary material s 4 2 3 1 submodule for basic water demand estimation the quadratic almost ideal demand system quaids is employed to simulate the basic water demand following banks et al 1997 the demand function applies a nonlinear relationship between the expenditure share devoted to water and total expenditure by regarding water as a kind of goods to specify the basic water demand chen and yang 2009 yuan et al 2014 the quaids model assumes the budget share of good i equals the sum of constant terms price terms linear total expenditure terms and quadratic total expenditure terms the following form defines the quaids model for the budget shares of ith goods of resident agents 1 w i α i j 1 k γ ij ln p j β i ln m a p λ i b p ln m a p 2 where i j 1 k denotes the type of goods consumed by agents wi is the budget share of ith goods that satisfies i 1 k w i 1 αi γij βi and λi are the parameters to be fitted pj is the price of jth goods m is the gross expenditure of agents the price and expenditure are expressed in the same monetary unit rmb α p is the price index given by equation 2 2 ln a p α 0 i 1 k α i ln p i 1 2 i 1 k j 1 k γ ij ln p i ln p j b p is the cobb douglas price aggregator 3 b p i 1 k p i β i the four parameters used in equation 1 are restricted by the following three properties additivity 4 i 1 k α i 1 i 1 k β i 0 i 1 k λ i 0 i 1 k γ ij 0 homogeneity 5 j 1 k γ ij 0 symmetry 6 γ ij γ ji j i j the additivity property implies that the sum of all expenditures on different goods is equal to total expenditures the homogeneity property denotes that the expenditure share of all goods remains constant if prices and revenues are magnified or reduced by the same multiplier and the symmetry property ensures that the compensated demand curve is symmetric to price banks et al 1997 the parameters involved in equation 1 could be estimated with regression methods fitted by the collected data in this study the seemingly unrelated regression sur method is adopted and performed using the stata statistical software stata version 12 0 poi 2012 suárez varela 2020 the random error terms in the quaids model are autocorrelated and measured by the sur method poi 2012 sur iteratively adjusts the parameters in equation 1 to minimize the covariance matrix of the random error until the criterion of convergence is met moreover the value of price index α p is set as the initial value for the price aggressors b p for detailed estimation processes please refer to poi 2012 or suárez varela 2020 2 3 2 submodule for information diffusion simulation the information diffusion process could be simulated as the information exchange in a social network with specific topological features barabasi and albert 1999 bianconi and barabasi 2001 in the social network model resident agents interact and exchange water conservation information with each other this study adopts the local world fitness evolving network model li and chen 2003 to represent the information diffusion in our study region compared to other commonly applied models such as small world networks watts and strogatz 1998 and scale free networks barabasi and albert 1999 the local world fitness evolving network introduces a regional clustering attachment mechanism to allow an agent to have uneven connections with agents in different regions li and chen 2003 more specifically as an agent is more concerned about the water conservation condition in his her region his her social connections will be unevenly concentrated among agents in the same region moreover as residents tend to communicate with higher status peers residents attributes may also determine their connection density in this study the state variables including age income and education level are used to measure the magnitude of social connections between residents denote nodes in the network as residents and edges between the nodes as the interactions between residents the procedure of the local world fitness evolving network is given as follows barabasi and albert 1999 bianconi and barabasi 2001 li and chen 2003 a growth add a new node with m m0 edges and link the new node to m different nodes already present in the network at every time step starting with m0 nodes and e0 edges b preferential attachment select m nodes from the existing network which is referred to as the local world and add a new node with m edges which links to m nodes of the local world using a preferential attachment with probability defined at time step t by 7 local k i m m 0 t η i k i j local η j k j where η denotes the fitness of the residents η ηage ηincome ηedu where ηage is the ratio of age to the maximum age of the resident in the social network ηincome is the ratio of income to the maximum income of the resident in the social network and ηedu is the ratio of education level to the highest education level of the resident in the social network k is the degree of the node at time step t which refers to the number of other nodes connected to this node the small world network model is adopted as a structurally homogeneous wcn compared with our local world fitness evolving network model the general principle of the small world model follows the procedure proposed by watts and strogatz 1998 a starting from the rule diagram each node is connected to all of its neighbors up to some fixed range k to make a loop network with n points b adding edges randomly add an edge between randomly selected pairs of nodes with probability p where at most one edge exists between any two different nodes fig s6 of the supplementary material s 5 shows the general scheme of the growth procedures of the small world network and local world fitness evolving network 2 3 3 submodule for water conservation attitude evaluation agents would adjust their water conservation attitude by interacting with other agents and external environments the classic social impact theory is widely used to explore the decision process toward water conservation of agents latané 1981 this method has manifested a strong ability to specify the agents decision rules under the influence of their preferences external effects and opinions of their neighborhoods koutiva and makropoulos 2016 three attributes of the information exchange process are essential to determine the conservation attitude of agents a the social strength or status of individuals b the physical or psychological distance between individuals and c the number of information sources latané 1981 the strength of social impact experienced by individuals can be represented by the following equation latané 1981 8 i i s i β o i h j 1 j i n s j o j o i d i j α where ii represents the amount of social pressure exerted upon resident agent i ii si represents agent i s influence or strength s 0 which is measured by the fitness value si η see equation 7 oi represents agent i s attitude 1 toward water conservation where 1 and 1 represent positive and negative attitudes respectively β represents an agent s resistance to change β 0 h represents the external influence h o m s m i o p s p i where om is the awareness of water shortage status which is always positive 1 smi is the strength of external influence regarding the magnitude of water shortage which is determined by the water shortage rate 0 op is the awareness of water price changes 1 op is positive if water prices increase and op is negative if water prices decrease spi is the strength of external influence regarding water price which is determined by water prices changes 0 di j represents the social distance between agents i and j di j 1 α represents the distance decay exponent α 1 n represents the total number of agents the probability of an agent adjusting his her attitude is calculated by equation 9 this equation is introduced to incorporate the volatility and the randomness assessed by the following equation kacperski and lyst 1999 9 o i t 1 o i t w i t h p r o b a b i l i t y exp i i t exp i i t exp i i t o i t w i t h p r o b a b i l i t y exp i i t exp i i t exp i i t where oi t represents the attitude 1 of agent i at time t t represents the average volatility of agents which is called social temperature t 0 a smaller t suggests the agents are more easily to maintain their opinions under the influence of social pressure conversely agents opinions tend to be unpredictable and randomized under higher t 2 3 4 submodule for water conservation level assessment based on the theory of planned behavior tpb ajzen 1991 the agents attitudes and subjective norms are supplemented by the perceived behavioral control and all together shape the intention toward water conservation behavior pouladi et al 2019 the attitude represents an agent s degree of positivity or negativity toward water conservation the subjective norm denotes the attitudes of external society and the perceived behavioral control describes the agent s perceived difficulty in performing water conservation practices koutiva and makropoulos 2016 the conceptual diagram of the model is shown in fig 5 items in equation 8 represent the influencing factors of the tpb model item siβ is assessed by residents characteristics and intention strength representing the perceived behavioral control factor item oih denotes the agent s opinions and the external environments such as water shortage status and water price item j 1 j i n s j o j o i d i j α denotes the influence of the neighborhood s opinions the two items together represent the agent s attitude and the subjective norm factors following koutiva and makropoulos 2016 the behavioral intention of residents behavior is evaluated with the probability of choosing each conservation level calculated by the following equations 10 p high c o n s e r v a t i o n l e v e l exp s i β o i h j 1 j i n s j o j o i d i j α s u m p low c o n s e r v a t i o n l e v e l exp s i β o i h j 1

agents selecting a water conservation behavior with a high level pmiddle conservation level represents the probability of the resident agents selecting a water conservation behavior with a middle level plow conservation level represents the probability of the resident agents selecting a water conservation behavior with a low level sum represents the function with a normalization factor for the probability distribution application sum exp s i β o i h j 1 j i n s j o j o i d i j α exp s i β o i h j 1 j i n s j o j o i d i j α exp s i β o i h j 1 j i n s j o j o i d i j α the behavioral intention of each resident agent is determined by the probabilities of each conservation level calculated by equation 10 agents behavioral intention leads to their specific water conservation behaviors i e low middle and high water conservation levels each water conservation level is regarded as a behavioral state representing a typical ensemble of water demand behavior states 3 application of abm model lhasa city water system 3 1 study area lhasa 91 06 e 29 36 n is the capital of china s tibet autonomous region and is located in the middle of the qinghai tibetan plateau on the north side of the himalayan mountains liu et al 2018 the qinghai tibetan plateau known as the world s third pole is extremely sensitive and fragile to human activities and environmental changes che et al 2014 the gross domestic product gdp of lhasa has maintained a more than 8 annual increase since 1997 and reached 61 8 billion rmb in 2019 lhasa municipal bureau of statistics 2020 furthermore its resident population is nearly 1 million and the tourist arrivals have exceeded 20 million per year resulting in a significant burden on its water supply system lhasa municipal bureau of statistics 2020 the main city area of lhasa consists of seven sub districts central region eastern suburb northern suburb western suburb economic development zone liuwu new district and education center fig 6 social and economic development varies across regions due to the different development orientations and unbalanced development status the central region the eastern suburb and the northern suburb hereafter referred to as territory one t1 are historic old towns with completely inter connected wsns this part surrounds the potala palace and forms the main urban area of lhasa accounting for more than 60 of residents in lhasa city chen et al 2018 bidr 2015 the western suburb hereafter referred to as territory two t2 is currently a sub center of urban concentration with convenient transportation for over 30 000 residents bidr 2015 liuwu new district hereafter referred to as territory three t3 is a high tech industrial development zone located on the south bank of the lhasa river liuwu new district management committee 2019 bidr 2015 the education center hereafter referred to as territory four t4 will be a new urban area dominated by school construction bidr 2015 the economic development zone hereafter referred to as territory five t5 is the only state level economic and technological developing zone in tibet lhasa economic development zone management committee 2020 this zone is planned to attract young people with working positions lhasa economic development zone management committee 2020 the geographical locations of different regions of lhasa city are illustrated in fig 6 and the characteristics of the residents are shown in table 1 groundwater is the primary water source of lhasa because of its good quality and easy exploitation however the groundwater tables show declining trends with an average rate of 1 17 m per 10 years derived from intensive water pumping in recent years zhang 2020 at the site of waterwork groundwater extraction much more significant regional depressions of groundwater tables or even descent funnels are observed zhang 2020 the city has seven waterworks i e yaowangshan waterworks eastern suburb waterworks northern suburb waterworks western suburb waterworks liuwu waterworks xianduo waterworks and dongga waterworks these waterworks are developed based on the location of groundwater sources and are responsible for the corresponding demand sites wsns among different waterworks are not completely connected because of the timing of infrastructure construction and the long distances between different water sources for example the yaowangshan waterwork was built in the 1980s the unique spatial fragmentation of waterworks and water distribution networks reinforces the social segregation of residents providing a perfect case to analyze the complex interactions of wsn and wcn and assess the influence of their structural heterogeneity on residents behaviors and the emergence of water conservation behaviors the corresponding water demand sites of each waterwork are presented in table 2 3 2 implementation and initial parameterization resident agents initial parameters are assigned in table 1 assuming that the agent annual disposable income follows the normal distribution the mean value of such a distribution is listed in table 1 and the standard diversion is set to 0 3 times the mean value according to liao et al 2017 the life expectancy of residents is set to be 68 and increases by one year old for every five years the state council of the people s republic of china 2015 the initial water conservation ratio is assumed to be 25 and the positive water conservation residents are randomly allotted to have low middle or high conservation levels residents with low middle or high conservation levels are assumed to reduce their water demand by 10 20 and 30 respectively additionally the population and residents income growths are assumed to follow logistics models feng et al 2019 calibrated by the historical data from 1998 to 2015 based on results from a field survey rakib et al 2019 urban population and income growth will be curbed under the effects of water shortages each sub district s population and residents income growth rate are assumed to be determined by the following equations 11 r t p o p r 0 p o p 1 0 3 r i w s 12 r t e c o r 0 e c o 1 0 3 r i w s where r0 pop denotes the ideal growth rate of the population r0 eco is the ideal growth rate of residents income ri ws is the water shortage ratio ri ws 0 when yt s ri ws yt s s when yt s yt is the water demand at year t s is the water supply capacity for the parameterization of submodules the disposal income and expenditure structure data the expenditure is divided into eight categories such as food clothes and service according to the statistical norms of lhasa from 2000 to 2014 are collected to calibrate the quaids model eight budget share equations equation 1 are established and the seemingly unrelated regression sur method is applied to calibrate the model poi 2012 suárez varela 2020 the values of parameters in the local world fitness network are m0 e0 3 m 10 and m 3 see equation 7 based on the property of the local world evolving network established by li and chen 2003 the value of β and α is set to be 2 following latané 1981 by the social impact model the strength of the interaction impact decreases with the increase in social distance the social distance di j is estimated by the shortest path length between two nodes i and j in the social network calculated by the floyd algorithm floyd 1962 finally the parameter t see equation 8 9 is assumed at 10 initially koutiva and makropoulos 2016 and its influence on the adoption of water conservation behavior is analyzed to investigate the relationships between individual decision patterns and social interaction intensity galán et al 2009 the initial water price is set as 1 rmb per cubic meter people s government of lhasa municipality 2014 the available water supply of each region is determined by the water supply capacity of the corresponding waterworks illustrated in table 2 multi year average recharge and et are incorporated as hydrological inputs to drive the modflow model the proportion of domestic water demand to total water demand is calibrated by historical data on domestic water demand and total water demand from 2010 to 2018 in addition following page et al 2014 the tourists per capita water demand is simplified to be 1 7 times the average residents water demand the travel time of tourists is randomly set to a value between 1 and 7 days we further assume that the annual number of tourists follows the law of a logarithmic function fitted by historical data balli et al 2019 and is distributed to each sub district assuming a consistent tourist resident ratio at different sub districts the models run from 2010 to 2045 and a time step of one year is adopted as the long term water demand dynamics rather than seasonal behavioral variations are focused and captured by the abm framework moreover relatively insignificant seasonality of water demand is reported by the historical water distribution data of waterworks 50 63 in the summer period i e june september and 49 37 in the winter period i e october march see fig s7 of the supplementary material s 6 for detailed monthly water distribution data of waterworks we conducted the modflow model to analyze the groundwater dynamics for lhasa city in a yearly time step as detailed in supplementary material s 1 all multi agent modeling processes are conducted and compiled in a fortran language environment on the intel visual fortran ivf platform 3 3 performance measures of abm with structurally heterogeneous wsn and wcn in abm studies it is important to demonstrate the reliability of the developed model ideally in water supply and demand studies one would validate the abm behavior rule against individual level domestic water demand data however individual level data is usually hard to obtain especially in lhasa city because of the stringent regulation and the ongoing absence of water meters in households bidr 2015 an alternative approach would be to validate the abm model structure and system level simulation results which can be considered proxies of real world agent behaviors du et al 2017a yang et al 2019 such abm validation procedures typically consider two aspects as suggested by aghaie et al 2020 structure validation which refers to the agreement of conceptual structure and outcome validation which refers to the agreement of system level outputs for the structure validation we ensure that the model follows validated theories including the estimation of residents basic water demand yuan et al 2014 suárez varela 2020 the opinion diffusion approach berglund 2015 hu et al 2020 and the assessment of conservation behaviors koutiva and makropoulos 2016 pouladi et al 2019 moreover historical data is used for submodule parameterization which guarantees the validity of the model s assumptions and structure the adoption of validated theories and calibrated parameters guarantees the model s rationality and accuracy and exempts the equifinality issue as for the outcome validation the simulated output is verified with historical annual water demand data from 2010 to 2018 the model performance is evaluated by the root mean square error rmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the rmse measures model accuracy in terms of deviations between simulations and observations pouladi et al 2019 and the nse measures the deviation of the residual variance compared to the observation nash and sutcliffe 1970 13 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i o b s y i s i m 2 14 nse 1 i 1 n y i o b s y i s i m 2

performs well in reproducing the historical water demand data fig 7 it has a relatively low rmse 0 54 106 m3 and a relatively high nse 0 96 the groundwater model for this study was calibrated and validated with monthly groundwater level data of 8 gauging stations from 2013 to 2015 the calibration validation periods and the model fits achieved by the groundwater model are shown in fig s5 and table s3 of the supplementary material s 2 3 4 scenario analysis two scenarios are employed for comparative analysis to explore the effects of the heterogeneous structure and the interrelation of wsn and wcn on the spatio temporal dynamics of domestic water demand and groundwater tables each scenario is defined by a set of rules to specify the characteristics of the wsn and wcn in the heterogeneous scenario scenario i the wsn consists of seven pumping wells and incompletely connected distribution networks of the seven waterworks and water prices are regionally derived based on pumping cost the wcn is locally and heterogeneously connected following the local world fitness network the homogeneous scenario scenario ii is developed in contrast with scenario i to confirm the limitations of the structurally homogeneous assumptions applied in many previous studies in this scenario the wsn consists of a virtual lumped pumping surface from the aquifer and fully connected distribution networks and the global water price is derived from the average pumping cost of the whole study area the wcn is globally and homogeneously connected following the small world network the values of the small world network parameters are k 2 and p 0 1 and the adding edge process is repeated until the average degree reaches about 3 for consistency with the degree of the established local world fitness network in this study the effects of different structures of wsn and wcn on urban water systems are measured by four indicators 1 domestic water demand m3 2 the depth to water table dwt m and 3 water conservation ratio 4 results first we report results on water demand and groundwater table provided by the hybrid framework sections 4 1 and 4 2 then we analyze the heterogeneous water conservation behaviors of residents across different regions and different income levels so as to understand the effects of network structure on water system dynamics sections 4 3 and 4 4 finally we explore the spatial dependency properties and sensitivity of water system under the effects of different network structures sections 4 5 and 4 6 4 1 dynamics of water demand the simulated annual water demands over 2010 2045 in lhasa city and the five sub districts under scenarios i and ii are given in fig 8 generally the domestic water demand presents an increasing trend over time in both scenarios moreover water demand under the homogeneous scenario is relatively higher than that under the heterogeneous scenario around 2022 which implies an overestimation of water demand under the homogeneous scenarios however the water demand expansion paths vary across the five sub districts the overestimation of water demand under the homogeneous scenario tends to enlarge progressively initially decline over time and finally almost no longer exist for the new urban regions t2 t4 and t5 where water supply capacities are relatively large in contrast a continued water demand overestimation under the homogeneous scenario is observed in the old urban districts t1 and t3 where water supply capabilities are relatively limited furthermore the emergence of the equilibrium status of water supply and demand is asynchronous across different territories under the heterogeneous scenario which is as early as 2020 for the old urban districts t1 and t3 and as late as 2035 for the new ones t2 t4 and t5 conversely water shortage co occurs in all five sub districts around 2025 under the homogeneous scenario due to the absence of the regionality of water supply the divergent water demand expansion patterns and asynchronous supply demand equilibrium status suggest the existence of compensatory water supply from regions with high water supply potential t2 t4 and t5 to regions with low water supply potential t1 and t3 under the assumption of fully connected wsn by the homogeneous scenario therefore the analysis of the main characteristics of water demand evolution for both lhasa city and its five sub districts reveals the overestimation of water demand caused by the structurally homogeneous assumption with the ignorance of regional heterogeneity 4 2 dynamics of groundwater table the previous analyses have focused on the spatially heterogeneous impacts of the structures of wsn and wcn on water demand dynamics this section assesses the influence of structurally heterogeneous networks temporal dynamics on the aquifer using the average depth to water table dwt at waterworks in the five territories as typical examples fig 9 a e show how the groundwater table responds to different structures of wsn and wcn at the five territories generally the groundwater table manifests declining trends over time in both scenarios however the heterogeneous scenario shows more significant declining trends in the groundwater table than the homogeneous scenario suggesting that lumping distributed pumping wells significantly underestimates the regional groundwater table decline this result confirms the regional groundwater drop observed in lhasa city which is consistent with previous studies liu 2020 zhang 2020 furthermore it is noticed that the dynamics of the average dwt significantly vary across territories under the heterogeneous scenario for example the groundwater table of t1 has active responses to water extraction in comparison negligible change in dwt is observed in t3 and t5 the results indicate that homogeneous simplification of the structures of the wsn and wcn will more significantly underestimate the groundwater table decline in t1 than in t3 and t5 this diversity can be attributed to the difference in groundwater recharge rates of the territories waterworks which is further attributed to the difference in distance to the lhasa river fig 6 in comparison the insignificant variance of the average dwt at the five territories under the structurally homogeneous assumption suggests the ignorance of spatial variability in groundwater dynamics moreover the dynamics of the average dwt under scenario ⅰ can be categorized into two representative temporal dynamic patterns firstly the underestimation of the average dwt by the homogeneous scenario tends to enlarge initially and reaches stability around 2020 fig 9f the old urban districts t1 and t3 secondly the underestimation of dwt by the homogeneous scenario tends to enlarge initially and reaches stability around 2035 fig 9f the new urban districts t2 t4 and t5 this diversity is derived from the discrepancy in the water supply potential of the five sub districts under the heterogeneous scenario with earlier occurrences of supply demand equilibrium status in t1 and t3 fig 8 these results illustrate that not only spatial variability but also temporal variability in groundwater dynamics is disregarded under the structurally homogeneous assumption 4 3 heterogeneous water conservation behavior of residents across different regions this section examines the agents micro behavioral patterns to support the emergences of water conservation and groundwater table decline analyzed in previous sections fig 10 shows the water conservation ratios of the five sub districts under both the heterogeneous and homogeneous scenarios increasing trends in the water conservation ratio are observed in all five districts under both scenarios however the dynamics of the water conservation ratio follow discrepant trajectories under the two scenarios firstly the mean value of the conservation ratio is relatively higher under the homogeneous scenario 0 811 than that under the heterogeneous scenario 0 707 this result reveals that the residents conservation attitudes may be overestimated under the structurally homogeneous hypothesis which explains the slightly lower water demand before 2020 under scenario ii fig 8 secondly we find that the water conservation behavior varies more significantly across the five sub districts under the heterogeneous scenario than that under the homogeneous scenario the old urban districts t1 and t3 get a higher conservation ratio and the new urban districts t2 t4 and t5 get a lower conservation ratio with a 13 year difference between the earliest and latest sub districts to reach a water conservation ratio of 0 8 in contrast the increasing tendency of the water conservation ratio is similar across the five sub districts under the homogeneous scenario and the time span for reaching the 0 8 water conservation ratio is narrowed to 6 year the convergence of water conservation behavior across sub districts under the homogeneous scenario emerges from the uniform information diffusion approaches and simultaneous water deficiency suggesting that the structurally homogeneous assumption neglects the spatial differentiation of agents behaviors among the five sub districts 4 4 heterogeneous water conservation behavior of residents with different income levels the water conservation ratios of residents across different income groups under the two scenarios are presented in fig 11 generally the average water conservation ratio under the homogeneous scenario is greater than that of the heterogeneous scenario this result implies a similar overestimation of the water conservation ratio by different income groups under the homogeneous scenario compared to the heterogeneous scenario however a relatively lower mean value of the water conservation ratio from the high income level is observed under both scenarios which implies that residents with higher income levels are less likely to adopt water conservation behaviors this result can be attributed to the relative insensitivity to external influences of high income groups owing to their resistance to change moreover the overestimation becomes more significant for the higher income groups than the lower income groups there is a 9 6 overestimation for the high income group and a 6 1 overestimation for the low income group this uneven degree of overestimation indicates that the lower income groups are prone to adopt water conservation behavior derived from more efficient information diffusion under the homogeneous scenario 4 5 regional spillover effects of water conservation behavior understanding the information diffusion mechanism among end users in the five sub districts is highly relevant to measuring water demand and the regional dependence of water demand behaviors accordingly 10 year time series 2015 2024 of water demand and water conservation ratio of each sub district under both scenarios are selected to assess the effects of information diffusion on the distribution characteristics of water demand behaviors as illustrated in fig 12 under the heterogeneous scenario since the water shortage occurs at t1 and t3 in 2019 decreasing trends in water demand and increasing trends in water conservation ratio are observed in all five sub districts while such changes in t1 and t3 are expected as the local water shortage naturally leads to lower water demand and higher water conservation ratio similar changes in t2 t4 and t5 where water is relatively abundant can only be explained by the diffusion of water shortage information from t1 and t3 these results thus suggest that water conservation behaviors could occur in water abundant regions under the influence of users in water scarce regions by an interrelated structurally heterogeneous wsn wcn system the diffusion of non conservation behavior from water abundant regions to water scarce regions is not observed because the water conservation ratio increases progressively after 2019 by water deficiency however as shown in fig 12b the water conservation ratio difference between 2018 and 2023 in water abundant sub districts t2 t4 and t5 with an average of 12 is not as high as that ratio in water scarce sub districts t1 and t3 which is 20 this disparity indicates that the inter regional information exchange is not as intensive as the intra regional information exchange and this uneven diffusion of information leads to divergent growth patterns in water demand across the five sub districts in contrast convergent increasing patterns of water demands are observed among the five sub districts under the homogeneous scenario the convergent trajectories of water demand across the five sub districts under the structurally homogeneous assumption indicate the existence of spatial homogeneity and dependency of water demand patterns 4 6 sensitivity analysis of groundwater table to water conservation behavior to be effective the simulation of urban water systems under structurally heterogeneous wsn and wcn should deal with uncertainty a key task is to assess their performance over a range of social behavioral conditions we investigate the impact of three different influencing factors on the dynamics of δdwt the change of dwt over time at two waterworks yaowangshan waterworks in t1 and western suburb waterworks in t2 under the heterogeneous scenario the two waterworks are selected to represent districts with low t1 and high t2 water supply potentials respectively fig 8 moreover each of these factors has its way of influence initial water conservation ratio c sets up the initial characteristic of residents and a lower value of c means weaker water conservation influence from neighbors social temperature t sets up the average volatility of residents higher volatility suggests higher stochasticity in choosing the water conservation attitude which reflects the behavioral pattern of agents lower values of t mean that agents behavior is highly likely to be maintained under the influences of the external environment and other agents the local scale of the local world fitness network m sets up the interaction patterns among residents with weaker inter regional interactions at lower values of m the sensitivity analysis is conducted by varying the values of one of the three factors and keeping the other parameters fixed the temporal dynamics of δdwt with the changes in these factors are shown in fig 13 firstly the impact of initial water conservation ratio c is intuitive as its increase leads to lower water demand and thus lower δdwt the groundwater table under different values of c will eventually converge as a result of the feedback between water scarcity and water conservation fig 13a secondly the effects of social temperature t manifest dissimilar patterns with a higher t leading to a lower δdwt in 2020 the groundwater table under different values of t rapidly diverges initially and eventually converges over time fig 13b the initial lower δdwt under a high t attributes to the stochastic adoption of water conservation behavior of certain agents due to their high volatility in adopting water conservation attitude however δdwt at a high t t 50 gradually surpasses that at a low t by 2035 mostly due to the limited influence of the external environment or other agents on the water conservation behavior of individuals besides δdwt is relatively higher at an extremely low value of t e g t 5 by 2035 than high values of t t 10 and 25 because of weak water conservation promotion from other agents by low water conservation ratio in 2020 thirdly lower δdwt is observed under higher values of m fig 13c under which water conservation attitudes among residents are diffused more effectively meanwhile different from the sensitivity analysis result of the other two factors the sensitivity analysis of m witnesses an expanding range in δdwt from 2020 to 2035 these dissimilar trajectories arise from the disparate inter regional information diffusion intensities under different m a higher value of m leads to a lower level of social network fragmentation and a higher level of inter regional interaction and hence more efficient information diffusions from water scarce sub districts t1 with the yaowangshan waterworks to water abundant sub districts t2 with the western suburb waterworks as well as a decline in water demand and δdwt at waterworks in water abundant sub districts furthermore the discrepant δdwt derives from changes in agents water conservation behaviors under the influence of these factors lower δdwt under high values of c t and m results from the higher adoption proportion of water conservation behavior and later occurrence of the equilibrium status of water supply and demand divergent δdwt of the two waterworks under low values of m illustrates heterogeneous water conservation behaviors across different regions derived from the high level of social network fragmentation the above results thus show the complex influence of network structural heterogeneity on urban water systems future practitioners should be aware of the uneven effects of uncertainty on the structurally heterogeneous system 5 discussion 5 1 mechanisms of water demand overestimation derived by homogeneous hypothesis this study aims to explore the effects of structural heterogeneity in urban wsn and wcn and their interactions on the dynamics of water demand and groundwater tables our results suggest that the commonly adopted homogeneous based framework overestimates domestic water demand fig 8 in lhasa city and its five individual sub districts these findings are consistent with previous practices of water resources planning in lhasa where water demand was overestimated lhasa municipal bureau of statistics 2010 indicating the homogeneous based framework is not appropriate for designing reasonable and practical urban water management policies a possible explanation for these overestimations may be associated with an overestimated water supply potential for water scarce sub districts indicated by low supply demand ratios under the inaccurate assumption of well connected wsn the explanation is consistent with duan et al 2019 s findings which reported that the enhancement of regional water connectivity could significantly buffer the potential stress escalations secondly the spatially lumping method in building wcns i e water end users in the five sub districts as a whole community ignores the impact of dma borders or other spatial constraints on water conservation opinion exchange the explanation is in accordance with recent studies which showed that people residing in water deficient areas are more likely to adopt water conservation behaviors than those living in non deficient areas rodriguez sanchez and sarabia sanchez 2020 gonzales and ajami 2019 moreover water demand overestimation driven by the ignorance of the structural heterogeneity of wcn may partly be explained by stein et al 2011 s findings which suggest that linkages between communities are markedly sparser than the linkages within the communities 5 2 effects of regional dependence on water conservation behavior our results manifest that the increasing tendency of water demand will be curbed by local district water shortage and the diffusion of water shortage information among districts fig 12 the water shortage in one area leads to the conservation behavior in other areas which means the existence of spatial spillover effects fig 12 these spillover effects corroborate the findings of previous works in water use patterns franczyk and chang 2009 regional water demand avni et al 2015 and water resources governance stein et al 2011 for instance franczyk and chang 2009 found that regional water use patterns depend on their geographical locations and interactions with adjacent regions interestingly water conservation behaviors display spatial spillover effects from water scarce sub districts to water abundant sub districts which is not observed under the homogeneous based framework our results suggest that imbalanced water conservation willingness and uneven information diffusion lead to uneven spatial spillover effects in the five sub districts the topological structure of wcn affects the intensity of spillover effects and the spillover effect is stronger when the wcn is less structurally heterogeneous fig 13 these spatial relationships further expand the findings of areal et al 2012 who asserted that spatial dependence in technical efficiency might result from farmers imitation with each other nevertheless the spatial spillover effects have not been previously described as drivers or barriers to adopting water conservation behavior addo et al 2018 on the other hand our results suggest that the spillover effects are not strong enough to eliminate regional variance there are some similarities between the results of ours and jill et al 2020 who reported that water shortage at the farm locations induced a decline of technical efficiency by 12 while that for adjacent farms with no water shortage is 4 to achieve sustainable urban water resources management spatial dependency and spillover effects need to be better understood and accounted for in water demand modeling our research extends the knowledge regarding the evolution mechanisms of water demand associated with structural heterogeneity and interactions between wsn and wcn 5 3 limitations and potential of the agent based framework in this study we skipped the effects of climate change and management strategy on the water supply system future studies may incorporate multidimensional driving factors by the water supply side to yield holistic dynamics of water supply and demand secondly this study simplified the formalization of the tpb model following koutiva and makropoulos 2016 future studies can quantify the parameters via questionnaires and statistical methods to enhance reliability pouladi et al 2019 thirdly the water demand of tourists is estimated at an annual time step while the number of tourists is highly seasonal calianno et al 2018 extending the model to a finer temporal resolution would improve the accuracy but it may face difficulties accessing detailed behavioral data and additional uncertainties despite the above limitation the bottom up methodology developed by this study helps explore the structurally heterogeneous water system diverse factors including behavioral heterogeneity infrastructure availability and the structures of wsns and wcns can be incorporated into the decision making process thus the framework can provide an environment that yields insights into efficient and sustainable management policies for urban water resources and understands the growth mechanisms of water demand 6 conclusions in this study we develop an agent based framework to explore the effects of the structural heterogeneity and interrelation between wsn and wcn on the urban water systems by simulating residents behaviors and the dynamic interactions among residents and the environment the following conclusions are reached 1 homogeneous simplification of wsn and wcn tends to overestimate the water supply potential and demand while underestimating the groundwater table decline at pumping wells overestimation of water supply capacity results in an earlier occurrence of regional water shortages overestimation of water demand leads to unnecessary and excessive planning of infrastructures underestimation of uneven groundwater table declines yields descent funnels even subsidence during the planning and construction phase water sources planning and water distribution network connectivity should be strengthened to enhance water supply capacity and improve system robustness 2 asynchronous regional water demand expansion paths and inconsistent water supply demand equilibrium status are observed under the heterogeneous scenario in contrast a convergence of regional water demand expansion paths and consistent equilibrium status are detected with the homogenous hypothesis city level metrics under homogeneous simplification cannot describe regional variability and individual heterogeneity our results thus emphasize the importance of representing the structural heterogeneity and interactions of wsns and wcns within a bottom up modeling framework 3 consumers adoption of water conservation behavior is derived from the local water shortage and the diffusion of water shortage information from other districts positive spatial spillover effects of water conservation behaviors from water scarce regions to water abundant regions are detected while the spillover effects are not strong enough to eliminate regional variance due to the structurally heterogeneous wsn and wcn the proposed agent based framework is reasonable and efficient for modeling urban water systems by incorporating the structurally heterogeneous wsn and wcn however this study can only be taken as a simplified application of abm new research can be conducted with the designation of different structures of wsn and wcn to investigate the performance of management policy portfolios furthermore highly detailed empirical data about residents decision making mechanisms derived from interviews or surveys can collaborate with socio economic theory to further enhance the abm s capacity to simulate water conservation behaviors credit authorship

2333,fiber optic active distributed temperature sensing fo adts experiments were performed on an aquifer thermal energy storage system ates site located on the university campus of bordeaux france the experiments consisted in heating the steel core of the fo cable while monitoring the rate of temperature increase during the heating periods the changes in temperature that were monitored through time at every depth under various hydraulic conditions and in different boreholes were used to evaluate both aquifer properties and wells conditions a first adts experiment was conducted under cross borehole configuration using a pumping well and a monitoring well separated by a distance of 8 5 meters then to check the reciprocity of the results a second experiment was conducted by switching the monitoring and the pumping well the results obtained through the use of analytical solutions for reproducing and interpreting the data lead to the following conclusions i adts can be used to estimate both thermal conductivity and darcy velocity distribution along boreholes crucial properties for ates performance ii the proposed method is a promising tool to detect clogging locations in the boreholes when it occurs this can be of great practical interest to maintain systems performance since once fo cables deployed experiments could be easily repeated without opening boreholes and stop the system operation keywords distributed temperature sensing groundwater flux thermal conductivity clogging ates data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction aquifer thermal energy storage ates is an open loop geothermal system involving at least two reversible boreholes fleuchaus et al 2018 this technology uses the subsurface as transient long term storage of cold and warm water and it gains more and more popularity with a great potential to reduce green house gas emissions of the building sector vanhoudt et al 2011 gao et al 2017 ghaebi et al 2017 schüppler et al 2019 stemmle et al 2021 ates performance is highly sensitive to hydrogeological conditions it requires good aquifer permeability to pump and inject water into the aquifer low natural groundwater flow to avoid stored energy losses due to advection and or thermal interaction between wells during system operation storage efficiency and energy recovery rate depend on the cold and warm thermal plumes extension bloemendal and hartog 2018 the spatiotemporal distribution of temperature is particularly impacted by aquifer heterogeneity especially regarding the groundwater flux and thermal properties distribution ferguson 2007 sommer et al 2013 bridger and allen 2014 ganguly and mohan kumar 2014 possemiers et al 2015 visser et al 2015 nguyen et al 2016 bloemendal and hartog 2018 ates performance also depends on wells sustainability which can be impacted by their aging among the main issues corrosion biological chemical and physical clogging are major problems which could lead to well damages and performance decrease fleuchaus et al 2018 bloemendal and olsthoorn 2018 the causes and consequences of the boreholes clogging are well documented for open loop systems bakema 2001 song et al 2020 a large clogging development is an additional source of geothermal system performance decrease quantification of the subsurface heterogeneity and the surveillance of clogging evolution in wells are therefore major concerns on ates site classically thermal and hydrodynamic properties of aquifers are characterized from laboratory measurements on core samples moreover some field surveys may be used in the context of ates characterization among these surveys pumping tests give an average value of aquifer transmissivity and specific storage their monitoring time ranges classically between 1 and 3 days and their well known interpretation provides a first overview of hydrogeological properties and context of a site kruseman and ridder 1994 flowmeter logs are suited to obtain the vertical flow distribution at a particular point and can provide information on fracture connectivity transmissivity and storativity distribution molz et al 1994 paillet 1998 roubinet et al 2015 these tests are simple to realize and can be performed in short time heat or solute tracer tests are used to investigate groundwater velocity thermal and hydraulic dispersivity or location of preferential groundwater paths bodin et al 2003 klepikova et al 2016 irvine et al 2015 but they are more difficult to realize and a robust interpretation could require a lot of observation points as well as comprehensive numerical modeling thermal response tests trt are used to estimate the average thermal conductivity of aquifers at the vicinity of the tested well but the data collection could require a long time beier et al 2011 dong et al 2022 finally cores collection is financially costly time consuming and their analysis provides only local information which could not be representative of the global in site aquifer dynamics sharqawy et al 2013 preventive actions to tackle clogging development include reduction in the frequency of pump starts and stops underground removal of iron avoiding possible oxygen infiltration or reduction of water turbidity and organic content nevertheless a certain clogging extension cannot be avoided during the recharge process thus leading to the decrease of geothermal system performance song et al 2020 surveillance of the clogging evolution is thus a major challenge for ates systems and developing adapted countermeasures on site could significantly help to maintain their performance recently a strategy was developed to follow its evolution gjengedal et al 2020 the surveillance procedure aims to conduct a step test with incremental increases in the groundwater flow rate while measuring the pressure and temperature responses in the system components nevertheless it does not focus on clogging locations in the well but gives an overall view of each component of the geothermal system production wells submersible pump and groundwater heat exchanger distributive thermal sensing with fiber optic cable fo dts opens a timely opportunity to improve our understanding of the functioning of ates systems this technology enables to collect efficiently long data set and to monitor dynamics process bense et al 2016 for geothermal application it was first used to monitor temperature variations along production boreholes hurtig et al 1996 dts methods have seen further improvements with the use of the active mode adts it consists on deploying a heat source in the well and monitoring the induced temperature changes bense et al 2016 the temperature elevation induced by the heat source and the subsequent cooling directly depends on thermal properties of the porous media and on water flux dissipating heat by advection among other it can be used to achieve enhanced thermal response test etrt to establish thermal conductivity profile for borehole heat exchanger bhe application freifeld et al 2008 huber and arslan 2012 vélez márquez et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 hakala et al 2022 furthermore the method proved its ability to measure groundwater flux distribution in the subsurface read et al 2014 bakker et al 2015 des tombe et al 2019 recent laboratory and field experiments demonstrate that analytical methods can be used to inspect the distribution of thermal conductivity and darcy velocity along a fiber positioning in saturated porous media simon et al 2021 del val et al 2021 these works enable the generalization of adts experiments interpretation apart from aquifer thermal properties the thermal conductivity profile established in a borehole could be also of major interest to inspect eventual low anomalies due to clogging development indeed the value of thermal conductivity for clogging materials such as bentonite clay or porous iron hydroxides provides a particular low signature useful for identification tang et al 2008 cho et al 2008 gjengedal et al 2020 dalla santa et al 2020 to our knowledge fo adts experiments in boreholes have never been performed with a purpose of detecting both clogging development and productive layers most of the experiments achieved in boreholes mainly focus on fractured zone identification la bernardie et al 2018 maldaner et al 2019 klepikova et al 2022 darcy velocity estimation selker and selker 2018 del val et al 2021 or aquifer thermal conductivity zhang et al 2020 hakala et al 2022 in this context a cross borehole adts experiment was carried out on a site located at the university of bordeaux in france and planned to be exploited by a new ates the test was realized under constant pumping rate condition and replicated in two different boreholes to verify the reciprocity of the data the main objectives were i to characterize the vertical distributions of thermal conductivity and darcy velocity in two different boreholes ii to reveal the preferential water pathways during injection iii to demonstrate the potential of adts to detect clogging area along well screens 2 experimental site 2 1 context the study area is located at the university of bordeaux pessac france fig 1a on the site of the ecole nationale superieure en environnement georessources et ingéniérie du developpement durable ensegid an ates system was designed to supply both cooling and heating to a new building of 3600 m2 the ates consists of a pair of 70 m deep reversible pumping injection wells gf1 hot well and gf2 cold well located 145 m apart fig 1b in addition to the production wells four piezometers pz51 pz101 pz52 and pz102 were created close to the main wells to monitor thermal plumes extension and to control piezometric heads piezometers pz101 and pz51 are used for the adts experiment they are separated by a distance of 8 5 m and located 6 0 m and 6 5 m apart from the ates hot production well gf1 they were drilled to 66 m and 70 m deep respectively our experiments were achieved 8 months before the beginning of ates operation located in the north aquitaine basin the experimental site corresponds to a large multi layered aquifer system the actual structure of this basin is the result of pyrenees retro foreland basin developed from the campanian to the miocene labat et al 2021 the local geology corresponds to the top of the system formed by a succession of sedimentary deposits during multiple transgression regression periods leading to a vertical heterogeneous sequences of limestone sandstone and clay from eocene to plio quaternary times larroque et al 2013 the proximal shore location of the site during oligocene period results in highly horizontally and vertically heterogeneous limestone deposits sztrákos and steurbaut 2017 a part of the oligocene formation composed by highly porous and permeable fossiliferous limestones constitutes the ates aquifer target around the experimental site the deep aquifer is confined as pointed out by seasonal artesianism near the surface level a 10 meters thick unconfined aquifer made of plio quaternary sand and clay deposits covers the oligocene formation at the site

highlight a heterogeneous limestone aquifer with a vertical and horizontal unequal distribution of incoming water fluxes the layer crossed between the depth of 40 60 m fig 2a is made of fossiliferous white limestone a developed porosity is identified from microscopic drill cuttings observation in this layer the pz51 gamma ray values fluctuate around an average of 25 0 cps which indicates a low clay content fig 2d the gf1 flowmeter reveals that the incoming water is located from the depth of 40 m to 55 m in this area a layer of 2 m thick between the depth of 44 m and 46 m produces about the half of the total discharge fig 2e another flowmeter realized in pz101 one year after the end of borehole works completion and before the beginning of ates operation indicates a more homogeneous flux distribution along this borehole fig 2e between the depth of 60 m and 67 m the drill cuttings observations emphasize gray limestones a less developed porosity and a significant clay content from 67 m to 71 m blue marl is encountered a mean transmissivity value of 7 0 10 4 m 2 s 1 is estimated from a two days pumping test in gf1 borehole camera inspections show the presence of clogging material in piezometers pz101 and pz51 fig 2f g and h from the depth of 35 m to 39 m the pz51 screens are totally clogged by a mix of yellow brown bentonite clay mud and white bio fouling bacteria fig 2f the screens are clean in the interval length 40 54 m the pz51 bottom is filled with clay and bentonite and encountered at the depth of 54 5 m instead of the 71 m initially drilled we believe that the main reason for the fast clogging is related to the fact that these wells are planned only for monitoring purpose as a consequence the piezometers were not sufficiently developed as for pz101 the screens are totally clogged by bentonite and mud from the depth of 35 m to 53 m fig 2 g below the depth of 53 m to the pz101 bottom at 60 m the screens are partially clogged fig 2h the clogged intervals of the piezometers are represented on the technical logs fig 2b and c 3 experiment and methodology 3 1 experimental set up adts experiments were conducted in pz101 and pz51 a loop of brusens fiber optic cable solifos fiber optic systems ag switzerland was lowered to their annular space it contains two multi mode fibers encased in a sealed stainless steel capillary and covered by wire rope and a pvc jacket fig 3a two electrical cables were connected to the steel armor of both fiber branches of the loop to allow the injection of electricity from a power controller these connections were further sealed by epoxy resin the induced temperature variation was monitored with a silixa xt dts unit reporting temperature every 25 cm at a 2 min sampling interval in pz51 and 1 min sampling interval in pz101 fig 3b in order to ensure contact with the porous media while deployed in the borehole each branch of the fo cable was slightly stretched and attached outside the polyvinyl chloride pvc tube every 3 m fig 3c this installation was similar to a previous study in 25 m depth boreholes del val et al 2021 for both piezometers 50 m of fo cable of each side of the loop remained outside the borehole for connection to the dts unit and for calibration purposes once the whole equipment installed the gravel pack was added down which embedded the fo cable in the gravel and prevented any cable shaking 3 2 temperature calibration process and dts spatial resolution during the experiment 10 m of each branch from sticking out cables were immersed into separate warm and cold calibration baths for temperature calibration purposes in order to cover the full range of temperatures that could be expected to be measured along the fiber optic cable the cold bath was filled with ice and the warm bath was equipped with a resistance to maintain water temperature at 31 c fig 3 the temperature was recorded in each bath with a pt100 probe 0 1 c accuracy and two rbr solot probes 0 002 c accuracy the temperature in both baths was homogenized with small aquarium bubblers the loop configuration of the fiber in the boreholes allowed to create a double ended connection providing accurate temperature measurements under field conditions van de giesen et al 2012 the python toolbox des tombe et al 2020 was used to check the quality of the dts measurement and indicated a good calibration of the temperature measured by the dts device the dts spatial resolution s r during the experience was estimated from the classical 90 step change tyler et al 2009 and the derivative method simon et al 2020 for pz101 the s r was estimated between 0 9 and 1 1 m as the sampling time s t was twice larger for pz51 experiment the s r was better and range from 0 7 to 0 9 m the s r of these experiments were more precise than the 2 3 m s r reported in the study of tyler et al 2009 and slightly less precise than the 0 5 0 9 m s r reported in the laboratory study of simon et al 2020 3 3 experiments proceedings the experiment was ran under cross borehole configuration it is a common practice for integrated aquifer characterization it is an efficient method to explain complex hydraulic behavior of aquifers and investigate preferential flow path in heterogeneous contexts butler and zhan 2004 le borgne et al 2006a b audouin and bodin 2008 brauchler et al 2010 lods et al 2020 aliouache et al 2021 this configuration is therefore of great interest to study thermal transfer by advection at the aquifer scale the cross borehole configuration was replicated into pz101 and pz51 to verify the reciprocity of the acquired data the reciprocity can be used to interpret the dynamic of the aquifers and highlights continuity or not of the hydraulic system hariga et al 2010 delay et al 2011 2012 marinoni et al 2016 sanchez vila et al 2016 the experiment started once the hydrodynamic pseudo steady state was reached the first stage consisted in heating the steel mantle of the fiber in the well pz101 with a constant injection rate of power p trough electrical cables controlled by the heat pulse power controller at the same time the neighboring piezometer pz51 was pumped at a constant rate q varying in between 4 5 and 4 6 m 3 h depending on the experiment experiment 1 in fig 4 the water level was monitored with vented level troll probes in situ in both piezometers the temperature evolution along the fo cable induced by the heat injection was monitored by the dts device at the end of the first stage without stopping the heating of the fiber the pumped water was injected in the monitoring well to monitor thermal signals induced by the injection experiment 2 in fig 4 the injected water came from the aquifer under natural conditions consequently it was colder than the water warmed by the fiber in the monitoring piezometer experiments 3 and 4 fig 4 correspond to adts experiment replicated in pz51 4 experimental data analysis before the heating phase the initial temperature distribution was recorded it represented a c shape with a minimum temperature of 15 4 c between the length interval of 35 65 m depth fig 5a such a temperature profile is typical for subsurface temperature regime influenced by an increase in ground surface temperature caused by global warming and or urbanization dědeček et al 2012 visser et al 2015 bayer et al 2016 fig 5b represents transient temperature profiles along pz51 455 curves acquired during the heating phase of the experiment as pointed out by the heat map the u shape of the cable provided two similar data sets at each sampling depth in pz51 data from pz101 423 curves not displayed in fig 5 are analyzed further in the manuscript when the heating started experiment 1 and 3 there was a quick temperature increase along the cable followed by a phase of slow change as expected differences of temperature elevation along the wells were observed due to thermal and hydrodynamic properties contrasts of aquifer layers simon et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 in some intervals like 35 40 m depth the temperature reached a value of 25 c whereas at 45 m depth the temperature quickly stabilized around 18 c such differences in thermal behavior along the well are analyzed in the following sections during the water injection experiments 2 and 4 the temperature changes were less significant once the electrical power switched off the temperature along the fo cable decreased drastically 4 1 preferential water flux pathways during reinjection the temperature anomalies measured during reinjection experiments 2 and 4 informed about the preferential flow paths in front of the screens during injection these anomalies were emphasized by the relative temperature anomaly δ t i n j eq 1 induced by the injected water 1 δ t i n j t t t i n j s t a r t where t i n j s t a r t is the temperature profile just before the beginning of water injection and t t the temperature profile measured at the time t after the beginning of the injection the evolution of δ t i n j profiles revealed three different zones in both piezometers fig 6a and c first above the screens i e at 35 m depth in the grouted area the injected water induced a slight temperature decrease less than 0 5 c in both wells this was related to conductive heat transfer due to colder water injection for depths greater than 54 5 m in pz51 and 60 m in pz101 the water temperature continued to increase due to the cable heating it indicated that the injected water did not influence the evolution of borehole temperature the latter means that the injected water did not infiltrate below these depths finally in the middle parts of both wells an overall significant temperature decrease induced by the local flow increase occurred in both piezometers the water infiltration areas are identified on the technical log of both piezometers fig 6b and d the thermal response was heterogeneous along the screens in both piezometers for example the layers at the depths of 39 m and 53 m in pz51 or 54 m in pz 101 were more sensitive to the cooling and reached a δ t i n j of 2 0 c other layers especially in pz51 41 44 and 50 m were barely affected by the cooling the short duration of the experiments 2 and 4 30 min and 64 min respectively did not allow a quantitative interpretation of the temperature transients and only provided a qualitative overview about zones of enhanced groundwater flow 4 2 use of analytical solutions for parameter distribution estimation 4 2 1 general interpretation framework adts data interpretation of experiment 1 and experiment 3 consisted on estimating vertically distributed parameters λ and q in the observation borehole the parameters were calculated at each sampling depth it was achieved through the assessment of experimental temperature evolution curves measured by the dts device following the theoretical approach developed by simon et al 2021 the interpretation framework was inspired from the one proposed by a free available matlab toolbox simon and bour 2022 and detailed further the two dimensional heat transport in saturated porous media eq 2 involving conduction and advection processes is expressed as carslaw and jaeger 1959 2 t t d t 2 t x 2 2 t y 2 q ρ w c w ρ b c b t x where t is the temperature k x and y are the coordinates m q is the darcy velocity m s 1 ρ b c b the volumetric heat capacity of the rock fluid matrix j m 3 k 1 ρ w c w the volumetric heat capacity of the water j m 3 k 1 ignoring thermal dispersion is a common practice for the interpretation of adts experiments bakker et al 2015 simon et al 2021 del val et al 2021 the consequences of this choice on the estimation of the parameters are discussed in section 5 2 therefore in eq 2 only thermal diffusivity d t m 2 s 1 is involved it depends on λ the bulk thermal conductivity w m 1 k 1 and is expressed as 3 d t λ ρ b c b considering whether or not natural flow in the aquifer occured eq 2 could be solved for a linear heating source involving the instantaneous line source model ils or moving instantaneous line source model mils carslaw and jaeger 1959 the ils solution expressed as follows eq 4 considers no flow within the aquifer and is the solution to eq 2 without considering the second term 4 δ t r t i l s p 4 π λ e i r 2 4 t d t where δ t is the temperature evolution p w m 1 is the constant heating power per unit length r 2 x 2 y 2 is the distance from the heating source the mils solution eq 5 is adapted from the ils and considers uniform flow across the heat source to take into account heat transfer by advection it is expressed as 5 δ t r t m i l s p 4 π λ exp q r 2 d t ρ w c w ρ c w α β with w α β the hantush well function hantush 1956 λ and q are estimated from these two solutions the previous equations did not consider thermal effects induced by the heating of the cable itself and the borehole material configuration just after heat injection in the fo cable the temperature increase was mainly associated first to the conductive skin effect in the fo cable components and secondly to the borehole material arrangement del val et al 2021 simon et al 2021 it generated a rapid increase of the temperature during the first time after heat injection the effect of the cable was the same along the borehole nevertheless the effect of the borehole material on the temperature increase could be different along the fo depending on the cable position in the gravel pack and mud and its relative distance to the pvc tube this aspect lead to a difference between the theoretical temperature calculated with ils and mils and the δ t e x p measured by fo dts this difference was taken into account in a δ t f o term fig 7 thus to model the temperature increase during the experiment δ t f o was added to the ils and mils solutions this was solved by trial error adjustments between ils model and experimental data 4 2 2 parameters quantification the ils and mils solutions were adjusted on the experimental data to estimate the λ and q values associated with the temperature evolution fig 8 the method consisted in reducing the root mean square error between the observed and modeled temperature using the brent algorithm brent 1974 four typical thermal behaviors were identified during the adts experiments ranging from no flow and low flow towards medium flow and high flow for no low and medium darcy velocity 2 0 10 5 m s 1 the experimental points before 1000 s were assimilated to the skin effect thus these points were excluded from λ fitting and estimation procedure fig 8 a c when only conductive heat transfer occurred i e no flow the temperature increased linearly along a log time scale during the whole experimental time fig 8a in this case the ils solution was used to estimate λ advection transfer generated a transition phase until temperature stabilization fig 8b and c and both analytical solutions were used to estimate λ and q high groundwater flux generated quick temperature stabilization when the darcy velocity was too high 2 0 10 5 m s 1 the sampling time of the experiments was unsuited to visualize the linear part of the thermal evolution plot an example is provided in fig 8d consequently thermal conductivity λ could not be estimated properly and was fixed at 2 8 w m 1 k 1 this value corresponds to an average value for limestone rocks dalla santa et al 2020 further discussion about the impact of λ values on the estimated q value is given in section 5 2 the analytical models had a good fit to the field data with the value of the root mean square error rmse generally remaining low i e rmse 0 1 the maximum value of 0 15 was calculated for the high darcy velocity interval low q values below 3 0 10 6 m s 1 should be considered cautiously it was demonstrated that an experimental time of 24 h with an error of 0 05 c on the field temperature measurement lead to errors above 20 on q estimation simon et al 2021 this error grew exponentially with the decrease of estimated q 4 2 3 groundwater and thermal conductivity distribution vertical distribution of λ and q were computed for each sampling depth along the two branches of the u cable fig 9 in each piezometer the 2 branches gave similar parameter estimations suggesting the consistency of the data acquisition and its processing the uncertain q values below 3 0 10 6 m s 1 were represented in a shaded area on the corresponding profiles fig 9a and c despite the short distance between pz101 and pz51 8 5 m the estimated q profiles showed major discrepancies in front of the borehole screens these q profiles were not equally distributed along the flowing areas of both piezometers highlighting a reciprocity gap in pz51 high darcy velocities of 5 0 10 5 m s 1 were estimated in the intervals of 43 46 m and 67 68 m fig 9a a lower peak of 1 0 10 5 m s 1 was detected in one branch at the depth of 62 m from the depth of 46 m to 53 m the q value decreased from 7 0 10 6 m s 1 to 4 0 10 6 m s 1 as for pz101 the adts experiment allowed to estimate a high darcy velocity superior of 2 0 10 5 m s 1 only in the thin layer at the depth of 62 m a medium flow of an average of 5 0 10 6 m s 1 was estimated between the length interval 54 61 m fig 9c in front of the screens the low λ values were always estimated in front of no or low flux areas in pz51 a value close to 1 0 w m 1 k 1 was estimated in the length intervals 35 39 m and 54 67 m on the contrary high λ values were calculated where significant q values were calculated this trend was also detected in pz101 high λ values of 3 0 w m 1 k 1 were measured in front of the highest darcy velocity area at the depth of 62 m whereas the values fluctuated around 1 5 w m 1 k 1 in the rest of the piezometer 5 discussion 5 1 consistency of the adts results in relation with available field data the parameters profiles obtained from adts experiments were compared to available independent field data the q profile in pz51 emphasized the same high productive layer as the one detected in the gf1 flowmeter log at the depth of 44 46 m the darcy velocity reached a value of 5 0 10 5 m s 1 at this depth nevertheless the flowmeter log achieved one year after borehole completion in pz101 suggested a homogeneous flux distribution probably influenced by the clogging development along this borehole but the adts detected a medium darcy velocity of 5 0 10 6 m s 1 where the screens are just partially clogged below the depth of 53 m in both piezometers weak or zero darcy velocity values were measured in front of clogged layers detected during video inspection fig 2f g and h the λ values of these layers were always inferior to 1 5 w m 1 k fig 9b and d it is typical for clogging materials like clay bentonite and porous iron hydroxides dalla santa et al 2020 cho et al 2008 tang et al 2008 gjengedal et al 2020 and does not correspond to the typical values of the thermal conductivity of the limestone i e 3 0 w m 1 k these observations highlight the potential of adts experiments to locate zones of borehole clogging we believe that the main reason for the clogging is related to the fact that these wells were planned only for monitoring purpose and as a consequence were not sufficiently developed after their completion the clogged materials did not have the same position along both boreholes it seems to be the main explanation for reciprocity gaps between parameters distribution in pz51 and pz101 the drill cuttings assessment revealed the same geology in both boreholes but a fracture or a more productive area might be intercepted in pz51 and gf1 and not in pz101 and could be the reason of a high flux in pz51 and gf1 involving the dilution of the bentonite in pz51 and not in pz101 the video camera showed bentonite and clay at the bottom of both piezometers the position of the plugs at the depth of 54 5 m in pz51 and 60 m in pz101 corresponded exactly to the limits highlighted by experiment 2 and experiment 4 fig 6 it confirmed that during injection the water did not flow in the lower part of the piezometers nevertheless during experience 1 and experience 3 some fluxes were detected below the well bottoms at the depths of 62 m in pz101 and 62 m and 68 m in pz51 fig 10 it may point out that at these depths the boreholes were clogged but the deposits were not completely compacted encrusted into the annular space high thermal conductivity values 3 0 w m 1 k 1 may confirm a likely dilution of the mud in these intervals 5 2 uncertainty and resolution of parameters calculation in highly productive layers the groundwater flow generated a fast temperature stabilization in this context adts experiments with a sampling time of more than 1 min are unsuited to visualize the linear part of the δ t e x p plot before the temperature stabilization fig 8d consequently it is not possible to accurately estimate the thermal conductivity λ consequently values of thermal conductivity consistent with the properties of the porous material dalla santa et al 2020 encountered in the borehole must be chosen as the default value however in high productive context it is possible to demonstrate the low impact of λ on the estimated darcy velocity fig 11 a sampling time of a few seconds would be necessary to visualize the conductive phase in this context nevertheless a short sampling time produce noisier data which can also lead to high uncertainty des tombe et al 2020 as mentioned in section 4 2 1 the analytical model used in this study ignored thermal dispersion by doing this the thermal diffusivity is overestimated it could be another source of error that could lead to underestimating q especially in high flow areas it was demonstrated that an estimated q of 5 0 10 6 m s 1 without considering the thermal dispersion will yield a q of 9 0 10 6 m s 1 if the longitudinal dispersivity is set at 0 1 m des tombe et al 2019 nevertheless in our experiment the effect of thermal dispersion should be very small if not negligible since here we use the same cable as a heat source and for measuring temperature moreover the vertical resolution of the dts is a limit to measure temperature variations induced by layers with a thickness ranging this resolution even if a thin layer is detected by the fo dts experiment the measured temperature in front of this layer is a result of the surrounding conditions leading to uncertainty in parameter estimation des tombe et al 2019 simon et al 2020 finally parameters estimation especially λ estimation is influenced by the test configuration the resolved parameters are unlikely to provide the true aquifer properties since the fo cable is located in the borehole annular space close to the pvc tube surrounded by the gravel and clogging material despite these uncertainties one should rather focus on relative parameter variation to identify clogging locations and productive layers along the borehole 5 3 advantages and limits of the proposed adts experiments 5 3 1 comparison with common field surveys these experiments demonstrated that adts could provide in short time information regarding two crucial concerns for ates operation i the method provides important insights regarding the aquifer heterogeneity in thermal and hydrodynamic properties and ii it enables the detection of clogging locations in the borehole adts experiment presents the advantage to estimate a distribution of parameters while pumping tests and trt give an average value of hydrodynamics and thermal properties moreover these surveys require much longer time of data collection i e at least 48 h versus 4 6 h required for the completion of adts tests however trt and pumping tests are very simple to deploy and their well known and relatively quick interpretation can give a first overview of the global aquifer dynamics unlike adts flowmeter tests are not designed to provide information about conductive heat transfers which could be of great interest in geothermal projects nevertheless the single hole flowmeter is a common survey that can be achieved in a shorter time than adts after a borehole completion it has also the advantage of a more simple setup than the adts one it provides a local vertical distribution of the fluxes at the logging well and is used to estimate permeability variations along the aquifer molz et al 1989 1994 paillet 1998 the application of the flowmeter test in cross borehole configuration proved to be also an efficient methodology to have a better characterization of aquifer dynamics at a large scale it allows highlighting connectivity of preferential groundwater flow paths le borgne et al 2006a b audouin and bodin 2008 the adts experiments give thermal conductivity only in the vicinity of the monitoring well to characterize aquifer heterogeneity and thermal diffusivity on large scales heat tracer tests with multiple monitoring well may be more powerful experimental field test klepikova et al 2016 it provides additional information compared to solute tracer tests since the thermal diffusivity is higher than the solute dispersion irvine et al 2015 la bernardie et al 2018 consequently heat tracer tests are more suited for geothermal sites however due to the ability of heat to propagate through solids by diffusion completion of heat tracer tests may take much longer time compared to solute tracer tests days vs hours irvine et al 2015 and la bernardie et al 2018 it can also be difficult to realize and interpret compared to adts experiments recent studies gjengedal et al 2020 2021 based on short step test combined with temperature and hydraulic performance monitoring first demonstrated a new technique enabling the detection of clogging and its further evolution characterization in geothermal systems while this method allows the detection of clogging in the entire system it does not precise the clogging location in the boreholes the new characteristic of our adts interpretation is to image clogging distribution in the monitoring well therefore this new strategy and the one proposed by gjengedal et al 2020 could complement each other once deployed in the borehole and all cable connections realized adts technology could be used as a permanent in situ device it presents a certain advantage as it can collect a large amount of data without opening the borehole and removing the submersible pump the aim would be to monitor clogging evolution and aquifer properties changes over time and to plan and adapt maintenance works before major deterioration of the wells this aspect would be time and financial saving compared to diagnostic well works or video camera inspections to visualize clogging development it is also an advantage to have a permanent fiber in the borehole it allows to warm the cable and collect the data with the dts unit without deploying the fiber in the borehole before each experiment like the methodology proposed by maldaner et al 2019 5 3 2 potential limits of cross borehole adts experiments in a geothermal operational context our experiments were achieved in wells made of pvc tubes and screens this material has a low thermal conductivity of 0 2 w m 1 k 1 it gives a limited impact on the temperature evolution generated by the warming of the fiber this impact was included in the skin effect during our interpretation process nevertheless a lot of wells are made of steel or stainless steel because of the high thermal conductivity of this material 15 30 w m 1 k 1 the energy demand may be significant to create a temperature increase detectable by the dts device a numerical model taking into account a well equipped with steel material would be necessary to inspect the feasibility of adts experiment in this configuration while on the ensegid site the exploited aquifer is found at a shallow depth 35 65 m in other sites the geothermal target may be deeper the longer cable length required for deeper applications will generate an additional economic cost and the deployment of the technology in the borehole will be more time consuming moreover longer heated section of the cable will require more power injection to reach similar temperature variations in this context it is a major concern to provide suitable devices able to inject safely more electrical power finally the ensegid site is equipped with several wells close to each other thus offering a good opportunity to perform adts experiments in cross borehole configuration monitoring and pumping boreholes are only separated by a distance of 8 5 m and a flowrate inferior to 5 0 m 3 h 1 was enough to induce groundwater flux measurable by the adts experiment nevertheless on geothermal sites just equipped with a warm and a cold well the high distance generally more than 100 m between the wells to avoid thermal breakthrough may be a limit to perform cross borehole adts experiments depending on the hydrogeological context and the capacity of the installed submersible pump the groundwater velocity at the monitoring well may not be detectable by the presented adts experiment configuration and interpretation scheme in this case a single hole adts configuration like the one proposed by read et al 2014 may be more suited 6 conclusion this study demonstrated the potential of adts experiments to collect and interpret a large amount of data by placing a fo between the borehole screens and the porous media our study allowed to characterize simultaneously the distribution of thermal conductivity and darcy velocity in a short time 4 6 h per experiment and to get useful insights about the water injection pathways in boreholes moreover the data provided information concerning the position of the clogging development along the screens in the future it would be certainly of interest to test adts experiments on a new operational geothermal site the aim would be to determine initial parameters profiles before the beginning of ates operation in the production injection wells and then monitor their evolution during a long term operation to have an overview on the wells performance behavior credit authorship contribution statement j godinaud conceptualization methodology software formal analysis writing original draft visualization m

2333,fiber optic active distributed temperature sensing fo adts experiments were performed on an aquifer thermal energy storage system ates site located on the university campus of bordeaux france the experiments consisted in heating the steel core of the fo cable while monitoring the rate of temperature increase during the heating periods the changes in temperature that were monitored through time at every depth under various hydraulic conditions and in different boreholes were used to evaluate both aquifer properties and wells conditions a first adts experiment was conducted under cross borehole configuration using a pumping well and a monitoring well separated by a distance of 8 5 meters then to check the reciprocity of the results a second experiment was conducted by switching the monitoring and the pumping well the results obtained through the use of analytical solutions for reproducing and interpreting the data lead to the following conclusions i adts can be used to estimate both thermal conductivity and darcy velocity distribution along boreholes crucial properties for ates performance ii the proposed method is a promising tool to detect clogging locations in the boreholes when it occurs this can be of great practical interest to maintain systems performance since once fo cables deployed experiments could be easily repeated without opening boreholes and stop the system operation keywords distributed temperature sensing groundwater flux thermal conductivity clogging ates data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction aquifer thermal energy storage ates is an open loop geothermal system involving at least two reversible boreholes fleuchaus et al 2018 this technology uses the subsurface as transient long term storage of cold and warm water and it gains more and more popularity with a great potential to reduce green house gas emissions of the building sector vanhoudt et al 2011 gao et al 2017 ghaebi et al 2017 schüppler et al 2019 stemmle et al 2021 ates performance is highly sensitive to hydrogeological conditions it requires good aquifer permeability to pump and inject water into the aquifer low natural groundwater flow to avoid stored energy losses due to advection and or thermal interaction between wells during system operation storage efficiency and energy recovery rate depend on the cold and warm thermal plumes extension bloemendal and hartog 2018 the spatiotemporal distribution of temperature is particularly impacted by aquifer heterogeneity especially regarding the groundwater flux and thermal properties distribution ferguson 2007 sommer et al 2013 bridger and allen 2014 ganguly and mohan kumar 2014 possemiers et al 2015 visser et al 2015 nguyen et al 2016 bloemendal and hartog 2018 ates performance also depends on wells sustainability which can be impacted by their aging among the main issues corrosion biological chemical and physical clogging are major problems which could lead to well damages and performance decrease fleuchaus et al 2018 bloemendal and olsthoorn 2018 the causes and consequences of the boreholes clogging are well documented for open loop systems bakema 2001 song et al 2020 a large clogging development is an additional source of geothermal system performance decrease quantification of the subsurface heterogeneity and the surveillance of clogging evolution in wells are therefore major concerns on ates site classically thermal and hydrodynamic properties of aquifers are characterized from laboratory measurements on core samples moreover some field surveys may be used in the context of ates characterization among these surveys pumping tests give an average value of aquifer transmissivity and specific storage their monitoring time ranges classically between 1 and 3 days and their well known interpretation provides a first overview of hydrogeological properties and context of a site kruseman and ridder 1994 flowmeter logs are suited to obtain the vertical flow distribution at a particular point and can provide information on fracture connectivity transmissivity and storativity distribution molz et al 1994 paillet 1998 roubinet et al 2015 these tests are simple to realize and can be performed in short time heat or solute tracer tests are used to investigate groundwater velocity thermal and hydraulic dispersivity or location of preferential groundwater paths bodin et al 2003 klepikova et al 2016 irvine et al 2015 but they are more difficult to realize and a robust interpretation could require a lot of observation points as well as comprehensive numerical modeling thermal response tests trt are used to estimate the average thermal conductivity of aquifers at the vicinity of the tested well but the data collection could require a long time beier et al 2011 dong et al 2022 finally cores collection is financially costly time consuming and their analysis provides only local information which could not be representative of the global in site aquifer dynamics sharqawy et al 2013 preventive actions to tackle clogging development include reduction in the frequency of pump starts and stops underground removal of iron avoiding possible oxygen infiltration or reduction of water turbidity and organic content nevertheless a certain clogging extension cannot be avoided during the recharge process thus leading to the decrease of geothermal system performance song et al 2020 surveillance of the clogging evolution is thus a major challenge for ates systems and developing adapted countermeasures on site could significantly help to maintain their performance recently a strategy was developed to follow its evolution gjengedal et al 2020 the surveillance procedure aims to conduct a step test with incremental increases in the groundwater flow rate while measuring the pressure and temperature responses in the system components nevertheless it does not focus on clogging locations in the well but gives an overall view of each component of the geothermal system production wells submersible pump and groundwater heat exchanger distributive thermal sensing with fiber optic cable fo dts opens a timely opportunity to improve our understanding of the functioning of ates systems this technology enables to collect efficiently long data set and to monitor dynamics process bense et al 2016 for geothermal application it was first used to monitor temperature variations along production boreholes hurtig et al 1996 dts methods have seen further improvements with the use of the active mode adts it consists on deploying a heat source in the well and monitoring the induced temperature changes bense et al 2016 the temperature elevation induced by the heat source and the subsequent cooling directly depends on thermal properties of the porous media and on water flux dissipating heat by advection among other it can be used to achieve enhanced thermal response test etrt to establish thermal conductivity profile for borehole heat exchanger bhe application freifeld et al 2008 huber and arslan 2012 vélez márquez et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 hakala et al 2022 furthermore the method proved its ability to measure groundwater flux distribution in the subsurface read et al 2014 bakker et al 2015 des tombe et al 2019 recent laboratory and field experiments demonstrate that analytical methods can be used to inspect the distribution of thermal conductivity and darcy velocity along a fiber positioning in saturated porous media simon et al 2021 del val et al 2021 these works enable the generalization of adts experiments interpretation apart from aquifer thermal properties the thermal conductivity profile established in a borehole could be also of major interest to inspect eventual low anomalies due to clogging development indeed the value of thermal conductivity for clogging materials such as bentonite clay or porous iron hydroxides provides a particular low signature useful for identification tang et al 2008 cho et al 2008 gjengedal et al 2020 dalla santa et al 2020 to our knowledge fo adts experiments in boreholes have never been performed with a purpose of detecting both clogging development and productive layers most of the experiments achieved in boreholes mainly focus on fractured zone identification la bernardie et al 2018 maldaner et al 2019 klepikova et al 2022 darcy velocity estimation selker and selker 2018 del val et al 2021 or aquifer thermal conductivity zhang et al 2020 hakala et al 2022 in this context a cross borehole adts experiment was carried out on a site located at the university of bordeaux in france and planned to be exploited by a new ates the test was realized under constant pumping rate condition and replicated in two different boreholes to verify the reciprocity of the data the main objectives were i to characterize the vertical distributions of thermal conductivity and darcy velocity in two different boreholes ii to reveal the preferential water pathways during injection iii to demonstrate the potential of adts to detect clogging area along well screens 2 experimental site 2 1 context the study area is located at the university of bordeaux pessac france fig 1a on the site of the ecole nationale superieure en environnement georessources et ingéniérie du developpement durable ensegid an ates system was designed to supply both cooling and heating to a new building of 3600 m2 the ates consists of a pair of 70 m deep reversible pumping injection wells gf1 hot well and gf2 cold well located 145 m apart fig 1b in addition to the production wells four piezometers pz51 pz101 pz52 and pz102 were created close to the main wells to monitor thermal plumes extension and to control piezometric heads piezometers pz101 and pz51 are used for the adts experiment they are separated by a distance of 8 5 m and located 6 0 m and 6 5 m apart from the ates hot production well gf1 they were drilled to 66 m and 70 m deep respectively our experiments were achieved 8 months before the beginning of ates operation located in the north aquitaine basin the experimental site corresponds to a large multi layered aquifer system the actual structure of this basin is the result of pyrenees retro foreland basin developed from the campanian to the miocene labat et al 2021 the local geology corresponds to the top of the system formed by a succession of sedimentary deposits during multiple transgression regression periods leading to a vertical heterogeneous sequences of limestone sandstone and clay from eocene to plio quaternary times larroque et al 2013 the proximal shore location of the site during oligocene period results in highly horizontally and vertically heterogeneous limestone deposits sztrákos and steurbaut 2017 a part of the oligocene formation composed by highly porous and permeable fossiliferous limestones constitutes the ates aquifer target around the experimental site the deep aquifer is confined as pointed out by seasonal artesianism near the surface level a 10 meters thick unconfined aquifer made of plio quaternary sand and clay deposits covers the oligocene formation at the site location the oligocene aquifer limestone is crossed from 12 m depth to 68 m depth 2 2 field data the available field data including gamma ray log flowmeter logs and drill cuttings observations highlight a heterogeneous limestone aquifer with a vertical and horizontal unequal distribution of incoming water fluxes the layer crossed between the depth of 40 60 m fig 2a is made of fossiliferous white limestone a developed porosity is identified from microscopic drill cuttings observation in this layer the pz51 gamma ray values fluctuate around an average of 25 0 cps which indicates a low clay content fig 2d the gf1 flowmeter reveals that the incoming water is located from the depth of 40 m to 55 m in this area a layer of 2 m thick between the depth of 44 m and 46 m produces about the half of the total discharge fig 2e another flowmeter realized in pz101 one year after the end of borehole works completion and before the beginning of ates operation indicates a more homogeneous flux distribution along this borehole fig 2e between the depth of 60 m and 67 m the drill cuttings observations emphasize gray limestones a less developed porosity and a significant clay content from 67 m to 71 m blue marl is encountered a mean transmissivity value of 7 0 10 4 m 2 s 1 is estimated from a two days pumping test in gf1 borehole camera inspections show the presence of clogging material in piezometers pz101 and pz51 fig 2f g and h from the depth of 35 m to 39 m the pz51 screens are totally clogged by a mix of yellow brown bentonite clay mud and white bio fouling bacteria fig 2f the screens are clean in the interval length 40 54 m the pz51 bottom is filled with clay and bentonite and encountered at the depth of 54 5 m instead of the 71 m initially drilled we believe that the main reason for the fast clogging is related to the fact that these wells are planned only for monitoring purpose as a consequence the piezometers were not sufficiently developed as for pz101 the screens are totally clogged by bentonite and mud from the depth of 35 m to 53 m fig 2 g below the depth of 53 m to the pz101 bottom at 60 m the screens are partially clogged fig 2h the clogged intervals of the piezometers are represented on the technical logs fig 2b and c 3 experiment and methodology 3 1 experimental set up adts experiments were conducted in pz101 and pz51 a loop of brusens fiber optic cable solifos fiber optic systems ag switzerland was lowered to their annular space it contains two multi mode fibers encased in a sealed stainless steel capillary and covered by wire rope and a pvc jacket fig 3a two electrical cables were connected to the steel armor of both fiber branches of the loop to allow the injection of electricity from a power controller these connections were further sealed by epoxy resin the induced temperature variation was monitored with a silixa xt dts unit reporting temperature every 25 cm at a 2 min sampling interval in pz51 and 1 min sampling interval in pz101 fig 3b in order to ensure contact with the porous media while deployed in the borehole each branch of the fo cable was slightly stretched and attached outside the polyvinyl chloride pvc tube every 3 m fig 3c this installation was similar to a previous study in 25 m depth boreholes del val et al 2021 for both piezometers 50 m of fo cable of each side of the loop remained outside the borehole for connection to the dts unit and for calibration purposes once the whole equipment installed the gravel pack was added down which embedded the fo cable in the gravel and prevented any cable shaking 3 2 temperature calibration process and dts spatial resolution during the experiment 10 m of each branch from sticking out cables were immersed into separate warm and cold calibration baths for temperature calibration purposes in order to cover the full range of temperatures that could be expected to be measured along the fiber optic cable the cold bath was filled with ice and the warm bath was equipped with a resistance to maintain water temperature at 31 c fig 3 the temperature was recorded in each bath with a pt100 probe 0 1 c accuracy and two rbr solot probes 0 002 c accuracy the temperature in both baths was homogenized with small aquarium bubblers the loop configuration of the fiber in the boreholes allowed to create a double ended connection providing accurate temperature measurements under field conditions van de giesen et al 2012 the python toolbox des tombe et al 2020 was used to check the quality of the dts measurement and indicated a good calibration of the temperature measured by the dts device the dts spatial resolution s r during the experience was estimated from the classical 90 step change tyler et al 2009 and the derivative method simon et al 2020 for pz101 the s r was estimated between 0 9 and 1 1 m as the sampling time s t was twice larger for pz51 experiment the s r was better and range from 0 7 to 0 9 m the s r of these experiments were more precise than the 2 3 m s r reported in the study of tyler et al 2009 and slightly less precise than the 0 5 0 9 m s r reported in the laboratory study of simon et al 2020 3 3 experiments proceedings the experiment was ran under cross borehole configuration it is a common practice for integrated aquifer characterization it is an efficient method to explain complex hydraulic behavior of aquifers and investigate preferential flow path in heterogeneous contexts butler and zhan 2004 le borgne et al 2006a b audouin and bodin 2008 brauchler et al 2010 lods et al 2020 aliouache et al 2021 this configuration is therefore of great interest to study thermal transfer by advection at the aquifer scale the cross borehole configuration was replicated into pz101 and pz51 to verify the reciprocity of the acquired data the reciprocity can be used to interpret the dynamic of the aquifers and highlights continuity or not of the hydraulic system hariga et al 2010 delay et al 2011 2012 marinoni et al 2016 sanchez vila et al 2016 the experiment started once the hydrodynamic pseudo steady state was reached the first stage consisted in heating the steel mantle of the fiber in the well pz101 with a constant injection rate of power p trough electrical cables controlled by the heat pulse power controller at the same time the neighboring piezometer pz51 was pumped at a constant rate q varying in between 4 5 and 4 6 m 3 h depending on the experiment experiment 1 in fig 4 the water level was monitored with vented level troll probes in situ in both piezometers the temperature evolution along the fo cable induced by the heat injection was monitored by the dts device at the end of the first stage without stopping the heating of the fiber the pumped water was injected in the monitoring well to monitor thermal signals induced by the injection experiment 2 in fig 4 the injected water came from the aquifer under natural conditions consequently it was colder than the water warmed by the fiber in the monitoring piezometer experiments 3 and 4 fig 4 correspond to adts experiment replicated in pz51 4 experimental data analysis before the heating phase the initial temperature distribution was recorded it represented a c shape with a minimum temperature of 15 4 c between the length interval of 35 65 m depth fig 5a such a temperature profile is typical for subsurface temperature regime influenced by an increase in ground surface temperature caused by global warming and or urbanization dědeček et al 2012 visser et al 2015 bayer et al 2016 fig 5b represents transient temperature profiles along pz51 455 curves acquired during the heating phase of the experiment as pointed out by the heat map the u shape of the cable provided two similar data sets at each sampling depth in pz51 data from pz101 423 curves not displayed in fig 5 are analyzed further in the manuscript when the heating started experiment 1 and 3 there was a quick temperature increase along the cable followed by a phase of slow change as expected differences of temperature elevation along the wells were observed due to thermal and hydrodynamic properties contrasts of aquifer layers simon et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 in some intervals like 35 40 m depth the temperature reached a value of 25 c whereas at 45 m depth the temperature quickly stabilized around 18 c such differences in thermal behavior along the well are analyzed in the following sections during the water injection experiments 2 and 4 the temperature changes were less significant once the electrical power switched off the temperature along the fo cable decreased drastically 4 1 preferential water flux pathways during reinjection the temperature anomalies measured during reinjection experiments 2 and 4 informed about the preferential flow paths in front of the screens during injection these anomalies were emphasized by the relative temperature anomaly δ t i n j eq 1 induced by the injected water 1 δ t i n j t t t i n j s t a r t where t i n j s t a r t is the temperature profile just before the beginning of water injection and t t the temperature profile measured at the time t after the beginning of the injection the evolution of δ t i n j profiles revealed three different zones in both piezometers fig 6a and c first above the screens i e at 35 m depth in the grouted area the injected water induced a slight temperature decrease less than 0 5 c in both wells this was related to conductive heat transfer due to colder water injection for depths greater than 54 5 m in pz51 and 60 m in pz101 the water temperature continued to increase due to the cable heating it indicated that the injected water did not influence the evolution of borehole temperature the latter means that the injected water did not infiltrate below these depths finally in the middle parts of both wells an overall significant temperature decrease induced by the local flow increase occurred in both piezometers the water infiltration areas are identified on the technical log of both piezometers fig 6b and d the thermal response was heterogeneous along the screens in both piezometers for example the layers at the depths of 39 m and 53 m in pz51 or 54 m in pz 101 were more sensitive to the cooling and reached a δ t i n j of 2 0 c other layers especially in pz51 41 44 and 50 m were barely affected by the cooling the short duration of the experiments 2 and 4 30 min and 64 min respectively did not allow a quantitative interpretation of the temperature transients and only provided a qualitative overview about zones of enhanced groundwater flow 4 2 use of analytical solutions for parameter distribution estimation 4 2 1 general interpretation framework adts data interpretation of experiment 1 and experiment 3 consisted on estimating vertically distributed parameters λ and q in the observation borehole the parameters were calculated at each sampling depth it was achieved through the assessment of experimental temperature evolution curves measured by the dts device following the theoretical approach developed by simon et al 2021 the interpretation framework was inspired from the one proposed by a free available matlab toolbox simon and bour 2022 and detailed further the two dimensional heat transport in saturated porous media eq 2 involving conduction and advection processes is expressed as carslaw and jaeger 1959 2 t t d t 2 t x 2 2 t y 2 q ρ w c w ρ b c b t x where t is the temperature k x and y are the coordinates m q is the darcy velocity m s 1 ρ b c b the volumetric heat capacity of the rock fluid matrix j m 3 k 1 ρ w c w the volumetric heat capacity of the water j m 3 k 1 ignoring thermal dispersion is a common practice for the interpretation of adts experiments bakker et al 2015 simon et al 2021 del val et al 2021 the consequences of this choice on the estimation of the parameters are discussed in section 5 2 therefore in eq 2 only thermal diffusivity d t m 2 s 1 is involved it depends on λ the bulk thermal conductivity w m 1 k 1 and is expressed as 3 d t λ ρ b c b considering whether or not natural flow in the aquifer occured eq 2 could be solved for a linear heating source involving the instantaneous line source model ils or moving instantaneous line source model mils carslaw and jaeger 1959 the ils solution expressed as follows eq 4 considers no flow within the aquifer and is the solution to eq 2 without considering the second term 4 δ t r t i l s p 4 π λ e i r 2 4 t d t where δ t is the temperature evolution p w m 1 is the constant heating power per unit length r 2 x 2 y 2 is the distance from the heating source the mils solution eq 5 is adapted from the ils and considers uniform flow across the heat source to take into account heat transfer by advection it is expressed as 5 δ t r t m i l s p 4 π λ exp q r 2 d t ρ w c w ρ c w α β with w α β the hantush well function hantush 1956 λ and q are estimated from these two solutions the previous equations did not consider thermal effects induced by the heating of the cable itself and the borehole material configuration just after heat injection in the fo cable the temperature increase was mainly associated first to the conductive skin effect in the fo cable components and secondly to the borehole material arrangement del val et al 2021 simon et al 2021 it generated a rapid increase of the temperature during the first time after heat injection the effect of the cable was the same along the borehole nevertheless the effect of the borehole material on the temperature increase could be different along the fo depending on the cable position in the gravel pack and mud and its relative distance to the pvc tube this aspect lead to a difference between the theoretical temperature calculated with ils and mils and the δ t e x p measured by fo dts this difference was taken into account in a δ t f o term fig 7 thus to model the temperature increase during the experiment δ t f o was added to the ils and mils solutions this was solved by trial error adjustments between ils model and experimental data 4 2 2 parameters quantification the ils and mils solutions were adjusted on the experimental data to estimate the λ and q values associated with the temperature evolution fig 8 the method consisted in reducing the root mean square error between the observed and modeled temperature using the brent algorithm brent 1974 four typical thermal behaviors were identified during the adts experiments ranging from no flow and low flow towards medium flow and high flow for no low and medium darcy velocity 2 0 10 5 m s 1 the experimental points before 1000 s were assimilated to the skin effect thus these points were excluded from λ fitting and estimation procedure fig 8 a c when only conductive heat transfer occurred i e no flow the temperature increased linearly along a log time scale during the whole experimental time fig 8a in this case the ils solution was used to estimate λ advection transfer generated a transition phase until temperature stabilization fig 8b and c and both analytical solutions were used to estimate λ and q high groundwater flux generated quick temperature stabilization when the darcy velocity was too high 2 0 10 5 m s 1 the sampling time of the experiments was unsuited to visualize the linear part of the thermal evolution plot an example is provided in fig 8d consequently thermal conductivity λ could not be estimated properly and was fixed at 2 8 w m 1 k 1 this value corresponds to an average value for limestone rocks dalla santa et al 2020 further discussion about the impact of λ values on the estimated q value is given in section 5 2 the analytical models had a good fit to the field data with the value of the root mean square error rmse generally remaining low i e rmse 0 1 the maximum value of 0 15 was calculated for the high darcy velocity interval low q values below 3 0 10 6 m s 1 should be considered cautiously it was demonstrated that an experimental time of 24 h with an error of 0 05 c on the field temperature measurement lead to errors above 20 on q estimation simon et al 2021 this error grew exponentially with the decrease of estimated q 4 2 3 groundwater and thermal conductivity distribution vertical distribution of λ and q were computed for each sampling depth along the two branches of the u cable fig 9 in each piezometer the 2 branches gave similar parameter estimations suggesting the consistency of the data acquisition and its processing the uncertain q values below 3 0 10 6 m s 1 were represented in a shaded area on the corresponding profiles fig 9a and c despite the short distance between pz101 and pz51 8 5 m the estimated q profiles showed major discrepancies in front of the borehole screens these q profiles were not equally distributed along the flowing areas of both piezometers highlighting a reciprocity gap in pz51 high darcy velocities of 5 0 10 5 m s 1 were estimated in the intervals of 43 46 m and 67 68 m fig 9a a lower peak of 1 0 10 5 m s 1 was detected in one branch at the depth of 62 m from the depth of 46 m to 53 m the q value decreased from 7 0 10 6 m s 1 to 4 0 10 6 m s 1 as for pz101 the adts experiment allowed to estimate a high darcy velocity superior of 2 0 10 5 m s 1 only in the thin layer at the depth of 62 m a medium flow of an average of 5 0 10 6 m s 1 was estimated between the length interval 54 61 m fig 9c in front of the screens the low λ values were always estimated in front of no or low flux areas in pz51 a value close to 1 0 w m 1 k 1 was estimated in the length intervals 35 39 m and 54 67 m on the contrary high λ values were calculated where significant q values were calculated this trend was also detected in pz101 high λ values of 3 0 w m 1 k 1 were measured in front of the highest darcy velocity area at the depth of 62 m whereas the values fluctuated around 1 5 w m 1 k 1 in the rest of the piezometer 5 discussion 5 1 consistency of the adts results in relation with available field data the parameters profiles obtained from adts experiments were compared to available independent field data the q profile in pz51 emphasized the same high productive layer as the one detected in the gf1 flowmeter log at the depth of 44 46 m the darcy velocity reached a value of 5 0 10 5 m s 1 at this depth nevertheless the flowmeter log achieved one year after borehole completion in pz101 suggested a homogeneous flux distribution probably influenced by the clogging development along this borehole but the adts detected a medium darcy velocity of 5 0 10 6 m s 1 where the screens are just partially clogged below the depth of 53 m in both piezometers weak or zero darcy velocity values were measured in front of clogged layers detected during video inspection fig 2f g and h the λ values of these layers were always inferior to 1 5 w m 1 k fig 9b and d it is typical for clogging materials like clay bentonite and porous iron hydroxides dalla santa et al 2020 cho et al 2008 tang et al 2008 gjengedal et al 2020 and does not correspond to the typical values of the thermal conductivity of the limestone i e 3 0 w m 1 k these observations highlight the potential of adts experiments to locate zones of borehole clogging we believe that the main reason for the clogging is related to the fact that these wells were planned only for monitoring purpose and as a consequence were not sufficiently developed after their completion the clogged materials did not have the same position along both boreholes it seems to be the main explanation for reciprocity gaps between parameters distribution in pz51 and pz101 the drill cuttings assessment revealed the same geology in both boreholes but a fracture or a more productive area might be intercepted in pz51 and gf1 and not in pz101 and could be the reason of a high flux in pz51 and gf1 involving the dilution of the bentonite in pz51 and not in pz101 the video camera showed bentonite and clay at the bottom of both piezometers the position of the plugs at the depth of 54 5 m in pz51 and 60 m in pz101 corresponded exactly to the limits highlighted by experiment 2 and experiment 4 fig 6 it confirmed that during injection the water did not flow in the lower part of the piezometers nevertheless during experience 1 and experience 3 some fluxes were detected below the well bottoms at the depths of 62 m in pz101 and 62 m and 68 m in pz51 fig 10 it may point out that at these depths the boreholes were clogged but the deposits were not completely compacted encrusted into the annular space high thermal conductivity values 3 0 w m 1 k 1 may confirm a likely dilution of the mud in these intervals 5 2 uncertainty and resolution of parameters calculation in highly productive layers the groundwater flow generated a fast temperature stabilization in this context adts experiments with a sampling time of more than 1 min are unsuited to visualize the linear part of the δ t e x p plot before the temperature stabilization fig 8d consequently it is not possible to accurately estimate the thermal conductivity λ consequently values of thermal conductivity consistent with the properties of the porous material dalla santa et al 2020 encountered in the borehole must be chosen as the default value however in high productive context it is possible to demonstrate the low impact of λ on the estimated darcy velocity fig 11 a sampling time of a few seconds would be necessary to visualize the conductive phase in this context nevertheless a short sampling time produce noisier data which can also lead to high uncertainty des tombe et al 2020 as mentioned in section 4 2 1 the analytical model used in this study ignored thermal dispersion by doing this the thermal diffusivity is overestimated it could be another source of error that could lead to underestimating q especially in high flow areas it was demonstrated that an estimated q of 5 0 10 6 m s 1 without considering the thermal dispersion will yield a q of 9 0 10 6 m s 1 if the longitudinal dispersivity is set at 0 1 m des tombe et al 2019 nevertheless in our experiment the effect of thermal dispersion should be very small if not negligible since here we use the same cable as a heat source and for measuring temperature moreover the vertical resolution of the dts is a limit to measure temperature variations induced by layers with a thickness ranging this resolution even if a thin layer is detected by the fo dts experiment the measured temperature in front of this layer is a result of the surrounding conditions leading to uncertainty in parameter estimation des tombe et al 2019 simon et al 2020 finally parameters estimation especially λ estimation is influenced by the test configuration the resolved parameters are unlikely to provide the true aquifer properties since the fo cable is located in the borehole annular space close to the pvc tube surrounded by the gravel and clogging material despite these uncertainties one should rather focus on relative parameter variation to identify clogging locations and productive layers along the borehole 5 3 advantages and limits of the proposed adts experiments 5 3 1 comparison with common field surveys these experiments demonstrated that adts could provide in short time information regarding two crucial concerns for ates operation i the method provides important insights regarding the aquifer heterogeneity in thermal and hydrodynamic properties and ii it enables the detection of clogging locations in the borehole adts experiment presents the advantage to estimate a distribution of parameters while pumping tests and trt give an average value of hydrodynamics and thermal properties moreover these surveys require much longer time of data collection i e at least 48 h versus 4 6 h required for the completion of adts tests however trt and pumping tests are very simple to deploy and their well known and relatively quick interpretation can give a first overview of the global aquifer dynamics unlike adts flowmeter tests are not designed to provide information about conductive heat transfers which could be of great interest in geothermal projects nevertheless the single hole flowmeter is a common survey that can be achieved in a shorter time than adts after a borehole completion it has also the advantage of a more simple setup than the adts one it provides a local vertical distribution of the fluxes at the logging well and is used to estimate permeability variations along the aquifer molz et al 1989 1994 paillet 1998 the application of the flowmeter test in cross borehole configuration proved to be also an efficient methodology to have a better characterization of aquifer dynamics at a large scale it allows highlighting connectivity of preferential groundwater flow paths le borgne et al 2006a b audouin and bodin 2008 the adts experiments give thermal conductivity only in the vicinity of the monitoring well to characterize aquifer heterogeneity and thermal diffusivity on large scales heat tracer tests with multiple monitoring well may be more powerful experimental field test klepikova et al 2016 it provides additional information compared to solute tracer tests since the thermal diffusivity is higher than the solute dispersion irvine et al 2015 la bernardie et al 2018 consequently heat tracer tests are more suited for geothermal sites however due to the ability of heat to propagate through solids by diffusion completion of heat tracer tests may take much longer time compared to solute tracer tests days vs hours irvine et al 2015 and la bernardie et al 2018 it can also be difficult to realize and interpret compared to adts experiments recent studies gjengedal et al 2020 2021 based on short step test combined with temperature and hydraulic performance monitoring first demonstrated a new technique enabling the detection of clogging and its further evolution characterization in geothermal systems while this method allows the detection of clogging in the entire system it does not precise the clogging location in the boreholes the new characteristic of our adts interpretation is to image clogging distribution in the monitoring well therefore this new strategy and the one proposed by gjengedal et al 2020 could complement each other once deployed in the borehole and all cable connections realized adts technology could be used as a permanent in situ device it presents a certain advantage as it can collect a large amount of data without opening the borehole and removing the submersible pump the aim would be to monitor clogging evolution and aquifer properties changes over time and to plan and adapt maintenance works before major deterioration of the wells this aspect would be time and financial saving compared to diagnostic well works or video camera inspections to visualize clogging development it is also an advantage to have a permanent fiber in the borehole it allows to warm the cable and collect the data with the dts unit without deploying the fiber in the borehole before each experiment like the methodology proposed by maldaner et al 2019 5 3 2 potential limits of cross borehole adts experiments in a geothermal operational context our experiments were achieved in wells made of pvc tubes and screens this material has a low thermal conductivity of 0 2 w m 1 k 1 it gives a limited impact on the temperature evolution generated by the warming of the fiber this impact was included in the skin effect during our interpretation process nevertheless a lot of wells are made of steel or stainless steel because of the high thermal conductivity of this material 15 30 w m 1 k 1 the energy demand may be significant to create a temperature increase detectable by the dts device a numerical model taking into account a well equipped with steel material would be necessary to inspect the feasibility of adts experiment in this configuration while on the ensegid site the exploited aquifer is found at a shallow depth 35 65 m in other sites the geothermal target may be deeper the longer cable length required for deeper applications will generate an additional economic cost and the deployment of the technology in the borehole will be more time consuming moreover longer heated section of the cable will require more power injection to reach similar temperature variations in this context it is a major concern to provide suitable devices able to inject safely more electrical power finally the ensegid site is equipped with several wells close to each other thus offering a good opportunity to perform adts experiments in cross borehole configuration monitoring and pumping boreholes are only separated by a distance of 8 5 m and a flowrate inferior to 5 0 m 3 h 1 was enough to induce groundwater flux measurable by the adts experiment nevertheless on geothermal sites just equipped with a warm and a cold well the high distance generally more than 100 m between the wells to avoid thermal breakthrough may be a limit to perform cross borehole adts experiments depending on the hydrogeological context and the capacity of the installed submersible pump the groundwater velocity at the monitoring well may not be detectable by the presented adts experiment configuration and interpretation scheme in this case a single hole adts configuration like the one proposed by read et al 2014 may be more suited 6 conclusion this study demonstrated the potential of adts experiments to collect and interpret a large amount of data by placing a fo between the borehole screens and the porous media our study allowed to characterize simultaneously the distribution of thermal conductivity and darcy velocity in a short time 4 6 h per experiment and to get useful insights about the water injection pathways in boreholes moreover the data provided information concerning the position of the clogging development along the screens in the future it would be certainly of interest to test adts experiments on a new operational geothermal site the aim would be to determine initial parameters profiles before the beginning of ates operation in the production injection wells and then monitor their evolution during a long term operation to have an overview on the wells performance behavior credit authorship contribution statement j godinaud conceptualization methodology software formal analysis writing original draft visualization m

2334,flooding of settlements is a growing concern in europe also in agricultural areas restoration and installation of vegetated landscape elements vle such as hedges lines of trees and grass buffers along the parcel boundaries is increasingly recognized as a way to mitigate downstream flood risk however there is a lack of scientific evidence to support their implementation we used the landlab modelling framework to gain knowledge about the importance of the presence and characteristics of vles for the hydrological response in a 26 ha undulating watershed representative for the belgian loess belt for which a multitude of vle scenarios were developed our model results demonstrated that the total runoff volume the peak discharge rate and its lag time in such small watersheds are mainly controlled by the density of the vle objects and their upstream area first and foremost we demonstrated a negative correlation between the discharge volume and peak discharge rate and the density of the vle objects and their upstream area a positive correlation was observed between the lag time and density of the vle objects for both dry and wet soils and between the lag tag time and upstream area for dry soils further we found that the impact of the value of the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil covered by the vle became increasingly important with increasing soil wetness with the hydraulic conductivity being negatively correlated with the discharge volume and peak discharge rate the impact of hydraulic conductivity on the lag time was limited a negative correlation between hydraulic conductivity and lag time for intermediate wet soils was demonstrated our model results also showed that the roughness expressed as the manning n coefficient of the soil underneath a vle and the spatial connectivity of the vle objects have little impact on the hydrological response keywords surface runoff modeling agricultural watershed vegetated landscape element natural flood management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction extensive areas throughout europe are affected by flooding of rivers or from surface runoff this can be demonstrated by the destructive events of july 2021 in western europe that caused an estimated loss of up to 5 8 billion and over 200 deaths kreienkamp et al 2021 in the period between 1980 and 2013 almost 1500 flood and wet mass movement events happened within the european union more than half of them since 2000 eea 2017 in belgium flood events are a common occurrence in the belgian loess belt which covers about 34 10576 km2 of the belgian territory these flood events are often co determined by runoff from agricultural land between 1991 and 2004 79 of the municipalities located within the belgian loess belt were affected by floods resulting from runoff from arable land bielders et al 2003 evrard et al 2007a flood hazard is likely to increase in this region as a result of the expected global warming related changes in the frequency and magnitude of extreme precipitation events fowler et al 2021 kreienkamp et al 2021 climate smart upstream land use systems and hence climate smart land use planning are increasingly recognized as a way to mitigate downstream flood risk gabriels et al 2022 minang et al 2015 vegetated landscape elements vles such as hedges lines of trees and grass buffers are inherent components of such climate resilient agricultural land use systems burgess gamble et al 2017 ellis et al 2021 their typical geometrical arrangement following the edges of agricultural parcels creates networks of landscape elements these networks alter the parcel and catchment hydrology since they create hydrological discontinuities by impeding flow paths mérot 1999 or enhancing flow continuities exacerbating runoff hence vles alter the runoff pattern and hence affect the frequency extent depth and duration of downstream flood events horn et al 2007 klaassen and zwaard 1974 mérot 1999 richet et al 2017 the attitude of landowners towards these potential natural flood protection measures is not always positive which can partly be explained by the current lack of scientific evidence about their effectiveness bielders et al 2003 ellis et al 2021 wells et al 2020 still there is a strong positive correlation between the probability of a landowner taking flood and erosion control measures e g grass buffer strips and the probability of having experienced runoff or erosion damage during the last decade bielders et al 2003 to design evidence based climate smart landscapes quantitative information about the effect of vles on the runoff in a catchment is needed vles and their hydrological properties have been the subject of numerous studies these studies demonstrate that the effect of the vle on the infiltration capacity of the soil covered by that vle depends on the type of vles with grass buffers decreasing the infiltration capacity compared to some common crop types while hedges increase the infiltration capacity baartman et al 2020 holden et al 2019 further it was shown that vles are typically associated with higher hydraulic roughness values baartman et al 2020 richet et al 2017 this not only results in a decreased velocity of runoff but also in lower sediment transport previously these studies focused mainly on the impact of vles on runoff at the field scale holden et al 2019 richet et al 2017 wallace et al 2021 however information on these effects at a catchment scale is at least equally important as many of the off site consequences of flooding events have to be managed at a catchment scale also on the catchment scale it becomes possible to assess the effect of the geometric characteristics of the vles i e dimensions position along the concentrated flow paths and connectivity on runoff within a catchment and to investigate how these characteristics affect the rainfall runoff behaviours of the catchment with this research we aimed to gain knowledge about the importance of the presence and characteristics of vles on the hydrological response of a small watershed representative of the belgian loess belt we used a physically based distributed rainfall runoff model implemented in the landlab modelling framework barnhart et al 2020 hobley et al 2017 to quantify the effect of various configurations and characteristics of vles using a design storm willems 2013 our findings are meant to aid in the conservation and promotion of vles in an agricultural landscape in the future this is important as shown by the declining trend in the presence of vles demonstrated by the disappearance of more than half of the hedgerows between 1900 and 2002 in flanders deckers et al 2005 the specific objectives of this research were to assess the sensitivity of the hydrological modelling framework landlab barnhart et al 2020 hobley et al 2017 to changes in the hydrological properties of vles i e manning s roughness coefficient n and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the underlying soil ks to compare the magnitude and timing of the flood peak discharge rate and the total runoff volume produced by a design storm between various configurations of vles to assess the impact of contrasting initial soil moisture contents on the hydrological functioning of vles 2 methodology 2 1 rainfall runoff model the open source python coded landlab modelling framework barnhart et al 2020 hobley et al 2017 was used to simulate overland flow and infiltration in a real watershed with assumed vles this modelling framework has previously been used and validated to model catchment runoff adams et al 2017 reitman et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 overland flow in the landlab modelling framework is based on the two dimensional shallow water equations swe as is the case for many physically based hydrological models e g cea and bladé 2015 defina 2000 warnock et al 2014 the swe are a simplification of the navier stokes equations in the vertical direction and consist of two parts the conservation of mass eq 1 and the conservation of momentum eq 2 and eq 3 1 h t q x x q y y 0 2 q x t local acceleration x u q x y v q x

vector q u v m s are the velocities at x y direction z m is the bed elevation g m s 2 is the gravity acceleration and n s m1 3 is the manning s n since full shallow water models are computationally expensive some studies suggest approximating or omitting specific terms in the swe e g bates et al 2010 singh 1997 we used lisflood fp a simplified approximation of the swe that omits the convective acceleration term in eq 2 and eq 3 bates et al 2010 bates and de roo 2000 de almeida et al 2012 de almeida and bates 2013 the original python code from the landlab library modelling framework was adapted to allow defining a unique manning s n for each cell in the gridded watershed this roughness coefficient was used to drive overland flow the flow direction is determined by defining for each cell the steepest path in the four cardinal directions the outlet was selected to be the only location in the watershed where water can exit the watershed therefore all other boundary cells were set as no flux cells for each time step water losses due to infiltration were calculated after flow was routed by using the green ampt mein larson infiltration model gaml mein and larson 1971 gaml describes the infiltration rate as 4 f k e 1 ψ δ θ f where f m s is the potential infiltration rate f m is the cumulative infiltration ψ m is the capillary pressure head at the wetting front δθ m3 m3 is the difference between saturated and initial volumetric moisture content and ke m s is the effective hydraulic conductivity ke is a lumped parameter that adjusts ks to account for spatial variation in rainfall intensity and soil properties e g soil crusting surface microtopography and soil pore structure langhans et al 2010b van den putte et al 2013 the gaml describes a situation where runoff occurs only after some time i e the ponding time a minimum water depth on the surface of 1 0e 8 m that can not infiltrate was assumed this was done to avoid numerical instability of the solutions of the overland flow modelling resulting from the calculation of negative water depths as suggested by costabile et al 2012 2 2 model construction 2 2 1 study area a 26 ha agricultural watershed situated in the belgian loess belt was selected 50 72 n 5 12 e fig 1 this area has been repeatedly affected by floods as happens frequently in undulating agricultural areas on loamy soils in flanders bielders et al 2003 evrard et al 2007b the elevation in the watershed was characterized by a 2 m resolution digital elevation model dem fig 1 b altitudes range between 106 m and 120 m above sea level the majority of the land cover 94 in the study area is agricultural land i e arable land and agricultural grassland alv 2021 2 2 2 vegetation cover existing field boundary patterns were used to generate different configurations of vles the first three patterns fig 2 a c occur elsewhere in belgium and were chosen to be representative of a typical agricultural field pattern fp in the region these three patterns were selected by assessing the parcel configuration around a selection of 1000 randomly chosen agricultural fields in the region and selecting a field pattern with a small medium and large average plot size fp1 fig 2 a is characterized by smaller plots with an average field size of 1 42 ha fp2 fig 2 b is characterized by medium sized fields with an average size of 1 89 ha fp3 fig 2 c is characterized by larger fields with an average field size of 2 33 ha the fourth pattern fp4 fig 2 d was generated to have field boundaries perpendicular and parallel to the flow directions in the watershed in total 42 configurations of vles were created based on the field boundaries of fp1 fp2 fp3 and fp4 these configurations differ in the density of vles connectivity and upslope area three different values of vle density were used 87 m ha 1 40 m ha 1 and 10 m ha 1 the highest vle density represents the mean density of vles in flanders in the year 1900 while a density of 40 m ha 1 represents the average situation in 2002 deckers et al 2005 a watershed with a vle density of 10 m ha 1 represents a situation in which the density of vles in the landscape is further reduced e g due to further intensification and heavy machinery use for fp1 fp2 and fp3 four configurations per density level with a range in connectivity were generated to do this 10 000 random combinations of field borders were selected and the beta connectivity index β was calculated as 5 β e v with e the number of vle segments and v the number of vle nodes a segment was defined as a side of an agricultural field boundary with the start and end point of the segment being defined as nodes in case a start or end node of another segment was positioned along the segment the segment was split in two at the location of that node the two configurations of field borders with the highest β per density level were then selected disconnections in these two configurations were created by rotating per vle section of 60 m the middle 20 m with an angle of 90 this was done to assess the impact of the connectivity of vles without changing the density or geographical position of the vles for fp4 two configurations per density level were created one where the vles were mainly positioned along the flow direction in the watershed and one where they were located perpendicular to the modelled flow direction while in fp1 fp2 and fp3 we aimed to assess the impact of vle connectivity on runoff we focused on vle configurations positioned along with or perpendicular to the main slope in fp4 the vle configurations were rasterized by assigning the land use class vle to all pixels intersected by a vle field border all other pixels in the watershed were considered to be landscape pixels the average number of vle pixels in the watershed was 166 659 and 1400 for a density level of 10 m ha 1 40 m ha 1 and 87 m ha 1 respectively this corresponds to 0 29 1 14 and 2 34 of the total number of pixels in the watershed for all 42 vle configurations the β index eq 5 and the upslope area per meter vle were calculated the average upslope area per meter vle was calculated by assessing for each vle pixel the size of the area that directly contributes water to that pixel the sum of that area for all vle pixels was then divided by the total length of the vle objects in the watershed to obtain the average upslope area per meter vle this gives an estimation of the runoff going through the vles in the watershed with larger values indicating a larger proportion of the runoff that flows through the vle gaml parameters manning s n and other soil parameters were selected based on values found in literature and are summarized in table 1 we assumed that our watershed had a uniform loamy soil the ks initial volumetric moisture content θi and capillary pressure head at wetting front were based on values derived by van den putte et al 2013 from a dataset consisting of 350 rainfall experiments carried out on 21 arable fields in the belgian loess belt the ks was equal to 19 2 mm hr 1 which was the average effective hydraulic conductivity derived for rainfall experiments carried out in the summer period the θi was set to a value between 0 02 cm3 cm 3 and 0 29 cm3 cm 3 which are the minimum and maximum θi values measured for experiments carried out in the summer period further a θi of 0 155 cm3 cm 3 was used as a medium value of θi the capillary pressure head at wetting front used in our model equals 172 7 mm which was the average value derived for rainfall experiments carried out in the summer period the manning s n was set to 0 08 s m 1 3 this value was based on the value measured by takken et al 1999 for land with the maize crop maize was selected as the only land cover type maize is the crop type with the largest spatial extent in flanders alv 2021 the vles were accounted for in the hydrological model by assigning adjusted values of ks and of manning s n to vle pixels three different values for ks for the soil under the vles were selected the first value was equal to 102 4 mm hr 1 which is representative of loamy soils under hedges holden et al 2019 the second value was equal to 20 mm hr 1 which is representative of loamy soils under grass buffers baartman et al 2020 evrard et al 2009 as a third value an intermediate value was chosen i e 51 2 mm hr 1 further also three values of the manning s n linked with vles were selected we used 0 43 s m 1 3 and 0 55 s m 1 3 which are the minimum and maximum values of manning s n for hedgerows calculated by richet et al 2017 further we also used a manning s n of 0 30 s m 1 3 which is the roughness coefficient associated with grass buffers baartman et al 2020 2 2 3 precipitation data this study uses a design storm i e a hypothetical rainfall event associated with a specific duration and return period as precipitation input in the model such design storms are often used for flood risk assessments jiang et al 2019 the 2 hour spatially uniform design storm with a 50 year return period used in this study was calculated based on the intensity durationfrequency idf relationship derived from the uccle 10 min rainfall time series demarée 2003 for the period 1898 2007 willems 2013 the calculation was done by using a frequency based method that constructs the hyetograph from the entire idf curve krvavica and rubinić 2020 the idf relationship was adjusted to account for multidecadal climate oscillations willems 2013 the peak intensity of the rainfall event was equal to 127 87 mm hr 1 while the total rainfall volume over the catchment in the considered 2 hour period was around 11000 m3 2 3 model application the rainfall runoff model described in section 2 1 was applied for 378 vle scenarios using python version 3 9 7 these scenarios were derived by combining varying landscape patterns different levels of vle density connectivity and values of ks and manning s n associated with the vle objects appendix a the 378 scenarios were run for θi equal to 0 02 m3 m3 0 155 m3 m3 and 0 29 m3 m3 hereafter referred to dry intermediate wet and wet soils while the 50 year return period design storm had a length of 2 h the total model run time was set for an additional 2 h after rainfall ceased to allow all runoff water to either reach the outlet of the watershed or infiltrate after each model run the total discharge volume in m3 the peak discharge rate at the outlet in m3 per second and the lag time between the rainfall and discharge peaks in seconds were derived from the discharge time series 2 4 vle feature impact on runoff the impact of the vle features on the total discharge volume the peak discharge rate and the lag time was assessed by comparing the differences in the output variables between different values of the vle features in a multidimensional analysis on the one hand and in a one dimensional analysis on the other hand all statistical analyses were done using r software version 4 1 2 2 4 1 multidimensional analysis to take into account feature interactions and rank the importance of the impact of each considered vle feature density connectivity upslope area manning s n and ks on the output variables 9 random forest analyses were conducted one for each combination of output variable 3 and soil wetness level 3 using the randomforest package version 4 7 1 a randomly selected bootstrapped sample of 70 of the 378 scenarios was used as a training set to fit 500 classification trees the remaining 30 of the observations were used as a testing set to evaluate the predictive performance of the models the relative importance of the features within the model was determined to show the impact of each input feature on the total discharge volume the peak discharge rate and the lag time this was done by constructing the global variable importance curves using the package vivo version 0 2 1 and dalex version 2 4 1 and comparing the variable importance of each feature with the maximal variable importance in the model regression trees have previously proven to be successful to assess the relative impact of features e g poncelet et al 2017 2 4 2 one dimensional analysis for each unique combination of density manning s n and ks 14 vle configurations were created appendix a for these 14 configurations the upslope area and connectivity were derived for each of the vle features density manning s n and ks connectivity upslope area a kruskal wallis nonparametric test kruskal and wallis 1952 was used to evaluate whether at least one level of these features performed significantly different from the others using the package stats version 4 2 1 the impact of a feature on an output variable was considered significant if the p value returned by the test was lower than 0 05 if the impact of the feature was considered significant a subsequent post hoc dunn s test with a bonferroni correction was performed using the package dunn test version 1 3 5 to determine which levels of the features differ from each other these differences were considered significant if the p value returned by the test was lower than 0 05 3 results runoff simulations for the 378 scenarios at three different wetness levels resulted in 1134 hydrographs from which the discharge volume peak discharge rate and lag time were derived initial soil moisture content was shown to have a large impact on the discharge volume peak discharge rate and lag time the average modelled discharge volume for all 378 scenarios was 3 08 m3 17 01 m3 and 110 66 m3 for dry intermediate wet and wet soil respectively the average modelled peak discharge rate was 0 01 m3 s 0 02 m3 s and 0 08 m3 s respectively and the average modelled lag time was 360 32 s 593 62 s and 593 17 s respectively for dry soils discharge in the watershed is dominated by runoff from a relatively small area close to the outlet as a large portion of the runoff from areas further away from the outlet can infiltrate and will not reach the outlet this results in a discharge peak that closely follows the peak in rainfall for wet soils however a smaller proportion of the precipitation will infiltrate and more runoff will reach the outlet of the watershed runoff from areas further away from the outlet has longer travel times and therefore the peak in discharge will arrive later in time for wet soils an illustration of the hydrograph of four distinct scenarios for wet soils with the associated hyetograph is given in fig 3 the bimodal shape of the hydrographs is the result of different flow paths arriving at the outlet the flow path conveying water from an area close to the outlet of the watershed results in a peak in discharge close to the peak in the rainfall the flow path conveying water from an area at a larger distance from the outlet results in a peak of discharge later in time the vle characteristics of the four scenarios and their corresponding discharge volume peak discharge rate and lag time values are given in table 2 3 1 multidimensional analysis we used random forest regression models to take into account feature interactions and rank the importance of the impact of each considered feature on the output variables the regression models explained 98 of the variation of the output variable discharge volume for all three wetness levels between 96 and 98 of the variation of the output variable peak discharge rate and between 33 and 84 of the variation of the output variable lag time table 3 the relatively low r2 value for wet soils suggests there could be other variables influencing the lag time after a storm than the variables here considered our analysis revealed that the vle features with the highest impact on the output variables differ per output variable and soil wetness level fig 4 the vle density in the watershed and the upslope area of the vle objects were the two most important features in 7 out of 9 random forest models for explaining the total discharge volume and peak discharge rate in wet soil conditions the two most important variables were the ks value associated with the vle object and the upslope area of the vle objects the impact of connectivity of the vle network on the total discharge volume and peak discharge rate was limited but an increase of relative impact could be observed with increasing values of θi a higher impact of connectivity of the vle network on the lag time was observed where the impact of the connectivity on the lag time decreased with increasing values of θi increasing soil wetness resulted in a higher relative impact of the ks value associated with the vle object on the total discharge volume and the peak discharge rate this was not the case when the lag time was evaluated whereby the impact of the ks value was limited for wet and dry soils the manning s n associated with the vle objects had little impact on all three output variables 3 2 one dimensional analysis a kruskal wallis test was performed to identify whether at least one level of the considered vle feature performed significantly different from the others this was done for the output variable discharge volume peak discharge rate and lag time the considered vle features were vle density the connectivity of the vle configuration expressed as β the upslope area of the vles the ks associated with the soil underneath the vles and the manning s n associated with the vles the results are presented in table 4 3 2 1 effect of density of vle objects the vle density had a generally negative impact on the total discharge volume and peak discharge rate and a positive impact on the lag time the larger the vle density in the watershed the lower the total discharge volume and peak discharge rate and the larger the lag time fig 5 these effects could also be seen when the storm hydrographs for scenarios with different density levels were compared fig 3 and table 2 scenarios 1 2 3 an exception to this trend was observed when the median lag times between a vle density of 10 m ha 1 and of 40 m ha 1 for wet soils were compared in this case the lag time decreases with increasing vle density for all soil wetness levels the kruskal wallis test demonstrates that these differences were statistically significant when the discharge volume and peak discharge rate were evaluated p value 0 05 these differences were more prominent with increasing levels of initial soil moisture for the output variable lag time no statistically significant differences were found between different levels of vle density for intermediate wet soils however for dry and wet soils statistically significant differences were found p value 0 05 between different levels of vle density 3 2 2 effect of connectivity the connectivity of the vle network had little impact on the total discharge volume peak discharge rate and lag time fig 6 a kruskal wallis test showed only a statistically significant difference between different levels of connectivity for the total discharge volume and peak discharge rate for dry soils table 4 contrary to our expectations we found that increasing values of the β index i e higher connectivity in the vle network result in a higher total discharge volume and higher peak discharge rates no statistically significant differences were found between the different levels of connectivity and the lag time for dry soils nor for any of the output variables for dry or intermediate wet soils 3 2 3 effect of upslope area the upslope area had a statistically significant negative impact on the total discharge volume and peak discharge rate for dry and wet soils and a significant positive impact on the lag time for dry soils fig 7 table 4 different levels of upslope area in wet soils were shown to also have significant differences in lag time values but no uniform trend could be distinguished the post hoc dunn s test demonstrated that for the lower levels of upslope area lag time decreased with increasing values of upslope area while the highest level of upslope area was associated with significantly higher values of the lag time the effects can also be observed when the storm hydrographs for scenarios with different density levels are compared fig 3 and table 2 scenarios 1 2 while the kruskal wallis test identified significant differences in the total discharge volume and peak discharge rate between different levels of upslope area in intermediate wet soils no clear trend could be observed intermediate wet soils did not show any significant differences in lag time between different levels of upslope area 3 2 4 effect of saturated hydraulic conductivity a higher ks associated with the soil underneath the vle objects had a generally negative impact on the total discharge volume and peak discharge rate the larger the ks value the lower the total discharge volume and peak discharge rate fig 8 these effects could also be seen when the storm hydrographs for scenarios with different levels of ks values are compared fig 3 and table 2 scenarios 3 4 the differences in total discharge volume and peak discharge rate between the different ks levels were statistically not significant for dry soils table 4 the ks value associated with the vle objects was proven to have a limited impact on the lag time only for intermediate wet soils statistically significant differences could be identified for the lag time when different levels of ks were considered with increasing levels of ks resulting in a modest decrease in lag time the modelled difference between the median lag time of the lowest and highest level of ks was only 0 04 s fig 8 table 4 3 2 5 effect of manning s roughness coefficient the kruskal wallis tests revealed no statistically significant differences between the different levels of the manning s n and the three output variables fig 9 table 4 4 discussion 4 1 model construction we used the distributed rainfall runoff model implemented in the landlab modelling framework to quantify the impact of vles and their geometric and hydrological characteristics on runoff in a small watershed obviously reality was simplified in multiple ways in the model setup a spatially uniform rainfall event was assumed while in reality rainfall is heterogeneously distributed over the catchment interception of rainfall by vegetation was not taken into account neglecting the interception of rainfall that lowers the amount that reaches the soil surface these interception losses occur both at the location of the agricultural land and vle objects it was quantified that hedgerows for example can intercept up to 2 6 mm of a precipitation event herbst et al 2006 by not taking these interception losses into account the rainfall amount that reaches the soil surface was overestimated we also assumed that the soil parameters i e θi capillary pressure head at wetting front ks and manning s n were spatially uniform in our watershed these values were if available based on values found in literature reports about experimental studies done in the same region as our study area for hedgerows we did not find ks values measured in the belgian loam belt in the literature therefore we used a value measured in a loamy soil in northern england field studies usually show a large heterogeneity in soil wetness both in the horizontal and vertical dimensions merz and plate 1997 this spatial heterogeneity can be attributed to a variety of factors including variations in soil characteristics topography and water routing processes merz and plate 1997 the presence of vles also has an impact on soil moisture not only directly underneath the object but also up to 10 m beyond their peripheries wallace et al 2021 the overland flow routing and therefore the infiltration was calculated based on a 2 m resolution dem at this spatial resolution non random microtopography related variations of ks langhans et al 2010a cannot be accounted for and the model assumes water is uniformly spread over the pixel this results in an overestimation of the effective hydraulic conductivity that is dependent on the inundated fraction of the pixel and therefore also in an overestimation of the fraction of the precipitation that can infiltrate we calculated an average runoff coefficient i e the total runoff volume divided by the total precipitation volume of 0 0003 m3 m3 for θi 0 02 m3 m 3 0 0015 m3 m3 for θi 0 155 m3 m3 and 0 0101 m3 m3 for θi 0 29 m3 m3 these values are slightly lower but in the same range as the findings of evrard et al 2007b and evrard et al 2008 who conducted a hydrological study near our study area the slightly lower values of the runoff coefficients we calculated could be explained by an overestimation of the ks values used in this study hydraulic conductivity has been proven to be dependent on water depth and rainfall intensity due to non random microtopography langhans et al 2013 the ks value used for the landscape pixels which covers the vast majority of the study area was derived from rainfall experiments with an intensity of ca 45 mm h 1 van den putte et al 2013 the design storm used in this study had an intensity lower than 45 mm h 1 for 92 of the duration of the storm earlier research carried out on loam soils in belgium has demonstrated a positive correlation between rainfall intensity and hydraulic conductivity langhans et al 2010b this implies an overestimation of the ks value was made during the majority of the time covered by the modelled storm over our watershed and could have resulted in underestimated values of the runoff coefficient further ks has proven to be highly variable in the study region van den putte et al 2013 calculated a standard deviation of obtained hydraulic conductivity values of 13 4 mm h 1 for rainfall experiments carried out in the summer period this high variability could have potentially led to an overestimation of ks in our study area lastly the observed runoff coefficients were derived for a catchment in which the average slope was 24 higher compared to the study area used here catchments with higher slopes typically show higher values of the runoff coefficient de niel and willems 2019 4 2 impact of vles on runoff the impact of the vle density connectivity upslope area ks and manning s n on the modelled total discharge volume peak discharge rate and lag time was evaluated fig 4 a negative correlation was found between vle density and discharge volume and peak discharge rate and a positive correlation between vle density and lag time fig 5 these findings are in line with previous research based on field experiments where higher vle densities could be associated with increased infiltration lower discharge volumes and peak discharge rates mérot 1999 viaud et al 2005 due to longer travel times and increased infiltration the storm hydrograph is smoothed out i e the lag time is longer and the peak discharge rate is reduced in catchments with higher densities of vles mérot 1999 this is also visualized in fig 3 scenarios 1 2 3 while ks manning s n and β remain completely or nearly constant across the 3 scenarios an increase in vle density ρ results in a lower discharge volume and peak discharge rate and a larger lag time regardless of changes in upslope area therefore it is recommended that the number of vles in the agricultural landscape does not further decrease and better even increases besides testing the impact of vle density we also looked at the effect of the connectivity of vles in the landscape by creating disconnections in the vle objects in reality the connectivity of the vle network in a landscape context is interrelated with the density of that vle network denser vle networks also demonstrate a higher level of connectivity burel and baudry 2012 deckers et al 2005 by keeping the density constant we aimed at studying the effect of the connectivity independently of the vle density no strong impact of vle connectivity on catchment runoff was found fig 4 the correlations between the level of connectivity and the discharge volume on the one hand and peak discharge rate on the other hand were both weakly negative and only present when the initial soil moisture content is low fig 6 the upslope area of the vle objects showed to have a strong impact on the total discharge volume the peak discharge rate and the lag time fig 4 in both dry and wet soils we identified a negative relationship between the upslope area of the vle objects and the discharge volume and peak discharge rate this is in line with our expectations and indicates that vle objects positioned on preferential flow paths downstream in the watershed can make a greater difference when vles are associated with large values of the upslope area a large proportion of the runoff will flow to the footprint of the vle object due to the higher ks values associated with vle objects compared to the landscape pixels more water can infiltrate this is the concept behind the installation of grassed waterways where an increase of infiltration is achieved by decreasing runoff velocities through increasing the roughness and ks evrard et al 2008 the negative relationship between upslope area and peak discharge rate and the positive relationship with lag time can also be observed when the storm hydrographs were compared fig 3 scenarios 1 2 while all other vle characteristics remain constant an increase in the upslope area results in a decrease of the discharge volume and peak discharge rate and an increase in the lag time vle objects are associated with values of ks that are up to 30 times higher compared to the surrounding agricultural land holden et al 2019 which enhances infiltration we could observe this effect in our modelling results where higher values of ks associated with the vles result in a decrease of the discharge volume fig 8 we found an increase of the impact of the ks value associated with the vle object on discharge volume and peak discharge rate with increasing levels of soil wetness this is contradictory to the findings of hu et al 2015 who concluded that the impact of ks variability on runoff increased for lower θi values besides their higher ks values vle objects are also characterized by higher values of manning s n compared to surrounding agricultural land baartman et al 2020 richet et al 2017 this increase in roughness is expected to reduce the velocity of the overland flow and thereby promoting infiltration and reducing the total runoff volume ferguson and fenner 2020 we did however not see this effect in our modelling results we applied the rainfall runoff model to a relatively small watershed 26 ha to quantify the impact of vles and their characteristics on runoff by using a design storm in larger catchments the river network configuration determines which areas of the catchment have the largest impact on the discharge peak while in small catchments this peak is dominated by run off from hillslopes in response to the storm dadson et al 2017 mérot 1999 therefore it cannot be assumed that the effect of small scale interventions can simply be extrapolated to estimate the combined effect at a larger scale dadson et al 2017 5 conclusions using a distributed rainfall runoff model we demonstrated that total discharge volume peak discharge rate and lag time to peak discharge are impacted more by the density of the vle objects positioned along the parcel boundaries in the watershed and their upslope area in comparison to the vle connectivity the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil underneath the vle and the manning s n coefficient associated with the vle the initial soil wetness level does not alter this relationship fundamentally both for upslope area and vle density a negative correlation with the total discharge volume and peak discharge rate and a positive correlation with the lag time was demonstrated the relationship is not linear though e g a factor 8 7 increase in linear density leads to a reduction of some 20 in discharge volume the modelled impact of the ks value associated with the soil underneath the vle objects on the discharge volume and peak discharge rate was rather weak but increased with increasing wetness ks was shown to be negatively correlated with the discharge volume and peak discharge rate connectivity and the manning s n value associated with the vle objects had a limited impact on the modelled discharge volume peak discharge rate and lag time the connectivity of the vle network had little impact on the total discharge volume peak discharge rate and lag time we conclude that the more abundant the vle along the agricultural parcel boundaries the more rainfall is retained in the watershed hence our modelling study confirms that vles contribute to a non negligible extent to lowering the downstream flood risk and increasing the time lag to peak discharge providing more opportunities for implementing punctual security measures funding this research was

2334,flooding of settlements is a growing concern in europe also in agricultural areas restoration and installation of vegetated landscape elements vle such as hedges lines of trees and grass buffers along the parcel boundaries is increasingly recognized as a way to mitigate downstream flood risk however there is a lack of scientific evidence to support their implementation we used the landlab modelling framework to gain knowledge about the importance of the presence and characteristics of vles for the hydrological response in a 26 ha undulating watershed representative for the belgian loess belt for which a multitude of vle scenarios were developed our model results demonstrated that the total runoff volume the peak discharge rate and its lag time in such small watersheds are mainly controlled by the density of the vle objects and their upstream area first and foremost we demonstrated a negative correlation between the discharge volume and peak discharge rate and the density of the vle objects and their upstream area a positive correlation was observed between the lag time and density of the vle objects for both dry and wet soils and between the lag tag time and upstream area for dry soils further we found that the impact of the value of the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil covered by the vle became increasingly important with increasing soil wetness with the hydraulic conductivity being negatively correlated with the discharge volume and peak discharge rate the impact of hydraulic conductivity on the lag time was limited a negative correlation between hydraulic conductivity and lag time for intermediate wet soils was demonstrated our model results also showed that the roughness expressed as the manning n coefficient of the soil underneath a vle and the spatial connectivity of the vle objects have little impact on the hydrological response keywords surface runoff modeling agricultural watershed vegetated landscape element natural flood management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction extensive areas throughout europe are affected by flooding of rivers or from surface runoff this can be demonstrated by the destructive events of july 2021 in western europe that caused an estimated loss of up to 5 8 billion and over 200 deaths kreienkamp et al 2021 in the period between 1980 and 2013 almost 1500 flood and wet mass movement events happened within the european union more than half of them since 2000 eea 2017 in belgium flood events are a common occurrence in the belgian loess belt which covers about 34 10576 km2 of the belgian territory these flood events are often co determined by runoff from agricultural land between 1991 and 2004 79 of the municipalities located within the belgian loess belt were affected by floods resulting from runoff from arable land bielders et al 2003 evrard et al 2007a flood hazard is likely to increase in this region as a result of the expected global warming related changes in the frequency and magnitude of extreme precipitation events fowler et al 2021 kreienkamp et al 2021 climate smart upstream land use systems and hence climate smart land use planning are increasingly recognized as a way to mitigate downstream flood risk gabriels et al 2022 minang et al 2015 vegetated landscape elements vles such as hedges lines of trees and grass buffers are inherent components of such climate resilient agricultural land use systems burgess gamble et al 2017 ellis et al 2021 their typical geometrical arrangement following the edges of agricultural parcels creates networks of landscape elements these networks alter the parcel and catchment hydrology since they create hydrological discontinuities by impeding flow paths mérot 1999 or enhancing flow continuities exacerbating runoff hence vles alter the runoff pattern and hence affect the frequency extent depth and duration of downstream flood events horn et al 2007 klaassen and zwaard 1974 mérot 1999 richet et al 2017 the attitude of landowners towards these potential natural flood protection measures is not always positive which can partly be explained by the current lack of scientific evidence about their effectiveness bielders et al 2003 ellis et al 2021 wells et al 2020 still there is a strong positive correlation between the probability of a landowner taking flood and erosion control measures e g grass buffer strips and the probability of having experienced runoff or erosion damage during the last decade bielders et al 2003 to design evidence based climate smart landscapes quantitative information about the effect of vles on the runoff in a catchment is needed vles and their hydrological properties have been the subject of numerous studies these studies demonstrate that the effect of the vle on the infiltration capacity of the soil covered by that vle depends on the type of vles with grass buffers decreasing the infiltration capacity compared to some common crop types while hedges increase the infiltration capacity baartman et al 2020 holden et al 2019 further it was shown that vles are typically associated with higher hydraulic roughness values baartman et al 2020 richet et al 2017 this not only results in a decreased velocity of runoff but also in lower sediment transport previously these studies focused mainly on the impact of vles on runoff at the field scale holden et al 2019 richet et al 2017 wallace et al 2021 however information on these effects at a catchment scale is at least equally important as many of the off site consequences of flooding events have to be managed at a catchment scale also on the catchment scale it becomes possible to assess the effect of the geometric characteristics of the vles i e dimensions position along the concentrated flow paths and connectivity on runoff within a catchment and to investigate how these characteristics affect the rainfall runoff behaviours of the catchment with this research we aimed to gain knowledge about the importance of the presence and characteristics of vles on the hydrological response of a small watershed representative of the belgian loess belt we used a physically based distributed rainfall runoff model implemented in the landlab modelling framework barnhart et al 2020 hobley et al 2017 to quantify the effect of various configurations and characteristics of vles using a design storm willems 2013 our findings are meant to aid in the conservation and promotion of vles in an agricultural landscape in the future this is important as shown by the declining trend in the presence of vles demonstrated by the disappearance of more than half of the hedgerows between 1900 and 2002 in flanders deckers et al 2005 the specific objectives of this research were to assess the sensitivity of the hydrological modelling framework landlab barnhart et al 2020 hobley et al 2017 to changes in the hydrological properties of vles i e manning s roughness coefficient n and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the underlying soil ks to compare the magnitude and timing of the flood peak discharge rate and the total runoff volume produced by a design storm between various configurations of vles to assess the impact of contrasting initial soil moisture contents on the hydrological functioning of vles 2 methodology 2 1 rainfall runoff model the open source python coded landlab modelling framework barnhart et al 2020 hobley et al 2017 was used to simulate overland flow and infiltration in a real watershed with assumed vles this modelling framework has previously been used and validated to model catchment runoff adams et al 2017 reitman et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 overland flow in the landlab modelling framework is based on the two dimensional shallow water equations swe as is the case for many physically based hydrological models e g cea and bladé 2015 defina 2000 warnock et al 2014 the swe are a simplification of the navier stokes

vector q u v m s are the velocities at x y direction z m is the bed elevation g m s 2 is the gravity acceleration and n s m1 3 is the manning s n since full shallow water models are computationally expensive some studies suggest approximating or omitting specific terms in the swe e g bates et al 2010 singh 1997 we used lisflood fp a simplified approximation of the swe that omits the convective acceleration term in eq 2 and eq 3 bates et al 2010 bates and de roo 2000 de almeida et al 2012 de almeida and bates 2013 the original python code from the landlab library modelling framework was adapted to allow defining a unique manning s n for each cell in the gridded watershed this roughness coefficient was used to drive overland flow the flow direction is determined by defining for each cell the steepest path in the four cardinal directions the outlet was selected to be the only location in the watershed where water can exit the watershed therefore all other boundary cells were set as no flux cells for each time step water losses due to infiltration were calculated after flow was routed by using the green ampt mein larson infiltration model gaml mein and larson 1971 gaml describes the infiltration rate as 4 f k e 1 ψ δ θ f where f m s is the potential infiltration rate f m is the cumulative infiltration ψ m is the capillary pressure head at the wetting front δθ m3 m3 is the difference between saturated and initial volumetric moisture content and ke m s is the effective hydraulic conductivity ke is a lumped parameter that adjusts ks to account for spatial variation in rainfall intensity and soil properties e g soil crusting surface microtopography and soil pore structure langhans et al 2010b van den putte et al 2013 the gaml describes a situation where runoff occurs only after some time i e the ponding time a minimum water depth on the surface of 1 0e 8 m that can not infiltrate was assumed this was done to avoid numerical instability of the solutions of the overland flow modelling resulting from the calculation of negative water depths as suggested by costabile et al 2012 2 2 model construction 2 2 1 study area a 26 ha agricultural watershed situated in the belgian loess belt was selected 50 72 n 5 12 e fig 1 this area has been repeatedly affected by floods as happens frequently in undulating agricultural areas on loamy soils in flanders bielders et al 2003 evrard et al 2007b the elevation in the watershed was characterized by a 2 m resolution digital elevation model dem fig 1 b altitudes range between 106 m and 120 m above sea level the majority of the land cover 94 in the study area is agricultural land i e arable land and agricultural grassland alv 2021 2 2 2 vegetation cover existing field boundary patterns were used to generate different configurations of vles the first three patterns fig 2 a c occur elsewhere in belgium and were chosen to be representative of a typical agricultural field pattern fp in the region these three patterns were selected by assessing the parcel configuration around a selection of 1000 randomly chosen agricultural fields in the region and selecting a field pattern with a small medium and large average plot size fp1 fig 2 a is characterized by smaller plots with an average field size of 1 42 ha fp2 fig 2 b is characterized by medium sized fields with an average size of 1 89 ha fp3 fig 2 c is characterized by larger fields with an average field size of 2 33 ha the fourth pattern fp4 fig 2 d was generated to have field boundaries perpendicular and parallel to the flow directions in the watershed in total 42 configurations of vles were created based on the field boundaries of fp1 fp2 fp3 and fp4 these configurations differ in the density of vles connectivity and upslope area three different values of vle density were used 87 m ha 1 40 m ha 1 and 10 m ha 1 the highest vle density represents the mean density of vles in flanders in the year 1900 while a density of 40 m ha 1 represents the average situation in 2002 deckers et al 2005 a watershed with a vle density of 10 m ha 1 represents a situation in which the density of vles in the landscape is further reduced e g due to further intensification and heavy machinery use for fp1 fp2 and fp3 four configurations per density level with a range in connectivity were generated to do this 10 000 random combinations of field borders were selected and the beta connectivity index β was calculated as 5 β e v with e the number of vle segments and v the number of vle nodes a segment was defined as a side of an agricultural field boundary with the start and end point of the segment being defined as nodes in case a start or end node of another segment was positioned along the segment the segment was split in two at the location of that node the two configurations of field borders with the highest β per density level were then selected disconnections in these two configurations were created by rotating per vle section of 60 m the middle 20 m with an angle of 90 this was done to assess the impact of the connectivity of vles without changing the density or geographical position of the vles for fp4 two configurations per density level were created one where the vles were mainly positioned along the flow direction in the watershed and one where they were located perpendicular to the modelled flow direction while in fp1 fp2 and fp3 we aimed to assess the impact of vle connectivity on runoff we focused on vle configurations positioned along with or perpendicular to the main slope in fp4 the vle configurations were rasterized by assigning the land use class vle to all pixels intersected by a vle field border all other pixels in the watershed were considered to be landscape pixels the average number of vle pixels in the watershed was 166 659 and 1400 for a density level of 10 m ha 1 40 m ha 1 and 87 m ha 1 respectively this corresponds to 0 29 1 14 and 2 34 of the total number of pixels in the watershed for all 42 vle configurations the β index eq 5 and the upslope area per meter vle were calculated the average upslope area per meter vle was calculated by assessing for each vle pixel the size of the area that directly contributes water to that pixel the sum of that area for all vle pixels was then divided by the total length of the vle objects in the watershed to obtain the average upslope area per meter vle this gives an estimation of the runoff going through the vles in the watershed with larger values indicating a larger proportion of the runoff that flows through the vle gaml parameters manning s n and other soil parameters were selected based on values found in literature and are summarized in table 1 we assumed that our watershed had a uniform loamy soil the ks initial volumetric moisture content θi and capillary pressure head at wetting front were based on values derived by van den putte et al 2013 from a dataset consisting of 350 rainfall experiments carried out on 21 arable fields in the belgian loess belt the ks was equal to 19 2 mm hr 1 which was the average effective hydraulic conductivity derived for rainfall experiments carried out in the summer period the θi was set to a value between 0 02 cm3 cm 3 and 0 29 cm3 cm 3 which are the minimum and maximum θi values measured for experiments carried out in the summer period further a θi of 0 155 cm3 cm 3 was used as a medium value of θi the capillary pressure head at wetting front used in our model equals 172 7 mm which was the average value derived for rainfall experiments carried out in the summer period the manning s n was set to 0 08 s m 1 3 this value was based on the value measured by takken et al 1999 for land with the maize crop maize was selected as the only land cover type maize is the crop type with the largest spatial extent in flanders alv 2021 the vles were accounted for in the hydrological model by assigning adjusted values of ks and of manning s n to vle pixels three different values for ks for the soil under the vles were selected the first value was equal to 102 4 mm hr 1 which is representative of loamy soils under hedges holden et al 2019 the second value was equal to 20 mm hr 1 which is representative of loamy soils under grass buffers baartman et al 2020 evrard et al 2009 as a third value an intermediate value was chosen i e 51 2 mm hr 1 further also three values of the manning s n linked with vles were selected we used 0 43 s m 1 3 and 0 55 s m 1 3 which are the minimum and maximum values of manning s n for hedgerows calculated by richet et al 2017 further we also used a manning s n of 0 30 s m 1 3 which is the roughness coefficient associated with grass buffers baartman et al 2020 2 2 3 precipitation data this study uses a design storm i e a hypothetical rainfall event associated with a specific duration and return period as precipitation input in the model such design storms are often used for flood risk assessments jiang et al 2019 the 2 hour spatially uniform design storm with a 50 year return period used in this study was calculated based on the intensity durationfrequency idf relationship derived from the uccle 10 min rainfall time series demarée 2003 for the period 1898 2007 willems 2013 the calculation was done by using a frequency based method that constructs the hyetograph from the entire idf curve krvavica and rubinić 2020 the idf relationship was adjusted to account for multidecadal climate oscillations willems 2013 the peak intensity of the rainfall event was equal to 127 87 mm hr 1 while the total rainfall volume over the catchment in the considered 2 hour period was around 11000 m3 2 3 model application the rainfall runoff model described in section 2 1 was applied for 378 vle scenarios using python version 3 9 7 these scenarios were derived by combining varying landscape patterns different levels of vle density connectivity and values of ks and manning s n associated with the vle objects appendix a the 378 scenarios were run for θi equal to 0 02 m3 m3 0 155 m3 m3 and 0 29 m3 m3 hereafter referred to dry intermediate wet and wet soils while the 50 year return period design storm had a length of 2 h the total model run time was set for an additional 2 h after rainfall ceased to allow all runoff water to either reach the outlet of the watershed or infiltrate after each model run the total discharge volume in m3 the peak discharge rate at the outlet in m3 per second and the lag time between the rainfall and discharge peaks in seconds were derived from the discharge time series 2 4 vle feature impact on runoff the impact of the vle features on the total discharge volume the peak discharge rate and the lag time was assessed by comparing the differences in the output variables between different values of the vle features in a multidimensional analysis on the one hand and in a one dimensional analysis on the other hand all statistical analyses were done using r software version 4 1 2 2 4 1 multidimensional analysis to take into account feature interactions and rank the importance of the impact of each considered vle feature density connectivity upslope area manning s n and ks on the output variables 9 random forest analyses were conducted one for each combination of output variable 3 and soil wetness level 3 using the randomforest package version 4 7 1 a randomly selected bootstrapped sample of 70 of the 378 scenarios was used as a training set to fit 500 classification trees the remaining 30 of the observations were used as a testing set to evaluate the predictive performance of the models the relative importance of the features within the model was determined to show the impact of each input feature on the total discharge volume the peak discharge rate and the lag time this was done by constructing the global variable importance curves using the package vivo version 0 2 1 and dalex version 2 4 1 and comparing the variable importance of each feature with the maximal variable importance in the model regression trees have previously proven to be successful to assess the relative impact of features e g poncelet et al 2017 2 4 2 one dimensional analysis for each unique combination of density manning s n and ks 14 vle configurations were created appendix a for these 14 configurations the upslope area and connectivity were derived for each of the vle features density manning s n and ks connectivity upslope area a kruskal wallis nonparametric test kruskal and wallis 1952 was used to evaluate whether at least one level of these features performed significantly different from the others using the package stats version 4 2 1 the impact of a feature on an output variable was considered significant if the p value returned by the test was lower than 0 05 if the impact of the feature was considered significant a subsequent post hoc dunn s test with a bonferroni correction was performed using the package dunn test version 1 3 5 to determine which levels of the features differ from each other these differences were considered significant if the p value returned by the test was lower than 0 05 3 results runoff simulations for the 378 scenarios at three different wetness levels resulted in 1134 hydrographs from which the discharge volume peak discharge rate and lag time were derived initial soil moisture content was shown to have a large impact on the discharge volume peak discharge rate and lag time the average modelled discharge volume for all 378 scenarios was 3 08 m3 17 01 m3 and 110 66 m3 for dry intermediate wet and wet soil respectively the average modelled peak discharge rate was 0 01 m3 s 0 02 m3 s and 0 08 m3 s respectively and the average modelled lag time was 360 32 s 593 62 s and 593 17 s respectively for dry soils discharge in the watershed is dominated by runoff from a relatively small area close to the outlet as a large portion of the runoff from areas further away from the outlet can infiltrate and will not reach the outlet this results in a discharge peak that closely follows the peak in rainfall for wet soils however a smaller proportion of the precipitation will infiltrate and more runoff will reach the outlet of the watershed runoff from areas further away from the outlet has longer travel times and therefore the peak in discharge will arrive later in time for wet soils an illustration of the hydrograph of four distinct scenarios for wet soils with the associated hyetograph is given in fig 3 the bimodal shape of the hydrographs is the result of different flow paths arriving at the outlet the flow path conveying water from an area close to the outlet of the watershed results in a peak in discharge close to the peak in the rainfall the flow path conveying water from an area at a larger distance from the outlet results in a peak of discharge later in time the vle characteristics of the four scenarios and their corresponding discharge volume peak discharge rate and lag time values are given in table 2 3 1 multidimensional analysis we used random forest regression models to take into account feature interactions and rank the importance of the impact of each considered feature on the output variables the regression models explained 98 of the variation of the output variable discharge volume for all three wetness levels between 96 and 98 of the variation of the output variable peak discharge rate and between 33 and 84 of the variation of the output variable lag time table 3 the relatively low r2 value for wet soils suggests there could be other variables influencing the lag time after a storm than the variables here considered our analysis revealed that the vle features with the highest impact on the output variables differ per output variable and soil wetness level fig 4 the vle density in the watershed and the upslope area of the vle objects were the two most important features in 7 out of 9 random forest models for explaining the total discharge volume and peak discharge rate in wet soil conditions the two most important variables were the ks value associated with the vle object and the upslope area of the vle objects the impact of connectivity of the vle network on the total discharge volume and peak discharge rate was limited but an increase of relative impact could be observed with increasing values of θi a higher impact of connectivity of the vle network on the lag time was observed where the impact of the connectivity on the lag time decreased with increasing values of θi increasing soil wetness resulted in a higher relative impact of the ks value associated with the vle object on the total discharge volume and the peak discharge rate this was not the case when the lag time was evaluated whereby the impact of the ks value was limited for wet and dry soils the manning s n associated with the vle objects had little impact on all three output variables 3 2 one dimensional analysis a kruskal wallis test was performed to identify whether at least one level of the considered vle feature performed significantly different from the others this was done for the output variable discharge volume peak discharge rate and lag time the considered vle features were vle density the connectivity of the vle configuration expressed as β the upslope area of the vles the ks associated with the soil underneath the vles and the manning s n associated with the vles the results are presented in table 4 3 2 1 effect of density of vle objects the vle density had a generally negative impact on the total discharge volume and peak discharge rate and a positive impact on the lag time the larger the vle density in the watershed the lower the total discharge volume and peak discharge rate and the larger the lag time fig 5 these effects could also be seen when the storm hydrographs for scenarios with different density levels were compared fig 3 and table 2 scenarios 1 2 3 an exception to this trend was observed when the median lag times between a vle density of 10 m ha 1 and of 40 m ha 1 for wet soils were compared in this case the lag time decreases with increasing vle density for all soil wetness levels the kruskal wallis test demonstrates that these differences were statistically significant when the discharge volume and peak discharge rate were evaluated p value 0 05 these differences were more prominent with increasing levels of initial soil moisture for the output variable lag time no statistically significant differences were found between different levels of vle density for intermediate wet soils however for dry and wet soils statistically significant differences were found p value 0 05 between different levels of vle density 3 2 2 effect of connectivity the connectivity of the vle network had little impact on the total discharge volume peak discharge rate and lag time fig 6 a kruskal wallis test showed only a statistically significant difference between different levels of connectivity for the total discharge volume and peak discharge rate for dry soils table 4 contrary to our expectations we found that increasing values of the β index i e higher connectivity in the vle network result in a higher total discharge volume and higher peak discharge rates no statistically significant differences were found between the different levels of connectivity and the lag time for dry soils nor for any of the output variables for dry or intermediate wet soils 3 2 3 effect of upslope area the upslope area had a statistically significant negative impact on the total discharge volume and peak discharge rate for dry and wet soils and a significant positive impact on the lag time for dry soils fig 7 table 4 different levels of upslope area in wet soils were shown to also have significant differences in lag time values but no uniform trend could be distinguished the post hoc dunn s test demonstrated that for the lower levels of upslope area lag time decreased with increasing values of upslope area while the highest level of upslope area was associated with significantly higher values of the lag time the effects can also be observed when the storm hydrographs for scenarios with different density levels are compared fig 3 and table 2 scenarios 1 2 while the kruskal wallis test identified significant differences in the total discharge volume and peak discharge rate between different levels of upslope area in intermediate wet soils no clear trend could be observed intermediate wet soils did not show any significant differences in lag time between different levels of upslope area 3 2 4 effect of saturated hydraulic conductivity a higher ks associated with the soil underneath the vle objects had a generally negative impact on the total discharge volume and peak discharge rate the larger the ks value the lower the total discharge volume and peak discharge rate fig 8 these effects could also be seen when the storm hydrographs for scenarios with different levels of ks values are compared fig 3 and table 2 scenarios 3 4 the differences in total discharge volume and peak discharge rate between the different ks levels were statistically not significant for dry soils table 4 the ks value associated with the vle objects was proven to have a limited impact on the lag time only for intermediate wet soils statistically significant differences could be identified for the lag time when different levels of ks were considered with increasing levels of ks resulting in a modest decrease in lag time the modelled difference between the median lag time of the lowest and highest level of ks was only 0 04 s fig 8 table 4 3 2 5 effect of manning s roughness coefficient the kruskal wallis tests revealed no statistically significant differences between the different levels of the manning s n and the three output variables fig 9 table 4 4 discussion 4 1 model construction we used the distributed rainfall runoff model implemented in the landlab modelling framework to quantify the impact of vles and their geometric and hydrological characteristics on runoff in a small watershed obviously reality was simplified in multiple ways in the model setup a spatially uniform rainfall event was assumed while in reality rainfall is heterogeneously distributed over the catchment interception of rainfall by vegetation was not taken into account neglecting the interception of rainfall that lowers the amount that reaches the soil surface these interception losses occur both at the location of the agricultural land and vle objects it was quantified that hedgerows for example can intercept up to 2 6 mm of a precipitation event herbst et al 2006 by not taking these interception losses into account the rainfall amount that reaches the soil surface was overestimated we also assumed that the soil parameters i e θi capillary pressure head at wetting front ks and manning s n were spatially uniform in our watershed these values were if available based on values found in literature reports about experimental studies done in the same region as our study area for hedgerows we did not find ks values measured in the belgian loam belt in the literature therefore we used a value measured in a loamy soil in northern england field studies usually show a large heterogeneity in soil wetness both in the horizontal and vertical dimensions merz and plate 1997 this spatial heterogeneity can be attributed to a variety of factors including variations in soil characteristics topography and water routing processes merz and plate 1997 the presence of vles also has an impact on soil moisture not only directly underneath the object but also up to 10 m beyond their peripheries wallace et al 2021 the overland flow routing and therefore the infiltration was calculated based on a 2 m resolution dem at this spatial resolution non random microtopography related variations of ks langhans et al 2010a cannot be accounted for and the model assumes water is uniformly spread over the pixel this results in an overestimation of the effective hydraulic conductivity that is dependent on the inundated fraction of the pixel and therefore also in an overestimation of the fraction of the precipitation that can infiltrate we calculated an average runoff coefficient i e the total runoff volume divided by the total precipitation volume of 0 0003 m3 m3 for θi 0 02 m3 m 3 0 0015 m3 m3 for θi 0 155 m3 m3 and 0 0101 m3 m3 for θi 0 29 m3 m3 these values are slightly lower but in the same range as the findings of evrard et al 2007b and evrard et al 2008 who conducted a hydrological study near our study area the slightly lower values of the runoff coefficients we calculated could be explained by an overestimation of the ks values used in this study hydraulic conductivity has been proven to be dependent on water depth and rainfall intensity due to non random microtopography langhans et al 2013 the ks value used for the landscape pixels which covers the vast majority of the study area was derived from rainfall experiments with an intensity of ca 45 mm h 1 van den putte et al 2013 the design storm used in this study had an intensity lower than 45 mm h 1 for 92 of the duration of the storm earlier research carried out on loam soils in belgium has demonstrated a positive correlation between rainfall intensity and hydraulic conductivity langhans et al 2010b this implies an overestimation of the ks value was made during the majority of the time covered by the modelled storm over our watershed and could have resulted in underestimated values of the runoff coefficient further ks has proven to be highly variable in the study region van den putte et al 2013 calculated a standard deviation of obtained hydraulic conductivity values of 13 4 mm h 1 for rainfall experiments carried out in the summer period this high variability could have potentially led to an overestimation of ks in our study area lastly the observed runoff coefficients were derived for a catchment in which the average slope was 24 higher compared to the study area used here catchments with higher slopes typically show higher values of the runoff coefficient de niel and willems 2019 4 2 impact of vles on runoff the impact of the vle density connectivity upslope area ks and manning s n on the modelled total discharge volume peak discharge rate and lag time was evaluated fig 4 a negative correlation was found between vle density and discharge volume and peak discharge rate and a positive correlation between vle density and lag time fig 5 these findings are in line with previous research based on field experiments where higher vle densities could be associated with increased infiltration lower discharge volumes and peak discharge rates mérot 1999 viaud et al 2005 due to longer travel times and increased infiltration the storm hydrograph is smoothed out i e the lag time is longer and the peak discharge rate is reduced in catchments with higher densities of vles mérot 1999 this is also visualized in fig 3 scenarios 1 2 3 while ks manning s n and β remain completely or nearly constant across the 3 scenarios an increase in vle density ρ results in a lower discharge volume and peak discharge rate and a larger lag time regardless of changes in upslope area therefore it is recommended that the number of vles in the agricultural landscape does not further decrease and better even increases besides testing the impact of vle density we also looked at the effect of the connectivity of vles in the landscape by creating disconnections in the vle objects in reality the connectivity of the vle network in a landscape context is interrelated with the density of that vle network denser vle networks also demonstrate a higher level of connectivity burel and baudry 2012 deckers et al 2005 by keeping the density constant we aimed at studying the effect of the connectivity independently of the vle density no strong impact of vle connectivity on catchment runoff was found fig 4 the correlations between the level of connectivity and the discharge volume on the one hand and peak discharge rate on the other hand were both weakly negative and only present when the initial soil moisture content is low fig 6 the upslope area of the vle objects showed to have a strong impact on the total discharge volume the peak discharge rate and the lag time fig 4 in both dry and wet soils we identified a negative relationship between the upslope area of the vle objects and the discharge volume and peak discharge rate this is in line with our expectations and indicates that vle objects positioned on preferential flow paths downstream in the watershed can make a greater difference when vles are associated with large values of the upslope area a large proportion of the runoff will flow to the footprint of the vle object due to the higher ks values associated with vle objects compared to the landscape pixels more water can infiltrate this is the concept behind the installation of grassed waterways where an increase of infiltration is achieved by decreasing runoff velocities through increasing the roughness and ks evrard et al 2008 the negative relationship between upslope area and peak discharge rate and the positive relationship with lag time can also be observed when the storm hydrographs were compared fig 3 scenarios 1 2 while all other vle characteristics remain constant an increase in the upslope area results in a decrease of the discharge volume and peak discharge rate and an increase in the lag time vle objects are associated with values of ks that are up to 30 times higher compared to the surrounding agricultural land holden et al 2019 which enhances infiltration we could observe this effect in our modelling results where higher values of ks associated with the vles result in a decrease of the discharge volume fig 8 we found an increase of the impact of the ks value associated with the vle object on discharge volume and peak discharge rate with increasing levels of soil wetness this is contradictory to the findings of hu et al 2015 who concluded that the impact of ks variability on runoff increased for lower θi values besides their higher ks values vle objects are also characterized by higher values of manning s n compared to surrounding agricultural land baartman et al 2020 richet et al 2017 this increase in roughness is expected to reduce the velocity of the overland flow and thereby promoting infiltration and reducing the total runoff volume ferguson and fenner 2020 we did however not see this effect in our modelling results we applied the rainfall runoff model to a relatively small watershed 26 ha to quantify the impact of vles and their characteristics on runoff by using a design storm in larger catchments the river network configuration determines which areas of the catchment have the largest impact on the discharge peak while in small catchments this peak is dominated by run off from hillslopes in response to the storm dadson et al 2017 mérot 1999 therefore it cannot be assumed that the effect of small scale interventions can simply be extrapolated to estimate the combined effect at a larger scale dadson et al 2017 5 conclusions using a distributed rainfall runoff model we demonstrated that total discharge volume peak discharge rate and lag time to peak discharge are impacted more by the density of the vle objects positioned along the parcel boundaries in the watershed and their upslope area in comparison to the vle connectivity the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil underneath the vle and the manning s n coefficient associated with the vle the initial soil wetness level does not alter this relationship fundamentally both for upslope area and vle density a negative correlation with the total discharge volume and peak discharge rate and a positive correlation with the lag time was demonstrated the relationship is not linear though e g a factor 8 7 increase in linear density leads to a reduction of some 20 in discharge volume the modelled impact of the ks value associated with the soil underneath the vle objects on the discharge volume and peak discharge rate was rather weak but increased with increasing wetness ks was shown to be negatively correlated with the discharge volume and peak discharge rate connectivity and the manning s n value associated with the vle objects had a limited impact on the modelled discharge volume peak discharge rate and lag time the connectivity of the vle network had little impact on the total discharge volume peak discharge rate and lag time we conclude that the more abundant the vle along the agricultural parcel boundaries the more rainfall is retained in the watershed hence our modelling study confirms that vles contribute to a non negligible extent to lowering the downstream flood risk and increasing the time lag to peak discharge providing more opportunities for implementing punctual security measures funding this research was
