9155,sub saharan africa ssa has witnessed increasing water scarcity and demand for additional water resources due to climate change however lack of information and access to irrigation scheduling decision support tools may limit smallholder farmers ability to manage irrigation water efficiently for sustainable crop production to overcome the complex nature associated with irrigation scheduling simple low cost and user friendly soil water monitoring tools such as the wetting front detector wfd have been developed but the commercial viability of these tools relies on effective demand for the services this paper assesses how information on the wetting front detector influences farmers willingness to pay wtp we find firstly that about 57 of the farmers have information about the wfd and 98 reported a wtp higher than zero secondly farmers are highly price sensitive but most are willing to pay a small amount for the wfd thirdly irrigation information increases farmers wtp for wfd by us 6 after controlling for variations existing among irrigation communities a heterogeneity analysis indicates that wtp is higher for women youth and high income earners than men adults and low income earners the results imply that increasing initial awareness and providing price subsidies for the new irrigation scheduling tool will increase future adoption keywords information constraint willingness to pay irrigation scheduling tool ghana data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction do farmers in the developing world prefer to invest in soil water monitoring tools for irrigation scheduling over traditional methods of irrigation the quantity of water to apply on farmers field and the timing of the application are important questions for farmers researchers development practitioners and policymakers irrigated farming is associated with relatively high cost of water use and maintenance cost of irrigation infrastructure in view of this understanding farmers context and their willingness to pay wtp for a low cost irrigation tool wetting front detector wfd and how the policy environment facilitate technology adoption may be beneficial to development practitioners in the design sensitization and dissemination of new technologies and tools the demand for irrigation is increasing given that a large proportion of farmers in sub saharan africa ssa depend on rain fed agriculture and irrigation serves as an adaptation option to climate change gebretsadik and romstad 2020 the growing global population poses a high demand for sustainable food production therefore the need to increase both the land area under agriculture and the demand for irrigation water to meet the growing demand aydogdu and bilgic 2016 according to grafton and hussey 2011 irrigation agriculture constitutes about 70 of global water supply and the threat of climate change is expected to further increase the share of irrigation agriculture to global water supply with this in mind development practitioners have designed development programmes to create awareness of efficient irrigation systems and low cost irrigation scheduling tools to guide smallholder farmers in making the best irrigation decisions to maximise water use efficiency and increase productivity despite the efforts in promoting these tools there is limited understanding especially in ghana on how information drives the uptake of such tools northern ghana upper east region presents a unique case given that rainfall is monomodal and characterized by a long period of drought the region has high levels of poverty although the wfd tool is effective adimassu et al 2020 it is relatively expensive compared to the traditional approach to irrigation this is likely to deter adoption especially among resource poor farmers this indicates that technology adoption is likely to be heterogenous across farmers channa et al 2019 suri 2011 this paper seeks to address three main research questions related to farmers adoption and wtp for the new irrigation tool 1 what is the demand for the new tool 2 what are the factors influencing access to information about the tool 3 what is the effect of information of the tool on farmers willingness to pay to answer these research questions our study relied on a survey of irrigation farmers in rural ghana who participated in an on farm demonstration on the irrigation tool and expressed their wtp however the wtp of the farmers were based on stated preferences due to limited funding to engage in auctions none of the participants in the demonstrations had prior knowledge and experience with the irrigation tool despite the enormous studies on technology adoption there is limited understanding on farmers wtp for wfd most of the studies estimated farmers wtp for irrigation without necessarily investigating irrigation scheduling aydogdu and bilgic 2016 gebretsadik and romstad 2020 kidane et al 2019 meunier et al 2019 olum et al 2020 rodrigues et al 2021 the closest study is abebe et al 2020 who estimated farmers wtp for the adoption of chameleon soil moisture monitoring tool in south eastern africa using a contingent valuation method they found a high demand for the tool and factors such as household characteristics neighbourhood effect cost of irrigation knowledge of use and benefits of the tool to be influencing wtp our study makes two main contributions first our study estimated the demand for wfd across a heterogenous sample none of the reviewed earlier studies estimated the demand for irrigation tools we find that farmers who have information are more highly price sensitive than those without information on water management the findings can guide development practitioners in technology targeting to reduce the cost of implementing development projects that focus on new agricultural technologies and tools second our study provides empirical insights into the factors that determine access to information and how information influences farmers wtp for a new irrigation tool that aids irrigation scheduling decisions our results show that information increases farmers wtp for wfd and factors such as socio economic institutional and location influence access to information the rest of the paper proceeds as follows we first provide background information on the wfd followed by presentation of the methods the results and discussion and conclusions follow 2 background 2 1 the irrigation tool wetting front detector wfd most farmers find it difficult to make accurate decision on when and how much water to apply to their field crops under irrigation excessive water use in irrigation systems can reduce potential yields due to leaching of micro and macronutrients vories et al 2017 fiebig and dodd 2016 low use of objective irrigation scheduling tools and insufficient irrigation are major challenge in ssa the low usage and can be attributed to several factors such as socio economics institution geographic and climatic effect information and the like abebe et al 2020 haensch et al 2019 jack 2013 foster and rosenzweig 2010 wheeler et al 2017 according to stevens 2006 as low as 18 of farmers under irrigated ecologies of south africa practice objective irrigation scheduling methods while the remainder engage in subjective methods based on their existing local knowledge intuition observation and local experience in the practice of irrigation to overcome the complex nature associated with irrigation scheduling simple low cost and user friendly soil water monitoring tools such as the wfd have been developed to help farmers manage their irrigation water and maximise the use of soil nutrients by plants for improved yields the soil water monitoring tools such as tensiometers chameleon sensors and wfd were promoted by the wagrinnova 5 5 the wagrinnova project was an eu funded project which sought to collectively create innovations across scales to enhance sustainable intensification resilience and food and nutritional security in water managed agricultural systems in west africa the project focused on sustainable intensification of agriculture the participating african countries were burkina faso ghana and senegal project to create awareness and access to irrigation scheduling tools among smallholder farmers the wfd fig 1 has a funnel shape base that can be buried in the desired rootzone of the soil stirzaker et al 2005 to inform the farmer on how deep water infiltrates the soil immediately after irrigation an indicator cap pops up when water reaches the desired soil depth informing the farmer to discontinue irrigation however local experience and knowledge of farmers on irrigation is still relevant to tell the next irrigation event since the tool only notifies on depth of irrigation water reached the wfd can be used alongside with simple soil sensors such as the chameleon sensor that sends signals of soil water status using colour depictions traditional methods such as the test and feel can be used by farmers to determine soil water status at regular intervals to inform irrigation the instrument further captures soil water solution through the funnel and stores it in a reservoir that can be extracted and monitored for salts and essential nutrients such as nitrate stirzaker 2003 stirzaker et al 2005 the price 6 6 refer to https shopsa via farm products wetting front detectors pair for more information on the price of wfd of a wfd is us 29 98 3 methods 3 1 study area the research setting for this study is the tono irrigation scheme located in the kassena nankana district of the upper east region of ghana fig 2 the region is considered as one of the poorest in ghana the kasena nankana district is located within the guinea savannah woodlands in ghana the vegetation is mainly savannah grasslands with short trees and trumps agriculture is the main activity of the inhabitants and the major crops grown are millet sorghum rice groundnuts leafy vegetables cowpea bambara beans okro cotton tomatoes and onions the main livestock reared are cattle sheep goat pigs guinea fowls fowls and other domestic animals like donkeys which serve as means of transporting farm produce and domestic activities fetching of water most of the farmers are smallholders with relatively low crop yields the main economic trees in the district are sheanut mango baobab and dawadawa generally the soils are suitable for the cultivation of several crops especially rice and vegetables ghana statistical service gss 2014 within the tono irrigation site farmers cultivate rice and vegetables both in the wet and dry seasons the soils are well drained loamy and mildly acidic and interspersed with patches of black or dark grey clay soils suitable for the cultivation of cereals legumes and vegetables 3 2 tono irrigation scheme fig 3 shows the tono irrigation scheme in the kassena nankana district the scheme was developed to promote all year round production of food crops by small scale farmers it has a gross area of 3860 ha with a potential irrigable area of 2680 ha of which 2490 ha has been developed international power company limited 2018 currently about 98 of the land is cultivated for rice the scheme has a farmer population of 2500 distributed across nine villages international power company limited 2018 the minimum average area of irrigable land accessed by farmers is 0 6 ha the irrigation company of upper region icour manages the irrigation scheme 3 3 sampling methods and data the study employs a multi stage sampling technique to sample 337 farmers consisting of participants 192 and non participant 145 of farmers in on farm demonstration of irrigation scheduling the first stage involves the purposive sampling of the tono irrigation scheme due to the stretch of the canal land area soil type topography of land crop type community and land tenure system scheme layout water supply system and drainage condition seven communities were purposively sampled in the second stage due to membership in water users association wua and gender categorization 7 7 older adults are farmers who are more than 30 years of age and youth are at or below 30 years of age older adults and youth in the final stage we employ proportional and random sampling techniques to select 337 farmers consisting of 114 adult males 92 adult females 82 young males and 49 young females we conducted a power test for the sample used for the study the power of the test is the chance to reject the null hypothesis given that the null hypothesis is false i e given that the alternative hypothesis is true following yamane 1967 the sample size n is determined as n n 1 n e 2 where n is the total population of farmers in the study area 2500 e is the margin of error 5 1 the derived margin of error of the sample size is 5 when the sample is 345 implying 95 confidence level and it is 5 1 when the sample is 337 this implies that there is 94 9 confidence in the results obtained from the sample used for the study this study relied on primary data which captured detailed information on household demographics education agricultural production system labour irrigation system challenges and opportunities income time use household water use household decision making aspirations training and social network and willingness to pay for an irrigation scheduling and solute monitoring tool the variable information captures exposure to the tool operation and labour costs effectiveness relative to farmers practice maintenance and access to the tool to complement the primary data generated through farmer interview we conducted a participatory on farm evaluation of wfd as an irrigation scheduling tool treatment in comparison with the farmers indigenous knowledge control of irrigation scheduling on rice under upland sandy loam soil conditions at bonia gaani and bui communities within the tono irrigation scheme the data captured per the demonstration include water requirements nitrate concentration and leaf chlorophyll content 3 4 empirical model information about a new agricultural technology and its effect on farmers willingness to pay wtp is a sequential decision making process which can be modeled using a two step approach varma 2018 in the first stage farmers access to information is specified as 1 g i ϑ z i μ i where g i is a latent variable representing irrigation scheduling information z i is a vector of covariates socio demographics household production and community ϑ is the vector of parameters to be estimated and μ i is the error term with mean zero and variance one varma 2018 in the second stage farmers demand or wtp for the irrigation tool is determined by socio demographics household production and community variables given the censored nature of the dependent variable wtp 8 8 some households stated wtp is zero which is not a missing data issue but a true reflection of their wtp in such instances the observations are censored and not truncated tobit model would be more appropriate to estimate the second stage equation the second stage model is specified as 2 wtp i α β g i γ x i ε i in eq 2 wtp i is the amount the farmer is willing to pay for a wfd between 0 and us 20 27 x i is the vector of socio economic characteristics that influence wtp table 1 g i represents information status of the farmer an indicator variable for whether famer participated had prior information or aware of wfd α β and γ are vectors of parameters to be estimated and ε i is the random error term we anticipate endogeneity in access to information on irrigation scheduling and solute monitoring tool due to unobserved heterogeneity among household heads and household characteristics that can potentially affect farmers wtp second there is a potential reverse causality between information and wtp farmers who have information on the irrigation decision tool are more likely to influence their wtp for the tool alternatively farmers with high wtp may be more likely to increase their search for more information regarding the use of the tool under the assumption of exogeneity in access to information the ordinary least squares ols estimation will lead to a consistent estimate of information on farmers wtp however due to the corner solution 2 08 of the farmers have zero wtp of the dependent variable estimation through ols is likely to be biased wooldridge 2010 employing the tobit specification deals with the corner solution nature of the wtp nonetheless the tobit model assumes the same underlying process for those who stated zero and those who stated values greater than zero channa et al 2019 the use of the standard instrumental variable estimation technique with two stage least squares 2sls approach will not be appropriate due to the censored nature of the farmers wtp variable porgo et al 2018 clougherty et al 2016 we employed the conditional recursive mixed process cmp developed by roodman 2011 that allows for the estimation of continuous and limited dependent variables while dealing with endogeneity issues including endogenous treatment the cmp controls the selection bias associated with unobserved factors affecting wtp by building from the seemingly unrelated regression framework and allowing for cross equation correlation of the error terms roodman 2011 4 results and discussion 4 1 descriptive statistics descriptive statistics of the variables of interest of this study is presented in table 1 about 57 of the sampled farmers participated in the on farm demonstration and thus had information on irrigation scheduling males constitute about 58 of the sample the average age of a household head is 42 years about 74 of the farmers are married and 36 of the respondents are literate the average household size is eight and the economically active household members is five the data showed that 30 of the sampled farmers are members of farmer organizations about 79 of the sampled farmers have a mobile savings account the average irrigable land area and cropland area is 2 06 ha and 1 87 ha respectively about 19 of the farmers in our sample have participated in non agricultural training the average income and asset are ghs2000 us 2703 and ghs3188 us 429 respectively the average female daily wage is gh24 us 3 24 the number of days spent in manual tillage is four days the number of days spouse support with fixing irrigation pump irrigation is one day about 24 of the farmers are time poor committed time 9 9 time poverty describes a situation where an individual works a greater number of hours committed time in the labour market than is desirable it also shows the lack of time for rest and leisure seymour et al 2019 parra and wodon 2010 bardasi and wodon 2006 in paid and unpaid work is greater than 10 5 h a day seventy three percent 73 of the sampled farmers prefer an irrigation scheduling and solute monitoring tool that is less labour intensive than labour intensive irrigation scheduling tools we present farmers wtp for the wetting front detector based on location fig 4 the graph shows variations in farmers wtp by location for example farmers in tono recorded the highest wtp value of ghs78 while farmers in biu recorded the lowest wtp value of ghs54 and the rest of the communities recorded wtp value above ghs60 fig 5 shows farmers stated wtp for the wetting front detector based on sex and age disaggregation generally males recorded relatively higher wtp for the tool than the women based on the category adult males are willing to pay the highest ghs69 followed by young males ghs64 young females ghs63 and adult females ghs61 fig 6 presents farmers wtp based on sex and age for farmers who have information on the irrigation scheduling and solute monitoring tool similarly males reported a higher wtp for the wetting front detector than the females comparing across the groups adult males recorded the highest wtp ghs70 followed by young males ghs63 adult females ghs59 and young female ghs51 comparatively adult male farmers with information recorded higher wtp for the wetting front detector than adult male farmers who did not have information about the tool fig 7 young female farmers who did not have information about the irrigation tool reported higher wtp ghs70 than young female farmers who have information similarly adult female and young male farmers who have information about the irrigation tool express lower wtp for the tool than their counterpart without information 4 2 demand for wfd fig 8 presents the demand curve for wfd which is based on the proportions of farmers who are willing to pay at each price point the demand curve is disaggregated based on access to information on the wfd generally we observe variations in farmers wtp for the wfd based on information status about 20 and 30 of the farmers who have information and those without information respectively were willing to pay between ghs100 and ghs150 for wfd an increase in the price of wfd by ghs50 decreases informed uninformed farmers demand from 84 82 to 20 29 and farmers who lacks information of the sample who are willing to purchase the wfd farmers who are informed are more price sensitive than those without information on water management ε b 1 87 ε a 1 43 4 3 participatory on farm evaluation of wfd fig 9 shows that farmers practice control relative to the use of the wfd treatment results in a higher seasonal irrigation water requirement across locations the irrigation schedule triggered by the wfd resulted in 43 2 65 3 and 13 3 water savings at gaani bonia and bui respectively compared to farmers own indigenous irrigation scheduling fig 9 the rootzone soil solute monitoring shows a high nitrate concentration under the wfd irrigated plots than the plot under farmers indigenous irrigation scheduling fig 10 irrigation schedule by the wfd consistently recorded high nitrate concentrations in the rootzone irrigation schedule by the farmers indigenous knowledge recorded lower nitrate concentration of 10 mg l 0 mg l and 50 mg l at bui gaani and bonia respectively fig 10 the low nitrate concentration recorded under farmer practice is largely due to the high volumes of irrigation water applied that led to dilution and leaching of nitrates beyond the rootzone in addition leaf chlorophyll concentration lcc an indication of plant health due to its reported linear relationship with nitrogen content was higher in the plant leaves of the wfd irrigated plots at 12 weeks after transplanting 13 85 μmol m² when compared to the farmer irrigated plot 9 83 μmol m² fig 11 the high lcc of plants within the wfd plots is as a result of the high nitrate concentration recorded in its root zones the farmer irrigated plot produced higher mean grain yield of 2 85 t ha while the wfd irrigated plot produced 2 43 t ha fig 12 the high volume of irrigation water applied under the farmer irrigated plot contributed to the increase in grain yield however irrigation water use efficiency of 1 08 kg m3 was recorded for plants in the wfd irrigated plot while 0 68 kg m3 was recorded for the farmer irrigated plot an indication of a 37 increase in efficient water use by plants under the wfd plot fig 13 in water scarce agricultural environment the wfd is preferred to maximise irrigation water use by rice farmers 4 4 estimates of information access and farmers wtp table 2 presents the estimates of the conditional recursive mixed process that shows the relationship between access to information on irrigation scheduling and solute monitoring tool and farmers wtp column 1 shows the first stage results that reports the factors influencing access to irrigation information without controlling for community fixed effects column 2 is the second stage results that shows the effect of information access on farmers wtp without controlling for community effects columns 3 and 4 shows the results of the access to irrigation information and farmers wtp equations that controls for community fixed effects generally we observe a positive effect of information on farmers wtp for wetting front detector by including the community controls we observe an improvement in the magnitude of the effect of information on farmers wtp which suggests that failure to account for community factors may underestimate the effect of information we discuss the results in columns 3 and 4 the first stage results shows that access to information on irrigation scheduling tool is significantly influenced by age ownership of savings mobile account asset and location of farmer in biu and bonia the results suggest that older household heads are more likely to have information on irrigation tools for scheduling irrigation irrigation farming is labour intensive and demanding which may be difficult for older household heads to keep up with the increasing demand in view of this they are more likely to access information on irrigation scheduling tool that may reduce their drudgery and reduce cost of water use household heads who own either a savings or mobile account are less likely to access information on irrigation scheduling tools compared to farmers in other locations farmers in biu and bonia are more likely to access information on irrigation scheduling tools the two communities are more accessible in terms of the distance to the icour and ministry of food and agriculture mofa offices access to these institutions increases farmers chance of accessing information on irrigation farming practices comparing columns 2 and 4 and including community controls in the model shows that information increases farmers wtp for a wfd from ghs35 us 5 to ghs42 us 6 the result suggests that failure to control for community fixed effects may lead to underestimation of the effect of information access on the wtp for a wfd the positive effect of information indicates that farmers value the benefits of irrigation decision tool and thus knowledge about the tool can facilitate adoption our result is consistent with several studies to understand farmers utilization of smartphones in regard to crop protection bonke et al 2018 find that information about smartphones apps significantly influences german farmers wtp for a crop protection app furthermore they find that about 93 of the farmers use smartphones for agricultural decisions in relation to weather forecast and identification of pests and diseases information access through field days increases farmers wtp for soil moisture monitoring tools abebe et al 2020 other studies have highlighted the role of information in influencing adoption attitudinal change and wtp for improved technologies toma et al 2018 yigezu et al 2018 a study by maredia et al 2019 show that field demonstrations influence farmers wtp for bean seed in tanzania and cowpea seed in ghana kokoye et al 2018 note that participation in soil testing programs influence farmers wtp for soil testing services in haiti ali et al 2020 find that providing weather information through tv radio and mobile phones in local languages influences farmers willingness to pay for weather index based insurance channa et al 2019 indicate that farmers wtp for hermetic bag is not significantly different from the medium text audio or video messages for communicating the technology but those with prior awareness of the storage technology were willing to pay relatively higher price than those previously unaware of it in contrast to our findings mastenbroek et al 2021 find that famers knowledge enhanced through randomized information treatment did not significantly influence their wtp for certified seed literacy increases farmers wtp for the wfd by ghs10 us 1 35 literacy improves the cognitive skills of individuals and enhances individual s ability to make informed decision regarding farm activities that has high potential of improving welfare outcomes the result is consistent with previous studies in africa and asia abegunde et al 2020 abebe et al 2018 aryal et al 2018 kokoye et al 2018 abdulai and huffman 2014 we observed that farmers who are members of farmer organization are willing to discount the price of the wfd by ghs15 us 2 02 while ownership of a savings or mobile money account increases farmers wtp for wfd by gfhs12 us 2 membership in a farmer organization enhances farmers collective decision in terms of access to information and technologies at a relatively low cost it is possible that such farmers would expect both financial and technical support from government or development practitioners when making purchasing decisions on inputs ownership of an account signals financial inclusion and farmers willingness to transfer risk of holding physical cash to a third party financial institutions are more likely to advance credit to farmers with access to accounts which may positively correlate with farmers wtp for an agricultural tool such as the wfd income is negatively associated with farmers wtp for the wfd the result suggests that although income improves access to information it does not necessarily increase wtp for an improved irrigation tool as household income increases there may be competing household and farm production needs household are more likely to invest their income to address most pressing needs such as food consumer goods and social activities especially within a rural setting consistent with the a priori expectation the wtp for wfd by a time poor household head is ghs18 us 2 4 the wfd is both labour and cost saving tool therefore time poor household heads are more likely to adopt and pay for the tool to reduce their drudgery with respect to irrigating their farm plots the findings suggests that time poverty can be reduced to an extent when farmers have access to the wfd however any irrigation scheduling tool that is less labour intensive is associated with a ghs9 us 1 22 decrease in farmers wtp our findings suggests that farmers are more interested in irrigation tool that is not labour intensive the findings suggest that in developing or designing any irrigation scheduling tool there is the need to factor the labour requirement component to ensure that the tool can be implemented with limited labour effort given that labour is expensive within an irrigation ecology similarly the tool must be gender sensitive for women to use we find a discounting effect in terms of the wtp across the communities relative to farmers in the yogbania community the highest lowest discounting effect is observed for farmers in the bonia chuchuliga namosa community our findings suggest that although farmers in bonia community have access to information on irrigation scheduling tools they are willing to discount the price of the tool while farmers in the chuchuliga namosa discount the price of the tool due to lack of access to information on irrigation scheduling tools the result indicates that information alone may not necessarily improve adoption of the wfd but demonstration of the tool which combines both information and practice may lead to high adoption and wtp 4 5 gender and age dimensions table 3 shows the results of information access on farmers wtp for the wfd based on sex male and female and age adult and youth dimensions columns 1 and 2 shows that results for the sex disaggregation while columns 3 and 4 shows the age disaggregation results the effect of information access on wtp for a wfd is significant among female headed households but non significant among male headed households information access increases female headed households wtp for a wfd by ghs39 us 5 27 the significant positive effect among female headed households can be attributed to two main reasons first the total drudgery paid and unpaid activities among women is relatively higher than men ghosh 2016 given that they do most of the irrigation work and have less man power and inequitable share of water resources compared to male headed households abebe et al 2020 given the multiple tasks women face they tend to be time poor martey et al 2022 orkoh et al 2020 and thus more likely to adopt a technology that will reduce their drudgery our result is consistent with aryal et al 2022 who find that female particiption in decision making increases their willing to adopt climate smart agriculture csa and therefore recommended for more training for women to increase their understanding of csa simtowe et al 2016 find high adoption of pigeon pea varieties among female farmers in malawi ghanaian women invest more in non farm activities than men kramer and lambrecht 2019 thus are more likely to invest the income in labour saving technologies second irrigation farming is associated with less risk compared to the wet season farming and the associated crop revenue is relatively high especially where costs are effectively managed due to effcient use of irrigation water for crop production women within the irrigation ecology cultivate rice and vegetables during the dry season and also serve as labour on other farms using the irrigation scheduling tool will reduce time spent in irrigation and channel the time saved in other paid activities to supplement their household income contrary to our findings hill et al 2013 finds that female headed households have lower wtp for insurance innovation while hidrobo et al 2022 find that women report lower wtp for a digital platform that provides nutrition sensitive agricultural information in ghana relative to men they find that the low wtp among females is due to the fact that women receives nutrition information from other sources in a similar study antwi agyei et al 2021 find that relatively fewer women were willing to pay for climate information than men due to resource constraint the analysis of information access on wtp for wfd based on age dimension suggests that the youth are more likely to adopt irrigation scheduling tool more speciafically information access increases the young farmers wtp for a wfd by ghs34 us 5 there is evidence that younger farmers are usually innovative risk loving and willing to try new concepts martey et al 2014 older farmers may have garnered wealth of irrigation scheduling experience through years of farming that could help them manage water efficiently antwi agyei et al 2021 in addition it is likely that older farmers are more risk averse and unwilling to pay for irrigation technologies abebe et al 2020 hill et al 2013 our result confirms the findings of antwi agyei et al 2021 and jaafar and kharroubi 2021 who reported that older farmers are less likely to access climate information and smart irrigation mobile application than younger farmers past studies kirui et al 2014 uddin et al 2014 have shown similar and consistent results while other studies kokoye et al 2018 yegbemey et al 2014 have shown contrary results due to gender disparities in access to resources finally we estimated the heterogeneity effect of information on wtp for wfd based on income status willingness to adopt wfd and aspiration 10 10 aspirations are future expectations and goals that individuals desire to achieve and they entail effort conditional on a person s belief in their own ability to change outcomes which may also depend on a person s exposure to information and access to resources bernard et al 2011 table 4 our results show that information increases farmers wtp for wfd among high income earners by ghs26 us 3 5 compared to low income earners which confirms the findings of kokoye et al 2018 and ulimwengu and sanyal 2011 the wtp for farmers who are willing to adopt wfd is ghs39 us 5 3 more than farmers who were unwilling to adopt improving access to information and demonstrating the benefits of an irrigation scheduling tool may increase farmers willingness to experiment with the tool on a small scale and subsequently scale up when the technology proves to be efficient we did not find any significant association between information access and wtp for farmers with high aspiration index our result suggests that high aspiration may not necessarily translate to adoption of soil water monitoring tools 5 conclusion precision agriculture is considered as an efficient approach to cost minimization and sustainable agricultural production most farmers find it difficult to decide on when and how much water to apply to field crops under irrigation given the information constraint they face a large proportion of farmers in irrigation ecologies use subjective approaches based on their local experience and indigenous knowledge in the practice of irrigation which may not be cost minimizing soil water monitoring tools such as the wfd are simple low cost and user friendly tools which can be integrated in the production process to optimise water use and crop yields as well as reducing overall water cost this study analyses the role of information about an irrigation scheduling tool in smallholder farmers demand for wfd in rural ghana the irrigation device can potentially reduce the cost and amount of irrigation water by providing an objective source of information on irrigation scheduling we find that 57 of the sampled farmers have irrigation information and 97 are willing to adopt the wfd about 98 of the farmers reported a wtp higher than zero this suggests that there is a high demand for soil water monitoring tools among small scale irrigators and this can be achieved with the right investment through a public private partnership an increase in the price of wfd by ghs50 decreases demand from 84 to 29 of the sample who are willing to purchase the wfd the main results indicate that irrigation information increases farmers wtp for wfd by us 6 after controlling for variations existing among the irrigation communities despite the majority of the farmers willing to adopt and pay for the wfd the low valuations indicates that they have less incentives to invest in irrigation scheduling tools which is a measure of water management when profit associated with that water management is not fully observable to farmers oliva et al 2020 based on our heterogeneity analysis we find that information increases wtp among female farmers youth high income earners and farmers who are willing to adopt the wfd however we did not find any significant effect of information on wtp for male older adults and farmers with high aspirations the main implication from our study is that increasing farmers awareness and experience in using an irrigation tool increases their wtp this suggests that focusing on economic incentives motivating and adequately resourcing extension agents and encouraging farmer learning can raise awareness and use of the tool the private sector must actively support extension to increase farmers awareness and benefits of using soil water monitoring tools for irrigation scheduling through both formal and informal exchange of information second comparing the market price and farmers wtp for the wfd implies that provision of a price payment scheme or subsidy to farmers and tax exemption to the private suppliers can significantly lead to price reduction and higher adoption commitment from government to provide enabling environment for the private sector to boost production of irrigation tools and the building capacity of farmers will not only increase adoption but increase use of the tool high adoption and use of the wfd will optimise water use at the farmer plot level and improve management of the irrigation scheme especially where climate change is a threat to sustainable crop production third outcome of the study provides the basis for targeting and promoting the tool among heterogenous population given that wtp for wfd varied across our sample such information will inform government spending of limited financial resources in supporting smallholder farmers and further guide the private sector in their irrigation investment decisions there are few limitations of our study first farmers may overstate or underestimate their wtp compared to prices in a retail market and especially within a contingent valuation framework an experimental auction may reduce the biases associated with the hypothetical situations channa et al 2019 vickery 1961 second there is limited understanding of how the medium of information about the technology influences farmers wtp for wfd despite these limitations the study has provided essential insights on how information drives the adoption of a soil water monitoring tool for irrigation scheduling within a developing country context which can be replicated in other countries with similar agroecology declaration of competing

9155,sub saharan africa ssa has witnessed increasing water scarcity and demand for additional water resources due to climate change however lack of information and access to irrigation scheduling decision support tools may limit smallholder farmers ability to manage irrigation water efficiently for sustainable crop production to overcome the complex nature associated with irrigation scheduling simple low cost and user friendly soil water monitoring tools such as the wetting front detector wfd have been developed but the commercial viability of these tools relies on effective demand for the services this paper assesses how information on the wetting front detector influences farmers willingness to pay wtp we find firstly that about 57 of the farmers have information about the wfd and 98 reported a wtp higher than zero secondly farmers are highly price sensitive but most are willing to pay a small amount for the wfd thirdly irrigation information increases farmers wtp for wfd by us 6 after controlling for variations existing among irrigation communities a heterogeneity analysis indicates that wtp is higher for women youth and high income earners than men adults and low income earners the results imply that increasing initial awareness and providing price subsidies for the new irrigation scheduling tool will increase future adoption keywords information constraint willingness to pay irrigation scheduling tool ghana data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction do farmers in the developing world prefer to invest in soil water monitoring tools for irrigation scheduling over traditional methods of irrigation the quantity of water to apply on farmers field and the timing of the application are important questions for farmers researchers development practitioners and policymakers irrigated farming is associated with relatively high cost of water use and maintenance cost of irrigation infrastructure in view of this understanding farmers context and their willingness to pay wtp for a low cost irrigation tool wetting front detector wfd and how the policy environment facilitate technology adoption may be beneficial to development practitioners in the design sensitization and dissemination of new technologies and tools the demand for irrigation is increasing given that a large proportion of farmers in sub saharan africa ssa depend on rain fed agriculture and irrigation serves as an adaptation option to climate change gebretsadik and romstad 2020 the growing global population poses a high demand for sustainable food production therefore the need to increase both the land area under agriculture and the demand for irrigation water to meet the growing demand aydogdu and bilgic 2016 according to grafton and hussey 2011 irrigation agriculture constitutes about 70 of global water supply and the threat of climate change is expected to further increase the share of irrigation agriculture to global water supply with this in mind development practitioners have designed development programmes to create awareness of efficient irrigation systems and low cost irrigation scheduling tools to guide smallholder farmers in making the best irrigation decisions to maximise water use efficiency and increase productivity despite the efforts in promoting these tools there is limited understanding especially in ghana on how information drives the uptake of such tools northern ghana upper east region presents a unique case given that rainfall is monomodal and characterized by a long period of drought the region has high levels of poverty although the wfd tool is effective adimassu et al 2020 it is relatively expensive compared to the traditional approach to irrigation this is likely to deter adoption especially among resource poor farmers this indicates that technology adoption is likely to be heterogenous across farmers channa et al 2019 suri 2011 this paper seeks to address three main research questions related to farmers adoption and wtp for the new irrigation tool 1 what is the demand for the new tool 2 what are the factors influencing access to information about the tool 3 what is the effect of information of the tool on farmers willingness to pay to answer these research questions our study relied on a survey of irrigation farmers in rural ghana who participated in an on farm demonstration on the irrigation tool and expressed their wtp however the wtp of the farmers were based on stated preferences due to limited funding to engage in auctions none of the participants in the demonstrations had prior knowledge and experience with the irrigation tool despite the enormous studies on technology adoption there is limited understanding on farmers wtp for wfd most of the studies estimated farmers wtp for irrigation without necessarily investigating irrigation scheduling aydogdu and bilgic 2016 gebretsadik and romstad 2020 kidane et al 2019 meunier et al 2019 olum et al 2020 rodrigues et al 2021 the closest study is abebe et al 2020 who estimated farmers wtp for the adoption of chameleon soil moisture monitoring tool in south eastern africa using a contingent valuation method they found a high demand for the tool and factors such as household characteristics neighbourhood effect cost of irrigation knowledge of use and benefits of the tool to be influencing wtp our study makes two main contributions first our study estimated the demand for wfd across a heterogenous sample none of the reviewed earlier studies estimated the demand for irrigation tools we find that farmers who have information are more highly price sensitive than those without information on water management the findings can guide development practitioners in technology targeting to reduce the cost of implementing development projects that focus on new agricultural technologies and tools second our study provides empirical insights into the factors that determine access to information and how information influences farmers wtp for a new irrigation tool that aids irrigation scheduling decisions our results show that information increases farmers wtp for wfd and factors such as socio economic institutional and location influence access to information the rest of the paper proceeds as follows we first provide background information on the wfd followed by presentation of the methods the results and discussion and conclusions follow 2 background 2 1 the irrigation tool wetting front detector wfd most farmers find it difficult to make accurate decision on when and how much water to apply to their field crops under irrigation excessive water use in irrigation systems can reduce potential yields due to leaching of micro and macronutrients vories et al 2017 fiebig and dodd 2016 low use of objective irrigation scheduling tools and insufficient irrigation are major challenge in ssa the low usage and can be attributed to several factors such as socio economics institution geographic and climatic effect information and the like abebe et al 2020 haensch et al 2019 jack 2013 foster and rosenzweig 2010 wheeler et al 2017 according to stevens 2006 as low as 18 of farmers under irrigated ecologies of south africa practice objective irrigation scheduling methods while the remainder engage in subjective methods based on their existing local knowledge intuition observation and local experience in the practice of irrigation to overcome the complex nature associated with irrigation scheduling simple low cost and user friendly soil water monitoring tools such as the wfd have been developed to help farmers manage their irrigation water and maximise the use of soil nutrients by plants for improved yields the soil water monitoring tools such as tensiometers chameleon sensors and wfd were promoted by the wagrinnova 5 5 the wagrinnova project was an eu funded project which sought to collectively create innovations across scales to enhance sustainable intensification resilience and food and nutritional security in water managed agricultural systems in west africa the project focused on sustainable intensification of agriculture the participating african countries were burkina faso ghana and senegal project to create awareness and access to irrigation scheduling tools among smallholder farmers the wfd fig 1 has a funnel shape base that can be buried in the desired rootzone of the soil stirzaker et al 2005 to inform the farmer on how deep water infiltrates the soil immediately after irrigation an indicator cap pops up when water reaches the desired soil depth informing the farmer to discontinue irrigation however local experience and knowledge of farmers on irrigation is still relevant to tell the next irrigation event since the tool only notifies on depth of irrigation water reached the wfd can be used alongside with simple soil sensors such as the chameleon sensor that sends signals of soil water status using colour depictions traditional methods such as the test and feel can be used by farmers to determine soil water status at regular intervals to inform irrigation the instrument further captures soil water solution through the funnel and stores it in a reservoir that can be extracted and monitored for salts and essential nutrients such as nitrate stirzaker 2003 stirzaker et al 2005 the price 6 6 refer to https shopsa via farm products wetting front detectors pair for more information on the price of wfd of a wfd is us 29 98 3 methods 3 1 study area the research setting for this study is the tono irrigation scheme located in the kassena nankana district of the upper east region of ghana fig 2 the region is considered as one of the poorest in ghana the kasena nankana district is located within the guinea savannah woodlands in ghana the vegetation is mainly savannah grasslands with short trees and trumps agriculture is the main activity of the inhabitants and the major crops grown are millet sorghum rice groundnuts leafy vegetables cowpea bambara beans okro cotton tomatoes and onions the main livestock reared are cattle sheep goat pigs guinea fowls fowls and other domestic animals like donkeys which serve as means of transporting farm produce and domestic activities fetching of water most of the farmers are smallholders with relatively low crop yields the main economic trees in the district are sheanut mango baobab and dawadawa generally the soils are suitable for the cultivation of several crops especially rice and vegetables ghana statistical service gss 2014 within the tono irrigation site farmers cultivate rice and vegetables both in the wet and dry seasons the soils are well drained loamy and mildly acidic and interspersed with patches of black or dark grey clay soils suitable for the cultivation of cereals legumes and vegetables 3 2 tono irrigation scheme fig 3 shows the tono irrigation scheme in the kassena nankana district the scheme was developed to promote all year round production of food crops by small scale farmers it has a gross area of 3860 ha with a potential irrigable area of 2680 ha of which 2490 ha has been developed international power company limited 2018 currently about 98 of the land is cultivated for rice the scheme has a farmer population of 2500 distributed across nine villages international power company limited 2018 the minimum average area of irrigable land accessed by farmers is 0 6 ha the irrigation company of upper region icour manages the irrigation scheme 3 3 sampling methods and data the study employs a multi stage sampling technique to sample 337 farmers consisting of participants 192 and non participant 145 of farmers in on farm demonstration of irrigation scheduling the first stage involves the purposive sampling of the tono irrigation scheme due to the stretch of the canal land area soil type topography of land crop type community and land tenure system scheme layout water supply system and drainage condition seven communities were purposively sampled in the second stage due to membership in water users association wua and gender categorization 7 7 older adults are farmers who are more than 30 years of age and youth are at or below 30 years of age older adults and youth in the final stage we employ proportional and random sampling techniques to select 337 farmers consisting of 114 adult males 92 adult females 82 young males and 49 young females we conducted a power test for the sample used for the study the power of the test is the chance to reject the null hypothesis given that the null hypothesis is false i e given that the alternative hypothesis is true following yamane 1967 the sample size n is determined as n n 1 n e 2 where n is the total population of farmers in the study area 2500 e is the margin of error 5 1 the derived margin of error of the sample size is 5 when the sample is 345 implying 95 confidence level and it is 5 1 when the sample is 337 this implies that there is 94 9 confidence in the results obtained from the sample used for the study this study relied on primary data which captured detailed information on household demographics education agricultural production system labour irrigation system challenges and opportunities income time use household water use household decision making aspirations training and social network and willingness to pay for an irrigation scheduling and solute monitoring tool the variable information captures exposure to the tool operation and labour costs effectiveness relative to farmers practice maintenance and access to the tool to complement the primary data generated through farmer interview we conducted a participatory on farm evaluation of wfd as an irrigation scheduling tool treatment in comparison with the farmers indigenous knowledge control of irrigation scheduling on rice under upland sandy loam soil conditions at bonia gaani and bui communities within the tono irrigation scheme the data captured per the demonstration include water requirements nitrate concentration and leaf chlorophyll content 3 4 empirical model information about a new agricultural technology and its effect on farmers willingness to pay wtp is a sequential decision making process which can be modeled using a two step approach varma 2018 in the first stage farmers access to information is specified as 1 g i ϑ z i μ i where g i is a latent variable representing irrigation scheduling information z i is a vector of covariates socio demographics household production and community ϑ is the vector of parameters to be estimated and μ i is the error term with mean zero and variance one varma 2018 in the second stage farmers demand or wtp for the irrigation tool is determined by socio demographics household production and community variables given the censored nature of the dependent variable wtp 8 8 some households stated wtp is zero which is not a missing data issue but a true reflection of their wtp in such instances the observations are censored and not truncated tobit model would be more appropriate to estimate the second stage equation the second stage model is specified as 2 wtp i α β g i γ x i ε i in eq 2 wtp i is the amount the farmer is willing to pay for a wfd between 0 and us 20 27 x i is the vector of socio economic characteristics that influence wtp table 1 g i represents information status of the farmer an indicator variable for whether famer participated had prior information or aware of wfd α β and γ are vectors of parameters to be estimated and ε i is the random error term we anticipate endogeneity in access to information on irrigation scheduling and solute monitoring tool due to unobserved heterogeneity among household heads and household characteristics that can potentially affect farmers wtp second there is a potential reverse causality between information and wtp farmers who have information on the irrigation decision tool are more likely to influence their wtp for the tool alternatively farmers with high wtp may be more likely to increase their search for more information regarding the use of the tool under the assumption of exogeneity in access to information the ordinary least squares ols estimation will lead to a consistent estimate of information on farmers wtp however due to the corner solution 2 08 of the farmers have zero wtp of the dependent variable estimation through ols is likely to be biased wooldridge 2010 employing the tobit specification deals with the corner solution nature of the wtp nonetheless the tobit model assumes the same underlying process for those who stated zero and those who stated values greater than zero channa et al 2019 the use of the standard instrumental variable estimation technique with two stage least squares 2sls approach will not be appropriate due to the censored nature of the farmers wtp variable porgo et al 2018 clougherty et al 2016 we employed the conditional recursive mixed process cmp developed by roodman 2011 that allows for the estimation of continuous and limited dependent variables while dealing with endogeneity issues including endogenous treatment the cmp controls the selection bias associated with unobserved factors affecting wtp by building from the seemingly unrelated regression framework and allowing for cross equation correlation of the error terms roodman 2011 4 results and discussion 4 1 descriptive statistics descriptive statistics of the variables of interest of this study is presented in table 1 about 57 of the sampled farmers participated in the on farm demonstration and thus had information on irrigation scheduling males constitute about 58 of the sample the average age of a household head is 42 years about 74 of the farmers are married and 36 of the respondents are literate the average household size is eight and the economically active household members is five the data showed that 30 of the sampled farmers are members of farmer organizations about 79 of the sampled farmers have a mobile savings account the average irrigable land area and cropland area is 2 06 ha and 1 87 ha respectively about 19 of the farmers in our sample have participated in non agricultural training the average income and asset are ghs2000 us 2703 and ghs3188 us 429 respectively the average female daily wage is gh24 us 3 24 the number of days spent in manual tillage is four days the number of days spouse support with fixing irrigation pump irrigation is one day about 24 of the farmers are time poor committed time 9 9 time poverty describes a situation where an individual works a greater number of hours committed time in the labour market than is desirable it also shows the lack of time for rest and leisure seymour et al 2019 parra and wodon 2010 bardasi and wodon 2006 in paid and unpaid work is greater than 10 5 h a day seventy three percent 73 of the sampled farmers prefer an irrigation scheduling and solute monitoring tool that is less labour intensive than labour intensive irrigation scheduling tools we present farmers wtp for the wetting front detector based on location fig 4 the graph shows variations in farmers wtp by location for example farmers in tono recorded the highest wtp value of ghs78 while farmers in biu recorded the lowest wtp value of ghs54 and the rest of the communities recorded wtp value above ghs60 fig 5 shows farmers stated wtp for the wetting front detector based on sex and age disaggregation generally males recorded relatively higher wtp for the tool than the women based on the category adult males are willing to pay the highest ghs69 followed by young males ghs64 young females ghs63 and adult females ghs61 fig 6 presents farmers wtp based on sex and age for farmers who have information on the irrigation scheduling and solute monitoring tool similarly males reported a higher wtp for the wetting front detector than the females comparing across the groups adult males recorded the highest wtp ghs70 followed by young males ghs63 adult females ghs59 and young female ghs51 comparatively adult male farmers with information recorded higher wtp for the wetting front detector than adult male farmers who did not have information about the tool fig 7 young female farmers who did not have information about the irrigation tool reported higher wtp ghs70 than young female farmers who have information similarly adult female and young male farmers who have information about the irrigation tool express lower wtp for the tool than their counterpart without information 4 2 demand for wfd fig 8 presents the demand curve for wfd which is based on the proportions of farmers who are willing to pay at each price point the demand curve is disaggregated based on access to information on the wfd generally we observe variations in farmers wtp for the wfd based on information status about 20 and 30 of the farmers who have information and those without information respectively were willing to pay between ghs100 and ghs150 for wfd an increase in the price of wfd by ghs50 decreases informed uninformed farmers demand from 84 82 to 20 29 and farmers who lacks information of the sample who are willing to purchase the wfd farmers who are informed are more price sensitive than those without information on water management ε b 1 87 ε a 1 43 4 3 participatory on farm evaluation of wfd fig 9 shows that farmers practice control relative to the use of the wfd treatment results in a higher seasonal irrigation water requirement across locations the irrigation schedule triggered by the wfd resulted in 43 2 65 3 and 13 3 water savings at gaani bonia and bui respectively compared to farmers own indigenous irrigation scheduling fig 9 the rootzone soil solute monitoring shows a high nitrate concentration under the wfd irrigated plots than the plot under farmers indigenous irrigation scheduling fig 10 irrigation schedule by the wfd consistently recorded high nitrate concentrations in the rootzone irrigation schedule by the farmers indigenous knowledge recorded lower nitrate concentration of 10 mg l 0 mg l and 50 mg l at bui gaani and bonia respectively fig 10 the low nitrate concentration recorded under farmer practice is largely due to the high volumes of irrigation water applied that led to dilution and leaching of nitrates beyond the rootzone in addition leaf chlorophyll concentration lcc an indication of plant health due to its reported linear relationship with nitrogen content was higher in the plant leaves of the wfd irrigated plots at 12 weeks after transplanting 13 85 μmol m² when compared to the farmer irrigated plot 9 83 μmol m² fig 11 the high lcc of plants within the wfd plots is as a result of the high nitrate concentration recorded in its root zones the farmer irrigated plot produced higher mean grain yield of 2 85 t ha while the wfd irrigated plot produced 2 43 t ha fig 12 the high volume of irrigation water applied under the farmer irrigated plot contributed to the increase in grain yield however irrigation water use efficiency of 1 08 kg m3 was recorded for plants in the wfd irrigated plot while 0 68 kg m3 was recorded for the farmer irrigated plot an indication of a 37 increase in efficient water use by plants under the wfd plot fig 13 in water scarce agricultural environment the wfd is preferred to maximise irrigation water use by rice farmers 4 4 estimates of information access and farmers wtp table 2 presents the estimates of the conditional recursive mixed process that shows the relationship between access to information on irrigation scheduling and solute monitoring tool and farmers wtp column 1 shows the first stage results that reports the factors influencing access to irrigation information without controlling for community fixed effects column 2 is the second stage results that shows the effect of information access on farmers wtp without controlling for community effects columns 3 and 4 shows the results of the access to irrigation information and farmers wtp equations that controls for community fixed effects generally we observe a positive effect of information on farmers wtp for wetting front detector by including the community controls we observe an improvement in the magnitude of the effect of information on farmers wtp which suggests that failure to account for community factors may underestimate the effect of information we discuss the results in columns 3 and 4 the first stage results shows that access to information on irrigation scheduling tool is significantly influenced by age ownership of savings mobile account asset and location of farmer in biu and bonia the results suggest that older household heads are more likely to have information on irrigation tools for scheduling irrigation irrigation farming is labour intensive and demanding which may be difficult for older household heads to keep up with the increasing demand in view of this they are more likely to access information on irrigation scheduling tool that may reduce their drudgery and reduce cost of water use household heads who own either a savings or mobile account are less likely to access information on irrigation scheduling tools compared to farmers in other locations farmers in biu and bonia are more likely to access information on irrigation scheduling tools the two communities are more accessible in terms of the distance to the icour and ministry of food and agriculture mofa offices access to these institutions increases farmers chance of accessing information on irrigation farming practices comparing columns 2 and 4 and including community controls in the model shows that information increases farmers wtp for a wfd from ghs35 us 5 to ghs42 us 6 the result suggests that failure to control for community fixed effects may lead to underestimation of the effect of information access on the wtp for a wfd the positive effect of information indicates that farmers value the benefits of irrigation decision tool and thus knowledge about the tool can facilitate adoption our result is consistent with several studies to understand farmers utilization of smartphones in regard to crop protection bonke et al 2018 find that information about smartphones apps significantly influences german farmers wtp for a crop protection app furthermore they find that about 93 of the farmers use smartphones for agricultural decisions in relation to weather forecast and identification of pests and diseases information access through field days increases farmers wtp for soil moisture monitoring tools abebe et al 2020 other studies have highlighted the role of information in influencing adoption attitudinal change and wtp for improved technologies toma et al 2018 yigezu et al 2018 a study by maredia et al 2019 show that field demonstrations influence farmers wtp for bean seed in tanzania and cowpea seed in ghana kokoye et al 2018 note that participation in soil testing programs influence farmers wtp for soil testing services in haiti ali et al 2020 find that providing weather information through tv radio and mobile phones in local languages influences farmers willingness to pay for weather index based insurance channa et al 2019 indicate that farmers wtp for hermetic bag is not significantly different from the medium text audio or video messages for communicating the technology but those with prior awareness of the storage technology were willing to pay relatively higher price than those previously unaware of it in contrast to our findings mastenbroek et al 2021 find that famers knowledge enhanced through randomized information treatment did not significantly influence their wtp for certified seed literacy increases farmers wtp for the wfd by ghs10 us 1 35 literacy improves the cognitive skills of individuals and enhances individual s ability to make informed decision regarding farm activities that has high potential of improving welfare outcomes the result is consistent with previous studies in africa and asia abegunde et al 2020 abebe et al 2018 aryal et al 2018 kokoye et al 2018 abdulai and huffman 2014 we observed that farmers who are members of farmer organization are willing to discount the price of the wfd by ghs15 us 2 02 while ownership of a savings or mobile money account increases farmers wtp for wfd by gfhs12 us 2 membership in a farmer organization enhances farmers collective decision in terms of access to information and technologies at a relatively low cost it is possible that such farmers would expect both financial and technical support from government or development practitioners when making purchasing decisions on inputs ownership of an account signals financial inclusion and farmers willingness to transfer risk of holding physical cash to a third party financial institutions are more likely to advance credit to farmers with access to accounts which may positively correlate with farmers wtp for an agricultural tool such as the wfd income is negatively associated with farmers wtp for the wfd the result suggests that although income improves access to information it does not necessarily increase wtp for an improved irrigation tool as household income increases there may be competing household and farm production needs household are more likely to invest their income to address most pressing needs such as food consumer goods and social activities especially within a rural setting consistent with the a priori expectation the wtp for wfd by a time poor household head is ghs18 us 2 4 the wfd is both labour and cost saving tool therefore time poor household heads are more likely to adopt and pay for the tool to reduce their drudgery with respect to irrigating their farm plots the findings suggests that time poverty can be reduced to an extent when farmers have access to the wfd however any irrigation scheduling tool that is less labour intensive is associated with a ghs9 us 1 22 decrease in farmers wtp our findings suggests that farmers are more interested in irrigation tool that is not labour intensive the findings suggest that in developing or designing any irrigation scheduling tool there is the need to factor the labour requirement component to ensure that the tool can be implemented with limited labour effort given that labour is expensive within an irrigation ecology similarly the tool must be gender sensitive for women to use we find a discounting effect in terms of the wtp across the communities relative to farmers in the yogbania community the highest lowest discounting effect is observed for farmers in the bonia chuchuliga namosa community our findings suggest that although farmers in bonia community have access to information on irrigation scheduling tools they are willing to discount the price of the tool while farmers in the chuchuliga namosa discount the price of the tool due to lack of access to information on irrigation scheduling tools the result indicates that information alone may not necessarily improve adoption of the wfd but demonstration of the tool which combines both information and practice may lead to high adoption and wtp 4 5 gender and age dimensions table 3 shows the results of information access on farmers wtp for the wfd based on sex male and female and age adult and youth dimensions columns 1 and 2 shows that results for the sex disaggregation while columns 3 and 4 shows the age disaggregation results the effect of information access on wtp for a wfd is significant among female headed households but non significant among male headed households information access increases female headed households wtp for a wfd by ghs39 us 5 27 the significant positive effect among female headed households can be attributed to two main reasons first the total drudgery paid and unpaid activities among women is relatively higher than men ghosh 2016 given that they do most of the irrigation work and have less man power and inequitable share of water resources compared to male headed households abebe et al 2020 given the multiple tasks women face they tend to be time poor martey et al 2022 orkoh et al 2020 and thus more likely to adopt a technology that will reduce their drudgery our result is consistent with aryal et al 2022 who find that female particiption in decision making increases their willing to adopt climate smart agriculture csa and therefore recommended for more training for women to increase their understanding of csa simtowe et al 2016 find high adoption of pigeon pea varieties among female farmers in malawi ghanaian women invest more in non farm activities than men kramer and lambrecht 2019 thus are more likely to invest the income in labour saving technologies second irrigation farming is associated with less risk compared to the wet season farming and the associated crop revenue is relatively high especially where costs are effectively managed due to effcient use of irrigation water for crop production women within the irrigation ecology cultivate rice and vegetables during the dry season and also serve as labour on other farms using the irrigation scheduling tool will reduce time spent in irrigation and channel the time saved in other paid activities to supplement their household income contrary to our findings hill et al 2013 finds that female headed households have lower wtp for insurance innovation while hidrobo et al 2022 find that women report lower wtp for a digital platform that provides nutrition sensitive agricultural information in ghana relative to men they find that the low wtp among females is due to the fact that women receives nutrition information from other sources in a similar study antwi agyei et al 2021 find that relatively fewer women were willing to pay for climate information than men due to resource constraint the analysis of information access on wtp for wfd based on age dimension suggests that the youth are more likely to adopt irrigation scheduling tool more speciafically information access increases the young farmers wtp for a wfd by ghs34 us 5 there is evidence that younger farmers are usually innovative risk loving and willing to try new concepts martey et al 2014 older farmers may have garnered wealth of irrigation scheduling experience through years of farming that could help them manage water efficiently antwi agyei et al 2021 in addition it is likely that older farmers are more risk averse and unwilling to pay for irrigation technologies abebe et al 2020 hill et al 2013 our result confirms the findings of antwi agyei et al 2021 and jaafar and kharroubi 2021 who reported that older farmers are less likely to access climate information and smart irrigation mobile application than younger farmers past studies kirui et al 2014 uddin et al 2014 have shown similar and consistent results while other studies kokoye et al 2018 yegbemey et al 2014 have shown contrary results due to gender disparities in access to resources finally we estimated the heterogeneity effect of information on wtp for wfd based on income status willingness to adopt wfd and aspiration 10 10 aspirations are future expectations and goals that individuals desire to achieve and they entail effort conditional on a person s belief in their own ability to change outcomes which may also depend on a person s exposure to information and access to resources bernard et al 2011 table 4 our results show that information increases farmers wtp for wfd among high income earners by ghs26 us 3 5 compared to low income earners which confirms the findings of kokoye et al 2018 and ulimwengu and sanyal 2011 the wtp for farmers who are willing to adopt wfd is ghs39 us 5 3 more than farmers who were unwilling to adopt improving access to information and demonstrating the benefits of an irrigation scheduling tool may increase farmers willingness to experiment with the tool on a small scale and subsequently scale up when the technology proves to be efficient we did not find any significant association between information access and wtp for farmers with high aspiration index our result suggests that high aspiration may not necessarily translate to adoption of soil water monitoring tools 5 conclusion precision agriculture is considered as an efficient approach to cost minimization and sustainable agricultural production most farmers find it difficult to decide on when and how much water to apply to field crops under irrigation given the information constraint they face a large proportion of farmers in irrigation ecologies use subjective approaches based on their local experience and indigenous knowledge in the practice of irrigation which may not be cost minimizing soil water monitoring tools such as the wfd are simple low cost and user friendly tools which can be integrated in the production process to optimise water use and crop yields as well as reducing overall water cost this study analyses the role of information about an irrigation scheduling tool in smallholder farmers demand for wfd in rural ghana the irrigation device can potentially reduce the cost and amount of irrigation water by providing an objective source of information on irrigation scheduling we find that 57 of the sampled farmers have irrigation information and 97 are willing to adopt the wfd about 98 of the farmers reported a wtp higher than zero this suggests that there is a high demand for soil water monitoring tools among small scale irrigators and this can be achieved with the right investment through a public private partnership an increase in the price of wfd by ghs50 decreases demand from 84 to 29 of the sample who are willing to purchase the wfd the main results indicate that irrigation information increases farmers wtp for wfd by us 6 after controlling for variations existing among the irrigation communities despite the majority of the farmers willing to adopt and pay for the wfd the low valuations indicates that they have less incentives to invest in irrigation scheduling tools which is a measure of water management when profit associated with that water management is not fully observable to farmers oliva et al 2020 based on our heterogeneity analysis we find that information increases wtp among female farmers youth high income earners and farmers who are willing to adopt the wfd however we did not find any significant effect of information on wtp for male older adults and farmers with high aspirations the main implication from our study is that increasing farmers awareness and experience in using an irrigation tool increases their wtp this suggests that focusing on economic incentives motivating and adequately resourcing extension agents and encouraging farmer learning can raise awareness and use of the tool the private sector must actively support extension to increase farmers awareness and benefits of using soil water monitoring tools for irrigation scheduling through both formal and informal exchange of information second comparing the market price and farmers wtp for the wfd implies that provision of a price payment scheme or subsidy to farmers and tax exemption to the private suppliers can significantly lead to price reduction and higher adoption commitment from government to provide enabling environment for the private sector to boost production of irrigation tools and the building capacity of farmers will not only increase adoption but increase use of the tool high adoption and use of the wfd will optimise water use at the farmer plot level and improve management of the irrigation scheme especially where climate change is a threat to sustainable crop production third outcome of the study provides the basis for targeting and promoting the tool among heterogenous population given that wtp for wfd varied across our sample such information will inform government spending of limited financial resources in supporting smallholder farmers and further guide the private sector in their irrigation investment decisions there are few limitations of our study first farmers may overstate or underestimate their wtp compared to prices in a retail market and especially within a contingent valuation framework an experimental auction may reduce the biases associated with the hypothetical situations channa et al 2019 vickery 1961 second there is limited

9156,in cotton an optimal balance between vegetative and reproductive growth will lead to high yields and water use efficiency remote sensing estimations of vegetation variables such as crop coefficient kc leaf area index lai and crop height during plant development can improve irrigation management optical and synthetic aperture radar sar satellite imagery can be a useful data source since they provide synoptic cover at fixed time intervals furthermore they can better capture the spatial variability in the field compared to point measurements since clouds limit optical observations at times the combination with sar can provide information during cloudy periods this study utilized optical imagery acquired by sentinel 2 and sar imagery acquired by sentinel 1 over cotton fields in israel the sentinel 2 based vegetation indices that are best suited for cotton monitoring were identified and the most robust sentinel 2 models for kc lai and height estimation achieved r2 0 879 rmse 0 0645 meris terrestrial chlorophyll index mtci r2 0 9535 rmse 0 8 mtci and r2 0 8883 rmse 10 cm enhanced vegetation index evi respectively additionally a model based on the output of the snap biophysical processor lai estimation algorithm was superior to the empirical lai models of the best performing vegetation indices r2 0 9717 rmse 0 6 the most robust sentinel 1

respectively this work paves the way for future studies to design decision support systems for better irrigation management in cotton even at the sub plot level by monitoring the heterogeneous development of the crop from space and adapting the irrigation accordingly to reach the target development at different growth stages during the season keywords eddy covariance crop coefficient lai vegetation indices synthetic aperture radar data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction proper crop management is necessary throughout the growing season to optimize yield crop coefficient kc based estimation of crop water consumption is one of the most commonly used irrigation management methods allen et al 1998 corbari et al 2017 pereira et al 2021 satellite optical remote sensing was previously demonstrated to be reliable for kc estimation e g beeri et al 2019 bretreger et al 2020 mateos et al 2013 sentinel 2 optical imagery is public domain with a short revisit time 5 days and a high spatial resolution 10 60 m depending on the band kc estimation models for cotton based on sentinel 2 imagery were previously derived during the middle and late stages of two growing seasons rozenstein et al 2018 2019 unfortunately data in the early stages of the growing season were not collected in these early studies hence these models validity in the early stages of the growing season is yet to be tested accordingly there is merit to validating and perhaps improving the model for that early stage of the growing season cotton irrigation management is challenging because vegetative and reproductive growth must be balanced in order to reach high yields and maintain profitable production constable and bange 2015 an abundance of water and nutrients will result in heavy vegetative growth that promotes boll rot and fruit abscission making the cotton crop difficult to harvest ritchie et al 2007 therefore cotton height and leaf area index lai monitoring throughout the crop development can support irrigation management to regulate vegetative growth to that end at most several plants height is typically measured in a representative patch of the field visited by the grower once or twice a week this form of monitoring may not optimally represent the whole field and accordingly remote sensing based monitoring can potentially improve upon it crop growth estimation from optical remote sensing is susceptible to saturation at lai 3 for a majority of vegetation indices vis gitelson et al 2003 kaplan and rozenstein 2021 however previous studies successfully modeled the relationship between cotton lai and vis derived from optical satellite imagery lambert et al 2018 achieved an r2 of 0 82 using the sen 2 agri system but they studied only peak lai due to an insufficient number of sentinel 2 imagery he and mostovoy 2019 used a time series of sentinel 2 imagery to derive the lai using the snap biophysical processor weiss and baret 2016 this processor was based on a neural network pre trained on radiative transfer simulations of canopy reflectance within sentinel 2 bands and geometry over a broad range of vegetation types and conditions the rmse of this algorithm s lai estimation was 0 51 for various field crops verrelst et al 2012 finally sentinel 2 red edge water vapor bands and vis developed based on these bands rendvi wevi wnevi were found effective in cotton lai estimation kaplan and rozenstein 2021 therefore spaceborne monitoring of lai as a proxy for cotton growth might supplement estimations of kc from sentinel 2 to regulate irrigation similar to lai cotton height is a reliable predictor of the aboveground biomass trevisan et al 2015 and is commonly used by growers to measure cotton development the spectral reflectance in the optical region is predominantly determined by the plant s biochemical properties and the canopy structure but plant height is related to plant vegetative growth and canopy development which is vicariously linked to the spectral reflectance and therefore vis kaplan et al 2021a previously the height of several crops was estimated using sar erten et al 2016 nasirzadehdizaji et al 2019 ndikumana et al 2018 and optical satellite sensors kaplan et al 2021a papadavid et al 2011 thenkabail et al 1994 but correlations between vis derived from sentinel 2 imagery and cotton height have not been studied to the best of our knowledge nevertheless spaceborne optical sensors are limited by cloud cover to overcome this problem previous studies suggested combining observations acquired at different times from several satellites flood 2014 manivasagam et al 2021 2019 sadeh et al 2021 but even this approach does not always produce enough cloud free observations to monitor cloudy regions effectively consequently sar was suggested as an alternative owing to its cloud penetration capability danklmayer et al 2009 reamer et al 1993 and the sensitivity of sar backscatter to vegetation roughness patterns rozenstein et al 2016 for example sentinel 1 was used by ashmitha et al 2019 and selvaraj et al 2019 for crop classification several studies investigated the combined use of sentinel 2 and c band sar satellites such as sentinel 1 and risat 1 haldar et al 2020 holtgrave et al 2020 verma et al 2019 haldar et al 2020 found a correlation between risat 1 sar imagery and cotton height r2 0 4949 and lai r2 0 5 sentinel 1 provides coverage at a revisit time of six days for the images acquired at the same geometry and can thus mitigate the limitation imposed by clouds on optical observations therefore this study s primary goal was to develop novel monitoring tools for cotton development and water consumption based on sentinel 1 sar and sentinel 2 optical imagery specifically the objectives were to calibrate empirical estimation models against field data collected throughout the entire length of cotton growing season for 1 kc 2 lai 3 height and 4 to compare lai estimates from the snap biophysical processor to the empirical models achieving these goals should improve irrigation practices throughout the cotton growing season and fill a gap by inspiring confidence in predictions made early in the growing season relative to the current models calibrated against field data collected during the mid late season rozenstein et al 2019 2018 2 methods 2 1 test sites and field measurements the field data used in this study were collected at three drip fertigated commercial cotton fields cv pima in

based on in situ measurements of the latent and sensible heat fluxes from the eddy covariance tower against available energy of net radiation minus soil heat flux in order to make sure that etc measurements were reliable the crop coefficient kc was calculated as etc et0 the daily kc time series in the 2020 field campaign was smoothed in python using a second order spline during the field campaign in 2020 lai was measured with a sunscan canopy analysis system ss1 delta t cambridge united kingdom the sunscan was oriented in the rows direction and moved perpendicular to the rows direction at increments of 20 cm to collect 30 readings this transect captured lai under the plants and between the rows 30 readings were averaged to derive a single lai measurement for comparison with vis derived from satellite observations vegetation height was measured using a ruler with an accuracy of 1 cm in 2016 and 2020 from the soil surface to the tip of the top leaf malachy et al 2022 each height value consisted of an average of at least 30 field measurements during the field campaign in 2020 lai and height were measured in two areas of the field near the center of the field six days with lai and seven days with height measurements and near the north west corner of the field where the rate of crop development was different from the center four lai and six height measurements field measured height lai and kc were linearly correlated with average values of vis lai from the biophysical processor and sar data from an area representing the eddy covariance flux footprint kljun et al 2015 and a polygon in the north west corner of the field in the 2020 field campaign short gaps in the crop height and lai time series were linearly interpolated from adjacent dates lai was measured from the start of the growing season until its decrease to the level of lai 8 after the lai passed its peak at lai 10 subsequently when the plants became very dense and it became challenging to move inside the field lai was not measured 2 2 satellite imagery sentinel 2 is an earth observation mission and part of the european space agency esa copernicus program it includes two satellites each equipped with a multi spectral instrument msi namely sentinel 2a launched 23 june 2015 and sentinel 2b launched 07 march 2017 overall 27 sentinel 2 images were used in this study table 2 lists the sentinel 2 spectral bands used to calculate vis the inventory of sentinel 2 images used in this study can be found in table 3 the sentinel 2 image acquired on 28 august 2020 had defective red edge bands and consequently vis based on these bands were not calculated and the lai biophysical processor was not used sentinel 1 is part of the european copernicus program for earth observation the payload of the two sentinel 1 satellites includes a dual polarization vv and vh c band sar instrument working at 5 405 ghz the resolution of the level 1 ground range detected grd interferometric wide iw mode that was used in this study is 20 22 m with a pixel size of 10 10 m and a revisit time of six days for observations at the same viewing geometry sentinel 1a and sentinel 1b were launched on 03 april 2014 and 25 april 2016 respectively the sentinel 1 incidence angle in the iw mode ranges approximately between 29º and 46º overall 70 sar images were used table 4 2 3 optical image processing and model calibration atmospherically corrected sentinel 2 reflectance products were used in this analysis sentinel 2 level 2a images covering the fields in this study were obtained from the esa copernicus open access hub website https scihub copernicus eu dhus home accessed 16 january 2022 the sen2cor algorithm was used to atmospherically correct the 2016 and 2017 imagery twenty vis detailed in appendix 1 and the sentinel application platform snap version 7 0 european space agency lai biophysical processor output were derived based on the sentinel 2 level 2a imagery to refine the lai output from the biophysical processor a linear regression was performed between this output and field measurements of lai henceforward referred to as corrected lai biophysical model in addition linear regression models were derived between the field measured kc lai and height and the remote sensing products derived from vis r2 and root mean square error rmse values were calculated for every model the following sentinel 2 based models were derived 1 kc lai and height models based on the 2020 data 2 kc and height models based on a combination of 2016 2017 and 2020 data 3 the lai output of the biophysical processor based on the sentinel 2 imagery of 2020 4 a corrected lai biophysical model 2 4 sar image processing and model calibration the challenge of modeling vegetation variables using sar imagery because of the radar backscatter dependence on the local incidence angle θ was recently solved by introducing two local incidence angle normalization methods kaplan et al 2021b 2021c all sar images in this study were sequentially pre processed in esa snap as follows a region around the target polygon was subsetted and the latest orbit file was used to correct for the satellite path thermal noise was removed followed by a calibration to β0 a dimensionless coefficient that corresponds to the reflectivity per unit area in the slant range and σ0 radar cross section per unit area in a natural scale range doppler terrain correction was performed using shuttle radar topography mission srtm farr et al 2007 digital elevation model with 30 m resolution a speckle filtering step was not performed in order to retain the native image resolution and pixel values range thus not affecting the correlation to vegetation variables flores et al 2019 inoue et al 2014 ndikumana et al 2018 subsequently to minimize the dependence of the sar backscatter intensity on the incidence angle σ0 was normalized by multiplying it by the local incidence angle θ in decimal degree scale kaplan et al 2021b 1 σ norm 0 σ 0 θ another sar local incidence angle normalization method used in this study was based on the radar brightness coefficient β0 kaplan et al 2021b 2 β norm 0 β 0 sin radians 90 θ 3 β0 was used because the radiometric correction of σ0 was based on a sea level ellipsoid small 2011 small et al 2021 and therefore less suitable for monitoring rough surfaces and rugged topography frey et al 2013 in this study all sar σ0 and β0 models were based on vh polarization because this polarization showed better performance than vv polarization the normalized and non normalized within polygon β0 and σ0 values were correlated with vegetation variables measured on the same date or linearly interpolated from adjacent measurements the sar based kc lai and height estimation process is shown in fig 2 overall the following sentinel 1 based models were derived 1 kc lai and height models based on normalized and non normalized β0 and σ0 from 2020 2 kc and height models based on normalized and non normalized β0 and σ0 from combined 2017 only kc 2016 and 2020 data all the kc and height models derived from sar data were based on polynomial regression models lai models derived from normalized and non normalized β0 and σ0 were based on power regression models validation of sar and optical kc models was performed by applying models based on 2016 2017 to 2020 data 3 results the energy balance closure analyses of the three campaigns are presented in fig 3 closure slopes of 0 96 084 and 0 90 and a high coefficient of determination r2 0 92 092 and 0 97 between the energy consumed by the canopy le h and the available energy rn g demonstrate that the latent heat flux measurements were reliable kc standard recommendations israeli extension service ies and estimations from the field measurements are presented in fig 4 alongside height and lai measurements table 5 presents the models performance in the 2020 field campaign alongside 2016 2017 sentinel 2 kc estimation models rozenstein et al 2019 and sentinel 1 models calibrated with 2016 2017 data and applied to 2020 data mtci showed the best performance in cotton kc estimation in agreement with the results obtained for 2016 and 2017 other vis such as evi gemi msavi and savi also performed better in kc lai and height estimation than the traditionally used ndvi lai generated from the snap biophysical processor showed a very high correlation with the measured lai but underestimated the values the corrected lai biophysical processor model compensated for the underestimation by the lai processor and had the lowest rmse out of all sentinel 2 based models notably the best models derived in this study could correctly estimate lai even at its highest values lai 10 without reaching saturation in all cases normalized sar models showed an improvement over non normalized sar models fig 5 shows the 2020 kc regression models based on mtci and ndvi unlike ndvi mtci was able to model the decrease of kc towards the end of the season ndvi s correlation with the measured kc was negatively affected by the last image see the red circled data point when kc has already decreased but ndvi was not able to reflect it fig 6 displays the time series of measured lai lai estimated by the snap biophysical processor and lai estimated by the corrected lai biophysical processor for the 2020 field campaign as lai was measured in two areas of the field two graphs are presented in fig 6 the graphs show that while the lai from the biophysical processor follows the trends of the measured lai it grossly underestimates the lai values lai derived from the corrected lai biophysical processor better matches the measurements the time series of estimated kc by mtci ndvi non normalized normalized σ0 alongside the measured kc values for the same days of sentinel 2 and sentinel 1 imagery acquisition related to the 2020 field campaign are presented in fig 7 mtci and ndvi models were based on 14 and 15 data points respectively and had an rmsemtci 0 0299 and rmsendvi 0 0868 sar kc models were based on 53 data points following a local incidence angle normalization sentinel 1 estimation of kc showed performance improvement over non normalized models the improvement in rmse was 0 0311 and 0 0542 for the 2020 sar σ0 and β0 kc models respectively table 5 table 6 presents the optical and sar based kc and height models calibrated using all available field data obtained in 2016 2020 mtci was the best vi for the kc estimation r2 0 879 rmse 0 0645 while evi showed the best results in the cotton height estimation r2 0 8883 rmse 10 cm the most commonly used vi ndvi showed an average performance in both kc and height estimation normalized sar models performed better than non normalized sar models and the σ0 models showed a slight advantage over the corresponding β0 models notably normalized sar kc models performed better than the majority of the vis including ndvi arvi gndvi ipvi ireci msavi ndi45 pssra reip rvi savi tndvi tsavi wdvi the best performing sentinel 2 and sentinel 1 kc height presented in table 6 and lai presented in table 5 models were used to derive maps of the whole cotton field for the 2020 time series fig 8 the mtci model was used for deriving the sentinel 2 based kc map evi model for height map and corrected lai biophysical model was used for deriving the lai map in all cases cloud independent normalized σ0 models were used to derive the sar based maps the white areas on the sentinel 1 maps fig 8 primarily found in the early stages of the growing season represent low backscatter values with no data i e the model prediction yielded a negative value that was subsequently classified as no data this results in partial overlap of the no data pixels between different products derived from the same image 4 discussion this study presented an innovative approach for calibrating and validating models for estimating kc height and lai in cotton based on sentinel 1 and sentinel 2 imagery to support irrigation management even in rainfed cotton cultivation generating maps to describe cotton development can be useful for variable rate application of growth inhibitors to regulate the vegetative growth the new model for estimating kc from sentinel 2 is an improvement over previous work that did not cover the early stages of the growing season rozenstein et al 2018 2019 estimation of kc from sentinel 1 was found to be slightly less accurate rmsesentinel 1 0 09 rmsesentinel 2 0 06 2016 2020 models but can be used instead of sentinel 2 when clouds over the field cause occlusion in optical observations since sentinel 1 imagery suffers from speckles a pixel based estimation of the vegetation is not possible but the estimation of vegetation properties of a larger area by averaging pixels is quite feasible in addition to estimate the cotton development models of lai and height based on sentinel 1 and sentinel 2 were derived cotton height estimations for the entire field rmsesentinel 1 18 cm rmsesentinel 2 10 cm 2016 2020 models present an advantage over single plant measurements that are commonly performed only for a few plants which may not capture the variance in cotton development over a large field especially from mid season when it becomes difficult to walk through the field accordingly it is preferable to use sentinel 2 which is more accurate except when it is cloudy and then sentinel 1 can complement the missing data albeit at lower accuracy mtci was the best vi to estimate cotton kc in agreement with our previous work rozenstein et al 2019 2018 which showed that mtci is the most accurate vi for cotton kc estimation mtci could accurately estimate kc at a late stage of the season when other indices like ndvi failed evi was found to be sensitive to high lai values and less affected by atmospheric aerosol impacts than many other vis huete et al 2002 sonobe et al 2019 xue and su 2017 consequently in the present study evi was found to be the best vi for estimating cotton lai alongside mtci and s2rep and height and one of the best vis for kc estimation therefore evi might be used efficiently with different sensors even those with a more traditional spectral resolution that does not include red edge bands e g landsat spot while the output of the lai biophysical processor underestimated the lai and therefore showed relatively low rmse 2 3 estimation accuracy the corrected lai biophysical processor model provided the most accurate sentinel 2 based lai estimation model rmse 0 6 in the present study which is slightly more accurate than the mtci evi and s2rep models that all showed similar accuracy of rmse 0 8 underestimation of lai by the snap lai biophysical processor has already been reported sadeh et al 2021 accordingly correcting the processor s lai output empirically as done in the present study might alleviate this drawback and improve its generality by reducing the estimation bias previously several other machine learning algorithms achieved similar accuracy as the corrected lai biophysical model and reported rmse 0 615 mao et al 2019 the r2 of the best vis based lai models derived in the present study is higher than a previously obtained ndvi based model that achieved r2 0 82 kalubarme et al 2006 the models derived in the present study showed that sentinel 2 is suitable for cotton lai estimation throughout the growing season including peak lai levels despite the high accuracy of lai models in the present study these models were based upon the data measured during only one season and should be validated in additional field campaigns all the normalized sar cotton variables estimation models showed higher performance than the non normalized models and therefore further established the efficacy of the earlier developed local incidence angle normalization methods which was tested on wheat cotton and processing tomatoes kaplan et al 2021b the kc lai and height sar models based on the σ0 and β0 showed similar results when applied to the relatively flat cotton fields previously β0 based models were found to be more accurate than σ0 based if they were applied to fields with a pronounced spatial structure such as tomatoes planted in soil ridges kaplan et al 2021b while the sar lai models based on the local incidence normalization methods showed lower r2 than the optical based models these sar based lai models demonstrated better performance than the previously studied risat 1 models r2 0 5 haldar et al 2020 the main advantage of the described methods is that they permit accurate estimation of vegetation variables throughout the entire growing season despite that the estimation of the vegetation traits under cloudy conditions remains less accurate because cloud independent sar models are less accurate than optical based models unfortunately in late december 2021 sentinel 1b malfunctioned and when the attempts to recover it were unsuccessful the satellite was declared inoperational there are ongoing efforts to replace it with commercial data in the short term namely from the canadian radarsat constellation and other sar systems in x band and l band sentinel 1 c and 1d are in development and sentinel 1 c is scheduled to undergo a flight acceptance review in october 2022 before a launch currently scheduled for some time in 2023 but an earlier launch at the end of 2022 is considered this shows how essential it is to have redundancy in earth observation missions and how important is the short revisit time of these constellations 5 conclusions empirical models based on sentinel 2 and sentinel 1 imagery have been shown to be reliable for estimating kc height and lai in cotton kc estimation models were demonstrated to work well throughout the cotton growing season and therefore can be used to inform growers of the required irrigation dose the models to estimate crop development lai and height can be used by growers to regulate the vegetative growth of cotton as previous studies showed mtci was the most accurate vi for the cotton kc estimation unlike ndvi mtci based estimations well captured the decrease in the kc at the very late stages of the season mtci and several other vis evi s2rep gemi wdvi pvi were found helpful for lai and height estimation the corrected lai biophysical processor model was the most accurate sentinel 2 based model for lai estimation in cotton previously developed local incidence angle normalization β0 and σ0 based procedures improved the estimation of cotton kc height and lai over non normalized sar data integration of optical and sar earth observations shows excellent potential to monitor cotton development and water consumption throughout the season funding the work was

9156,in cotton an optimal balance between vegetative and reproductive growth will lead to high yields and water use efficiency remote sensing estimations of vegetation variables such as crop

heavy vegetative growth that promotes boll rot and fruit abscission making the cotton crop difficult to harvest ritchie et al 2007 therefore cotton height and leaf area index lai monitoring throughout the crop development can support irrigation management to regulate vegetative growth to that end at most several plants height is typically measured in a representative patch of the field visited by the grower once or twice a week this form of monitoring may not optimally represent the whole field and accordingly remote sensing based monitoring can potentially improve upon it crop growth estimation from optical remote sensing is susceptible to saturation at lai 3 for a majority of vegetation indices vis gitelson et al 2003 kaplan and rozenstein 2021 however previous studies successfully modeled the relationship between cotton lai and vis derived from optical satellite imagery lambert et al 2018 achieved an r2 of 0 82 using the sen 2 agri system but they studied only peak lai due to an insufficient number of sentinel 2 imagery he and mostovoy 2019 used a time series of sentinel 2 imagery to derive the lai using the snap biophysical processor weiss and baret 2016 this processor was based on a neural network pre trained on radiative transfer simulations of canopy reflectance within sentinel 2 bands and geometry over a broad range of vegetation types and conditions the rmse of this algorithm s lai estimation was 0 51 for various field crops verrelst et al 2012 finally sentinel 2 red edge water vapor bands and vis developed based on these bands rendvi wevi wnevi were found effective in cotton lai estimation kaplan and rozenstein 2021 therefore spaceborne monitoring of lai as a proxy for cotton growth might supplement estimations of kc from sentinel 2 to regulate irrigation similar to lai cotton height is a reliable predictor of the aboveground biomass trevisan et al 2015 and is commonly used by growers to measure cotton development the spectral reflectance in the optical region is predominantly determined by the plant s biochemical properties and the canopy structure but plant height is related to plant vegetative growth and canopy development which is vicariously linked to the spectral reflectance and therefore vis kaplan et al 2021a previously the height of several crops was estimated using sar erten et al 2016 nasirzadehdizaji et al 2019 ndikumana et al 2018 and optical satellite sensors kaplan et al 2021a papadavid et al 2011 thenkabail et al 1994 but correlations between vis derived from sentinel 2 imagery and cotton height have not been studied to the best of our knowledge nevertheless spaceborne optical sensors are limited by cloud cover to overcome this problem previous studies suggested combining observations acquired at different times from several satellites flood 2014 manivasagam et al 2021 2019 sadeh et al 2021 but even this approach does not always produce enough cloud free observations to monitor cloudy regions effectively consequently sar was suggested as an alternative owing to its cloud penetration capability danklmayer et al 2009 reamer et al 1993 and the sensitivity of sar backscatter to vegetation roughness patterns rozenstein et al 2016 for example sentinel 1 was used by ashmitha et al 2019 and selvaraj et al 2019 for crop classification several studies investigated the combined use of sentinel 2 and c band sar satellites such as sentinel 1 and risat 1 haldar et al 2020 holtgrave et al 2020 verma et al 2019 haldar et al 2020 found a correlation between risat 1 sar imagery and cotton height r2 0 4949 and lai r2 0 5 sentinel 1 provides coverage at a revisit time of six days for the images acquired at the same geometry and can thus mitigate the limitation imposed by clouds on optical observations therefore this study s primary goal was to develop novel monitoring tools for cotton development and water consumption based on sentinel 1 sar and sentinel 2 optical imagery specifically the objectives were to calibrate empirical estimation models against field data collected throughout the entire length of cotton growing season for 1 kc 2 lai 3 height and 4 to compare lai estimates from the snap biophysical processor to the empirical models achieving these goals should improve irrigation practices throughout the cotton growing season and fill a gap by inspiring confidence in predictions made early in the growing season relative to the current models calibrated against field data collected during the mid late season rozenstein et al 2019 2018 2 methods 2 1 test sites and field measurements the field data used in this study were collected at three drip fertigated commercial cotton fields cv pima in

successfully applied the penman monteith method el shirbeny et al 2022 valipour 2017 field measurements of an eddy covariance system were used to measure the actual cotton crop evapotranspiration etc eddy covariance systems consisted of an open path gas analyzer li 7500ds li cor biosciences lincoln ne usa and a three axis ultrasonic anemometer model csat3 campbell scientific logan ut usa in addition to the eddy covariance system the experimental setup of each campaign included a net radiometer q 7 1 rebs seattle wa usa and soil heat flux plates hft 3 1 rebs seattle wa usa air temperature

the constant flux surface layer this was verified by a footprint analysis to confirm that the 90 flux footprint was within the field under study kljun et al 2015 energy balance closure was analyzed based on in situ measurements of the latent and sensible heat fluxes from the eddy covariance tower against available energy of net radiation minus soil heat flux in order to make sure that etc measurements were reliable the crop coefficient kc was calculated as etc et0 the daily kc time series in the 2020 field campaign was smoothed in python using a second order spline during the field campaign in 2020 lai was measured with a sunscan canopy analysis system ss1 delta t cambridge united kingdom the sunscan was oriented in the rows direction and moved perpendicular to the rows direction at increments of 20 cm to collect 30 readings this transect captured lai under the plants and between the rows 30 readings were averaged to derive a single lai measurement for comparison with vis derived from satellite observations vegetation height was measured using a ruler with an accuracy of 1 cm in 2016 and 2020 from the soil surface to the tip of the top leaf malachy et al 2022 each height value consisted of an average of at least 30 field measurements during the field campaign in 2020 lai and height were measured in two areas of the field near the center of the field six days with lai and seven days with height measurements and near the north west corner of the field where the rate of crop development was different from the center four lai and six height measurements field measured height lai and kc were linearly correlated with average values of vis lai from the biophysical processor and sar data from an area representing the eddy covariance flux footprint kljun et al 2015 and a polygon in the north west corner of the field in the 2020 field campaign short gaps in the crop height and lai time series were linearly interpolated from adjacent dates lai was measured from the start of the growing season until its decrease to the level of lai 8 after the lai passed its peak at lai 10 subsequently when the plants became very dense and it became challenging to move inside the field lai was not measured 2 2 satellite imagery sentinel 2 is an earth observation mission and part of the european space agency esa copernicus program it includes two satellites each equipped with a multi spectral instrument msi namely sentinel 2a launched 23 june 2015 and sentinel 2b launched 07 march 2017 overall 27 sentinel 2 images were used in this study table 2 lists the sentinel 2 spectral bands used to calculate vis the inventory of sentinel 2 images used in this study can be found in table 3 the sentinel 2 image acquired on 28 august 2020 had defective red edge bands and consequently vis based on these bands were not calculated and the lai biophysical processor was not used sentinel 1 is part of the european copernicus program for earth observation the payload of the two sentinel 1 satellites includes a dual polarization vv and vh c band sar instrument working at 5 405 ghz the resolution of the level 1 ground range detected grd interferometric wide iw mode that was used in this study is 20 22 m with a pixel size of 10 10 m and a revisit time of six days for observations at the same viewing geometry sentinel 1a and sentinel 1b were launched on 03 april 2014 and 25 april 2016 respectively the sentinel 1 incidence angle in the iw mode ranges approximately between 29º and 46º overall 70 sar images were used table 4 2 3 optical image processing and model calibration atmospherically corrected sentinel 2 reflectance products were used in this analysis sentinel 2 level 2a images covering the fields in this study were obtained from the esa copernicus open access hub website https scihub copernicus eu dhus home accessed 16 january 2022 the sen2cor algorithm was used to atmospherically correct the 2016 and 2017 imagery twenty vis detailed in appendix 1 and the sentinel application platform snap version 7 0 european space agency lai biophysical processor output were derived based on the sentinel 2 level 2a imagery to refine the lai output from the biophysical processor a linear regression was performed between this output and field measurements of lai henceforward referred to as corrected lai biophysical model in addition linear regression models were derived between the field measured kc lai and height and the remote sensing products derived from vis r2 and root mean square error rmse values were calculated for every model the following sentinel 2 based models were derived 1 kc lai and height models based on the 2020 data 2 kc and height models based on a combination of 2016 2017 and 2020 data 3 the lai output of the biophysical processor based on the sentinel 2 imagery of 2020 4 a corrected lai biophysical model 2 4 sar image processing and model calibration the challenge of modeling vegetation variables using sar imagery because of the radar backscatter dependence on the local incidence angle θ was recently solved by introducing two local incidence angle normalization methods kaplan et al 2021b 2021c all sar images in this study were sequentially pre processed in esa snap as follows a region around the target polygon was subsetted and the latest orbit file was used to correct for the satellite path thermal noise was removed followed by a calibration to β0 a dimensionless coefficient that corresponds to the reflectivity per unit area in the slant range and σ0 radar cross section per unit area in a natural scale range doppler terrain correction was performed using shuttle radar topography mission srtm farr et al 2007 digital elevation model with 30 m resolution a speckle filtering step was not performed in order to retain the native image resolution and pixel values range thus not affecting the correlation to vegetation variables flores et al 2019 inoue et al 2014 ndikumana et al 2018 subsequently to minimize the dependence of the sar backscatter intensity on the incidence angle σ0 was normalized by multiplying it by the local incidence angle θ in decimal degree scale kaplan et al 2021b 1 σ norm 0 σ 0 θ another sar local incidence angle normalization method used in this study was based on the radar brightness coefficient β0 kaplan et al 2021b 2 β norm 0 β 0 sin radians 90 θ 3 β0 was used because the radiometric correction of σ0 was based on a sea level ellipsoid small 2011 small et al 2021 and therefore less suitable for monitoring rough surfaces and rugged topography frey et al 2013 in this study all sar σ0 and β0 models were based on vh polarization because this polarization showed better performance than vv polarization the normalized and non normalized within polygon β0 and σ0 values were correlated with vegetation variables measured on the same date or linearly interpolated from adjacent measurements the sar based kc lai and height estimation process is shown in fig 2 overall the following sentinel 1 based models were derived 1 kc lai and height models based on normalized and non normalized β0 and σ0 from 2020 2 kc and height models based on normalized and non normalized β0 and σ0 from combined 2017 only kc 2016 and 2020 data all the kc and height models derived from sar data were based on polynomial regression models lai models derived from normalized and non normalized β0 and σ0 were based on power regression models validation of sar and optical kc models was performed by applying models based on 2016 2017 to 2020 data 3 results the energy balance closure analyses of the three campaigns are presented in fig 3 closure slopes of 0 96 084 and 0 90 and a high coefficient of determination r2 0 92 092 and 0 97 between the energy consumed by the canopy le h and the available energy rn g demonstrate that the latent heat flux measurements were reliable kc standard recommendations israeli extension service ies and estimations from the field measurements are presented in fig 4 alongside height and lai measurements table 5 presents the models performance in the 2020 field campaign alongside 2016 2017 sentinel 2 kc estimation models rozenstein et al 2019 and sentinel 1 models calibrated with 2016 2017 data and applied to 2020 data mtci showed the best performance in cotton kc estimation in agreement with the results obtained for 2016 and 2017 other vis such as evi gemi msavi and savi also performed better in kc lai and height estimation than the traditionally used ndvi lai generated from the snap biophysical processor showed a very high correlation with the measured lai but underestimated the values the corrected lai biophysical processor model compensated for the underestimation by the lai processor and had the lowest rmse out of all sentinel 2 based models notably the best models derived in this study could correctly estimate lai even at its highest values lai 10 without reaching saturation in all cases normalized sar models showed an improvement over non normalized sar models fig 5 shows the 2020 kc regression models based on mtci and ndvi unlike ndvi mtci was able to model the decrease of kc towards the end of the season ndvi s correlation with the measured kc was negatively affected by the last image see the red circled data point when kc has already decreased but ndvi was not able to reflect it fig 6 displays the time series of measured lai lai estimated by the snap biophysical processor and lai estimated by the corrected lai biophysical processor for the 2020 field campaign as lai was measured in two areas of the field two graphs are presented in fig 6 the graphs show that while the lai from the biophysical processor follows the trends of the measured lai it grossly underestimates the lai values lai derived from the corrected lai biophysical processor better matches the measurements the time series of estimated kc by mtci ndvi non normalized normalized σ0 alongside the measured kc values for the same days of sentinel 2 and sentinel 1 imagery acquisition related to the 2020 field campaign are presented in fig 7 mtci and ndvi models were based on 14 and 15 data points respectively and had an rmsemtci 0 0299 and rmsendvi 0 0868 sar kc models were based on 53 data points following a local incidence angle normalization sentinel 1 estimation of kc showed performance improvement over non normalized models the improvement in rmse was 0 0311 and 0 0542 for the 2020 sar σ0 and β0 kc models respectively table 5 table 6 presents the optical and sar based kc and height models calibrated using all available field data obtained in 2016 2020 mtci was the best vi for the kc estimation r2 0 879 rmse 0 0645 while evi showed the best results in the cotton height estimation r2 0 8883 rmse 10 cm the most commonly used vi ndvi showed an average performance in both kc and height estimation normalized sar models performed better than non normalized sar models and the σ0 models showed a slight advantage over the corresponding β0 models notably normalized sar kc models performed better than the majority of the vis including ndvi arvi gndvi ipvi ireci msavi ndi45 pssra reip rvi savi tndvi tsavi wdvi the best performing sentinel 2 and sentinel 1 kc height presented in table 6 and lai presented in table 5 models were used to derive maps of the whole cotton field for the 2020 time series fig 8 the mtci model was used for deriving the sentinel 2 based kc map evi model for height map and corrected lai biophysical model was used for deriving the lai map in all cases cloud independent normalized σ0 models were used to derive the sar based maps the white areas on the sentinel 1 maps fig 8 primarily found in the early stages of the growing season represent low backscatter values with no data i e the model prediction yielded a negative value that was subsequently classified as no data this results in partial overlap of the no data pixels between different products derived from the same image 4 discussion this study presented an innovative approach for calibrating and validating models for estimating kc height and lai in cotton based on sentinel 1 and sentinel 2 imagery to support irrigation management even in rainfed cotton cultivation generating maps to describe cotton development can be useful for variable rate application of growth inhibitors to regulate the vegetative growth the new model for estimating kc from sentinel 2 is an improvement over previous work that did not cover the early stages of the growing season rozenstein et al 2018 2019 estimation of kc from sentinel 1 was found to be slightly less accurate rmsesentinel 1 0 09 rmsesentinel 2 0 06 2016 2020 models but can be used instead of sentinel 2 when clouds over the field cause occlusion in optical observations since sentinel 1 imagery suffers from speckles a pixel based estimation of the vegetation is not possible but the estimation of vegetation properties of a larger area by averaging pixels is quite feasible in addition to estimate the cotton development models of lai and height based on sentinel 1 and sentinel 2 were derived cotton height estimations for the entire field rmsesentinel 1 18 cm rmsesentinel 2 10 cm 2016 2020 models present an advantage over single plant measurements that are commonly performed only for a few plants which may not capture the variance in cotton development over a large field especially from mid season when it becomes difficult to walk through the field accordingly it is preferable to use sentinel 2 which is more accurate except when it is cloudy and then sentinel 1 can complement the missing data albeit at lower accuracy mtci was the best vi to estimate cotton kc in agreement with our previous work rozenstein et al 2019 2018 which showed that mtci is the most accurate vi for cotton kc estimation mtci could accurately estimate kc at a late stage of the season when other indices like ndvi failed evi was found to be sensitive to high lai values and less affected by atmospheric aerosol impacts than many other vis huete et al 2002 sonobe et al 2019 xue and su 2017 consequently in the present study evi was found to be the best vi for estimating cotton lai alongside mtci and s2rep and height and one of the best vis for kc estimation therefore evi might be used efficiently with different sensors even those with a more traditional spectral resolution that does not include red edge bands e g landsat spot while the output of the lai biophysical processor underestimated the lai and therefore showed relatively low rmse 2 3 estimation accuracy the corrected lai biophysical processor model provided the most accurate sentinel 2 based lai estimation model rmse 0 6 in the present study which is slightly more accurate than the mtci evi and s2rep models that all showed similar accuracy of rmse 0 8 underestimation of lai by the snap lai biophysical processor has already been reported sadeh et al 2021 accordingly correcting the processor s lai output empirically as done in the present study might alleviate this drawback and improve its generality by reducing the estimation bias previously several other machine learning algorithms achieved similar accuracy as the corrected lai biophysical model and reported rmse 0 615 mao et al 2019 the r2 of the best vis based lai models derived in the present study is higher than a previously obtained ndvi based model that achieved r2 0 82 kalubarme et al 2006 the models derived in the present study showed that sentinel 2 is suitable for cotton lai estimation throughout the growing season including peak lai levels despite the high accuracy of lai models in the present study these models were based upon the data measured during only one season and should be validated in additional field campaigns all the normalized sar cotton variables estimation models showed higher performance than the non normalized models and therefore further established the efficacy of the earlier developed local incidence angle normalization methods which was tested on wheat cotton and processing tomatoes kaplan et al 2021b the kc lai and height sar models based on the σ0 and β0 showed similar results when applied to the relatively flat cotton fields previously β0 based models were found to be more accurate than σ0 based if they were applied to fields with a pronounced spatial structure such as tomatoes planted in soil ridges kaplan et al 2021b while the sar lai models based on the local incidence normalization methods showed lower r2 than the optical based models these sar based lai models demonstrated better performance than the previously studied risat 1 models r2 0 5 haldar et al 2020 the main advantage of the described methods is that they permit accurate estimation of vegetation variables throughout the entire growing season despite that the estimation of the vegetation traits under cloudy conditions remains less accurate because cloud independent sar models are less accurate than optical based models unfortunately in late december 2021 sentinel 1b malfunctioned and when the attempts to recover it were unsuccessful the satellite was declared inoperational there are ongoing efforts to replace it with commercial data in the short term namely from the canadian radarsat constellation and other sar systems in x band and l band sentinel 1 c and 1d are in development and sentinel 1 c is scheduled to undergo a flight acceptance review in october 2022 before a launch currently scheduled for some time in 2023 but an earlier launch at the end of 2022 is considered this shows how essential it is to have redundancy in earth observation missions and how important is the short revisit time of these constellations 5 conclusions empirical models based on sentinel 2 and sentinel 1 imagery have been shown to be reliable for estimating kc height and lai in cotton kc estimation models were demonstrated to work well throughout the cotton growing season and therefore can be used to inform growers of the required irrigation dose the models to estimate crop development lai and height can be used by growers to regulate the vegetative growth of cotton as previous studies showed mtci was the most accurate vi for the cotton kc estimation unlike ndvi mtci based estimations well captured the decrease in the kc at the very late stages of the season mtci and several other vis evi s2rep gemi wdvi pvi were found helpful for lai and height estimation the corrected lai biophysical processor model was the most accurate sentinel 2 based model for lai estimation in cotton previously developed local incidence angle normalization β0 and σ0 based procedures improved the estimation of cotton kc height and lai over non normalized sar data integration of optical and sar earth observations shows excellent potential to monitor cotton development and water consumption throughout the season funding the work was

9157,various field trials were performed at different locations of punjab pakistan to study the effect of trace metals on uptake of iron fe and wheat productivity as well as the health risk assessment by ingestion of wheat grains grown with application of different irrigation sources the experimental design was laid out in rcbd having four replications soil samples were taken before sowing of crop from 0 to 15 cm depth and triticum astivum samples were taken after irrigation through different water treatments examined for pollution load index pli bioaccumulation factor baf translocation factor tf bioconcentration factor bcf daily intake of metal dim and health risk index hri parameters fe concentrations in soil from five districts where wheat types watered with 3 different supplies ranged from 30 28 to 41 03 mg kg and in grain sample ranged between 1 36 and 6 74 mg kg all the samples had dim values of fe were observed lower than standard tolerable limits and values of hri less than 1 which indicates that there is no fe toxicity due to utilization of wheat grains keywords risk factor sewage toxicity trace elements wheat iron health risk index data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction due to the scarcity of fresh water farmers are enforced to apply wastewater without any treatment as an alternative to fresh water that results in toxic effects on crops as well as on people that is also responsible for heavy metals to accumulate in the soil the capacity of plants to take up heavy metals is diverse as some plants accumulate more heavy metals than other plants and cause different health risks to people via food chain industrial wastewater is also used for irrigation purpose that is enriched with organic matter and is also contaminated with heavy metals such as zn fe cd cr cu pb co ni and hg municipal wastewater is the largest source which can be used for irrigation purpose however it contains a significant amount of chemical pollutants due to the continuous use of wastewater crop productivity and the fertility of the soil is increased which encourages farmers however structural deterioration soil salinization and equalization acidification are the problems which are associated with the continuous use of wastewater and it lowers the productivity of the soil in spite of these complexities wastewater up to now is being applied on the fields plants and soil can be protected from the adverse effect of wastewater by its usage in a planned way but somehow it can still pose a threat to them so there is a need to determine the contamination level of water from different sources and the transfer of contaminants from water to soil and food crops this study will be helpful for plant breeders and farmers to realize the effect of ground sewage and industrial water on soil and wheat plants wheat triticum aestivum l along with rice and corn is one of the major crop in three extensively farmed crops on earth due to its high nutritional content olabanji et al 2007 pakistan produces the most wheat of any developing country and it also has the greatest per capita wheat production pakistan s two provinces punjab and sindh are the most significant producers of wheat with punjab leading the way during the dry rabbi season of winter the wheat is produced in punjab and is the most important food grain along with rice rajaram and hettel 1995 wheat is considered as pakistan s staple food and is grown in practically every corner of the country khan et al 2017 the main irrigation resource in pakistan is its canal system it has the largest canal irrigation system worldwide as the agricultural land area is increasing day by day the canal irrigation system is not satisfying this extended area and due to this reason water is a limiting factor for proper maintenance of agriculture awan 1979 world bank 2004 for irrigation there is a gradual decline in freshwater resources the use of recycled water from sewage processing has increased al khamisia et al 2012 heavy metals may accumulate in fertile soil and plants if recycled industrialized or municipal effluent is used in agriculture singh et al 2010 heavy metals mainly harmful components that can sabotage the benefits of using recycled water in agriculture petrus and warchol 2005 when heavy metals are accumulated in agricultural soil and crops it leads to intense ecological problems because they are persistent and non biodegradable property and can result in accumulation in various human body parts muhammad et al 2011 iron is an element which is necessarily found in almost all living things it is part of blood oxygen carrying compound called hemoglobin its deficiency cause anemia its concentration lies between the macro and micro elements of living organisms those enzymes and proteins which possess iron have heme prosthetic groups which contribute to various biological oxidations and transport iron is mostly ignored in the wheat grain analysis hassan et al 2013 plants require fe for their initial stages of growth when young parts are growing the pale color of older leaves and larger veins show the deficiency of fe in dry and little moist areas the quantity of iron in the soil is up to 35 which is insufficient for the proper growth of plants therefore plants in these areas mostly show chlorosis in relation to the plants of semi humid and humid areas as recommended by who the value of fe in drinking water is 1 0 mg l patel et al 2011 continuous intake of excess amount of fe can induce mammary tumors in rats which may be carcinogenic and kidney tumors in syrian hamsters which are estrogen stimulated regulation of estrogen elevates the easy uptake of fe by cells many types of cancers which are related to estrogen are the results of an excess amount of iron stored in body stores lieher and jones 2001 as a catalyst fe plays an important role in chlorophyll synthesis and also plays an essential role in many biochemical reactions as suggested by who the acceptable value of fe is 20 mg kg shah et al 2011 keeping in view the above scenario this project was planned to study the impact of trace elements on uptake of iron fe and health risk assessment by ingestion of wheat grains grown with application of various irrigation sources 2 materials and methods 2 1 research location seven punjab districts

all five kinds varied between 0 005 and 0 03 mg kg day according to the findings table 11 punjab 2011 which was treated with industrialized water in 2nd year had the greatest daily fe intake whereas faislabad 2008 which was treated using ground water in 2nd year had the lowest 3 1 12 health risk index hri for fe in various specimens ranged between 0 008 0 04 according to findings table 11 the punjab 2011 irrigation using industrialized water in 2nd year had the greatest value whereas faislabad 2008 treated by ground water in 1st year and likewise watan treated utilizing gw in 2nd year had the minimum values 3 2 iron 3 2 1 water the fe quantities 0 09 2 66 mg l indicated by alghobar and suresha 2016a b in ground and sewage samples correspondingly were substantially higher in all types of water samples in ground and sewage samples kobaissi et al 2014 found decreased fe concentrations 0 02 0 65 mg l iron inside in every type of water sample of both years was much higher than the allowable limit 5 0 mg l settled by the wwf 2007 naturally fe is present in lakes underground water and rivers other resources of fe in water includes the natural deposits corrosion of fe containing metals industrialized wastes and refining of iron ores they can bio accumulate in the food chain and are resistant to degradation ravindra et al 2014 3 2 2 soil kobaissi et al 2014 accounted higher fe value 282 17 mg kg in soil applied with wastewater iron concentration in all soil samples of two growing years was seen elevated in contrast to the values 1 21 1 59 mg kg of fe in gw and sww applied to soils correspondingly as calculated by owliaie 2016 ahmad et al 2018 had given the lower fe concentrations 3 04 3 96 mg kg in ground fresh and waste water treated soils correspondingly it has been observed that the soil treated with sewage water is rich in organic matter and nutrients moreover it is a low cost system for sewage water discarding ullah et al 2011 ghosh et al 2012 iron contents in all the samples were found lower than the greatest permitted value 56 90 150 mg kg given by dosumu et al 2005 and nrc 2001 correspondingly in current research the high fe concentrations were observed in soil samples but its concentration was below the utmost permitted value and being an important nutrient its high concentration in soil is not harmful 3 2 3 root iron values 5641 8533 mg kg in roots treated with gw and sww correspondingly accounted by alrawiq et al 2014 were found elevated in relation to the current research when fe was accumulated in high concentration in the roots it might be attributed to the microbial activity in roots which discharge organic acids which facilitate the accumulation and absorption of iron in the roots which might be the reason of its high concentration in the roots crowley et al 1991 kobaissi et al 2014 also suggested the higher fe concentration in roots it is investigated that in neutral to alkaline soil the availability of iron is reduced which makes the plant iron deficient although it is present in abundance iron is present in insoluble oxidized form due to this reason about thirty percent of world s cultivated soils are calcareous with low fe availability mori 1999 3 2 4 shoot in present research the accumulation of fe in various classes of shoots sample were found high as compared to the value 4 78 mg kg determined by yap et al 2009 it has been noticed that the reason for high concentration of metals such as pb fe mn and cd etc in various parts of plants is due to the continuous use of wastewater and their derivation from the rocks in agricultural area excess use of pesticides and fertilizers are also the possible reasons for high level of these metals qian et al 1996 alrawiq et al 2014 concluded the high fe concentration 69 77 mg kg in shoots sample treated by sw the lower fe contents 8 91 11 8 mg kg were found in shoot samples treated with correspondingly as suggested by kobaissi et al 2014 3 2 5 grains iron concentrations in all types of samples treated with gw and sww in two growing years were found lower than those values 7 84 5 29 mg kg showed by khan et al 2016a b in gw and sww treated grains correspondingly however fe value in grains of punjab 2011 treated with industrialized water in 2nd year was contained by the assortment of above mention values the concentration of cd in grains treated with ground water were found within the range of current study while all the wastewater samples exceed the value given by khan et al 2019 in wastewater samples rattan et al 2005 had given the higher fe concentrations 336 404 mg kg in grains treated with gw and sww correspondingly iron values were lesser to highest tolerable limit 425 5 mg kg as suggested by the fao who 2001 current values were lower than the findings 195 342 mg kg of alghobar and suresha 2016a b in the grain treated with gw and sww correspondingly primarily the composition of trace elements relies upon the availability of the minerals in the soil however different levels of minerals may get uptake by the various types of wheat varieties from the same type of soil or the same may absorb various quantities of minerals in different soils svencnjak et al 2013 it has been observed that fe transfer from soil towards roots roots towards shoots and shoots towards grains were found in the following order soil towards roots roots towards shoots shoots towards grains 3 2 6 pollution load index for fe pli in current research for all samples were seen lower in comparison to findings of ahmad et al 2016 at two different sites pollution load index 0 36 0 45 suggested by khan et al 2016a b in two different sites was found lower the range for pli of fe given by ololade 2014 1 06 1 1 and izah et al 2017 1 05 1 14 was found higher fe pli for every type of samples was 1 indicated that soil was not polluted with fe 3 2 7 bio accumulation factor bio accumulation factor in all types of samples treated with 3 types of water in two growing years was found elevated to investigation of khan et al 2016a b 0 4 however our findings were contradictory to that of hadif et al 2015 who did not report baf for fe baf indicated that there was inconsistency in and across the varieties by treatments it is observed that soil types soil metal amount soil ph cation exchange capacity and dissimilar crop varieties influence metal absorbed by plants barancikova et al 2004 3 2 8 translocation factor the lower tf 0 01 0 01 for fe was determined by alrawiq et al 2014 in ground and wastewater correspondingly the range 0 008 0 01 given by hadif et al 2015 for tf of iron was seen low in comparison to present research it has also been observed metals large quantity absorbed by the cereal crops gather into the roots where the metabolic rate was higher however the accumulation in stem and leaves was found minimum mo et al 2001 3 2 9 bio concentration factor fe bcf for all types of samples was lower than those values 0 67 0 66 suggested by khan et al 2017 in ground and wastewater treated samples correspondingly ahmad et al 2018 also reported the higher bcf values 0 45 0 49 for fe in ground and wastewater treated samples correspondingly it has been observed that heavy metals are important for plants and human health in small amount but if their concentration exceeds the permissible limit they become health hazards divrikli et al 2006 in present research all the samples showed the bio concentration factor for fe less than 1 which showed that the consumption of these grains does not cause the fe toxicity hassan et al 2013 3 2 10 enrichment factor enrichment factor 1 indicates no transport of metal by soil toward plants so in current research no fe was uptake by plant birth 2003 taha et al 2013 also showed the same results iron is a transition metal and it forms the chelates with the organic material in the clay that is why it is not available for plant to uptake planquart et al 1999 3 2 11 daily intake of metal khan et al 2017 0 01 0 01 mg kg day and ahmad et al 2018 0 004 0 02 mg kg day reported the values of dim of fe in ground and wastewater grown samples correspondingly these were observed within range of the current study khan et al 2016a b investigated the higher daily intake values 0 04 0 03 mg kg day for iron in gw and sw grown wheat samples correspondingly all the samples had the dim values of fe beneath to the daily tolerable limit 45 mg kg day usepa 2002 3 2 12 health risk index khan et al 2017 0 01 0 02 and ahmad et al 2018 0 006 0 02 suggested the hri values in ground and wastewater grown samples correspondingly for fe as about similar to present work health risk index for fe in ground and waste water treated samples 0 06 0 04 correspondingly were found higher khan et al 2016a b all living organisms contain the fe as it is an important element it is considered between the edge of macro and micro nutrients iron is a less studied element in wheat grain analysis as compared to other heavy metals hassan et al 2013 in current study all the samples had the hri less than 1 which means that there is no fe toxicity due to utilization of these grains 4 conclusion the present study involved an analysis of fe concentrations in various parts of wheat varieties grown in soils irrigated with different sources of water in pakistan there are no safe and tolerable limits established for heavy metals in irrigation water soil and food crops all the samples had dim values of fe were observed lower than standard tolerable limits and values of hri less than 1 which indicates that there is no fe toxicity due to utilization of wheat grains and its accumulation from soil to plant varied according to metal wheat variety and water source however it did not follow any particular pattern proximate nutrient and anti nutrient contents in wheat were greatly affected by industrial water 5 future prospects and recommendations different wheat varieties should be studied on molecular to assess the most resistant variety against heavy metal toxicity furthermore study of transfer of metals to humans and animals via food chain is required moreover study to check possible

9157,various field trials were performed at different locations of punjab pakistan to study the effect of trace metals on uptake of iron fe and wheat productivity as well as the health risk assessment by ingestion of wheat grains grown with application of different irrigation sources the experimental design was laid out in rcbd having four replications soil samples were taken before sowing of crop from 0 to 15 cm depth and triticum astivum samples were taken after irrigation through different water treatments examined for pollution load index pli bioaccumulation factor baf translocation factor tf bioconcentration factor bcf daily intake of metal dim and health risk index hri parameters fe concentrations in soil from five districts where wheat types watered with 3 different supplies ranged from 30 28 to 41 03 mg kg and in grain sample ranged between 1 36 and 6 74 mg kg all the samples had dim values of fe were observed lower than standard tolerable limits and values of hri less than 1 which indicates that there is no fe toxicity due to utilization of wheat grains keywords risk factor sewage toxicity trace elements wheat iron health risk index data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction due to the scarcity of fresh water farmers are enforced to apply wastewater without any treatment as an alternative to fresh water that results in toxic effects on crops as well as on people that is also responsible for heavy metals to accumulate in the soil the capacity of plants to take up heavy metals is diverse as some plants accumulate more heavy metals than other plants and cause different health risks to people via food chain industrial wastewater is also used for irrigation purpose that is enriched with organic matter and is also contaminated with heavy metals such as zn fe cd cr cu pb co ni and hg municipal wastewater is the largest source which can be used for irrigation purpose however it contains a significant amount of chemical pollutants due to the continuous use of wastewater crop productivity and the fertility of the soil is increased which encourages farmers however structural deterioration soil salinization and equalization acidification are the problems which are associated with the continuous use of wastewater and it lowers the productivity of the soil in spite of these complexities wastewater up to now is being applied on the fields plants and soil can be protected from the adverse effect of wastewater by its usage in a planned way but somehow it can still pose a threat to them so there is a need to determine the contamination level of water from different sources and the transfer of contaminants from water to soil and food crops this study will be helpful for plant breeders and farmers to realize the effect of ground sewage and industrial water on soil and wheat plants wheat triticum aestivum l along with rice and corn is one of the major crop in three extensively farmed crops on earth due to its high nutritional content olabanji et al 2007 pakistan produces the most wheat of any developing country and it also has the greatest per capita wheat production pakistan s two provinces punjab and sindh are the most significant producers of wheat with punjab leading the way during the dry rabbi season of winter the wheat is produced in punjab and is the most important food grain along with rice rajaram and hettel 1995 wheat is considered as pakistan s staple food and is grown in practically every corner of the country khan et al 2017 the main irrigation resource in pakistan is its canal system it has the largest canal irrigation system worldwide as the agricultural land area is increasing day by day the canal irrigation system is not satisfying this extended area and due to this reason water is a limiting factor for proper maintenance of agriculture awan 1979 world bank 2004 for irrigation there is a gradual decline in freshwater resources the use of recycled water from sewage processing has increased al khamisia et al 2012 heavy metals may accumulate in fertile soil and plants if recycled industrialized or municipal effluent is used in agriculture singh et al 2010 heavy metals mainly harmful components that can sabotage the benefits of using recycled water in agriculture petrus and warchol 2005 when heavy metals are accumulated in agricultural soil and crops it leads to intense ecological problems because they are persistent and non biodegradable property and can result in accumulation in various human body parts muhammad et al 2011 iron is an element which is necessarily found in almost all living things it is part of blood oxygen carrying compound called hemoglobin its deficiency cause anemia its concentration lies between the macro and micro elements of living organisms those enzymes and proteins which possess iron have heme prosthetic groups which contribute to various biological oxidations and transport iron is mostly ignored in the wheat grain analysis hassan et al 2013 plants require fe for their initial stages of growth when young parts are growing the pale color of older leaves and larger veins show the deficiency of fe in dry and little moist areas the quantity of iron in the soil is up to 35 which is insufficient for the proper growth of plants therefore plants in these areas mostly show chlorosis in relation to the plants of semi humid and humid areas as recommended by who the value of fe in drinking water is 1 0 mg l patel et al 2011 continuous intake of excess amount of fe can induce mammary tumors in rats which may be carcinogenic and kidney tumors in syrian hamsters which are estrogen stimulated regulation of estrogen elevates the easy uptake of fe by cells many types of cancers which are related to estrogen are the results of an excess amount of iron stored in body stores lieher and jones 2001 as a catalyst fe plays an important role in chlorophyll synthesis and also plays an essential role in many biochemical reactions as suggested by who the acceptable value of fe is 20 mg kg shah et al 2011 keeping in view the above scenario this project was planned to study the impact of trace elements on uptake of iron fe and health risk assessment by ingestion of wheat grains grown with application of various irrigation sources 2 materials and methods 2 1 research location seven punjab districts

institutional animal ethics committee university of sargodha approval no 25a18 iec uos all the experiments performed compile with the rules of the national research council and all methods were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations fig 1 2 3 water collection 100 ml each of gw ground water sw sewage water and industrialized waste water iww samples were collected from seven areas in punjab all replicates samples were collected in polypropylene bottles cleaned by nitric acid 1 before being transported to the laboratory and kept at 4 c until analysis afnor 1997 2 4 sampling chosen locations were excavated up to 12 15 cm deep with a stainless steel auger partially including all layers of soil samples were air dehydrated before being placed in a 72 forced air oven for 47 h these samples were stock up inside sealed labeled paper container and set aside in an incubator at 70 c for five days rhue and kidder 1983 the samples of wheat grains stems and root were taken from each area for each water resource husks were separated to grains wheat samples were extensively rinsed with water after being completely cleaned through tap water to eliminate dust and dirt particles all samples were air dried before being placed for 47 h in a 72 oven after being removed from the oven all of the samples were changed to powder form using a grinder pulverized and sifted aydin et al 2015 2 5 digestion following apha guidelines all types of wastewater samples obtained from seven districts were digested apha 2005 after adding 10 ml of strong hno3 to water samples 50 ml the digestion was proceeded at 80 c awaiting the solution turned to translucent then filtered using 0 22 ml whatman filters maidstone uk and distill water was added to made volume 50 ml wet digestion was employed to digest the samples of soil and crops parts 1 g of every dehydrated sample was putt in 15 ml of h2so4 hclo4 and hno3 solution 1 1 5 at 80 c until the solution turned into a clear liquid final volume of every sample was raised to 50 ml after filtration of the digested solutions and then saved into bottles for later investigation allen et al 1986 2 6 preparation of standard solution of given metals after suitable calculations a standard curve for fe was produced using a 1000 ppm stock solution and well dried iron sulfide then in a 100 ml volumetric flask 10 ml of the appropriate stock solution and 90 ml of distilled water were carefully combined to make a 100 ppm metal solution filling the needed ml from the second stock solution into 100 ml flask and then making the solution to 100 ml by adding distilled water to make the appropriate element concentrations 2 7 analytical method to determine fe following conclusion of digestion all replicates were analyzed for fe using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer and wet digestion and then diluted as needed 2 8 pollution load index to evaluate the whole amount of soil contamination pollution load index pli was determined

et al 2013 pli was checked by liu et al 2005 1 pli fe is fe rs m rs reference value of the fe in soil 2 9 bio accumulation factor baf for fe metal is determined as relative amount of heavy metals quantity inside crops to soil concentration by zhuang et al 2013 and was founded by cui et al 2007 li et al 2007 2 baf fe shoots fe soil 2 10 translocation factor tf is a calculation for capability of crops plants to transport stored heavy metals from an organ towards the other organ of plant bermudez et al 2011 in this investigation the metal transport from roots toward shoots of wheat crop was determined by cui et al 2007 li et al 2007 3 tf fe shoots fe soil 2 11 bio concentration factor determination of bcf was meant for measurement of heavy metals appropriate to eatable parts of cereal crops especially in grains related to the amount of metals inside soil if the bcf was greater than 1 it can be stated that heavy metals were present in elevated amounts inside the crops parts in comparison to the soil kisku et al 2000 bcf was calculated by cui et al 2004 4 bcf fe w graiins fe soil 2 12 enrichment factor ef is used to determine the human s activities that are responsible for accumulation of heavy metal concentration inside the soil to show feasible pressure by human activities towards heavy metal buildup in soil amount of heavy metals categorized by the low variability of

determined for evaluation of the risks correlated to consumption heavy metal polluted wheat grains if the values of hri is 1 people will be facing no hazard to eating of those type of grains cui et al 2004 it has been stated if the hri 1 then the inhabitants face hazard at high risk sajjad et al 2009 7 hri dim daily intake of metal rfd oral reference dose 2 15 calculation of percentage the average metal percentage is the amount transported from soil towards roots roots towards shoots and shoots towards grains and it was determined by division of sum of values of metal in the soil by the proportions inside roots then multiplying by 100 a similar method was roots towards shoots and the shoots towards the grains 2 16 statistical analysis all of the samples findings were submitted to variance analysis through anova as needed and the results were best adapted to field analysis as a totally randomized block design using the minitab 16 software the data from each characteristic was statistically analyzed it allows users to focus on data analysis and interpretation as well as the outcomes it does the computations and generates the graphs automatically to discover significant differences between mean values a three way anova 3 factor factorial design was used in addition to anova the tucky test was used the tucky test is a single step multiple comparison statistical test every treatment s mean is compared to the means of every other treatment in the tucky test 2 17 quality control analysis to avoid contamination standards were carefully prepared the dry weight of soil and vegetable samples was used to determine their size for each sample analyses were carried out three times to excellence guarantee of the results quality control procedures were strictly followed

lowest was 0 63 in watan treated with ground water according to data since year one the punjab 2011 treated with ground water had the highest tf value of 0 88 in 2nd year whereas seher 2006 treated with industrialized water had the poorest 0 73 3 1 9 bio concentration factor for fe the bio concentration value varied as 0 03 0 17 table 11 the lowest bcf for fe was found in the faislabad 2008 which was treated with gw in 2nd year and the highest in the punjab 2011 which was cultivated by industrialized water in 2nd year 3 1 10 enrichment factor in all types of samples the ef for fe was shown to be below one nevertheless the ef level of fe in different kinds of wheat cultivars was unaffected by resource of irrigation or year the enrichment factor for fe in various as 0 005 0 02 in different samples table 10 the lowest value of enrichment factor for fe was found in varieties faislabad 2008 treated by ground water in farming years 1 and 2 watan treated with ground water in 2nd year and punjab 2011 treated using ground water in 2nd year punjab 2011 which was treated using industrialized water in 2nd year has the highest fe ef value 3 1 11 daily intake of metal dim of fe in all five kinds varied between 0 005 and 0 03 mg kg day according to the findings table 11 punjab 2011 which was treated with industrialized water in 2nd year had the greatest daily fe intake whereas faislabad 2008 which was treated using ground water in 2nd year had the lowest 3 1 12 health risk index hri for fe in various specimens ranged between 0 008 0 04 according to findings table 11 the punjab 2011 irrigation using industrialized water in 2nd year had the greatest value whereas faislabad 2008 treated by ground water in 1st year and likewise watan treated utilizing gw in 2nd year had the minimum values 3 2 iron 3 2 1 water the fe quantities 0 09 2 66 mg l indicated by alghobar and suresha 2016a b in ground and sewage samples correspondingly were substantially higher in all types of water samples in ground and sewage samples kobaissi et al 2014 found decreased fe concentrations 0 02 0 65 mg l iron inside in every type of water sample of both years was much higher than the allowable limit 5 0 mg l settled by the wwf 2007 naturally fe is present in lakes underground water and rivers other resources of fe in water includes the natural deposits corrosion of fe containing metals industrialized wastes and refining of iron ores they can bio accumulate in the food chain and are resistant to degradation ravindra et al 2014 3 2 2 soil kobaissi et al 2014 accounted higher fe value 282 17 mg kg in soil applied with wastewater iron concentration in all soil samples of two growing years was seen elevated in contrast to the values 1 21 1 59 mg kg of fe in gw and sww applied to soils correspondingly as calculated by owliaie 2016 ahmad et al 2018 had given the lower fe concentrations 3 04 3 96 mg kg in ground fresh and waste water treated soils correspondingly it has been observed that the soil treated with sewage water is rich in organic matter and nutrients moreover it is a low cost system for sewage water discarding ullah et al 2011 ghosh et al 2012 iron contents in all the samples were found lower than the greatest permitted value 56 90 150 mg kg given by dosumu et al 2005 and nrc 2001 correspondingly in current research the high fe concentrations were observed in soil samples but its concentration was below the utmost permitted value and being an important nutrient its high concentration in soil is not harmful 3 2 3 root iron values 5641 8533 mg kg in roots treated with gw and sww correspondingly accounted by alrawiq et al 2014 were found elevated in relation to the current research when fe was accumulated in high concentration in the roots it might be attributed to the microbial activity in roots which discharge organic acids which facilitate the accumulation and absorption of iron in the roots which might be the reason of its high concentration in the roots crowley et al 1991 kobaissi et al 2014 also suggested the higher fe concentration in roots it is investigated that in neutral to alkaline soil the availability of iron is reduced which makes the plant iron deficient although it is present in abundance iron is present in insoluble oxidized form due to this reason about thirty percent of world s cultivated soils are calcareous with low fe availability mori 1999 3 2 4 shoot in present research the accumulation of fe in various classes of shoots sample were found high as compared to the value 4 78 mg kg determined by yap et al 2009 it has been noticed that the reason for high concentration of metals such as pb fe mn and cd etc in various parts of plants is due to the continuous use of wastewater and their derivation from the rocks in agricultural area excess use of pesticides and fertilizers are also the possible reasons for high level of these metals qian et al 1996 alrawiq et al 2014 concluded the high fe concentration 69 77 mg kg in shoots sample treated by sw the lower fe contents 8 91 11 8 mg kg were found in shoot samples treated with correspondingly as suggested by kobaissi et al 2014 3 2 5 grains iron concentrations in all types of samples treated with gw and sww in two growing years were found lower than those values 7 84 5 29 mg kg showed by khan et al 2016a b in gw and sww treated grains correspondingly however fe value in grains of punjab 2011 treated with industrialized water in 2nd year was contained by the assortment of above mention values the concentration of cd in grains treated with ground water were found within the range of current study while all the wastewater samples exceed the value given by khan et al 2019 in wastewater samples rattan et al 2005 had given the higher fe concentrations 336 404 mg kg in grains treated with gw and sww correspondingly iron values were lesser to highest tolerable limit 425 5 mg kg as suggested by the fao who 2001 current values were lower than the findings 195 342 mg kg of alghobar and suresha 2016a b in the grain treated with gw and sww correspondingly primarily the composition of trace elements relies upon the availability of the minerals in the soil however different levels of minerals may get uptake by the various types of wheat varieties from the same type of soil or the same may absorb various quantities of minerals in different soils svencnjak et al 2013 it has been observed that fe transfer from soil towards roots roots towards shoots and shoots towards grains were found in the following order soil towards roots roots towards shoots shoots towards grains 3 2 6 pollution load index for fe pli in current research for all samples were seen lower in comparison to findings of ahmad et al 2016 at two different sites pollution load index 0 36 0 45 suggested by khan et al 2016a b in two different sites was found lower the range for pli of fe given by ololade 2014 1 06 1 1 and izah et al 2017 1 05 1 14 was found higher fe pli for every type of samples was 1 indicated that soil was not polluted with fe 3 2 7 bio accumulation factor bio accumulation factor in all types of samples treated with 3 types of water in two growing years was found elevated to investigation of khan et al 2016a b 0 4 however our findings were contradictory to that of hadif et al 2015 who did not report baf for fe baf indicated that there was inconsistency in and across the varieties by treatments it is observed that soil types soil metal amount soil ph cation exchange capacity and dissimilar crop varieties influence metal absorbed by plants barancikova et al 2004 3 2 8 translocation factor the lower tf 0 01 0 01 for fe was determined by alrawiq et al 2014 in ground and wastewater correspondingly the range 0 008 0 01 given by hadif et al 2015 for tf of iron was seen low in comparison to present research it has also been observed metals large quantity absorbed by the cereal crops gather into the roots where the metabolic rate was higher however the accumulation in stem and leaves was found minimum mo et al 2001 3 2 9 bio concentration factor fe bcf for all types of samples was lower than those values 0 67 0 66 suggested by khan et al 2017 in ground and wastewater treated samples correspondingly ahmad et al 2018 also reported the higher bcf values 0 45 0 49 for fe in ground and wastewater treated samples correspondingly it has been observed that heavy metals are important for plants and human health in small amount but if their concentration exceeds the permissible limit they become health hazards divrikli et al 2006 in present research all the samples showed the bio concentration factor for fe less than 1 which showed that the consumption of these grains does not cause the fe toxicity hassan et al 2013 3 2 10 enrichment factor enrichment factor 1 indicates no transport of metal by soil toward plants so in current research no fe was uptake by plant birth 2003 taha et al 2013 also showed the same results iron is a transition metal and it forms the chelates with the organic material in the clay that is why it is not available for plant to uptake planquart et al 1999 3 2 11 daily intake of metal khan et al 2017 0 01 0 01 mg kg day and ahmad et al 2018 0 004 0 02 mg kg day reported the values of dim of fe in ground and wastewater grown samples correspondingly these were observed within range of the current study khan et al 2016a b investigated the higher daily intake values 0 04 0 03 mg kg day for iron in gw and sw grown wheat samples correspondingly all the samples had the dim values of fe beneath to the daily tolerable limit 45 mg kg day usepa 2002 3 2 12 health risk index khan et al 2017 0 01 0 02 and ahmad et al 2018 0 006 0 02 suggested the hri values in ground and wastewater grown samples correspondingly for fe as about similar to present work health risk index for fe in ground and waste water treated samples 0 06 0 04 correspondingly were found higher khan et al 2016a b all living organisms contain the fe as it is an important element it is considered between the edge of macro and micro nutrients iron is a less studied element in wheat grain analysis as compared to other heavy metals hassan et al 2013 in current study all the samples had the hri less than 1 which means that there is no fe toxicity due to utilization of these grains 4 conclusion the present study involved an analysis of fe concentrations in various parts of wheat varieties grown in soils irrigated with different sources of water in pakistan there are no safe and tolerable limits established for heavy metals in irrigation water soil and food crops all the samples had dim values of fe were observed lower than standard tolerable limits and values of hri less than 1 which indicates that there is no fe toxicity due to utilization of wheat grains and its accumulation from soil to plant varied according to metal wheat variety and water source however it did not follow any particular pattern proximate nutrient and anti nutrient contents in wheat were greatly affected by industrial water 5 future prospects and recommendations different wheat varieties should be studied on molecular to assess the most resistant variety against heavy metal toxicity furthermore study of transfer of metals to humans and animals via food chain is required moreover study to check possible effects of climatic conditions in heavy metals uptake should be conducted credit authorship contribution statement author contributions conceptualization yan sun fu chen and asma zafar data curation

9158,in the upcoming irrigation management in agricultural production accurate mapping of crop water consumption with a high spatial and temporal resolution at a farm scale is needed in this study we developed models for crop coefficients k c estimation using unmanned aerial vehicle uav remote sensing and machine learning ml techniques for irrigated maize in a semi arid region in northwest china k c values were calculated using a procedure given in fao56 manual using field measurements multispectral vegetation indices vis vegetation fraction vf thermal based vis and texture information ti were derived from uav based multispectral rgb and thermal infrared imagery respectively these remotely sensed variables and their combinations were used to develop prediction models using six ml algorithms linear regression lr polynomial regression pr exponential regression er random forest regression rfr support vector regression svr and deep neural network dnn among these models the rfr with the highest accuracy r 2 0 69 rmse 0 1019 was recommended to estimate maize k c the multispectral and thermal based vis and texture of the near infrared band had greater contributions than rgb based vf and ti in the k c rfr model under different irrigation treatments furthermore the maize k c rfr prediction model had high accuracy in estimating cumulative evapotranspiration r 2 0 89 rmse 15 0 mm stage during different growth stages and daily soil water content r 2 0 85 rmse 0 0089 m3 m3 in the root zone these results show that the integration of uav remote sensing and ml provides a promising tool to help farmers make decisions using timely mapped crop water consumption especially under water shortages or drought conditions keywords crop water requirement fao56 evapotranspiration uav crop coefficient random forest regression data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction crop evapotranspiration et plays an important role in efficient irrigation management et is closely related to meteorological drivers soil factors and crop growth conditions crop et can be directly measured by a lysimeter lópez urrea et al 2020 the eddy covariance method jiang et al 2021 or the bowen ratio energy balance zhang et al 2008 however these forms of et measurements are expensive and difficult to apply to a field scale due to the differences in spatial scale traditionally et can be calculated using the widely accepted fao56 method which is based on reference evapotranspiration et0 and a crop coefficient k c allen et al 1998 et0 represents the meteorological evaporative demand and is calculated using local weather data the k c in the fao56 method represents the physical and physiological differences between a specific crop and the reference crop e g grass or alfalfa according to the fao56 method k c eq 1 is defined as follows 1 k c k s k cb k e where k cb is the basal crop coefficient representing the ratio of crop transpiration to et0 under full irrigation conditions k e is the soil evaporation coefficient representing the ratio of soil evaporation to et0 k s is the soil water stress coefficient representing the influence of the soil water stress factor on crop transpiration and k s is equal to 1 when representing no water stress and is less than 1 when representing water stress conditions the accurate and rapid acquisition of k c is significant to estimate et especially for understanding crop water consumption in a semiarid region of northwest china chen et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 the fao56 method has been employed to estimate et for many crops such as cotton cholpankulov et al 2008 soybean luis et al 2017 sunflower miao et al 2016 tomato zheng et al 2013 and wheat sánchez et al 2015 and the method also estimates maize et well in different regions of china ding et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 the daily k c value is obtained by a smooth continuous k c curve function in time units jensen and allen 2016 however the parameters of the fao56 method are complex and require a large amount of observational data limitations such as the time required and the lack of monitoring crop growth and crop water use patterns affected by climate soil cultivation management etc jiang et al 2014 qiu et al 2015 hinder the application of the fao56 method in precision irrigation practices additionally differences in water consumption exist at a spatial scale due to nonuniform irrigation soil characteristics fertilization or pests therefore the acquisition of the spatial distribution of kc is important to irrigation management at a field scale k c values can be obtained remotely either on the ground plant scale in the air field scale or by satellite from local to national continental and global scales pôças et al 2020 vegetation indices vis calculated by different spectral bands of remote sensing imagery to rapidly and nondestructively assess crop growth statuses liang et al 2020 qiao et al 2019 seo et al 2019 xie et al 2015 are used to estimate k c hunsaker et al 2003 used ground based vis to predict k cb at a field scale some researchers estimated k c using satellite based vis at a regional scale gontia and tiwari 2010 maselli et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 unmanned aerial vehicle uav based vis have been suitable approaches to monitor crop growth at a field scale in recent years due to the features of uav remote sensing such as its short operating cycle high resolution and low cost rango et al 2009 previous studies also investigated a few k c estimation models based on uav based vis han et al 2018 estimated maize k c using six types of uav based vis under different irrigation conditions but did not investigate the maize k c prediction model for the whole growth season zhang et al 2019c established maize k c using uav based vi soil water content swc and leaf area index lai during the whole growth season nevertheless maize k c prediction needs to be tested using longer time series of data shao et al 2021 estimated maize k c using uav based vis and ground based lai under different irrigation conditions the above maize k c estimation models included ground based parameters i e lai and swc and it is relatively difficult to directly generate the spatial distribution of k c values therefore it is imperative to estimate the maize k c values at a field scale using only remote sensing data vis from multispectral optical sensors remain asymptotically saturated among dense and heterogeneous canopies rischbeck et al 2016 which affects the application of vis in monitoring crop status during high vegetation coverage stages structural thermal and textural features extracted from uav based multisensors e g multispectral rgb and thermal infrared cameras have also been employed for predicting various plant traits in previous studies canopy structure information such as canopy coverage or vegetation fraction has been used for the basal crop coefficient k cb pereira et al 2020b and lai nielsen et al 2012 canopy thermal features such as thermal based crop water stress indices were used for estimating crop coefficients kullberg et al 2017 as well as monitoring crop status han et al 2016 and yield guo et al 2016 canopy texture features representing the spatial variation of pixel intensities within an image emphasize the plant canopy structural and geometric features and have been used for estimating crop biomass niu et al 2019 zheng et al 2018 lai li et al 2018 and chlorophyll content lu et al 2018 few studies have directly estimated maize k c using texture features under different irrigation conditions previous studies maimaitijiang et al 2017 2020 have reported that the combination of canopy spectral thermal structure and texture information extracted from multiple sensors has the potential to improve the accuracy of crop trait estimations over using features from a single sensor therefore the features extracted from uav multispectral rgb and thermal infrared images were applied for maize k c estimation in the current study some regression methods such as multiple linear regression mlr han et al 2018 zhang et al 2019c linear regression lr gontia and tiwari 2010 kamble et al 2013 polynomial regression pr alam et al 2018 and exponential regression er er raki et al 2013 have been used for a variety of crops shao et al 2021 implemented random forest regression rfr to predict maize k c based on lai and six types of multispectral vis they found that rfr models gave more accurate k c estimates than mlr models support vector regression svr models dou and yang 2018 tang et al 2018 have been proposed for actual et estimations with meteorological soil and crop variables because they provide easy solutions for nonlinear functions deep neural networks dnns perform well in many cases such as image recognition classification and regression tasks due to their capability of learning complex relations between input and output variables using multiple hidden layers chen et al 2020 2019 kaba et al 2018 there have been several studies predicting maize k c at a field scale based on multispectral vis swc and lai using machine learning methods however few studies have reported remote sensing methods based on uav based multispectral rgb and thermal infrared information using novel models such as svm dnn and rfr in addition the contributions of inputs from uav based multisensors to the maize k c estimation model have still not been fully investigated therefore the specific objectives of this study were to i investigate the potential of uav remote sensing e g rgb multispectral and thermal infrared images in k c prediction at a field scale using two years 2018 and 2019 of data and obtain a high resolution centimeter pixel daily k c map ii compare rfr based k c with lr pr er svr and dnn based k c iii test the contributions of canopy coverage canopy spectra texture thermal information and their combinations to k c estimation and iv evaluate the adaptability of the uav based maize k c estimation model under different irrigation levels 2 materials and methods 2 1 test site and irrigation treatments the

shown in table 2 was measured by a rain gauge cylinder with three replications 2 2 data acquisition the acquisition of uav imagery from multiple sensors was integrated into crop monitoring applications maimaitijiang et al 2017 2020 uav multispectral rededge micasense inc seattle usa high resolution rgb dji technology co shenzhen china and thermal infrared flir systems inc portland usa

information extraction the canopy spectral structure texture and thermal information used in this study table 4 were computed at small plots to identify relationships with the corresponding maize k c values shao et al 2021 used ms based vis ndvi savi evi tcari gndvi and vari to estimate maize k c four types of vis sr ndre ndrei and mcari were added to the study the choice of these indices was based on their characteristics sr with a large range of values presents sensitivity and provides complementary information when the crop is in its high vegetation fraction growth stage filgueiras et al 2020 ndre ndrei and mcari contain different combinations of red edge nir red and green bands additionally vegetation fraction vf the percentage of vegetation area per ground surface area was used as crop density information to estimate maize kc the maize canopy area was extracted from rgb imagery using the ostu method classified maize pixels divided the total number of pixels in the plot to

dnn and svr methods fig 3 the vegetation fraction was extracted from uav based rgb imagery canopy spectral vis were calculated from uav based ms imagery texture information was obtained from uav based rgb red green and blue bands ms red edge and nir bands and tir thermal infrared band imagery the preprocessing methods for uav imagery can be found in shao et al 2021 k c estimation models using lr pr and er methods based on uav ms based vis were established to validate the methods reported in previous studies for predicting maize k c at a field scale the k c prediction models using rfr dnn and svr methods based on ms rgb tir and the combinations of these sensors were established to select an optimal method to estimate the maize k c at a field scale and to generate a high resolution k c map the applicability of the optimal k c estimation model was evaluated under different irrigation treatments the uav based k c estimation model was applied to obtain daily swc in the root zone using the daily soil water balance method compared with swb based swc additionally the uav based k c prediction model was also used for calculating cumulative evapotranspiration cet using machine learning methods compared with fao56 and swb based cet under different rapid middle and late growth stages 2 4 5 machine learning models for estimating k c and model evaluation the dnn model has multiple hidden layers to learn more complex nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs the rectified linear unit relu activation function is employed by the neurons in each hidden layer due to its better performance compared with other activation functions ghimire et al 2019 the number of hidden layers in dnn in this study was two the kernel based svr model is a supervised soft computing algorithm that simultaneously minimizes estimation errors and model complexity chen et al 2013 the radial basis function was used as a kernel function in the study due to its good prediction accuracy and model stability in agricultural applications fan et al 2018 the key parameters of the rfr dnn and svr models were confirmed by the trial and error approach and were optimized using the grid search method al fugara et al 2020 fan et al 2021 the tree number n estimators and the maximum depth of trees max depth in the rfr algorithm were optimized ranging from 50 to 500 at 50 intervals and from 5 to 15 at 1 interval the number of neurons in the two hidden layers units1 and units2 iteration epochs and learning rate learning rate in dnn models were optimized with values ranging from 10 to 100 at 10 intervals from 50 to 500 at 50 intervals and from 0 01 to 0 1 at 0 01 intervals respectively the penalty parameter cost and kernel parameter gamma in the svr algorithm were also optimized ranging from 0 1 to 1 5 at 0 1 intervals for both parameters additional parameters were left at the default values in the python scikit learn package https scikit learn org the optimized parameters of the rfr dnn and svr models based on the eight combinations table 5 as inputs are shown in table 6 for k c estimation models 80 475 samples of all samples selected randomly were used as the training set and the remaining samples 119 samples were used as the validation set to ensure the reliability of the model accuracy five fold cross validation method stone 1974 was used to evaluate the k c models including coefficient of determination r 2 and root mean square error rmse high values of r 2 closer to 1 and low values of rmse demonstrate good accuracy for k c estimation models 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation of canopy temperature derived from thermal infrared imagery the correlation of canopy temperatures measured by the uav thermal infrared camera and hand held thermal imager was high r 2 0 98 rmse 1 52 fig 4 which indicates that the accuracy of canopy temperature measured by the uav thermal infrared camera was acceptable consistently maimaitijiang et al 2020 also reported similar results r 2 0 985 rmse 1 34 the corresponding temperatures in the uav thermal imagery can be further converted to surface temperatures through a linear model fig 4 before measuring the surface temperatures of ground targets the bias of temperature for the hand held thermal imager was measured compared with the blackbody calibration source 3 2 k c prediction models using lr pr and er methods the accuracies of vi based k c models using lr pr and er methods were low table 7 with r 2 values ranging from 0 01 0 20 these results are lower than those r 2 0 63 0 95 of vi based k c models presented in previous studies alam et al 2018 baburao et al 2013 er raki et al 2013 gontia and tiwari 2010 rozenstein et al 2019 the aforementioned results indicate that vis based k c prediction models using lr pr and er algorithms were not suitable for our field maize these differences are probably due to the differences between crop varieties spatial scale climate and field management the results of the older vi based k c prediction models against those in our field measurements demonstrate the limitation of the models established by previous researchers and the new proposed models in the study should be further tested in various environments and varieties 3 3 performance of rfr svr and dnn models for k c estimation compared with the accuracies of maize k c estimation models using lr pr and er methods table 7 the accuracies of the rfr svr and dnn based k c prediction models table 8 were higher the results indicate that the algorithms which could learn complex nonlinear relationships between inputs and output were useful for improving the accuracy of maize k c prediction the accuracy of the rfr based k c estimation model r 2 0 57 0 69 rmse 0 1033 0 1208 was better than that of the svr r 2 0 33 0 59 rmse 0 1153 0 1506 and the dnn based r 2 0 17 0 47 rmse 0 1333 0 1699 models obviously the rfr model was more suitable for daily maize k c estimation due to its advantage in modeling complex nonlinear relationships between k c and its driving variables the rfr model containing all variables combination id 8 ms rgb and tir did not always improve the accuracy of k c prediction when compared with combination id 5 ms rgb thermal features provided redundant spectral information for predicting maize k c which indicates that the rfr models were not more useful when more complex relations between the multivariate inputs and output existed the accuracies table 8 of k c estimation model using the ms combination of ms and rgb ms and tir and ms rgb and tir were similar r 2 0 68 0 69 0 68 or 0 69 it indicates that the ms was a suitable and economic approach to directly predict maize k c at a field scale and rgb and tir were not very effective in improving the accuracy of the maize k c prediction model using the rfr method therefore the features obtained from the ms should be included in machine learning models for maize k c estimation previous researchers found that the relationship between the basal crop coefficient k cb and vis was high campos et al 2017 odi lara et al 2016 consistently crop water stress coefficient k s can be calculated based on the temperature based crop water stress index cwsi extracted from uav based infrared thermal imagery pereira et al 2020b zhang et al 2019b zhou et al 2021 e g k s 1 cwsi and the cwsi can also be estimated by uav based vis zhang et al 2021 the k c include k cb k s and k e factors therefore the variables related to soil evaporation may have potential to improve the accuracy of the maize kc estimation model besides some rfr based kc estimation values deviated greatly from 1 1 line under the tr3 condition during the rapid growth stage fig 5 the reason may be that the fraction of exposed soil was higher during the rapid growth stage and deficit irrigation treatments resulted in large fluctuation of k e microwave remote sensing allows for the measurement of water content at the soil surface dari et al 2021 zhang et al 2019a and may be a potential approach to improve the accuracy of k c estimation in summary a high resolution spatial distribution centimeter pixel of maize k c fig 6 could be obtained at a field scale using the rfr method based on the combination of uav rgb ms and tir information the rfr based k c map can provide support for obtaining the spatial variability of water use and prescription maps of variable rate irrigation for maize at a field scale it was necessary to select high contribution variables using the rfr method to obtain a better explanatory power for the k c prediction model the chosen high contribution parameters table 9 for the k c rfr estimation model were multispectral vis gndvi savi and mcari thermal indices tcratio and dact and textural information nir me among which the gndvi was the primary variable these results demonstrate that uav vis with nir and red green and red and red edge red and green bands were strongly related to the k c estimation rozenstein et al 2019 reported that vis based on combination of red edge and red bands also performed well for cotton k c estimation by introducing ms based texture information and thermal index the accuracy of maize k c prediction can be improved r 2 0 69 rmse 0 1019 compared with the ms based vis and the result is better than that r 2 0 65 rmse 0 1373 of maize k c estimation based on the ground based lai and ms based vis reported by shao et al 2021 canopy structure information can partly overcome asymptotic saturation problems concerning spectral features wallace 2013 the canopy coverage vf from the rgb imagery has little contribution to the maize k c rfr prediction model based on the combination of ms and rgb or a combination of ms tir and rgb table 9 the reason may be that the training data for the model were mainly concentrated in the high canopy coverage growth stage and the value of vf had a relatively small range during the growth stage 3 4 maize k c prediction using the rfr method for different water treatments the maize k c estimation model was applied to tr1 and tr8 to evaluate the adaptability of the model under different irrigation treatments the k c rfr model exhibited a high prediction accuracy under tr1 and tr8 with an r 2 of 0 74 and an rmse of 0 072 fig 7 violin plots of the fao56 and rfr based k c under tr1 and tr8 are shown in fig 8 to further explore the difference in the distribution of estimated and observed maize k c values the results show that the differences between the fao56 and rfr based k c were not significant for tr1 or tr8 based on anova with the hsd tukey test however significant differences were shown for the fao56 and rfr based kc between tr1 and tr8 shao et al 2021 also reported the same results for maize k c estimation using the rfr method based on uav vis and ground based lai besides a higher frequency of small absolute errors 0 0 05 and a lower frequency of high absolute errors 0 1 0 25 were obtained fig 9 by the k c rfr model compared with the k c fao56 model under tr1 and tr8 all these results confirm that the maize k c rfr prediction model established in the study is an advanced method and adaptable to distinguish maize k c differences among different irrigation levels at a field scale 3 5 rfr based k c estimation model for calculating cumulative et and swb based swc in the root zone the interpolation method was used to complete the daily et when the remote sensing data lacked days to further evaluate the performance of the rfr based k c prediction model established in the study rfr and fao56 based k c for calculating the cumulative et cetrfr and cetfao56 was compared with swb based cumulative et cetswb as shown in fig 10 this figure shows that cetfao56 and cetrfr during different growth stages were strongly related to cetswb with r 2 values of 0 89 and 0 89 respectively the results indicate that the accuracy of fao56 and rfr based maize k c prediction was high cetfao56 and cetrfr slightly underestimated cetswb during the middle growth stage fig 10 however the results were still not poor with rmse values in the range of 15 0 15 3 mm stage 4 8 of the total water consumption shao et al 2021 also reported a similar result for estimating cet using the k c rfr model based on uav vis and lai these results demonstrate that the accuracy of the rfr based k c prediction model based on uav multisensor ms rgb and tir or ms for estimating cetrfr is acceptable during different growth stages in the future the use of a lysimeter or eddy covariance technology will be helpful to improve the confidence of the result of the maize k c rfr estimation model for estimating cet rfr based k c for computing swc values based on the daily et and d r using the daily swb method eq 13 in the root zone were compared to the measured swc values fig 11 in 2018 the figure shows that rfr based swc had a strong correlation r 2 0 85 rmse 0 0089 m3 m3 with the measured swc panigrahi and panda 2003 also reported that the correlation of the swb based swc and measured swc in situ was strong these results indicate that the accuracy of rfr based k c prediction for maize swc in the root zone was acceptable filgueiras et al 2020 also suggested that the rfr method can estimate maize swc of effective rooting depth well with the rmse approximately equal to 0 0070 based on modis based vis the aforementioned results demonstrate the potential of the rfr based maize k c prediction based on uav multisensors for cet and swc in determining crop water use and irrigation requirements and scheduling at a field scale and reinforcing the ability of the regression method to model the cet and swc variables 3 6 limitations and future works the study established the maize k c estimation models based on the uav multisensor remote sensing using ml methods the proposed method can rapidly obtain maize k c values and generate high resolution k c spatial distribution maps however the uav based method is often limited by cloudy conditions especially for vis based model the effects of flight height on the maize k c estimation model should be further investigated in the future this is important for the practical application of the uav based k c model the multispectral vis used in the study were calculated using five blue green red near infrared and red edge bands hyperspectral bands should be introduced to the k c model in the future the study used two years of data to train and test the maize k c model in the future the suitability of the k c estimation model should be further evaluated for different maize varieties under various field conditions 4 conclusions the lr pr and er methods had relatively low accuracy for estimating maize k c based on ms based vis at a field scale and the rfr method was recommended for maize k c prediction over the svr and dnn methods the accuracy of the k c rfr estimation based on ms based vis and texture information was similar to that of the k c rfr prediction based on the combination of ms rgb ms tir or ms rgb tir sensors therefore k c prediction using the rfr method did not benefit from more types of data ms based vis gndvi savi and mcari thermal indices t cratio and dact and texture information nir me had high contributions to the k c rfr estimation model ms based vis with nir and red green and red and red edge red and green bands should be included in machine learning models for daily k c estimation otherwise significant errors may occur the k c rfr prediction model was adapted to estimate and distinguish maize k c under different irrigation levels and showed feasibility in estimating cumulative et under different growth stages and swc in the root zone at a field scale therefore the k c rfr model can provide information for crop water use and irrigated agriculture management and the farmer can be guided in irrigation decision making further research should evaluate the suitability of the k c rfr estimation model for different varieties of maize under other regions and field irrigation management practices funding this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of

9158,in the upcoming irrigation management in agricultural production accurate mapping of crop water consumption with a high spatial and temporal resolution at a farm scale is needed in this study we developed models for crop coefficients k c estimation using unmanned aerial vehicle uav remote sensing and machine learning ml techniques for irrigated maize in a semi arid region in northwest china k c values were calculated using a procedure given in fao56 manual using field measurements multispectral vegetation indices vis vegetation fraction vf thermal based vis and texture information ti were derived from uav based multispectral rgb and thermal infrared imagery respectively these remotely sensed variables and their combinations were used to develop prediction models using six ml algorithms linear regression lr polynomial regression pr exponential regression er random forest regression rfr support vector regression svr and deep neural network dnn among these models the rfr with the highest accuracy r 2 0 69 rmse 0 1019 was recommended to estimate maize k c the multispectral and thermal based vis and texture of the near infrared band had greater contributions than rgb based vf

stage during different growth stages and daily soil water content r 2 0 85 rmse 0 0089 m3 m3 in the root zone these results show that the integration of uav remote sensing and ml provides a promising tool to help farmers make decisions using timely mapped crop water consumption especially under water shortages or drought conditions keywords crop water requirement fao56 evapotranspiration uav crop coefficient random forest regression data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction crop evapotranspiration et plays an important role in efficient irrigation management et is closely related to meteorological drivers soil factors and crop growth conditions crop et can be directly measured by a lysimeter lópez urrea et al 2020 the eddy covariance method jiang et al 2021 or the bowen ratio energy balance zhang et al 2008 however these forms of et measurements are expensive and difficult to apply to a field scale due to the differences in spatial scale traditionally et can be calculated using the widely accepted fao56 method which is based on reference evapotranspiration et0 and a crop coefficient k c allen et al 1998 et0 represents the meteorological evaporative demand and is calculated using local weather data the k c in the fao56 method represents the physical and physiological differences between a specific crop and the reference crop e g grass or alfalfa according to the fao56 method k c eq 1 is defined as follows 1 k c k s k cb k e where k cb is the basal crop coefficient representing the ratio of crop transpiration to et0 under full irrigation conditions k e is the soil evaporation coefficient representing the ratio of soil evaporation to et0 k s is the soil water stress coefficient representing the influence of the soil water stress factor on crop transpiration and k s is equal to 1 when representing no water stress and is less than 1 when representing water stress conditions the accurate and rapid acquisition of k c is significant to estimate et especially for understanding crop water consumption in a semiarid region of northwest china chen et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 the fao56 method has been employed to estimate et for many crops such as cotton cholpankulov et al 2008 soybean luis et al 2017 sunflower miao et al 2016 tomato zheng et al 2013 and wheat sánchez et al 2015 and the method also estimates maize et well in different regions of china ding et al 2013 zhao et al 2013 the daily k c value is obtained by a smooth continuous k c curve function in time units jensen and allen 2016 however the parameters of the fao56 method are complex and require a large amount of observational data limitations such as the time required and the lack of monitoring crop growth and crop water use patterns affected by climate soil cultivation management etc jiang et al 2014 qiu et al 2015 hinder the application of the fao56 method in precision irrigation practices additionally differences in water consumption exist at a spatial scale due to nonuniform irrigation soil characteristics fertilization or pests therefore the acquisition of the spatial distribution of kc is important to irrigation management at a field scale k c values can be obtained remotely either on the ground plant scale in the air field scale or by satellite from local to national continental and global scales pôças et al 2020 vegetation indices vis calculated by different spectral bands of remote sensing imagery to rapidly and nondestructively assess crop growth statuses liang et al 2020 qiao et al 2019 seo et al 2019 xie et al 2015 are used to estimate k c hunsaker et al 2003 used ground based vis to predict k cb at a field scale some researchers estimated k c using satellite based vis at a regional scale gontia and tiwari 2010 maselli et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 unmanned aerial vehicle uav based vis have been suitable approaches to monitor crop growth at a field scale in recent years due to the features of uav remote sensing such as its short operating cycle high resolution and low cost rango et al 2009 previous studies also investigated a few k c estimation models based on uav based vis han et al 2018 estimated maize k c using six types of uav based vis under different irrigation conditions but did not investigate the maize k c prediction model for the whole growth season zhang et al 2019c established maize k c using uav based vi soil water content swc and leaf area index lai during the whole growth season nevertheless maize k c prediction needs to be tested using longer time series of data shao et al 2021 estimated maize k c using uav based vis and ground based lai under different irrigation conditions the above maize k c estimation models included ground based parameters i e lai and swc and it is relatively difficult to directly generate the spatial distribution of k c values therefore it is imperative to estimate the maize k c values at a field scale using only remote sensing data vis from multispectral optical sensors remain asymptotically saturated among dense and heterogeneous canopies rischbeck et al 2016 which affects the application of vis in monitoring crop status during high vegetation coverage stages structural thermal and textural features extracted from uav based multisensors e g multispectral rgb and thermal infrared cameras have also been employed for predicting various plant traits in previous studies canopy structure information such as canopy coverage or vegetation fraction has been used for the basal crop coefficient k cb pereira et al 2020b and lai nielsen et al 2012 canopy thermal features such as thermal based crop water stress indices were used for estimating crop coefficients kullberg et al 2017 as well as monitoring crop status han et al 2016 and yield guo et al 2016 canopy texture features representing the spatial variation of pixel intensities within an image emphasize the plant canopy structural and geometric features and have been used for estimating crop biomass niu et al 2019 zheng et al 2018 lai li et al 2018 and chlorophyll content lu et al 2018 few studies have directly estimated maize k c using texture features under different irrigation conditions previous studies maimaitijiang et al 2017 2020 have reported that the combination of canopy spectral thermal structure and texture information extracted from multiple sensors has the potential to improve the accuracy of crop trait estimations over using features from a single sensor therefore the features extracted from uav multispectral rgb

random forest regression rfr to predict maize k c based on lai and six types of multispectral vis they found that rfr models gave more accurate k c estimates than mlr models support vector regression svr models dou and yang 2018 tang et al 2018 have been proposed for actual et estimations with meteorological soil and crop variables because they provide easy solutions for nonlinear functions deep neural networks dnns perform well in many cases such as image recognition classification and regression tasks due to their capability of learning complex relations between input and output variables using multiple hidden layers chen et al 2020 2019 kaba et al 2018 there have been several studies predicting maize k c at a field scale based on multispectral vis swc and lai using machine learning methods however few studies have reported remote sensing methods based on uav based multispectral rgb and thermal infrared information using novel models such as svm dnn and rfr in addition the contributions of inputs from uav based multisensors to the maize k c estimation model have still not been fully investigated therefore the specific objectives of this study were to i investigate the

information extraction the canopy spectral structure texture and thermal information used in this study table 4 were computed at small plots to identify relationships with the corresponding maize k c values shao et al 2021 used ms based vis ndvi savi evi tcari gndvi and vari to estimate maize k c four types of vis sr ndre ndrei and mcari were added to the study the choice of these indices was based on their characteristics sr with a large range of values presents sensitivity and provides complementary information when the crop is in its high vegetation fraction growth stage filgueiras et al 2020 ndre ndrei and mcari contain different combinations of red edge nir red and green bands additionally vegetation fraction vf the percentage of vegetation area per ground surface area was used as crop density information to estimate maize kc the maize canopy area was extracted from rgb imagery using the ostu method classified maize pixels divided the total number of pixels in the plot to

dnn and svr methods fig 3 the vegetation fraction was extracted from uav based rgb imagery canopy spectral vis were calculated from uav based ms imagery texture information was obtained from uav based rgb red green and blue bands ms red edge and nir bands and tir thermal infrared band imagery the preprocessing methods for uav imagery can be found in shao et al 2021 k c estimation models using lr pr and er methods based on uav ms based vis were established to validate the methods reported in previous studies for predicting maize k c at a field scale the k c prediction models using rfr dnn and svr methods based on ms rgb tir and the combinations of these sensors were established to select an optimal method to estimate the maize k c at a field scale and to generate a high resolution k c map the applicability of the optimal k c estimation model was evaluated under different irrigation treatments the uav based k c estimation model was applied to obtain daily swc in the root zone using the daily soil water balance method compared with swb based swc additionally the uav based k c prediction model was also used for calculating cumulative evapotranspiration cet using machine learning methods compared with fao56 and swb based cet under different rapid middle and late growth stages 2 4 5 machine learning models for estimating k c and model evaluation the dnn model has multiple hidden layers to learn more complex nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs the rectified linear unit relu activation function is employed by the neurons in each hidden layer due to its better performance compared with other activation functions ghimire et al 2019 the number of hidden layers in dnn in this study was two the kernel based svr model is a supervised soft computing algorithm that simultaneously minimizes estimation errors and model complexity chen et al 2013 the radial basis function was used as a kernel function in the study due to its good prediction accuracy and model stability in agricultural applications fan et al 2018 the key parameters of the rfr dnn and svr models were confirmed by the trial and error approach and were optimized using the grid search method al fugara et al 2020 fan et al 2021 the tree number n estimators and the maximum depth of trees max depth in the rfr algorithm were optimized ranging from 50 to 500 at 50 intervals and from 5 to 15 at 1 interval the number of neurons in the two hidden layers units1 and units2 iteration epochs and learning rate learning rate in dnn models were optimized with values ranging from 10 to 100 at 10 intervals from 50 to 500 at 50 intervals and from 0 01 to 0 1 at 0 01 intervals respectively the penalty parameter cost and kernel parameter gamma in the svr algorithm were also optimized ranging from 0 1 to 1 5 at 0 1 intervals for both parameters additional parameters were left at the default values in the python scikit learn package https scikit learn org the optimized parameters of the rfr dnn and svr models based on the eight combinations table 5 as inputs are shown in table 6 for k c estimation models 80 475 samples of all samples selected randomly were used as the training set and the remaining samples 119 samples were used as the validation set to ensure the reliability of the model accuracy five fold cross validation method stone 1974 was used to evaluate the k c models including coefficient of determination r 2 and root mean square error rmse high values of r 2 closer to 1 and low values of rmse demonstrate good accuracy for k c estimation models 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation of canopy temperature derived from thermal infrared imagery the correlation of canopy temperatures measured by the uav thermal infrared camera and hand held thermal imager was high r 2 0 98 rmse 1 52 fig 4 which indicates that the accuracy of canopy temperature measured by the uav thermal infrared camera was acceptable consistently maimaitijiang et al 2020 also reported similar results r 2 0 985 rmse 1 34 the corresponding temperatures in the uav thermal imagery can be further converted to surface temperatures through a linear model fig 4 before measuring the surface temperatures of ground targets the bias of temperature for the hand held thermal imager was measured compared with the blackbody calibration source 3 2 k c prediction models using lr pr and er methods the accuracies of vi based k c models using lr pr and er methods were low table 7 with r 2 values ranging from 0 01 0 20 these results are lower than those r 2 0 63 0 95 of vi based k c models presented in previous studies alam et al 2018 baburao et al 2013 er raki et al 2013 gontia and tiwari 2010 rozenstein et al 2019 the aforementioned results indicate that vis based k c prediction models using lr pr and er algorithms were not suitable for our field maize these differences are probably due to the differences between crop varieties spatial scale climate and field management the results of the older vi based k c prediction models against those in our field measurements demonstrate the limitation of the models established by previous researchers and the new proposed models in the study should be further tested in various environments and varieties 3 3 performance of rfr svr and dnn models for k c estimation compared with the accuracies of maize k c estimation models using lr pr and er methods table 7 the accuracies of the rfr svr and dnn based k c prediction models table 8 were higher the results indicate that the algorithms which could learn complex nonlinear relationships between inputs and output were useful for improving the accuracy of maize k c prediction the accuracy of the rfr based k c estimation model r 2 0 57 0 69 rmse 0 1033 0 1208 was better than that of the svr r 2 0 33 0 59 rmse 0 1153 0 1506 and the dnn based r 2 0 17 0 47 rmse 0 1333 0 1699 models obviously the rfr model was more suitable for daily maize k c estimation due to its advantage in modeling complex nonlinear relationships between k c and its driving variables the rfr model containing all variables combination id 8 ms rgb and tir did not always improve the accuracy of k c prediction when compared with combination id 5 ms rgb thermal features provided redundant spectral information for predicting maize k c which indicates that the rfr models were not more useful when more complex relations between the multivariate inputs and output existed the accuracies table 8 of k c estimation model using the ms combination of ms and rgb ms and tir and ms rgb and tir were similar r 2 0 68 0 69 0 68 or 0 69 it indicates that the ms was a suitable and economic approach to directly predict maize k c at a field scale and rgb and tir were not very effective in improving the accuracy of the maize k c prediction model using the rfr method therefore the features obtained from the ms should be included in machine learning models for maize k c estimation previous researchers found that the relationship between the basal crop coefficient k cb and vis was high campos et al 2017 odi lara et al 2016 consistently crop water stress coefficient k s can be calculated based on the temperature based crop water stress index cwsi extracted from uav based infrared thermal imagery pereira et al 2020b zhang et al 2019b zhou et al 2021 e g k s 1 cwsi and the cwsi can also be estimated by uav based vis zhang et al 2021 the k c include k cb k s and k e factors therefore the variables related to soil evaporation may have potential to improve the accuracy of the maize kc estimation model besides some rfr based kc estimation values deviated greatly from 1 1 line under the tr3 condition during the rapid growth stage fig 5 the reason may be that the fraction of exposed soil was higher during the rapid growth stage and deficit irrigation treatments resulted in large fluctuation of k e microwave remote sensing allows for the measurement of water content at the soil surface dari et al 2021 zhang et al 2019a and may be a potential approach to improve the accuracy of k c estimation in summary a high resolution spatial distribution centimeter pixel of maize k c fig 6 could be obtained at a field scale using the rfr method based on the combination of uav rgb ms and tir information the rfr based k c map can provide support for obtaining the spatial variability of water use and prescription maps of variable rate irrigation for maize at a field scale it was necessary to select high contribution variables using the rfr method to obtain a better explanatory power for the k c prediction model the chosen high contribution parameters table 9 for the k c rfr estimation model were multispectral vis gndvi savi and mcari thermal indices tcratio and dact and textural information nir me among which the gndvi was the primary variable these results demonstrate that uav vis with nir and red green and red and red edge red and green bands were strongly related to the k c estimation rozenstein et al 2019 reported that vis based on combination of red edge and red bands also performed well for cotton k c estimation by introducing ms based texture information and thermal index the accuracy of maize k c prediction can be improved r 2 0 69 rmse 0 1019 compared with the ms based vis and the result is better than that r 2 0 65 rmse 0 1373 of maize k c estimation based on the ground based lai and ms based vis reported by shao et al 2021 canopy structure information can partly overcome asymptotic saturation problems concerning spectral features wallace 2013 the canopy coverage vf from the rgb imagery has little contribution to the maize k c rfr prediction model based on the combination of ms and rgb or a combination of ms tir and rgb table 9 the reason may be that the training data for the model were mainly concentrated in the high canopy coverage growth stage and the value of vf had a relatively small range during the growth stage 3 4 maize k c prediction using the rfr method for different water treatments the maize k c estimation model was applied to tr1 and tr8 to evaluate the adaptability of the model under different irrigation treatments the k c rfr model exhibited a high prediction accuracy under tr1 and tr8 with an r 2 of 0 74 and an rmse of 0 072 fig 7 violin plots of the fao56 and rfr based k c under tr1 and tr8 are shown in fig 8 to further explore the difference in the distribution of estimated and observed maize k c values the results show that the differences between the fao56 and rfr based k c were not significant for tr1 or tr8 based on anova with the hsd tukey test however significant differences were shown for the fao56 and rfr based kc between tr1 and tr8 shao et al 2021 also reported the same results for maize k c estimation using the rfr method based on uav vis and ground based lai besides a higher frequency of small absolute errors 0 0 05 and a lower frequency of high absolute errors 0 1 0 25 were obtained fig 9 by the k c rfr model compared with the k c fao56 model under tr1 and tr8 all these results confirm that the maize k c rfr prediction model established in the study is an advanced method and adaptable to distinguish maize k c differences among different irrigation levels at a field scale 3 5 rfr based k c estimation model for calculating cumulative et and swb based swc in the root zone the interpolation method was used to complete the daily et when the remote sensing data lacked days to further evaluate the performance of the rfr based k c prediction model established in the study rfr and fao56 based k c for calculating the cumulative et cetrfr and cetfao56 was compared with swb based cumulative et cetswb as shown in fig 10 this figure shows that cetfao56 and cetrfr during different growth stages were strongly related to cetswb with r 2 values of 0 89 and 0 89 respectively the results indicate that the accuracy of fao56 and rfr based maize k c prediction was high cetfao56 and cetrfr slightly underestimated cetswb during the middle growth stage fig 10 however the results were still not poor with rmse values in the range of 15 0 15 3 mm stage 4 8 of the total water consumption shao et al 2021 also reported a similar result for estimating cet using the k c rfr model based on uav vis and lai these results demonstrate that the accuracy of the rfr based k c prediction model based on uav multisensor ms rgb and tir or ms for estimating cetrfr is acceptable during different growth stages in the future the use of a lysimeter or eddy covariance technology will be helpful to improve the confidence of the result of the maize k c rfr estimation model for estimating cet rfr based k c for computing swc values based on the daily et and d r using the daily swb method eq 13 in the root zone were compared to the measured swc values fig 11 in 2018 the figure shows that rfr based swc had a strong correlation r 2 0 85 rmse 0 0089 m3 m3 with the measured swc panigrahi and panda 2003 also reported that the correlation of the swb based swc and measured swc in situ was strong these results indicate that the accuracy of rfr based k c prediction for maize swc in the root zone was acceptable filgueiras et al 2020 also suggested that the rfr method can estimate maize swc of effective rooting depth well with the rmse approximately equal to 0 0070 based on modis based vis the aforementioned results demonstrate the potential of the rfr based maize k c prediction based on uav multisensors for cet and swc in determining crop water use and irrigation requirements and scheduling at a field scale and reinforcing the ability of the regression method to model the cet and swc variables 3 6 limitations and future works the study established the maize k c estimation models based on the uav multisensor remote sensing using ml methods the proposed method can rapidly obtain maize k c values and generate high resolution k c spatial distribution maps however the uav based method is often limited by cloudy conditions especially for vis based model the effects of flight height on the maize k c estimation model should be further investigated in the future this is important for the practical application of the uav based k c model the multispectral vis used in the study were calculated using five blue green red near infrared and red edge bands hyperspectral bands should be introduced to the k c model in the future the study used two years of data to train and test the maize k c model in the future the suitability of the k c estimation model should be further evaluated for different maize varieties under various field conditions 4 conclusions the lr pr and er methods had relatively low accuracy for estimating maize k c based on ms based vis at a field scale and the rfr method was recommended for maize k c prediction over the svr and dnn methods the accuracy of the k c rfr estimation based on ms based vis and texture information was similar to that of the k c rfr prediction based on the combination of ms rgb ms tir or ms rgb tir sensors therefore k c prediction using the rfr method did not benefit from more types of data ms based vis gndvi savi and mcari thermal indices t cratio and dact and texture information nir me had high contributions to the k c rfr estimation model ms based vis with nir and red green and red and red edge red and green bands should be included in machine learning models for daily k c estimation otherwise significant errors may occur the k c rfr prediction model was adapted to estimate and distinguish maize k c under different irrigation levels and showed feasibility in estimating cumulative et under different growth stages and swc in the root zone at a field scale therefore the k c rfr model can provide information for crop water use and irrigated agriculture management and the farmer can be guided in irrigation decision making further research should evaluate the suitability of the k c rfr estimation model for different varieties of maize under other regions and field irrigation management practices funding this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of

9159,agricultural intensification has increased crop productivity but simplified production and reduced cropping system diversity in recent decades the intensified wheat maize rotation in the north china plain has sharply decreased the groundwater table with associated environmental and biodiversity issues understanding whether increasing cropping system diversity stabilizes productivity improves resilience and reduces adverse environmental impacts is critical this study quantified the water requirements of nine staple crops from 1960 to 2020 established 15 alternative crop rotations and evaluated the resilience of each rotation in the cangzhou area a typical groundwater deletion funnel area the results showed that reducing cropping density harvests per year from 2 to 1 5 decreased the average annual water requirement and irrigation demand by 14 and 33 respectively summer soybean alternated with maize and rotated with wheat did not reduce groundwater use but increased profitability and protein production spring mung bean summer millet based multi rotations had higher precipitation coupling degrees 8 in wet years 17 in normal years and 56 in dry years and profitability 1 1 2 4 times than the wheat maize rotation the spring potato summer millet rotation in one year had the greatest profitability the highest equivalent yield to wheat and the highest water use efficiency wue while spring maize rotated with winter wheat summer soybean performed best for protein content energy output and wues this study identified 11 alternative rotations with a higher comprehensive evaluation index than the conventional wheat maize rotation based on entropy topsis considering 12 indicators spring mungbean is not suitable for inclusion in the crop rotation when solely cultivated in one year due to mismatched rainfall beyond wheat and maize soybean millet and potato are promising crops for innovative multi year multi crop rotations to enhance crop

crop diversifications to the conventional w m rotation and 3 evaluate the synergies and tradeoffs of established crop rotations across multiple dimensions including food production economic and environmental effects the study provides essential information for using crop rotations as an effective means to enhance the sustainability of food production across multiple outcomes and minimize tradeoffs fig 1 extending this solution to other water stressed agricultural regions could be an effective strategy for achieving sustainable food production systems globally 2 materials and methods 2 1 research area the water requirements of diversified crop rotations were evaluated at the cangzhou meteorological station 38 20 n 116 29 e altitude 9 6 m in the heilonggang watershed located in the southeast of hebei province in the ncp fig 2a the site has a warm temperate zone semi humid monsoon climate the annual average precipitation is 573 9 mm with sharp yearly fluctuations and uneven seasonal distribution fig 2b about 79 of the yearly precipitation occurs from june to september fig 2c the annual mean air temperature is 13 1 fig 2c with a frost free period of about 200 days the w m double cropping system dominates in this area accounting for 83 of the total cultivated area fig s1 cangzhou bureau of statistics 2020 groundwater table decline has reached 1 5 m year 1 in this area yang et al 2021a 2 2 data source daily meteorological data 1960 2020 including maximum minimum and average temperatures relative average humidity wind speed at 10 m height sunshine hours at 2 m height

coefficient soil bulk density and saturated moisture content were obtained from national soil survey database nine main crops winter wheat summer maize spring potato spring cotton summer oil sunflower spring maize spring mung bean summer soybean summer millet were involved in the analysis and diversified crop rotation design crop characteristics including sowing date harvest date planting area and sowing density were collected from field experiment data literature survey results project reports and statistical yearbooks the local crop sowing and harvest date information is detailed in supplementary material table s1 crop yields from 2008 to 2020 were collected from the hebei province bureau of statistics 2021 soil parameters are listed in table s2 2 3 classification according to precipitation type year precipitation in each year was distinguished as wet normal or dry according to eq 1 yang et al 2022a to identify the water requirement characteristics for each crop in different years wet year p i p 0 33 δ 1 normal year p 0 33 δ p i p 0 33 δ dry year p i p 0 33 δ where p i is the i th year s rainfall mm p is the average year s precipitation from 1960 to 2020 mm and

for wet years 575 8 34 8 mm for normal years and 404 7 85 9 mm for dry years table s3 2 4 crop water requirement calculations the simetaw simulation evapotranspiration of applied water model snyder et al 2004 2005 2012 was used to simulate and quantify the crop water requirement et c effective rainfall e r and irrigation water requirement et aw of nine main crops at cangzhou station this model has been applied widely to calculate the water requirements of maize wheat cotton and soybean in the ncp kong et al 2009 yang et al 2011 2012 2013 2021b c huang et al 2012 hu et al 2017 jia et al 2019 the model calculates the reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 yang et al 2021b then multiplies the daily et 0 time series using a crop coefficient k c specific for each crop to obtain the desired daily et c time series the k c values of each crop were adopted from the fao 56 recommendations allen et al 1998 the parameters of each crop and soil were adjusted according to the actual situation therefore et c was calculated as follows 2 e t c e t 0 k c the simetaw model also simulated daily rainfall soil water holding characteristics and effective rooting depths further et c was used to determine effective rainfall e r and to generate hypothetical irrigation schedules for estimating seasonal and annual et aw in which et aw represents the net amount of irrigation water required to add to the crop in the growing season snyder et al 2005 as follows 3 et aw et c e r where et aw is crop irrigation water requirement during the growing season mm et c is crop evapotranspiration during the growing season mm and e r is the effective rainfall during the growing season mm when et c e r 0 et aw 0 2 5 diversified crop rotation establishment the rotat model dogliotti 2003 castellazzi et al 2008 was used to design potential diversified crop rotations for the research area using agronomic criteria the program combines crops from a predefined list to generate all possible rotations the criteria and rules of rotation design included species and groups of crops frequency of crops and groups sequence or succession duration to complete a cycle number of different crops and crop growth period crop groups relate to the same plant family or similar cultivation practices e g root crops the rotat model can generate a set of crop sequences evaluate the agronomic feasibility of the sequences based on rules evaluate the performance of the generated rotations and validate the rotations for various indicators the full factorial number of possible combinations of crops is limited by the number of filters controlled by the user these filters were designed to eliminate crop successions that are agronomically unfeasible and for farm specific reasons not practical or desirable the filters represent expert knowledge quantitatively and explicitly the generated combination and sequence of crop species determine characteristics of farming systems such as crop yields soil erosion occurrence of soil borne pests diseases and weeds and nitrogen and labor dynamics dogliotti et al 2003 fifteen cropping systems were selected from the crop sequence list generated from the nine diverse crops mentioned above see table s4 based on local climate water resources soil conditions and crop characteristics e g crop water demand characteristics crop growth and development traits agronomic standards crop attributes inter crop interactions planting frequency and crop rotation cycle the final crop rotation database contained four double cropping systems with the conventional w m rotation and 11 multi crop rotations all with 3 harvests in 2 years with the first year starting from a single spring or summer crop we maximized the rotation cycle to two years because the local farmers prefer short rotation cycles due to their usual practices and perceptions summer soybean alternated with summer maize and rotated with winter wheat and spring mungbean summer millet based crop rotations were designed to increase protein production as did relative to w m based rotations fig 3 shows the time sequence for each crop in each crop rotation 2 6 indicator calculations for crop rotations 2 6 1 1 cropping index we defined cropping index ci as the crop harvest number per year within a cropping system cycle calculated as follows 4 ci cropharvests rotationyears where crop harvests is the number of crop harvests within a complete crop rotation cycle and rotation years is the number of years in that cropping system cycle for example the ci of the spring maize winter wheat summer maize rotation is 3 2 3 crop harvests 2 rotation years the 15 targeted cropping systems in this study included four double cropping ci 2 and 11 multi crop rotations ci 1 5 we defined one year as the analytical unit for the diverse indicators below 2 6 2 annual water requirement 5 e t i 1 n e t c i j 1 n e j 6 e j o k c e t 0 where et is

this crop rotation is equal to the value of et when the ci is 1 5 the annual evapotranspiration of this crop rotation is equal to the value of et divided by 2 as the number of rotation cycle years 2 6 3 precipitation coupling degree we defined the precipitation coupling degree pcd λ as the water availability ratio between crop water requirement and natural precipitation during a particular growth stage or whole growing season of a specific crop rotation with values ranging from 0 to 1 growth stage values were 7 λ i 1 p i e t c i p i e t c i p i e t c i where λ i is the index value in the i th growth stage of a crop rotation p i is the total amount of natural precipitation in the i th stage mm and et ci is the water requirement for crop growth in the i th stage mm the index value for the whole crop rotation is the ratio between the total natural precipitation and et c over the entire growing season for a specific rotation 2 6 4 equivalent yield economic benefit energy and protein content a realistic consideration of yield accounts for differences in economic values between crop species the economic benefit of each crop is expressed as within year yield multiplied by the corresponding product price in inflation adjusted yuan minus costs to eliminate inflation or deflation as a source of variability between the different cases in different years we used the china national consumer price index cpi to adjust crop prices and economic benefit for all database years once adjusted the economic benefit values became less dependent on year to year fluctuations in input prices and yields since the yield data in this study started in 2008 we adopted the 2008 cpi as the baseline so all economic benefit values are expressed in 2008 yuan all cpi values from 2008 to 2020 were sourced from the china statistical yearbook national bureau of statistics of china 2021 crop prices were sourced from the china yearbook of agricultural price survey the yields of different crop species are comparable based on the principle of economic value the equivalent yield of each crop is recalculated as eq 9 with winter wheat as the baseline meanwhile the energy and protein content of each crop and each rotation were calculated using eq 10 and eq 11 respectively 8 eb i yield i price i cpi i cpi 2008 9 e y i yield i price i wheatprice i 10 e i y i e l d i α i 11 p c i y i

statistical analysis the yearly mean data of the diversified crops or crop rotations were statistically analyzed using multi way analysis of variance anova differences between rotation mean values were compared using duncan s multiple range test at a 95 probability level entropy topsis technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution is a multi objective decision analysis method for identifying a solution from a feasible solution set by defining the positive and negative ideal solutions of the problem and selecting the ideal solution that is the most positive and furthest from the negative ideal solution wang et al 2019 chen et al 2020 liu et al 2021a in order to overcome the influence of subjective factors caused by the delphi method or analytic hierarchy process when determining the weight of the evaluation index of the traditional topsis method the entropy weight method was selected for objective evaluation to determine the index weight avoiding a certain degree of subjectivity bias delgado and romero 2016 chen et al 2020 we used the entropy weight method to obtain the weight of each indicator and then calculated the comprehensive evaluation

requirements of diversified crop rotations during the growing season from 1960 to 2020 the average growing season et c of each crop rotation did not significantly differ between precipitation type years the conventional w m rotation had the highest growing season et c in wet 820 mm normal and dry 834 mm years with similar values for the winter wheat summer soybean rotation fig 5a c summer soybean spring mungbean summer millet had the smallest growing season et c averaging 520 mm across all precipitation type years or 37 lower than the w m rotation compared to the conventional w m rotation spring mung bean or spring potato rotated with summer millet ci 2 decreased growing season et c by 17 and 9 respectively winter wheat based multi crop rotations 3 harvests in 2 years decreased growing season et c averaged 605 mm in all precipitation type years by 23 29 spring mung bean summer millet based multi crop rotations rotated with summer oil sunflower spring maize or summer soybean in the first year decreased growing season et c averaged 540 mm in all precipitation type years by 31 37 the spring cotton spring mung bean summer millet rotation had a growing season et c of 631 mm similar to the spring maize winter wheat summer soybean rotation or 24 lower than the w m rotation the et aw of each crop rotation under different precipitation type years was ranked dry year normal year wet year the winter wheat summer soybean rotation ci 2 had the highest average et aw in wet 456 mm normal 511 mm and dry years 564 mm but did not significantly differ from the conventional w m rotation 404 mm in wet 466 mm in normal and 534 mm in dry years fig 5d f the summer oil sunflower spring mung bean summer millet rotation ci 1 5 had the lowest average et aw in wet 240 mm normal 237 mm and dry years 265 mm compared to the w m rotation winter wheat based multi crop rotations ci 1 5 decreased the average annual et aw by 21 wet 29 normal and 33 dry similarly the spring mung bean summer millet rotation ci 2 decreased the average annual et aw by 11 wet 18 normal and 15 dry spring mung bean summer millet based rotations ci 1 5 also decreased the average annual et aw by 34 wet 42 normal and 45 dry all these results suggest that decreasing the ci significantly decreased the annual irrigation amounts especially in normal and dry years 2 3 annual evapotranspiration of diversified crop rotations from 1960 to 2020 the annual et of each crop rotation included et c during the crop growing period and et in the fallow period the average annual water consumption of each crop rotation did not significantly differ between precipitation type years the conventional w m rotation had the highest average annual et in the past 60 years in wet 824 mm normal 841 mm and dry 840 mm years fig 6a c summer soybean spring mung bean summer millet had the lowest annual et averaging 656 mm across all precipitation type years the average annual et of winter wheat summer soybean and spring potato summer millet rotations ci 2 did not significantly differ from the w m rotation in different precipitation type years this revealed that the double cropping systems in one year ci 2 had no water use advantage compared to the w m rotation the average annual et of seven winter wheat based multi crop rotations ci 1 5 was decreased by 13 18 range 685 729 mm while the spring mungbean summer millet based multi crop rotations ci 1 5 decreased annual et by 13 21 thus decreasing ci is beneficial for decreasing annual et 2 4 precipitation coupling degree of diversified crop rotations in different precipitation type years from 1960 to 2020 the precipitation coupling degree of all diversified crop rotations was ranked wet year normal year dry year fig 7 in the wet years the precipitation coupling degree of 15 crop rotations ranged from 0 69 to 0 91 average 0 83 with 87 exceeding 0 80 fig 7a spring mungbean summer millet based rotations had the highest precipitation coupling degrees all 0 85 the four double cropping rotations performed well in the wet year with precipitation coupling degrees of 0 80 0 91 the spring mung bean winter wheat summer maize or summer soybean rotations had a low precipitation coupling degree of 0 69 because the spring mungbean rotated in the first year had the shortest growing period april june which mismatched the rainfall season in the normal year fig 7b the precipitation coupling degree of 15 crop rotations declined range 0 57 0 81 average 0 72 the two winter wheat based double crop rotations decreased distinctly only 0 68 the five winter wheat based multi crop rotations 3 harvests in 2 years excluding spring mungbean as the first year crop had an average value of 0 76 spring mungbean summer millet based multi rotations had relatively high precipitation coupling degrees ranging from 0 76 to 0 81 in the dry year fig 7c the precipitation coupling degree of 15 crop rotations decreased even more than the normal and wet years range 0 46 0 77 average 0 61 the two winter wheat summer crop maize or soybean rotations decreased significantly to a very low 0 48 the precipitation coupling degree of the seven winter wheat based multi crop rotations ci 1 5 averaged 0 62 spring mungbean summer millet based multiple crop rotations had comparatively higher values ranging from 0 71 to 0 77 in short different crop rotations had different resilience and adaptation to different precipitation type years winter wheat based double cropping systems were disadvantaged in normal and dry years with only 20 30 of the yearly precipitation in the wheat growing season spring mung bean winter wheat summer maize or summer soybean had the lowest precipitation coupling degrees in wet 0 69 normal 0 57 and dry years 0 46 indicating that spring mungbean is not suitable for individual rotations in the first year due to its short growing period april june and mismatched rainfall season 2 5 multiple functions of diversified crop rotations from 2008 to 2020 the average annual economic benefit of the conventional w m rotation from 2018 to 2020 was 12 944 yuan ha 1 fig 8a the spring potato summer millet double cropping system had the highest economic benefit 4 2 times higher than the w m rotation due to potato s high yield and price the two other double cropping systems spring mungbean summer millet and winter wheat summer soybean had higher economic outputs than the w m rotation by 1 9 and 1 2 times respectively similarly spring mung bean summer millet based multi rotations with three harvests in two years rotated spring maize summer oil sunflower or summer soybean in the first year had 1 3 2 4 times higher economic output than the w m rotation winter wheat summer soybean based multi rotations with three harvests in two years rotated spring maize spring mung bean summer oil sunflower in the first year had 1 01 1 7 times higher economic outputs than the w m rotation in contrast w m based rotations 3 harvests in 2 years decreased the economic benefit by 8 25 relative to the w m rotation the average annual equivalent yield of the conventional w m rotation from 2018 to 2020 was 9646 kg ha 1 similar to the winter wheat summer soybean rotation but 10 27 higher than nine of the 15 potential crop rotations fig 8b the spring potato summer millet rotation had the highest equivalent yield 2 7 times higher than the w m rotation the spring mungbean summer millet rotation had an equivalent yield 1 2 times higher than the w m rotation the spring maize based multi rotations ci 3 2 rotated with spring mungbean summer millet or winter wheat summer soybean in the second year had 1 7 and 1 5 times higher equivalent yields than the w m rotation respectively the average annual protein content of the conventional w m rotation was 1285 kg ha 1 12 66 higher than eleven of the 15 potential cropping systems fig 8c the winter wheat summer soybean rotation had 1 3 times higher protein content than the w m rotation the spring maize winter wheat summer soybean rotation had the highest protein yield 1 7 times higher than the w m rotation the spring maize spring mungbean summer millet rotation also increased protein yield by 10 compared to the conventional w m rotation the average annual energy of the conventional w m rotation was 172 103 mj ha 1 similar to the spring maize spring mungbean summer millet rotation 169 103 mj ha 1 fig 8d the spring maize winter wheat summer soybean and spring potato summer millet rotations had 26 and 15 higher average annual energy than the w m rotation respectively eleven of the 15 potential rotations had 24 71 lower average annual energy than the w m rotation the generalized wues ewue ywue pwue and enwue equated to economic benefit equivalent yield protein content or energy divided by annual et see supplementary material fig s2 the order of the 15 crop rotations changed for each wue indicator depending on the annual et suggesting that the efficiency per cubic meter of water differed for each crop rotation the average ranking of the four wues for the conventional w m rotation among the 15 rotations decreased by 7 27 fig s2 compared to the four indicators shown in fig 8 2 6 comprehensive assessment of diversified crop rotations based on heatmap and entropy topsis the heatmap and entropy topsis analysis identified the optimal crop rotation for synergy of groundwater use reduction food production economic benefit ghgs and dietary nutrition fig 9 the heatmap analysis indicated that the conventional w m and wheat soybean rotations were included in a small cluster with a higher annual et for the w m rotation and a higher groundwater table decline for both rotations fig 9a spring maize rotated in the wheat soybean or in the spring mungbean summer millet rotations were also in a small cluster while spring maize winter wheat summer soybean had higher protein content energy and corresponding wues than spring maize spring mungbean summer millet these four cropping systems along with the spring potato summer millet rotation were in a large cluster with higher economic benefit equivalent yield and corresponding wues for the spring potato summer millet rotation the principal component analysis pca revealed the relationships between the 15 crop rotations and each evaluated indicator rotations with winter wheat were associated with higher irrigation water and energy inputs higher ghgs and greater groundwater table decline fig 9b rotations with soybean were associated with higher protein contents growing season precipitation and economic benefits the pca showed that increasing fallow days and lower ci contributed to mitigate the groundwater table decline however irrigation pumped from groundwater increased groundwater depletion energy consumption and ghgs in co2 eq fig 9c crop rotations with high comprehensive evaluation index cei values were considered potential alternative rotations for the conventional w m rotation fig 10 shows the results of the normalization analysis for 12 indicators in each rotation the cei for the w m rotation 0 307 ranked 12th for the 15 rotations table 1 the spring potato summer millet rotation had the greatest value with 0 665 followed by spring mungbean summer millet based rotations summer soybean w m rotation spring maize w m or w s rotations and summer oil sunflower w m or w s rotations rotations with spring mungbean grown solely in the first year had 12 lower ceis than the w m rotation indicating that spring mungbean is not suitable for sole cultivation in one year within a rotation the cei value of the wheat soybean rotation 0 270 had no clear advantage over the w m rotation 4 discussion 4 1 water consumption of staple crops this study quantified et c e r and et aw of nine tested crops during the growing season from 1960 to 2020 providing a valuable database of crop water requirements over time in the research area the et c values of winter wheat 335 533 mm summer maize 322 428 mm spring cotton 495 684 mm and spring maize 393 567 mm were consistent with previous studies in the ncp kong et al 2009 for cotton and winter wheat yang et al 2011 for spring maize yang et al 2012 for winter wheat yang et al 2013 for summer maize yang et al 2021b for cotton and shi et al 2021 for winter wheat and summer maize this study also extended the water requirement database to other crops with limited studies in the cangzhou area such as soybean millet mungbean and oil sunflower it was obviously found that spring cotton winter wheat spring maize and spring potato had higher et c than the other five crops this information helped build alternative diversified cropping systems considering the inclusion of soybean millet mungbean and oil sunflower in the conventional w m rotation to lower the water requirements the et c of all tested crops followed a slightly declining trend from 1960 to 2020 consistent with yang et al 2013 2021b and mainly attributed to decreased solar radiation the e r of each crop varied over time due to intra and inter annual rainfall differences during the growing period crop irrigation demand et aw determined from et c and e r was ranked winter crop spring crop summer crop suggesting that crop diversification with soybean or millet could reduce groundwater irrigation in the ncp

al 2019 in this study 15 crop rotations including four rotations of double cropping per year and 11 multi crop rotations of three crops in two years were generated transparently using agronomic criteria in the rotat model dogliotti et al 2003 to gain insight into future possibilities for alternative water saving rotations no significant differences in average annual et c occurred between precipitation type years wet normal and dry for the 15 crop rotations the double cropping systems ci 2 had 13 15 higher average annual et c than multi crop rotations ci 1 5 consistent with previous studies yang et al 2021a reported that ci negatively correlated with water consumption implying that introducing the fallow period each year into the intensive w m double cropping system would reduce actual et by 10 54 in this study fallow period inclusion decreased annual et c by 17 in wet years 16 in normal years and 15 in dry years multi crop rotations ci 1 5 decreased annual et c by 11 23 relative to the conventional w m rotation with an average et c of 835 mm liu et al 2001 the winter wheat summer soybean based multi rotations or the spring mungbean summer millet based rotations had lower et c than the w m rotation indicating that soybean millet and mung bean are good alternatives for inclusion in the conventional rotations to increase biodiversity and system benefits as supported by previous studies li et al 2010 reported the water saving benefits of a millet rye double cropping system with different millet cultivars and sowing dates luo et al 2015 found that climate change affected the water requirement of soybean and millet at a lesser degree than the most sensitive winter wheat using the cropwat model legume based rotations offer a critical pathway for enhancing global crop production especially when integrated into low input and low diversity agricultural systems zhao et al 2020 developing diversified cropping systems involving soybean and spring maize can also help alleviate groundwater table decline in the ncp from a water footprint perspective yang et al 2020 the precipitation coupling degree of all established crop rotations was ranked wet year average 0 83 normal year 0 72 dry year 0 61 while the annual et aw of different crop rotations was ranked dry year normal year wet year multiple crop rotations with three crops in two years significantly reduced the annual et aw by 28 in wet 34 in normal and 36 in dry years compared to the average value for the four double cropping systems apart from the spring mungbean winter wheat summer maize summer soybean with low precipitation coupling degree the annual et aw of multiple rotations 3 crops in 2 years decreased by 18 50 compared to the w m rotation however the conventional w m did not have the highest irrigation demand as compared to the other three double cropping systems being similar to wheat soybean and spring potato summer millet rotations with a ci of 1 5 decreased groundwater decline by 26 relative to those with a ci of 2 in addition the spring mungbean summer millet based multi rotations mitigated groundwater decline by 62 relative to the conventional w m rotation this suggests that decreasing the cropping intensity can reduce annual irrigation demands and further mitigate the decline of groundwater table yang et al 2015a b yang 2019a 2021a meanwhile the w m rotation has the potential to sustain groundwater use balance under rainfed conditions or extremely optimized irrigation regimes and techniques with an accompanying yield reduction sun et al 2015 li et al 2018 yan et al 2020 4 3 co benefits and tradeoffs of diversified crop rotations across multiple dimensions sustainable food fiber and forage production depend on cropping systems that produce high yields and preserve soil water and biodiversity franchini et al 2012 diversified crop rotations improve the ability of the cropping system to cope with unexpected disturbances and uncertainty while maintaining system functionality and productivity li et al 2019 diversified cropping systems especially those incorporating legumes can enhance food production with reduced inputs and environmental impacts zhao et al 2020 enhancing biodiversity temporally by crop rotation promoted ecosystem services such as pest and disease control carbon sequestration and soil fertility

reduction liu et al 2021b shah et al 2021 davis et al 2019 indicated that diversifying crop production by shifting to include more coarse cereals such as millets and sorghum can supply more iron to human diets helping mitigate the incidence of anemia in women with a high proportion of rice in diets in india this study selected 11 crop rotations with a higher nondimensional cei than the conventional w m rotation for water consumption economic benefit equivalent yield protein content energy in calories precipitation coupling degree groundwater table decline ghgs in co2 eq and wues the results revealed that the cei of the winter wheat summer soybean rotation ci 2 did not significantly differ from the w m rotation mainly due to the low yielding soybean even with its higher protein content and economic benefit reckling et al 2016b cusworth et al 2021 the multi crop rotations ci 1 5 that included soybean had higher cei indicating an amplification effect and nitrogen benefit of including legumes in rotations the positive effect of soybean as the pre crop on increasing the yield and nitrogen use efficiency of subsequent crops has been previously reported in many studies franchini et al 2012 preissel et al 2015 espinoza et al 2020 in addition soybean enhances dietary nutrition and farmer income and reduces nitrogen and carbon footprints michalczyk et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 including legumes in crop rotations reduces synthetic n fertilizer use due to n inputs from biological nitrogen fixation jensen et al 2020 and improves soil n cycling due to higher n concentrations and lower c n ratios than cereal residues and n rhizodeposition by legumes guinet et al 2020 in the ncp n leaching mainly occurs during the summer crop growing season as 70 of precipitation occurs in summer jia et al 2014 the wheat soybean rotation had lower n leaching risks than the w m rotation yang et al 2022b currently china purchases around 66 of the soybean traded on the international market to meet 90 of its domestic needs anon 2019 soybean production is encouraged for self sufficiency and sustainability liu et al 2021b in dominant production regions like the ncp and should be included in crop combination designs for the research area crop rotations were proved to possess high and stable crop yields especially under water stress as reported in a 23 year experiment in south brazil that included wheat soybean black oat soybean and white lupin maize rotations franchini et al 2012 crop diversification enhances soil microbial biomass silva et al 2010 and diversity pereira et al 2007 increasing the efficiency of several key microbial processes for maximizing soybean yield such as biological nitrogen fixation nutrient recycling and the suppression of disease causing agents hungria et al 2009 the rotational design of cropping systems offered an efficient way to optimize n and water management in agricultural production through alternative sequencing to ensure optimal n use and water use efficiencies rahman and kazal 2015 yang et al 2015a 2019a 2021a in this study the spring potato summer millet rotation performed the best for cei due to the high potato yield potatoes are fat free a source of vitamin c and vitamin b6 and can supply good amounts of other micronutrients and fiber that feature in the food based dietary guidelines of many countries wijesinha bettoni and mouillé 2019 potato has been proposed as the fourth major staple food crop for improving china s food security in china since 2015 moreover plastic film mulching cultivation has been used to reduce water evaporation for potato planting in water limited agricultural areas qin et al 2022 conversely millet has advantages when grown on rainfed marginal lands that are often exposed to water stress kumar et al 2018 therefore we recommend to include soybean millet and potato in the conventional w m system to develop diversified crop rotations with three crops in two years that supply nutrients and energy while mitigating groundwater irrigation stress and conforming to local farmers usual practices and perceptions the novel information generated from this study suggests that diversified crop rotations with more species and lower cropping intensity have higher resilience for adapting to climate change and water stress each crop has unique characteristics and growth traits key agronomic indices and environmental implications that affect these metrics we encourage the collection of first hand data from the field we will elucidate the spatial configuration of diversified crop rotations in future work the approach used in this study could be used to design superior crop rotations for other agricultural regions with water shortages 5 conclusion sustainable crop production systems aim to provide sufficient nutritious food while maximizing climate resilience and minimizing resource demands and adverse environmental impacts this study systematically analyzed the water requirements of nine staple crops from 1960 to 2020 to establish 15 alternative crop rotations for reducing groundwater use increasing nutrient energy and economic outputs and improving system efficiency and resilience in the cangzhou area a typical groundwater depletion zone in the ncp the results showed that summer millet and summer soybean had the lowest et c rotations with two crops in one year had 14 and 33 higher annual et c and et aw respectively than multi crop rotations with three crops in two years winter wheat rotated with summer soybean had similar annual et c than the w m rotation slightly greater economic benefit and significantly higher protein content spring mungbean summer millet based multi rotations had 8 17 and 56 higher precipitation coupling degrees in wet normal and dry years respectively and 1 1 2 4 times greater economic benefits than the w m rotation spring mung bean summer millet rotated with summer oil sunflower or soybean as the previous crop had the lowest annual et c and et aw spring potato summer millet had the greatest economic benefit and equivalent yield and corresponding wues and spring maize rotated with winter wheat summer soybean performed best for protein and energy contents and corresponding wues this study selected 11 alternative crop rotations with higher cei than the w m rotation based on entropy topsis the results however indicated that spring mung bean is not suitable for inclusion in the crop rotation as the sole crop in one year introducing soybean millet and potato into innovative multi crop rotations is endorsed for farm configuration transition shifting from simple two crop rotation in one year to multi crop rotations for crop diversification maximum

9159,agricultural intensification has increased crop productivity but simplified production and reduced cropping system diversity in recent decades the intensified wheat maize rotation in the north china plain has sharply decreased the groundwater table with associated environmental and biodiversity issues understanding whether increasing cropping system diversity stabilizes productivity improves resilience and reduces adverse environmental impacts is critical this study quantified the water requirements of nine staple crops from 1960 to 2020 established 15 alternative crop rotations and evaluated the resilience of each rotation in the cangzhou area a typical groundwater deletion funnel area the results showed that reducing cropping density harvests per year from 2 to 1 5 decreased the average annual water requirement and irrigation demand by 14 and 33 respectively summer soybean alternated with maize and rotated with wheat did not reduce groundwater use but increased profitability and protein production spring mung bean summer millet based multi rotations had higher precipitation coupling degrees 8 in wet years 17 in normal years and 56 in dry years and profitability 1 1 2 4 times than the wheat maize rotation the spring potato summer millet rotation in one year had the greatest profitability the highest equivalent yield to wheat and the highest water use efficiency wue while spring maize rotated with winter wheat summer soybean performed best for protein content energy output and wues this study identified 11 alternative rotations with a higher comprehensive evaluation index than the conventional wheat maize rotation based on entropy topsis considering 12 indicators spring mungbean is not suitable for inclusion in the crop rotation when solely cultivated in one year due to mismatched rainfall beyond wheat and maize soybean millet and potato are promising crops for innovative multi year multi crop rotations to enhance crop diversification maximize system outputs and minimize groundwater and energy depletion this study s analysis could be extended to develop robust and diverse crop rotations with multiple co benefits in other water stressed agricultural regions keywords diversified crop rotation water requirement resilience multiple objectives tradeoff data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction intensive agriculture has significantly increased crop yield but simplified production with lower diversity of cropping systems higher genetic uniformity and a higher uniformity of agricultural landscapes over the last decades hufnagel et al 2020 changing current agricultural practices from near monoculture to a diverse cropping portfolio is considered a new agricultural pathway for alleviating the challenge of food shortage and ending hunger siddique et al 2021 crop rotation diversification is an effective strategy for increasing system sustainability and resilience against abiotic and biotic stresses and improving the constancies in production related traits reckling et al 2016a li et al 2019 sanford et al 2021 diversified crop rotations also improve groundwater table levels and the economic sustainability of food production yang et al 2021a the north china plain ncp has accounted for 23 of china s total grain production in the past 40 years including 51 of the nation s wheat and 35 of its maize national bureau of statistics of china 2019 however more than 60 of the freshwater in this area comes from groundwater with agriculture responsible for 62 70 of the region s water usage anon 2019 the winter wheat summer maize w m double cropping system has dominated the ncp since 1980 occupying 70 of the area s arable land national bureau of statistics of china

for irrigation to satisfy winter wheat s water demands sun et al 2019 groundwater table decline in the cangzhou area adjacent to the heilonggang watershed in the southeast of the ncp has reached 1 5 m year 1 due to irrigation overuse yang et al 2021a surpassing groundwater declines in india and the us high plains pei et al 2015 and resulting in other ecological problems such as land subsidence salt intrusion and deep earth fissures cao et al 2013 alternative crop rotations are urgently needed to balance water security and food production in the ncp in the northern great plains of north america crop diversification where annual legumes or oilseeds replace summer fallow periods in a rotation sequence has increased crop water use efficiency wue in the southern great plains continuous small cereal grain production and crop sequences with a high incidence of oilseeds generally have low precipitation use efficiencies nielsen et al 2005 in the central great plains the wue of winter wheat was increased by 18 56 in rotations that included a broadleaf crop tanaka et al 2005 in the argentina pampas an analysis of water dynamics over six years in a maize soybean rotation that included a fall winter cover crop revealed that the previous cover crop affected the main crop s yield in exceptionally dry seasons due to soil water extraction restovich et al 2012 in the ncp replacing maize or the inter planted crop with soybean in the conventional w m rotation increased water use during the summer rainy season in a three year field experiment due to the increased leaf area index indicating that selecting a low water use crop in the summer season as the previous crop minimizes the reduction in winter wheat yield under limited water supply qin et al 2018 in the ncp the impact of different irrigation schedules on groundwater reserves and crop production in the w m rotation has been predicted for historical sun et al 2015 yang et al 2022a and future climate change yan et al 2020 scenarios suggesting an inevitable shift to alternative watering systems e g rainfed or only one irrigation at sowing and a single cropping system per year but accompanying by a reduction in yield compared to the w m rotation crop diversifications with such as sweet potato peanut and cotton as the previous crop of winter wheat significantly decreased actual annual evapotranspiration et by 11 30 yang et al 2015a 2019b and greenhouse gas ghg emissions by 14 56 in a 12 year field experiment yang et al 2014 2019b yang et al 2021a evaluated the multi dimensional outcomes of 31 different crop rotations tested in field experiments across the ncp in the past three decades and found that 77 of the tested crop rotations decreased annual et with only single cropping or the w m rotation under rainfed conditions maintaining the groundwater table and 35 of the crop rotations increased economic benefits this synthetic analysis validated that diversified crop rotations enhanced groundwater and economic sustainability of food production in the ncp sustainable food systems aim to provide adequate nutritious foods while maximizing climate resilience and minimizing resource demands and adverse environmental impacts improving system resilience requires systemically integrating multiple factors affecting plant growth crop yield and economic outcomes optimized crop configuration and diversification increase grain production enhance system resilience to abiotic and biotic stresses and decrease environmental damage liu et al 2022a identifying synergies that minimize tradeoffs across multiple dimensions is essential for sustainable agricultural intensification davis et al 2017 identified possible alternative configurations to the agricultural landscape that by reshaping the global distribution of crops within current rainfed and irrigated croplands based on total water consumption would feed an additional 825 million people while reducing the consumptive use of rainwater and irrigation by 14 and 12 respectively in india diversifying crop production to include more coarse cereals such as millets and sorghum could make the food supply more nutritious reduce resource demand and ghgs and enhance climate resilience without reducing calorie production or increasing land area davis et al 2019 after assessing the adequacy of nutrient supply associated natural resource use land freshwater and ghgs at the current national level in india damerau et al 2020 applied an integrated local environmental and nutrient optimization approach to explore possible constraints to india achieving the goal of food self sufficiency groot and yang 2022 presented an evolutionary multi objective optimization analysis of how 30 different crop rotations practiced in the ncp could be combined at the regional level to overcome tradeoffs between economic food security and environmental performance indicators rearranging cropping systems in the ncp is crucial and should include the choice of cropping system fine tuning inputs and crop management improving crop cultivars by combining multiple strategies and planning spatiotemporal distribution and coordination few studies on diversified cropping systems have comprehensively evaluated the synergies and tradeoffs between groundwater use grain yield nutrient production ghgs energy production and wue indicators in the ncp this study takes cangzhou the most severe groundwater depletion area as a case study to 1 quantify the water requirements of nine staple crops from 1960 to 2020 2 redesign and identify alternative crop diversifications to the conventional w m rotation and 3 evaluate the synergies and tradeoffs of established crop rotations across multiple dimensions including food production economic and environmental effects the study provides essential information for using crop rotations as an effective means to enhance the sustainability of food production across multiple outcomes and minimize tradeoffs fig 1 extending this solution to other water stressed agricultural regions could be an effective strategy for achieving sustainable food production systems globally 2 materials and methods 2 1 research area the water requirements of diversified crop rotations were evaluated at the cangzhou meteorological station 38 20 n 116 29 e altitude 9 6 m in the heilonggang watershed located in the southeast of hebei province in the ncp fig 2a the site has a warm temperate zone semi humid monsoon climate the annual average precipitation is 573 9 mm with sharp yearly fluctuations and uneven seasonal distribution fig 2b about 79 of the yearly precipitation occurs from june to september fig 2c the annual mean air temperature is 13 1 fig 2c with a frost free period of about 200 days the w m double cropping system dominates in this area accounting for 83 of the total cultivated area fig s1 cangzhou bureau of statistics 2020 groundwater table decline has reached 1 5 m year 1 in this area yang et al 2021a 2 2 data source daily meteorological data 1960 2020 including maximum minimum and average temperatures relative average humidity wind speed at 10 m height sunshine hours at 2 m height and precipitation at the cangzhou meteorological station were obtained from the china meteorological data sharing website http data cma cn soil parameters including soil type soil texture wilting coefficient soil bulk density and saturated moisture content were obtained from national soil survey database nine main crops winter wheat summer maize spring potato spring cotton summer oil sunflower spring maize spring mung bean summer soybean summer millet were involved in the analysis and diversified crop rotation design crop characteristics including sowing date harvest date planting area and sowing density were collected from field experiment data literature survey results project reports and statistical yearbooks the local crop sowing and harvest date information is detailed in supplementary material table s1 crop yields from 2008 to 2020 were collected from the hebei province bureau of statistics 2021 soil parameters are listed in table s2 2 3 classification according to precipitation type year precipitation in each year was distinguished as wet normal or dry according to eq 1 yang et al 2022a to identify the water requirement characteristics for each crop in different years wet year p i p 0 33 δ 1 normal year p 0 33 δ p i p 0 33 δ dry year p i p 0 33 δ where p i is the i th year s rainfall mm p is the average year s precipitation from 1960 to 2020 mm and δ is the standard deviation of p mm average annual precipitation was 573 9 173 3 mm from 1960 to 2020 with p i 631 3 mm for wet years p i 516 7 mm for dry years and 516 7 mm p i 631 3 mm for normal years thus cangzhou had 18 wet years 23 normal years and 20 dry years in the past 61 years with most of the precipitation type years discontinuous the average annual precipitation was 768 9 148 4 mm for wet years 575 8 34 8 mm for normal years and 404 7 85 9 mm for dry years table s3 2 4 crop water requirement calculations the simetaw simulation evapotranspiration of applied water model snyder et al 2004 2005 2012 was used to simulate and quantify the crop water requirement et c effective rainfall e r and irrigation water requirement et aw of nine main crops at cangzhou station this model has been applied widely to calculate the water requirements of maize wheat cotton and soybean in the ncp kong et al 2009 yang et al 2011 2012 2013 2021b c huang et al 2012 hu et al 2017 jia et al 2019 the model calculates the reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 yang et al 2021b then multiplies the daily et 0 time series using a crop coefficient k c specific for each crop to obtain the desired daily et c time series the k c values of each crop were adopted from the fao 56 recommendations allen et al 1998 the parameters of each crop and soil were adjusted according to the actual situation therefore et c was calculated as follows 2 e t c e t 0 k c the simetaw model also simulated daily rainfall soil water holding characteristics and effective rooting depths further et c was used to determine effective rainfall e r and to generate hypothetical irrigation schedules for estimating seasonal and annual et aw in which et aw represents the net amount of irrigation water required to add to the crop in the growing season snyder et al 2005 as follows 3 et aw et c e r where et aw is crop irrigation water requirement during the growing season mm et c is crop evapotranspiration during the growing season mm and e r is the effective rainfall during the growing season mm when et c e r 0 et aw 0 2 5 diversified crop rotation establishment the rotat model dogliotti 2003 castellazzi et al 2008 was used to design potential diversified crop rotations for the research area using agronomic criteria the program combines crops from a predefined list to generate all possible rotations the criteria and rules of rotation design included species and groups of crops frequency of crops and groups sequence or succession duration to complete a cycle number of different crops and crop growth period crop groups relate to the same plant family or similar cultivation practices e g root crops the rotat model can generate a set of crop sequences evaluate the agronomic feasibility of the sequences based on rules evaluate the performance of the generated rotations and validate the rotations for various indicators the full factorial number of possible combinations of crops is limited by the number of filters controlled by the user these filters were designed to eliminate crop successions that are agronomically unfeasible and for farm specific reasons not practical or desirable the filters represent expert knowledge quantitatively and explicitly the generated combination and sequence of crop species determine characteristics of farming systems such as crop yields soil erosion occurrence of soil borne pests diseases and weeds and nitrogen and labor dynamics dogliotti et al 2003 fifteen cropping systems were selected from the crop sequence list generated from the nine diverse crops mentioned above see table s4 based on local climate water resources soil conditions and crop characteristics e g crop water demand characteristics crop growth and development traits agronomic standards crop attributes inter crop interactions planting frequency and crop rotation cycle the final crop rotation database contained four double cropping systems with the conventional w m rotation and 11 multi crop rotations all with 3 harvests in 2 years with the first year starting from a single spring or summer crop we maximized the rotation cycle to two years because the local farmers prefer short rotation cycles due to their usual practices and perceptions summer soybean alternated with summer maize and rotated with winter wheat and spring mungbean summer millet based crop rotations were designed to increase protein production as did relative to w m based rotations fig 3 shows the time sequence for each crop in each crop rotation 2 6 indicator calculations for crop rotations 2 6 1 1 cropping index we defined cropping index ci as the crop harvest number per year within a cropping system cycle calculated as follows 4 ci cropharvests rotationyears where crop harvests is the number of crop harvests within a complete crop rotation cycle and rotation years is the number of years in that cropping system cycle for example the ci of the spring maize winter wheat summer maize rotation is 3 2 3 crop harvests 2 rotation years the 15 targeted cropping systems in this study included four double cropping ci 2 and 11 multi crop rotations ci 1 5 we defined one year as the analytical unit for the diverse indicators below 2 6 2 annual water requirement 5 e t i 1 n e t c i j 1 n e j 6 e j o k c e t 0 where et is annual evapotranspiration mm of a certain crop rotation et ci is crop water requirement in the i th crop growing stage mm e j is evapotranspiration in the j fallow period mm ok c is the conversion coefficient of bare soil during the fallow period recommended by the simetaw model and et 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm when a crop rotation s ci is 2 the annual evapotranspiration of this crop rotation is equal to the value of et when the ci is 1 5 the annual evapotranspiration of this crop rotation is equal to the value of et divided by 2 as the number of rotation cycle years 2 6 3 precipitation coupling degree we defined the precipitation coupling degree pcd λ as the water availability ratio between crop water requirement and natural precipitation during a particular growth stage or whole growing season of a specific crop rotation with values ranging from 0 to 1 growth stage values were 7 λ i 1 p i e t c i p i e t c i p i e t c i where λ i is the index value in the i th growth stage of a crop rotation p i is the total amount of natural precipitation in the i th stage mm and et ci is the water requirement for crop growth in the i th stage mm the index value for the whole crop rotation is the ratio between the total natural precipitation and et c over the entire growing season for a specific rotation 2 6 4 equivalent yield economic benefit energy and protein content a realistic consideration of yield accounts for differences in economic values between crop species the economic benefit of each crop is expressed as within year yield multiplied by the corresponding product price in inflation adjusted yuan minus costs to eliminate inflation or deflation as a source of variability between the different cases in different years we used the china national consumer price index cpi to adjust crop prices and economic benefit for all database years once adjusted the economic benefit values became less dependent on year to year fluctuations in input prices and yields since the yield data in this study started in 2008 we adopted the 2008 cpi as the baseline so all economic benefit values are expressed in 2008 yuan all cpi values from 2008 to 2020 were sourced from the china statistical yearbook national bureau of statistics of china 2021 crop prices were sourced from the china yearbook of agricultural price survey the yields of different crop species are comparable based on the principle of economic value the equivalent yield of each crop is recalculated as eq 9 with winter wheat as the baseline meanwhile the energy and protein content of each crop and each rotation were calculated using eq 10 and eq 11 respectively 8 eb i yield i price i cpi i cpi 2008 9 e y i yield i price i wheatprice i 10 e i y i e l d i α i 11 p c i y i

statistical analysis the yearly mean data of the diversified crops or crop rotations were statistically analyzed using multi way analysis of variance anova differences between rotation mean values were compared using duncan s multiple range test at a 95 probability level entropy topsis technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution is a multi objective decision analysis method for identifying a solution from a feasible solution set by defining the positive and negative ideal solutions of the problem and selecting the ideal solution that is the most positive and furthest from the negative ideal solution wang et al 2019 chen et al 2020 liu et al 2021a in order to overcome the influence of subjective factors caused by the delphi method or analytic hierarchy process when determining the weight of the evaluation index of the traditional topsis method the entropy weight method was selected for objective evaluation to determine the index weight avoiding a certain degree of subjectivity bias delgado and romero 2016 chen et al 2020 we used the entropy weight method to obtain the weight of each indicator and then calculated the comprehensive evaluation rank of each crop rotation using topsis as follows 1 normalize the indicators 16 b i j x i j x min x max x min positiveindicator 17 b i j x max x i j x max x min negativeindicator where b ij is the normalized value of the j th index in the i th crop rotation positive indicators include eb ey e pc ewue ywue enwue pwue and pcd negative indicators include annual et ghgs and gtd groundwater table decline ghgs were calculated from the electricity consumption for irrigation pumping multiplied by its emission factor expressed in co2 eq liu et al 2022b groundwater table decline m was calculated

et c during the growing season from 1960 to 2020 572 mm followed by winter wheat 464 mm spring maize 457 mm spring potato 428 mm spring mung bean 367 mm summer maize 366 mm summer oil sunflower 360 mm summer soybean 350 mm and summer millet 323 mm fig 4a the average annual e r during the past 60 years differed in each crop s growing season with the high to low ranking as spring cotton e r 337 mm spring maize 277 mm summer oil sunflower 259 mm summer maize 250 mm summer millet 196 mm summer soybean 192 mm winter wheat 109 mm spring mung bean 95 mm and spring potato 74 mm fig 4b et aw is the difference between the crop water requirement and effective rainfall during the growing season when e r can not supply the entire et c winter wheat had the highest average annual et aw 355 mm followed by spring potato 354 mm spring mung bean 272 mm spring cotton 235 mm spring maize 180 mm summer soybean 158 mm summer millet 128 mm summer maize 116 mm and summer oil sunflower 101 mm fig 4c 2 2 water requirements of diversified crop rotations during the growing season from 1960 to 2020 the average growing season et c of each crop rotation did not significantly differ between precipitation type years the conventional w m rotation had the highest growing season et c in wet 820 mm normal and dry 834 mm years with similar values for the winter wheat summer soybean rotation fig 5a c summer soybean spring mungbean summer millet had the smallest growing season et c averaging 520 mm across all precipitation type years or 37 lower than the w m rotation compared to the conventional w m rotation spring mung bean or spring potato rotated with summer millet ci 2 decreased growing season et c by 17 and 9 respectively winter wheat based multi crop rotations 3 harvests in 2 years decreased growing season et c averaged 605 mm in all precipitation type years by 23 29 spring mung bean summer millet based multi crop rotations rotated with summer oil sunflower spring maize or summer soybean in the first year decreased growing season et c averaged 540 mm in all precipitation type years by 31 37 the spring cotton spring mung bean summer millet rotation had a growing season et c of 631 mm similar to the spring maize winter wheat summer soybean rotation or 24 lower than the w m rotation the et aw of each crop rotation under different precipitation type years was ranked dry year normal year wet year the winter wheat summer soybean rotation ci 2 had the highest average et aw in wet 456 mm normal 511 mm and dry years 564 mm but did not significantly differ from the conventional w m rotation 404 mm in wet 466 mm in normal and 534 mm in dry years fig 5d f the summer oil sunflower spring mung bean summer millet rotation ci 1 5 had the lowest average et aw in wet 240 mm normal 237 mm and dry years 265 mm compared to the w m rotation winter wheat based multi crop rotations ci 1 5 decreased the average annual et aw by 21 wet 29 normal and 33 dry similarly the spring mung bean summer millet rotation ci 2 decreased the average annual et aw by 11 wet 18 normal and 15 dry spring mung bean summer millet based rotations ci 1 5 also decreased the average annual et aw by 34 wet 42 normal and 45 dry all these results suggest that decreasing the ci significantly decreased the annual irrigation amounts especially in normal and dry years 2 3 annual evapotranspiration of diversified crop rotations from 1960 to 2020 the annual et of each crop rotation included et c during the crop growing period and et in the fallow period the average annual water consumption of each crop rotation did not significantly differ between precipitation type years the conventional w m rotation had the highest average annual et in the past 60 years in wet 824 mm normal 841 mm and dry 840 mm years fig 6a c summer soybean spring mung bean summer millet had the lowest annual et averaging 656 mm across all precipitation type years the average annual et of winter wheat summer soybean and spring potato summer millet rotations ci 2 did not significantly differ from the w m rotation in different precipitation type years this revealed that the double cropping systems in one year ci 2 had no water use advantage compared to the w m rotation the average annual et of seven winter wheat based multi crop rotations ci 1 5 was decreased by 13 18 range 685 729 mm while the spring mungbean summer millet based multi crop rotations ci 1 5 decreased annual et by 13 21 thus decreasing ci is beneficial for decreasing annual et 2 4 precipitation coupling degree of diversified crop rotations in different precipitation type years from 1960 to 2020 the precipitation coupling degree of all diversified crop rotations was ranked wet year normal year dry year fig 7 in the wet years the precipitation coupling degree of 15 crop rotations ranged from 0 69 to 0 91 average 0 83 with 87 exceeding 0 80 fig 7a spring mungbean summer millet based rotations had the highest precipitation coupling degrees all 0 85 the four double cropping rotations performed well in the wet year with precipitation coupling degrees of 0 80 0 91 the spring mung bean winter wheat summer maize or summer soybean rotations had a low precipitation coupling degree of 0 69 because the spring mungbean rotated in the first year had the shortest growing period april june which mismatched the rainfall season in the normal year fig 7b the precipitation coupling degree of 15 crop rotations declined range 0 57 0 81 average 0 72 the two winter wheat based double crop rotations decreased distinctly only 0 68 the five winter wheat based multi crop rotations 3 harvests in 2 years excluding spring mungbean as the first year crop had an average value of 0 76 spring mungbean summer millet based multi rotations had relatively high precipitation coupling degrees ranging from 0 76 to 0 81 in the dry year fig 7c the precipitation coupling degree of 15 crop rotations decreased even more than the normal and wet years range 0 46 0 77 average 0 61 the two winter wheat summer crop maize or soybean rotations decreased significantly to a very low 0 48 the precipitation coupling degree of the seven winter wheat based multi crop rotations ci 1 5 averaged 0 62 spring mungbean summer millet based multiple crop rotations had comparatively higher values ranging from 0 71 to 0 77 in short different crop rotations had different resilience and adaptation to different precipitation type years winter wheat based double cropping systems were disadvantaged in normal and dry years with only 20 30 of the yearly precipitation in the wheat growing season spring mung bean winter wheat summer maize or summer soybean had the lowest precipitation coupling degrees in wet 0 69 normal 0 57 and dry years 0 46 indicating that spring mungbean is not suitable for individual rotations in the first year due to its short growing period april june and mismatched rainfall season 2 5 multiple functions of diversified crop rotations from 2008 to 2020 the average annual economic benefit of the conventional w m rotation from 2018 to 2020 was 12 944 yuan ha 1 fig 8a the spring potato summer millet double cropping system had the highest economic benefit 4 2 times higher than the w m rotation due to potato s high yield and price the two other double cropping systems spring mungbean summer millet and winter wheat summer soybean had higher economic outputs than the w m rotation by 1 9 and 1 2 times respectively similarly spring mung bean summer millet based multi rotations with three harvests in two years rotated spring maize summer oil sunflower or summer soybean in the first year had 1 3 2 4 times higher economic output than the w m rotation winter wheat summer soybean based multi rotations with three harvests in two years rotated spring maize spring mung bean summer oil sunflower in the first year had 1 01 1 7 times higher economic outputs than the w m rotation in contrast w m based rotations 3 harvests in 2 years decreased the economic benefit by 8 25 relative to the w m rotation the average annual equivalent yield of the conventional w m rotation from 2018 to 2020 was 9646 kg ha 1 similar to the winter wheat summer soybean rotation but 10 27 higher than nine of the 15 potential crop rotations fig 8b the spring potato summer millet rotation had the highest equivalent yield 2 7 times higher than the w m rotation the spring mungbean summer millet rotation had an equivalent yield 1 2 times higher than the w m rotation the spring maize based multi rotations ci 3 2 rotated with spring mungbean summer millet or winter wheat summer soybean in the second year had 1 7 and 1 5 times higher equivalent yields than the w m rotation respectively the average annual protein content of the conventional w m rotation was 1285 kg ha 1 12 66 higher than eleven of the 15 potential cropping systems fig 8c the winter wheat summer soybean rotation had 1 3 times higher protein content than the w m rotation the spring maize winter wheat summer soybean rotation had the highest protein yield 1 7 times higher than the w m rotation the spring maize spring mungbean summer millet rotation also increased protein yield by 10 compared to the conventional w m rotation the average annual energy of the conventional w m rotation was 172 103 mj ha 1 similar to the spring maize spring mungbean summer millet rotation 169 103 mj ha 1 fig 8d the spring maize winter wheat summer soybean and spring potato summer millet rotations had 26 and 15 higher average annual energy than the w m rotation respectively eleven of the 15 potential rotations had 24 71 lower average annual energy than the w m rotation the generalized wues ewue ywue pwue and enwue equated to economic benefit equivalent yield protein content or energy divided by annual et see supplementary material fig s2 the order of the 15 crop rotations changed for each wue indicator depending on the annual et suggesting that the efficiency per cubic meter of water differed for each crop rotation the average ranking of the four wues for the conventional w m rotation among the 15 rotations decreased by 7 27 fig s2 compared to the four indicators shown in fig 8 2 6 comprehensive assessment of diversified crop rotations based on heatmap and entropy topsis the heatmap and entropy topsis analysis identified the optimal crop rotation for synergy of groundwater use reduction food production economic benefit ghgs and dietary nutrition fig 9 the heatmap analysis indicated that the conventional w m and wheat soybean rotations were included in a small cluster with a higher annual et for the w m rotation and a higher groundwater table decline for both rotations fig 9a spring maize rotated in the wheat soybean or in the spring mungbean summer millet rotations were also in a small cluster while spring maize winter wheat summer soybean had higher protein content energy and corresponding wues than spring maize spring mungbean summer millet these four cropping systems along with the spring potato summer millet rotation were in a large cluster with higher economic benefit equivalent yield and corresponding wues for the spring potato summer millet rotation the principal component analysis pca revealed the relationships between the 15 crop rotations and each evaluated indicator rotations with winter wheat were associated with higher irrigation water and energy inputs higher ghgs and greater groundwater table decline fig 9b rotations with soybean were associated with higher protein contents growing season precipitation and economic benefits the pca showed that increasing fallow days and lower ci contributed to mitigate the groundwater table decline however irrigation pumped from groundwater increased groundwater depletion energy consumption and ghgs in co2 eq fig 9c crop rotations with high comprehensive evaluation index cei values were considered potential alternative rotations for the conventional w m rotation fig 10 shows the results of the normalization analysis for 12 indicators in each rotation the cei for the w m rotation 0 307 ranked 12th for the 15 rotations table 1 the spring potato summer millet rotation had the greatest value with 0 665 followed by spring mungbean summer millet based rotations summer soybean w m rotation spring maize w m or w s rotations and summer oil sunflower w m or w s rotations rotations with spring mungbean grown solely in the first year had 12 lower ceis than the w m rotation indicating that spring mungbean is not suitable for sole cultivation in one year within a rotation the cei value of the wheat soybean rotation 0 270 had no clear advantage over the w m rotation 4 discussion 4 1 water consumption of staple crops this study quantified et c e r and et aw of nine tested crops during the growing season from 1960 to 2020 providing a valuable database of crop water requirements over time in the research area the et c values of winter wheat 335 533 mm summer maize 322 428 mm spring cotton 495 684 mm and spring maize 393 567 mm were consistent with previous studies in the ncp kong et al 2009 for cotton and winter wheat yang et al 2011 for spring maize yang et al 2012 for winter wheat yang et al 2013 for summer maize yang et al 2021b for cotton and shi et al 2021 for winter wheat and summer maize this study also extended the water requirement database to other crops with limited studies in the cangzhou area such as soybean millet mungbean and oil sunflower it was obviously found that spring cotton winter wheat spring maize and spring potato had higher et c than the other five crops this information helped build alternative diversified cropping systems considering the inclusion of soybean millet mungbean and oil sunflower in the conventional w m rotation to lower the water requirements the et c of all tested crops followed a slightly declining trend from 1960 to 2020 consistent with yang et al 2013 2021b and mainly attributed to decreased solar radiation the e r of each crop varied over time due to intra and inter annual rainfall differences during the growing period crop irrigation demand et aw determined from et c and e r was ranked winter crop spring crop summer crop suggesting that crop diversification with soybean or millet could reduce groundwater irrigation in the ncp singh et al 2018 yang et al 2021c shah et al 2021 4 2 water consumption of diversified crop rotations crop rotation plays a central role in developing sustainable farming systems gaitán cremaschi et al 2019 in this study 15 crop rotations including four rotations of double cropping per year and 11 multi crop rotations of three crops in two years were generated transparently using agronomic criteria in the rotat model dogliotti et al 2003 to gain insight into future possibilities for alternative water saving rotations no significant differences in average annual et c occurred between precipitation type years wet normal and dry for the 15 crop rotations the double cropping systems ci 2 had 13 15 higher average annual et c than multi crop rotations ci 1 5 consistent with previous studies yang et al 2021a reported that ci negatively correlated with water consumption implying that introducing the fallow period each year into the intensive w m double cropping system would reduce actual et by 10 54 in this study fallow period inclusion decreased annual et c by 17 in wet years 16 in normal years and 15 in dry years multi crop rotations ci 1 5 decreased annual et c by 11 23 relative to the conventional w m rotation with an average et c of 835 mm liu et al 2001 the winter wheat summer soybean based multi rotations or the spring mungbean summer millet based rotations had lower et c than the w m rotation indicating that soybean millet and mung bean are good alternatives for inclusion in the conventional rotations to increase biodiversity and system benefits as supported by previous studies li et al 2010 reported the water saving benefits of a millet rye double cropping system with different millet cultivars and sowing dates luo et al 2015 found that climate change affected the water requirement of soybean and millet at a lesser degree than the most sensitive winter wheat using the cropwat model legume based rotations offer a critical pathway for enhancing global crop production especially when integrated into low input and low diversity agricultural systems zhao et al 2020 developing diversified cropping systems involving soybean and spring maize can also help alleviate groundwater table decline in the ncp from a water footprint perspective yang et al 2020 the precipitation coupling degree of all established crop rotations was ranked wet year average 0 83 normal year 0 72 dry year 0 61 while the annual et aw of different crop rotations was ranked dry year normal year wet year multiple crop rotations with three crops in two years significantly reduced the annual et aw by 28 in wet 34 in normal and 36 in dry years compared to the average value for the four double cropping systems apart from the spring mungbean winter wheat summer maize summer soybean with low precipitation coupling degree the annual et aw of multiple rotations 3 crops in 2 years decreased by 18 50 compared to the w m rotation however the conventional w m did not have the highest irrigation demand as compared to the other three double cropping systems being similar to wheat soybean and spring potato summer millet rotations with a ci of 1 5 decreased groundwater decline by 26 relative to those with a ci of 2 in addition the spring mungbean summer millet based multi rotations mitigated groundwater decline by 62 relative to the conventional w m rotation this suggests that decreasing the cropping intensity can reduce annual irrigation demands and further mitigate the decline of groundwater table yang et al 2015a b yang 2019a 2021a meanwhile the w m rotation has the potential to sustain groundwater use balance under rainfed conditions or extremely optimized irrigation regimes and techniques with an accompanying yield reduction sun et al

reduction liu et al 2021b shah et al 2021 davis et al 2019 indicated that diversifying crop production by shifting to include more coarse cereals such as millets and sorghum can supply more iron to human diets helping mitigate the incidence of anemia in women with a high proportion of rice in diets in india this study selected 11 crop rotations with a higher nondimensional cei than the conventional w m rotation for water consumption economic benefit equivalent yield protein content energy in calories precipitation coupling degree groundwater table decline ghgs in co2 eq and wues the results revealed that the cei of the winter wheat summer soybean rotation ci 2 did not significantly differ from the w m rotation mainly due to the low yielding soybean even with its higher protein content and economic benefit reckling et al 2016b cusworth et al 2021 the multi crop rotations ci 1 5 that included soybean had higher cei indicating an amplification effect and nitrogen benefit of including legumes in rotations the positive effect of soybean as the pre crop on increasing the yield and nitrogen use efficiency of subsequent crops has been previously reported in many studies franchini et al 2012 preissel et al 2015 espinoza et al 2020 in addition soybean enhances dietary nutrition and farmer income and reduces nitrogen and carbon footprints michalczyk et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 including legumes in crop rotations reduces synthetic n fertilizer use due to n inputs from biological nitrogen fixation jensen et al 2020 and improves soil n cycling due to higher n concentrations and lower c n ratios than cereal residues and n rhizodeposition by legumes guinet et al 2020 in the ncp n leaching mainly occurs during the summer crop growing season as 70 of precipitation occurs in summer jia et al 2014 the wheat soybean rotation had lower n leaching risks than the w m rotation yang et al 2022b currently china purchases around 66 of the soybean traded on the international market to meet 90 of its domestic needs anon 2019 soybean production is encouraged for self sufficiency and sustainability liu et al 2021b in dominant production regions like the ncp and should be included in crop combination designs for the research area crop rotations were proved to possess high and stable crop yields especially under water stress as reported in a 23 year experiment in south brazil that included wheat soybean black oat soybean and white lupin maize rotations franchini et al 2012 crop diversification enhances soil microbial biomass silva et al 2010 and

sequencing to ensure optimal n use and water use efficiencies rahman and kazal 2015 yang et al 2015a 2019a 2021a in this study the spring potato summer millet rotation performed the best for cei due to the high potato yield potatoes are fat free a source of vitamin c and vitamin b6 and can supply good amounts of other micronutrients and fiber that feature in the food based dietary guidelines of many countries wijesinha bettoni and mouillé 2019 potato has been proposed as the fourth major staple food crop for improving china s food security in china since 2015 moreover plastic film mulching cultivation has been used to reduce water evaporation for potato planting in water limited agricultural areas qin et al 2022 conversely millet has advantages when grown on rainfed marginal lands that are often exposed to water stress kumar et al 2018 therefore we recommend to include soybean millet and potato in the conventional w m system to develop diversified crop rotations with three crops in two years that supply nutrients and energy while mitigating groundwater irrigation stress and conforming to local farmers usual practices and perceptions the novel information generated from this study suggests that diversified crop rotations with more species and lower cropping intensity have higher resilience for adapting to climate change and water stress each crop has unique characteristics and growth traits key agronomic indices and environmental implications that affect these metrics we encourage the collection of first hand data from the field we will elucidate the spatial configuration of diversified crop rotations in future work the approach used in this study could be used to design superior crop rotations for other agricultural regions with water shortages 5 conclusion sustainable crop production systems aim to provide sufficient nutritious food while maximizing climate resilience and minimizing resource demands and adverse environmental impacts this study systematically analyzed the water requirements of nine staple crops from 1960 to 2020 to establish 15 alternative crop rotations for reducing groundwater use increasing nutrient energy and economic outputs and improving system efficiency and resilience in the cangzhou area a typical groundwater depletion zone in the ncp the results showed that summer millet and summer soybean had the lowest et c rotations with two crops in one year had 14 and 33 higher annual et c and et aw respectively than multi crop rotations with three crops in two years winter wheat rotated with summer soybean had similar annual et c than the w m rotation slightly greater economic benefit and significantly higher protein content spring mungbean summer millet based multi rotations had 8 17 and 56 higher precipitation coupling degrees in wet normal and dry years respectively and 1 1 2 4 times greater economic benefits than the w m rotation spring mung bean summer millet rotated with summer oil sunflower or soybean as the previous crop had the lowest annual et c and et aw spring potato summer millet had the greatest economic benefit and equivalent yield and corresponding wues and spring maize rotated with winter wheat summer soybean performed best for protein and energy contents and corresponding wues this study selected 11 alternative crop rotations with higher cei than the w m rotation based on entropy topsis the results however indicated that spring mung bean is not suitable for inclusion in the crop rotation as the sole crop in one year introducing soybean millet and potato into innovative multi crop rotations is endorsed for farm configuration transition shifting from simple two crop rotation in one year to multi crop rotations for crop diversification maximum
