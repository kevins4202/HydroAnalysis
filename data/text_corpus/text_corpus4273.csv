21365,this study is dedicated to the wind waves parameters distribution on the black sea with a focus on coastal areas wind waves were simulated using the swan model forced by the ncep cfsr and ncep cfsv2 reanalyses for the period 1979 2016 an unstructured computational grid with resolution varying between 15 km and 200 m was applied modelling results were validated against in situ and remote sensing data for the entire sea distributions of total and seasonal maxima of wave parameters are analyzed maximal significant wave heights exceed 8 5 m and are found in the southwestern areas of the sea maximal wave lengths over 160 m and periods over 10 5 s are located in the eastern part of the sea total and seasonal time series extracted for 12 locations along the coasts of the black sea were studied maximal values of significant wave heights over 6 m correspond to areas along the northeastern and southwestern coasts of the black sea and the southern coast of the crimean peninsula maximal values of wave lengths and wave periods over 140 m and 10 s are located along the northeastern and southern coasts of the black sea nomenclature adcp acoustic doppler current profiler cfsr climate

manifestation of the ocean atmosphere interaction being a mean to transfer energy from the wind to the water surface they significantly influence the state of the upper ocean layer leading to intensified vertical mixing and modifying other physical fields such as currents surface roughness and albedo in nearshore areas wind waves also interact with the topography resulting in the shoreline changes sediment transport and rip currents extreme wind waves occurring during storms can cause significant damage to coastal and offshore engineering structures such as drilling platforms masts pipelines piers berths and beaches moreover such catastrophic events may lead to shipwrecks resulting in pollution of surrounding waters and coastal areas and elimination of seaweed fish marine mammals and birds the black sea is an enclosed sea and has minimal interaction with the world ocean via the bosphorus strait moreover it has a remarkable significance for the economic activity of the riparian countries russia s most significant port in terms of freight turnover novorossijsk is located in the northeastern part of the black sea other significant ports of the black sea are tuapse and taman in russia odesa in ukraine constanța in romania varna and burgas in bulgaria samsun and filyos in turkey batumi in georgia these ports produce intense ship traffic between themselves as well as between them and the other parts of the world ocean via the bosphorus strait besides since hydrocarbon petroleum fields were found several offshore drilling platforms are present e g karkinit platform to the west of the crimean peninsula or gloria platform off the romanian coast three underwater gas pipelines are located on the bottom of the black sea first the blue stream pipeline connects the terminals in arkhipo osipovka russia and dursu turkey second a pipeline goes along the russian coast between dzhubga and sochi finally the turkstream pipeline was recently launched connecting the terminals located in the vicinity of anapa russia and kiyiköy turkey last but not least the black sea s coasts are a popular tourist destination the most remarkable resort areas are located e g close to anapa gelendzhik and sochi in russia batumi in georgia and varna in bulgaria therefore information on wind waves in the black sea in general and its coastal areas in particular is of high importance and interest for science industry and society following these needs numerous studies of this phenomenon were implemented during recent years the majority of them were carried out using numerical modelling based on meteorological reanalyses since they are found to be a modern reliable and adequate method akpınar et al 2012 akpinar and de león 2016 rusu 2016 research dealing with wind waves in the black sea is usually devoted to the peculiarities of waves and wind distribution in the entire sea their results are mainly focused on the spatial distribution of average and extreme wave parameters and its temporal variability various methods and materials are applied during such studies for example arkhipkin et al 2014 obtained a database of the wind wave parameters using the numerical model swan booij et al 1999 ris et al 1999 which was forced by wind data from the ncep ncar reanalysis kalnay et al 1996 for the period between 1949 and 2010 the model output was validated against satellite altimetry data kovzova et al 2006 used the same reanalysis to create a handbook on wind and wave parameters for the entire black sea this modelling was performed on a rectangular computational grid the black sea was divided into five regions for each region typical values of wind and wave parameters were assessed akpinar et al 2016 also used the swan model but it was run on a finer grid based on the gebco bathymetry the results were validated against in situ buoy measurements divinsky and kosyan 2017 used another model namely the dhi mike 21 sw to calculate wind wave parameters on an unstructured grid forced by the era interim reanalysis for the period from 1979 until 2015 data from multiple sources buoys a moored adcp string recorders and visual observations at offshore platforms and satellite measurements were used for calibration shokurov et al 2016 assessed the quality of results produced by the wam model forced with data from mesoscale atmospheric models mm5 and wrf their study was limited to the southern coastal area of the crimean peninsula wave measurements performed at katziveli were used for validation onea and rusu 2017 performed their study using data on wind waves obtained directly from the era interim reanalysis dee et al 2011 and corresponding to several points located along the perimeter of the black sea a similar approach but applied for the study of wind and wave parameters along shipping routes is used in rusu et al 2018 aydoğan and ayat 2018 focused their study on the spatial distribution of their multiannual trends the spatial variability of long term trends of wave heights in the coastal areas of the black sea was described by akpınar and bingölbali 2016 according to their results these trends are either negligible or weak extreme storm waves their spatial and temporal distribution long term trends and synoptic background are also of high interest several studies focused on the analysis of direct measurements or modelling results in a specific location or area thus bilyay et al 2011 analyzed wave measurements performed for the construction of a port near filyos a town in the southwestern area of the black sea myslenkov et al 2016 analyzed the quality of modelling results obtained during modelling experiments forced with ncep cfsr and wrf arw winds regarding the northeastern part of the black sea surkova et al 2013 polonsky et al 2014 and kislov et al 2016 studied the relationship between the atmospheric circulation patterns and corresponding storm waves valchev et al 2012 zăinescu et al 2017 and galabov et al 2018 examined long term trends of storminess in the western part of the black sea and close to the danube delta as well as their relation to teleconnection patterns in november 2007 a severe storm occurred to the south of the crimean peninsula and close to the kerch strait during this storm several vessels crashed which led to the pollution of marine and coastal environments with oil and other chemical products bukhanovskij et al 2009 studied the meteorological background of this storm while the ecological consequences were discussed in several studies e g matishov et al 2013 among others dan et al 2009 and trifonova et al 2012 described the effects of wind waves on erosion accretion and sediment transport these studies were focused on the danube delta and the western black sea respectively as the coast are strongly affected by wave induced impacts rusu 2009b described a study of the wave current interaction at the danube delta anton et al 2019 performed a case study devoted to the features of waves off the coast of magnalia romania several studies focused on the interaction of waves with artificial objects such as piers and breakwaters e g alekseev et al 2013 an essential application of wind waves is the extraction of wave energy numerical experiments can give comprehensive data for the assessment of wave energy recourses regarding the black sea numerous papers showed results of wave energy resources studies and its possible use rusu 2009a akpınar and kömürcü 2012 akpınar and kömürcü 2013 citiroglu and okur 2014 rusu 2015 akpınar et al 2019 in our study we assess the spatial and seasonal variability of significant wave heights swh wave lengths wl and mean absolute wave period tm02 wp the computations were carried out on an unstructured computational grid with resolution up to 200 m in the coastal areas seasonal and total distributions of maximal and average values of these parameters are assessed over the entire basin twelve key locations in the nearshore areas which as we believe present specific interest for science industry transport and society were selected for a more comprehensive analysis we were motivated by the fact that there are no detailed studies of wind wave statistics along the whole black sea coast based on the swan model and the ncep cfsr reanalysis using a high resolution unstructured computational grid thus bingölbali et al 2019 used a downscaling approach to assess the wind waves statistics but their study area was limited to the southwestern area of the black sea rusu et al 2018 analyzed the wind and wave conditions at locations along the coast of the sea and some offshore points however regarding the waves they evaluated only the swh parameter akpınar and bingölbali 2016 assessed data corresponding to coastal areas but the focus of their study was on long term trends of swh and wind speeds 2 data and methods any study of wind waves carried out using numerical models requires four following components information on wind speed and direction covering the area of interest a computational grid containing information on the water depths a numerical wave model and results of instrumental wave observations to validate the model output in this study we used an unstructured computation grid wind data from the ncep cfsr and ncep cfsv2 reanalyses the swan wave model and three types of wave measurements performed in situ by a laser level sensor a buoy and remote satellite observations we will discuss these data and methods in detail in the following sections 2 1 wind data the numerical experiment was forced with data on the wind speed and direction at 10 m above the sea surface this data was acquired from the ncep cfsr reanalysis saha et al 2010 for the period between 1979 and 2010 and from the ncep cfsv2 reanalysis saha et al 2014 for the period between 2011 and 2016 the timestep of this data is 1 h it has a spatial resolution of 0 3 in both latitudinal and longitudinal direction comparisons of different reanalyses van vledder and akpınar 2015 akpinar and de león 2016 demonstrated that the ncep cfsr reanalysis turned out to be the most preferable one to model extreme wind waves on the black sea among others myslenkov et al 2016 akpınar et al 2016 and bingölbali et al 2019 used this reanalysis to study wind waves in the black sea 2 2 bathymetry and computational grid a specific feature of the black sea is its coastal and bottom topography their comprehensive description can be found in ignatov 2007 we will provide here a brief description of its main characteristics the coastline of the northwestern and northern part of the sea as well as the western crimean coast is generally plain the deltas of major rivers running into the black sea danube dnieper dniester are also located on the northern part of the shoreline the coastline of the southern part of the crimean peninsula as well as the eastern southern and southwestern coasts of the sea are mountainous except the kolkhida lowland in the southeastern part of the black sea the coasts are mostly abrasive in mountainous areas and accumulative in plain and lowland areas the black sea shelf extends till depths of 200 m and has a diverse morphology it is most expressed in the northwestern part of the black sea whereas in many other areas the shelf width does not exceed 10 km the narrowest shelf is observed along the mountainous coasts of the black sea ignatov 2007 subdivides the black sea shelf into 7 regions bulgarian near bosporus northwestern crimean kerch taman caucasian east anatolian and west anatolian the principal characteristics of these areas are given in table 1 the shelf is followed by a relatively steep continental slope and an abyssal plain with maximal depths exceeding 2200 m there are two types of computational grids commonly used in modelling studies of wind waves rectangular and unstructured ones rectangular grids allow to perform faster computations but their resolution is constant therefore detailed data on wave parameters in coastal areas can be acquired either using a single high resolution mesh or using multiple nested meshes both options lead to increasing of computational time another option is to use unstructured triangular computational grids in such grids the density of the nodes can be customized thus one can obtain high resolution results concerning a specific region of interest during a single model run general concepts related to the generation and application of unstructured grids were described by zijlema 2010 dietrich et al 2011 and dietrich et al 2012 in this study we applied an unstructured grid created using the sms aquaveo software the grid is based on digitized nautical maps of the entire black sea and its coastal areas these maps contain isolines corresponding to the shoreline and depths of 5 10 20 50 100 200 300 500 1000 1500 and 2000 m as well as depth values at selected individual locations afterwards the grid itself was created using the paving method the initial distance between the points located along the coast was set to 500 m the grid resolution linearly decreases towards the offshore areas to reach 15 km thus the grid resolution depends only from the offshore distance finally grid nodes were added manually at areas of specific interest increasing the resolution there till 200 m the grid contains 42 284 nodes and 77 036 elements fig 1 the model output grid is equivalent to the computational grid 2 3 model setup in this study we used the third generation swan wind wave model version 41 10 the spectral directional resolution was set to 5 in frequency space there were 38 logarithmically distributed discrete frequencies between 0 03 and 1 hz gen3 mode was applied exponential wave growth was parametrized according to komen et al 1984 bottom friction was described according to the jonswap formulation hasselmann et al 1973 the processes of refraction and diffraction whitecapping quadruplets triad wave interactions and bottom friction were considered the timestep of the computations was 30 min whereas the results were recorded to output files every 3 h the computations were performed continuously for every year to avoid gaps caused by model heat up the computations for each year except for 1979 started at midnight of december 29th of the previous year thus there were 3 days which corresponds to 144 computational time steps for the model to reach adequate performance 2 4 model validation the importance of model validation is crucial since it is the only reliable method to assess the adequacy of the model output and avoid unrealistic results results of trusted instrumental measurements are needed to perform the validation in this study we use various types of such data results of in situ wave measurements in the coastal area of the black sea performed by a laser level sensor and a buoy and remote satellite observations during validation we compared first of all swh values since it is the only parameter available from all four datasets modelling results laser level measurements buoy measurements and satellite altimetry in the case of the buoy measurements we also compared wp and wave directions we will first provide brief technical descriptions of each dataset a discussion on the statistical validation parameters is given afterwards in section 2 4 4 2 4 1 laser level sensor data to assess model performance in shallow water conditions data of instrumental swh measurements carried out in the harbour of novorossijsk port were used for these measurements a riegl ld90 3200hip laser level meter was applied which was mounted at the end of a 1 km long pier the accuracy of the laser level varies between 25 and 75 mm depending on the environmental conditions and its resolution is 2 mm the water depth at the installation point is 20 m the timestep of these measurements was 15 20 min myslenkov and chernyshova 2016 described these measurements in more details measurements corresponding to the model output timestep were extracted from the initial dataset data for the period from 2010 until 2012 was selected for validation which corresponds to 8103 data values the comparison of measured and modelled swh values is shown on a scatter diagram fig 2 and a timeseries plot for the year 2010 fig 3 a trend to underestimate swh values is observed on the scatter diagram however the timeseries show that this trend is mostly due to calmer months between may and september when typical values of measured swh are around 0 5 m and only seldom exceed 1 m it means that the model s uncertainties increase in calmer conditions in other seasons almost all storms are represented adequately by the model 2 4 2 wave buoy data buoy measurements were performed by a datawell wave buoy installed off the city of gelendzhik on the northeastern coast of the black sea the offshore distance of the buoy is 7 km the water depth at the installation point is 85 m the buoy was installed within the nato tu waves project and operated with several interruptions from july 1996 until december 2003 the default timestep of the measurements was 3 h during storms it increased till 1 h 10 126 pairs of measured and modelled significant wave height values were used for validation a detailed description of the applied data is given in bukhanovskij et al 2000 the comparison of these values is illustrated on a scatter diagram fig 4 and a timeseries plot for the year 1997 fig 5 figs 5 and 6 show a quite good agreement between the model and the buoy measurements the modelled significant wave height values may be somewhat lower than the measured ones at the same time all individual storms recorded by the buoy are represented by the model as well besides swh the buoy measures wave periods and directions as well the comparison of modelled and measured wp values is illustrated on a scatter diagram fig 6 and a timeseries plot for the year 1997 fig 7 these figures show a quite good agreement between the wp values obtained during instrumental measurements and modelling experiments the model seems to slightly underestimate wp between may and september more detailed parameters of the wp validation will be given in section 2 4 4 fig 8 shows the comparison of wave directions measured by the buoy and calculated by the model no systematical shifts can be noted regarding the comparison however a higher variance is observed in case of buoy data especially during the stormy months between october and january 2 4 3 satellite altimeter data data obtained with the altika altimeter installed on the saral satellite steunou et al 2015 was used as another source to validate the modelling results as shown by previous studies the data quality of this altimeter is better if compared to similar results acquired by e g envisat or jason 1 and jason 2 satellites janssen et al 2007 jayaram et al 2015 compared data on wave height and wind speed obtained with the altika altimeter with buoys and concluded that for the wave heights the standard deviation is 0 21 m and the bias is 0 04 m for the wind speed these values are 1 75 m s and 0 25 m s respectively altimeter data on the significant wave height have an approximately 7 km spatial resolution and are available via the rads http rads tudelft nl rads rads shtml data corresponding to the period from march 15th 2013 until december 31st 2016 was used for validation according to the principles described by abdalla et al 2011 the following data was rejected from the validation process values with a standard deviation of the altimeter significant wave height exceeding 0 4 m values with swh lower than 0 3 m values with distance to the shore closer than 10 km moreover significant wave heights from the altimeter were compared with modelling results for grid points located not more than 8 km and 1 h from the place and time the satellite observation was made thus 61 289 data pairs were selected for validation figs 9 and 10 fig 10 shows a good agreement between measured and modelled significant wave height values the linear approximation in this case is similar to the one obtained for in situ buoy observations 2 4 4 seasonal variability in the validation parameters for comparisons against each data set following statistical parameters were calculated the bias b i a s 1 n i 1 n m o d i o b s i the mean absolute error m a e 1 n i 1 n m o d i o b s i the root mean square error r m s e 1 n i 1 n m o d i o b s i 2 the scatter index s i r m s e 1 2 i 1 n m o d i o b s i the correlation coefficient r 1 n 1 i 1 n m o d i m o d σ m o d o b s i o b s σ o b s where mod and obs are the modelled and observed swh or wp values σ m o d and σ o b s are their standard deviations respectively these parameters were calculated for the entire available datasets and each month separately their seasonal variability is shown on figs 11 and 12 their monthly averaged and total values are also given in appendix a table a 1 and a 2 regarding swh values the following features can be observed on fig 11 and table a 1 the correlation coefficient r is commonly higher if we compare modelled data against satellite measurements this seems to happen because the volume of satellite data is approx 6 8 times larger than the volume of each other dataset moreover satellite data are located all across the black sea and not in a single point next to its coast monthly r values vary from 0 77 in may to 0 89 in september on the other hand r values corresponding to buoy and laser level measurements have a well pronounced intra annual variability thus r for laser level measurements varies from 0 39 in july to 0 86 in november the same values for buoy measurements vary from 0 51 in august to 0 80 in april and 0 81 in june overall larger r of in situ measurements is observed from october until april whereas in late spring summer and early autumn their values tend to decrease the si for satellite data which varies from 0 32 to 0 38 is lower than this index for in situ measurements for all months moreover highest si values calculated using the in situ data up to 0 76 m for the case of laser level are observed between july and september at the same time when minimal r values were found the differences in the bias mae and rmse calculated for various data sources are not that expressed as in the case of r and si average monthly bias values are always below 0 which means that modelling results systematically underestimate observations some conclusions can be made from the above described results the general slight underestimation of modelled swh which is most pronounced when comparing modelling results with satellite measurements can be explained by a certain underestimation of the wind speed by the reanalysis itself it is a common problem reported within others by akpınar et al 2012 and arkhipkin et al 2014 furthermore the reanalysis often does not represent adequately enough local wind effects caused by orography such as mountain valley circulations and bora winds this issue is best observed in the comparison of modelled results with in situ nearshore measurements especially the laser level thus in summer the mean monthly bias and r values are minimal because local winds mainly govern the wave generation in this season myslenkov and chernyshova 2016 showed that these calm months contribute significantly to the weak correlation in other seasons higher swh values in the region where in situ observations were carried out may be caused not only by the prevailing atmospheric circulation but also by strong bora winds alpers et al 2011 gavrikov and ivanov 2015 such winds are not always represented by the reanalysis but can generate waves with swh up to 2 5 m toropov et al 2012 in case of the wave periods no seasonal variability of r can be found its values vary between 0 6 in august and 0 84 in february the only parameter with an expressed intra annual variability is the bias which drops to values below 0 4 s in the period between may and september in contrast in other months it varies between 0 21 and 0 10 s it is due to the already mentioned underestimation of wp values during the warm season finally we can compare our validation parameters with those obtained in some other similar research for example divinsky and kosyan 2017 also used an unstructured computational grid and validated their model output using several data sources in situ adcp measurements wave buoys string wave recorders and satellite altimetry akpınar and bingölbali 2016 in their study used the same model and wind forcing as we did our validation parameters generally agree with those published in the mentioned studies 3 results and discussion 3 1 offshore areas to demonstrate some features of the wind wave climate of the entire black sea we will describe the distribution of total and seasonal 1 1 in this paper seasons are defined as follows winter december january and february spring march april and may summer june july and august autumn september october and november swh wl and wp maxima and means produced by the model figs 13 15 shows the distribution of annual maxima according to our results the highest swh in the black sea are observed in the southwestern area of the sea where they exceed 8 5 m two other areas with swh exceeding 8 m are found one spreading from the southeastern coasts of the crimean peninsula towards the northeastern coast of the sea between anapa and novorossijsk in russia and another located in the southeastern part of the sea maximal swh decrease around the coasts of the sea and in its shallow northwestern area the distributions of annual wl and wp maxima look quite similar moreover areas with wl and wp maxima in general coincide with those where swh maxima are observed wl and wp maxima are found in the southeastern part of the sea and a relatively narrow area adjacent to its southwestern coast to the east of the bosphorus wl maxima in these areas exceed 160 and 150 m respectively wp maxima 10 5 s typical values of wl and wp maxima on the remaining areas of the sea vary between 80 and 140 m and 8 10 s respectively the seasonal variability of swh wl and wp maxima can be seen on figs 16 18 absolute swh maxima correspond to winter in this season they exceed 8 5 m in the southwestern part of the sea close to the bosphorus at the same time another area with swh maxima is observed in the eastern part of the sea where this parameter exceeds 8 0 m both these areas are observed in the total distribution of the swh maxima as well in spring swh maxima slightly decrease and do not exceed 7 5 m another clearly expressed area with swh maxima appears close to the southwestern coast of the crimean peninsula in summer the storminess is weaker therefore swh maxima in this season are the lowest compared to other seasons they exceed 6 m only in several compact areas in the southwestern part of the sea on the bigger part of the remaining black sea swh maxima in summer are below 5 0 m finally in autumn storminess intensifies and swh maxima exceed 8 0 m again however in this season the area with such values spreads along the southern coasts of the crimean and taman peninsulas which makes a difference between the distribution of this parameter in winter and autumn wl maxima are observed in autumn in the southeastern part of the black sea fig 17d they exceed 160 m in this case in other seasons higher values of wl maxima are observed in winter and spring when they may be over 150 m long such wl maxima correspond to areas in the southwest and southeast of the sea in winter and in the southeast only in spring in summer wl maxima do not exceed 130 m the spatial distribution of wp maxima in all seasons is similar to that of the wl maxima fig 18 the most pronounced area with highest wp is observed in the southeastern part of the sea in autumn in this case wp maxima exceed 10 5 s in winter and spring wp maxima are usually somewhat lower between 10 0 and 10 5 s finally in summer wp maxima do not exceed 9 5 s except a compact area close to the eastern shore of the black sea the distributions of annual swh wl and wp means are shown on figs 19 21 annual swh means do not exceed 1 1 m and their highest values are found in the southwestern part of the black sea it means that this region is generally more affected by higher waves a finding shown earlier by arkhipkin et al 2014 in terms of the total duration of waves with swh exceeding 4 m on the bigger part of the remaining black sea annual swh means are between 0 8 and 1 0 m lower annual swh means correspond to southeastern and northwestern marginal areas of the sea generally annual swh means decrease towards the coasts regarding the nearshore areas highest swh means correspond to the southwestern coasts of the sea as well as to some areas on the western and southern coast the spatial pattern of annual wl and wp means distribution is quite similar figs 20 and 21 these parameters increase southwards and reach their highest values along the southeastern coast of the black sea in these areas wl and wp means exceed 22 m and 4 0 s correspondingly in the central areas of the sea annual wl and wp means are somewhat lower 18 22 m and 3 6 4 0 s correspondingly a decrease of these parameters is best observed in the shallow northwestern area of the black sea where minimal annual wl and wp means are observed below 8 m and 2 8 s correspondingly unlike the case of swh maxima the spatial pattern of mean swh distribution remains nearly the same in all seasons fig 22 the most expressed swh means are found in the southwestern part of the black sea with values ranging from 1 3 to 1 4 m in winter till 0 7 0 8 in summer consequently the highest swh averages in the nearshore areas correspond to winter in this season average swh exceed 1 0 m along the southwestern western and northeastern coasts of the sea the increase of average swh from the shoreline towards the high seas is most expressed in winter along the northwestern western and southwestern coasts of the black sea regarding the wl and wp means their highest values are also observed in winter figs 23 and 24 on the bigger part of the sea they exceed 26 m and 4 4 s but their highest values correspond to a compact area located to the northwest of sinop where they exceed 28 m and 4 6 s lowest wl and wp means in winter correspond to the northwestern part of the black sea where their values are below 12 m and 3 2 s respectively this spatial pattern remains nearly unchanged in spring and autumn but the highest values decrease till 20 22 m and 24 26 s in spring in summer average wl and wp are minimal and exceed 16 m and 3 6 s along the southern coasts of the sea 3 2 coastal areas an advantage of the unstructured computational grid used in this study is the possibility to obtain high definition data for the coastal areas in this section we will describe the results based on analysis of timeseries of wind wave parameters for 12 points located in the coastal areas of the black sea the kerch strait gelendzhik sochi hopa giresun sinop zonguldak bosphorus galata gloria the karkinit platform and katziveli fig 25 table 2 these points were selected because they are of high interest for scientific or industrial purposes thus long time wave observations were carried out at sinop hopa gelendzhik katziveli the karkinit platform and gloria within the nato tu waves project furthermore scientific investigations in the nearshore areas are continuously carried out by research institutions located at gelendzhik katziveli and galata several other locations have an expressed transportation significance since they are located close to ports e g sochi giresun and sinop and on intense shipping routes bosphorus and kerch strait a similar criterion for selecting research locations was used by rusu et al 2018 at these points data from a grid node located 2 6 km offshore was selected for further analysis such a distance was selected to take into account the wave energy generated by winds blowing from the shore if they occur and are represented by the reanalysis an exception was made for the stations corresponding to kerch strait karkinit platform gloria and galata despite these 4 stations are located rather far away offshore 14 50 km their wave conditions still may be affected by relatively small depths 22 43 m generally the water depth at selected locations varies from 22 to 97 m examples of model performance in nearshore areas can be observed on figs 26 and 27 which show the distribution of maximal wave parameters around the points in kerch strait and gelendzhik the plotted fields are smooth and have no outbursts data corresponding to the selected locations adequately represents the wave parameters in the adjacent areas moreover the interaction of wave fields with the complex coastal shoreline e g in the entrance of the kerch strait and bays located in novorossijsk and gelendzhik is observed as well however such maps are not the best way to represent long term data series corresponding to a single location therefore in order to describe the typical wave climate features in these points we will discuss the wave roses which show the joint distribution of swh and wave direction and box and whisker diagrams of swh wl and wp designed for the entire dataset and each of the seasons the distribution of the predominant wave directions shown on fig 28 is usually defined by the location of the study point relatively to the shoreline at several points which are located closer to the shoreline or at relatively small depths the bigger part of waves comes from directions perpendicular the coast or close to such directions which may be caused by refraction and predominant winds this is best observed in cases of bosphorus fig 28 a galata fig 28 b and giresun fig 28 d thus in bosphorus 34 7 of the waves correspond to the ne direction 23 3 correspond to nne and 16 9 correspond to ene which gives nearly 75 altogether in galata the parts of waves coming from e and ene are nearly equal 21 9 and 22 0 correspondingly beside them remarkable are ese ne and se directions each having 10 9 11 8 of waves in giresun most expressed are the nnw 30 5 and nw 27 5 directions all other have less than 15 of waves the diversity of wave directions is minimal in hopa fig 28 f where 53 9 of waves correspond to wnw 19 3 to nw and 10 7 to w making 83 9 altogether this can be explained by constant winds blowing from the seaside at this point furthermore the wind patterns here are governed by the orographic conditions the coast is surrounded by mountains which block winds blowing from the shore on the other hand wave directions are most diverse at points located further away from the coast such are gloria fig 28 e and the karkinit platform fig 28 g thus in gloria there are three predominant wave directions s 12 9 ene 12 6 and ne 12 0 altogether they constitute only 37 5 of waves the remaining part is distributed among other directions at the karkinit platform the predominant directions are sw 11 8 ssw 10 5 and ene 8 3 the least amount of waves come from se 2 2 due to the fine resolution of the computational grid and the reanalysis quality it is sometimes possible to reproduce typical wave features caused by local winds this is most evident in the case of gelendzhik fig 28 c where a local peak corresponding to ne and ene is observed 9 7 of waves there come from these directions this is the effect of the bora a strong cold katabatic wind typical for the northeastern coastal areas of the black sea especially for the shoreline between novorossijsk and gelendzhik such winds usually occur during autumn and winter if they are associated with negative air temperatures they can lead to ice accretion on vessels and coastal constructions which is the most dangerous consequence of the bora gavrikov and ivanov 2015 a detailed numerical study of such winds and associated waves was performed by toropov et al 2012 at several points which are located close to the shoreline there are two expressed peaks in the distribution of wave directions thus in katziveli fig 28 h at the very south of the crimean peninsula 23 8 of waves come from e and 25 3 from wsw and w only 13 4 of waves come from sse s and ssw which are the directions relatively perpendicular to the coastline this can be due to the fact that waves here are generated by winds blowing along the coastline and that the effects of refraction are still not fully displayed because of the considerable depth 61 m a similar effect is observed at sochi fig 28 k where 22 2 of waves come from sse 23 7 from w and 17 1 from wsw the distribution of swh wl and wp and their seasonal variability is better observed on the box and whisker plots 2 2 box and whisker plots for this study were designed in the following way the lower and upper limits of the boxes represent the 25 and 75 percentile of the data correspondingly the lines inside the boxes indicate the median 50 percentile of the data the lower and upper whiskers represent the 5 and 95 percentiles correspondingly the dots indicate individual data values lying beyond the 5 95 percentiles interval fig 29 shows such a plot for all values of the swh without seasonality swh maxima exceed 6 m at six studied locations gelendzhik 6 7 m kerch strait 6 9 m katziveli 7 1 m karkinit platform 6 6 m bosphorus 7 1 m and sinop 6 3 m which corresponds to the swh maxima pattern shown on fig 13 at other locations swh maxima are between 4 7 m at sochi and 5 5 m at zonguldak the 95th percentile of swh exceeds 2 m only at bosphorus 2 1 m at other points this value is below 2 m with a minimal record at giresun 1 4 m a remarkable feature is that despite equal swh maxima are observed at katziveli and bosphorus 7 1 m in both cases the 95th percentiles values are significantly different 2 1 m at bosphorus and 1 7 at katziveli this demonstrates that higher waves are more frequent at bosphorus and in the surrounding area of the black sea which was demonstrated earlier by arkhipkin et al 2014 the seasonal swh variability at the study points can be observed on fig 30 highest swh values are achieved in winter and autumn in winter storminess in terms of maximal significant wave heights and their 95th percentile is slightly higher in the southwestern and southern areas of the black sea thus at bosphorus the highest swh value and their 95th percentile are 7 1 and 2 8 m and in sinop 6 3 and 2 4 m correspondingly on the other hand in autumn highest swh values correspond to points located in the northern and northeastern parts of the sea gelendzhik kerch strait katziveli and karkinit platform however highest 95th percentile values are found at points located mainly in other regions of the sea bosphorus 2 2 m sinop 2 0 m karkinit 2 0 m and gloria 2 0 m summer is the calmest season on the black sea swh maxima exceed 4 m only at four points bosphorus 5 7 m sinop 5 2 m katziveli 4 2 m and zonguldak 4 0 m lowest swh maxima are located along the western coast of the black sea these values in gloria and galata are 2 7 and 2 6 m correspondingly the swh maxima in sochi is somewhat lower 2 5 m however in terms of the 95th percentile calmest is the northern and northeastern area of the sea where the 95th percentile is below 1 m e g at sochi 0 8 m gelendzhik 0 9 m and katziveli 0 9 m the total distribution of the wl values is shown on fig 31 wl maxima correspond to hopa 154 m sochi 150 m gelendzhik 145 m and bosphorus 143 m the 95th percentiles are highest along the southern coast of the black sea at bosphorus 56 7 m zonguldak 57 3 m sinop 51 6 m and giresun 52 0 m and on the northeastern coast in gelendzhik 51 1 m on the other hand in terms of wl maxima and their 95th percentile the waves are shortest in the northwestern area of the sea and along its western coast thus at the karkinit platform the maximal wave length is 102 4 m and the 95th percentile is 35 9 m at gloria these values are 109 4 m and 41 5 m at galata 109 2 m and 41 1 m correspondingly such a difference may be caused by the considerable fetch length which reaches the southern and eastern coasts of the black sea on the one hand and relatively small depths of the northwestern black sea shelf on the other the seasonal distribution of wl is shown on fig 32 a significant decrease is observed in summer in this season highest wl values are observed along the eastern and southeastern coasts of the black sea in sochi 119 4 m hopa 117 5 m and giresun 112 8 m the 95th percentile of wave lengths in summer is below 40 m at all stations except zonguldak 41 1 m moreover kerch strait is the only location where this parameter is below 20 m 18 5 m the distribution of wp is relatively uniform along the coasts of the black sea fig 33 wp maxima are between 9 0 s in gloria and 10 7 s in sochi the 95th percentile of wave periods is higher along the southern coasts of the sea where it is between 6 5 s at bosphorus and 6 1 s in hopa the minimal value of the 95th percentile of wp corresponds to the karkinit platform 5 2 s similar to the case of significant wave heights and wave lengths wave periods are lower in summer and higher in winter and autumn fig 34 thus in summer maximal wave periods do not exceed 10 s and their 95th percentile is between 4 s and 6 s at all stations except kerch strait 5 5 s an increase of median wp values relative to other regions is observed at points corresponding to the southern coast of the sea bosphorus zonguldak sinop and giresun this tendency is most evident in summer and autumn and it agrees with the location of highest wp means along this part of the shoreline compare with figs 21 and 24 4 conclusions this study shows the results of a 38 years long wind wave hindcast covering the period from 1979 until 2016 for the black sea which was carried out using the swan wind wave model an original unstructured computational grid and ncep cfsr and ncep cfsv2 wind data as forcing modelling results were validated against wave buoy measurements and remote satellite observations both comparisons showed satisfactory results typical values of the average monthly bias were between 0 and 0 2 m of the correlation coefficient between 0 8 and 0 9 to show the features of the wave climate for the entire black sea we have described spatial distributions of annual and seasonal swh wl and wp maxima and means maximal values of significant wave heights exceed 8 5 m and correspond to the southwestern area of the black sea areas with maximal wave lengths and periods are located in the eastern part of the sea these values there exceed 160 m and 10 5 s correspondingly annual swh means exceed 1 m in the southwestern area of the sea while annual wl and wp means reach 24 m and 4 2 s in areas along the southern coast of the black sea generally such spatial patterns match well with previous results obtained in similar studies e g by rusu et al 2018 and akpınar and bingölbali 2016 to assess the features of wind wave climate in the coastal areas total and seasonal timeseries corresponding to 12 points located along the coasts of the black sea were studied maximal values of significant wave heights over 6 m correspond to areas along the northeastern and southwestern coasts of the black sea and the southern coast of the crimean peninsula maximal values of wave lengths and wave periods over 140 m and 10 s correspondingly are located along the northeastern and southern coasts of the black sea the data described in this paper are expected to be used in further research of long term variability of wind wave parameters storminess trends and coastal transformation caused by wave action in the black sea credit authorship contribution statement

21365,this study is dedicated to the wind waves parameters distribution on the black sea with a focus on coastal areas wind waves were simulated using the swan model forced by the ncep cfsr and ncep cfsv2 reanalyses for the period 1979 2016 an unstructured computational grid with resolution varying between 15 km and 200 m was applied modelling results were validated against in situ and remote sensing data for the entire sea distributions of total and seasonal maxima of wave parameters are analyzed maximal significant wave heights exceed 8 5 m and are found in the southwestern areas of the sea maximal wave lengths over 160 m and periods over 10 5 s are located in the eastern part of the sea total and seasonal time series extracted for 12 locations along the coasts of the black sea were studied maximal values of significant wave heights over 6 m correspond to areas along the northeastern and southwestern coasts of the black sea and the southern coast of the crimean peninsula maximal

manifestation of the ocean atmosphere interaction being a mean to transfer energy from the wind to the water surface they significantly influence the state of the upper ocean layer leading to intensified vertical mixing and modifying other physical fields such as currents surface roughness and albedo in nearshore areas wind waves also interact with the topography resulting in the shoreline changes sediment transport and rip currents extreme wind waves occurring during storms can cause significant damage to coastal and offshore engineering structures such as drilling platforms masts pipelines piers berths and beaches moreover such catastrophic events may lead to shipwrecks resulting in pollution of surrounding waters and coastal areas and elimination of seaweed fish marine mammals and birds the black sea is an enclosed sea and has minimal interaction with the world ocean via the bosphorus strait moreover it has a remarkable significance for the economic activity of the riparian countries russia s most significant port in terms of freight turnover novorossijsk is located in the northeastern part of the black sea other significant ports of the black sea are tuapse and taman in russia odesa in ukraine constanța in romania varna and burgas in bulgaria samsun and filyos in turkey batumi in georgia these ports produce intense ship traffic between themselves as well as between them and the other parts of the world ocean via the bosphorus strait besides since hydrocarbon petroleum fields were found several offshore drilling platforms are present e g karkinit platform to the west of the crimean peninsula or gloria platform off the romanian coast three underwater gas pipelines are located on the bottom of the black sea first the blue stream pipeline connects the terminals in arkhipo osipovka russia and dursu turkey second a pipeline goes along the russian coast between dzhubga and sochi finally the turkstream pipeline was recently launched connecting the terminals located in the vicinity of anapa russia and kiyiköy turkey last but not least the black sea s coasts are a popular tourist destination the most remarkable resort areas are located e g close to anapa gelendzhik and sochi in russia batumi in georgia and varna in bulgaria therefore information on wind waves in the black sea in general and its coastal areas in particular is of high importance and interest for science industry and society following these needs numerous studies of this phenomenon were implemented during recent years the majority of them were carried out using numerical modelling based on meteorological reanalyses since they are found to be a modern reliable and adequate method akpınar et al 2012 akpinar and de león 2016 rusu 2016 research dealing with wind waves in the black sea is usually devoted to the peculiarities of waves and wind distribution in the entire sea their results are mainly focused on the spatial distribution of average and extreme wave parameters and its temporal variability various methods and materials are applied during such studies for example arkhipkin et al 2014 obtained a database of the wind wave parameters using the numerical model swan booij et al 1999 ris et al 1999 which was forced by wind data from the ncep ncar reanalysis kalnay et al 1996 for the period between 1949 and 2010 the model output was validated against satellite altimetry data kovzova et al 2006 used the same reanalysis to create a handbook on wind and wave parameters for the entire black sea this modelling was performed on a rectangular computational grid the black sea was divided into five regions for each region typical values of wind and wave parameters were assessed akpinar et al 2016 also used the swan model but it was run on a finer grid based on the gebco bathymetry the results were validated against in situ buoy measurements divinsky and kosyan 2017 used another model namely the dhi mike 21 sw to calculate wind wave parameters on an unstructured grid forced by the era interim reanalysis for the period from 1979 until 2015 data from multiple sources buoys a moored adcp string recorders and visual observations at offshore platforms and satellite measurements were used for calibration shokurov et al 2016 assessed the quality of results produced by the wam model forced with data from mesoscale atmospheric models mm5 and wrf their study was limited to the southern coastal area of the crimean peninsula wave measurements performed at katziveli were used for validation onea and rusu 2017 performed their study using data on wind waves obtained directly from the era interim reanalysis dee et al 2011 and corresponding to several points located along the perimeter of the black sea a similar approach but applied for the study of wind and wave parameters along shipping routes is used in rusu et al 2018 aydoğan and ayat 2018 focused their study on the spatial distribution of their multiannual trends the spatial variability of long term trends of wave heights in the coastal areas of the black sea was described by akpınar and bingölbali 2016 according to their results these trends are either negligible or weak extreme storm waves their spatial and temporal distribution long term trends and synoptic background are also of high interest several studies focused on the analysis of direct measurements or modelling results in a specific location or area thus bilyay et al 2011 analyzed wave measurements performed for the construction of a port near filyos a town in the southwestern area of the black sea myslenkov et al 2016 analyzed the quality of modelling results obtained during modelling experiments forced with ncep cfsr and wrf arw winds regarding the northeastern part of the black sea surkova et al 2013 polonsky et al 2014 and kislov et al 2016 studied the relationship between the atmospheric circulation patterns and corresponding storm waves valchev et al 2012 zăinescu et al 2017 and galabov et al 2018 examined long term trends of storminess in the western part of the black sea and close to the danube delta as well as their relation to teleconnection patterns in november 2007 a severe storm occurred to the south of the crimean peninsula and close to the kerch strait during this storm several vessels crashed which led to the pollution of marine and coastal environments with oil and other chemical products bukhanovskij et al 2009 studied the meteorological background of this storm while the ecological consequences were discussed in several studies e g matishov et al 2013 among others dan et al 2009 and trifonova et al 2012 described the effects of wind waves on erosion accretion and sediment transport these studies were focused on the danube delta and the western black sea respectively as the coast are strongly affected by wave induced impacts rusu 2009b described a study of the wave current interaction at the danube delta anton et al 2019 performed a case study devoted to the features of waves off the coast of magnalia romania several studies focused on the interaction of waves with artificial objects such as piers and breakwaters e g alekseev et al 2013 an essential application of wind waves is the extraction of wave energy numerical experiments can give comprehensive data for the assessment of wave energy recourses regarding the black sea numerous papers showed results of wave energy resources studies and its possible use rusu 2009a akpınar and kömürcü 2012 akpınar and kömürcü 2013 citiroglu and okur 2014 rusu 2015 akpınar et al 2019 in our study we assess the spatial and seasonal variability of significant wave heights swh wave lengths wl and mean absolute wave period tm02 wp the computations were carried out on an unstructured computational grid with resolution up to 200 m in the coastal areas seasonal and total distributions of maximal and average values of these parameters are assessed over the entire basin twelve key locations in the nearshore areas which as we believe present specific interest for science industry transport and society were selected for a more comprehensive analysis we were motivated by the fact that there are no detailed studies of wind wave statistics along the whole black sea coast based on the swan model and the ncep cfsr reanalysis using a high resolution unstructured computational grid thus bingölbali et al 2019 used a downscaling approach to assess the wind waves statistics but their study area was limited to the southwestern area of the black sea rusu et al 2018 analyzed the wind and wave conditions at locations along the coast of the sea and some offshore points however regarding the waves they evaluated only the swh parameter akpınar and bingölbali 2016 assessed data corresponding to coastal areas but the focus of their study was on long term trends of swh and wind speeds 2 data and methods any study of wind waves carried out using numerical models requires four following components information on wind speed and direction covering the area of interest a computational grid containing information on the water depths a numerical wave model and results of instrumental wave observations to validate the model output in this study we used an unstructured computation grid wind data from the ncep cfsr and ncep cfsv2 reanalyses the swan wave model and three types of wave measurements performed in situ by a laser level sensor a buoy and remote satellite observations we will discuss these data and methods in detail in the following sections 2 1 wind data the numerical experiment was forced with data on the wind speed and direction at 10 m above the sea surface this data was acquired from the ncep cfsr reanalysis saha et al 2010 for the period between 1979 and 2010 and from the ncep cfsv2 reanalysis saha et al 2014 for the period between 2011 and 2016 the timestep of this data is 1 h it has a spatial resolution of 0 3 in both latitudinal and longitudinal direction comparisons of different reanalyses van vledder and akpınar 2015 akpinar and de león 2016 demonstrated that the ncep cfsr reanalysis turned out to be the most preferable one to model extreme wind waves on the black sea among others myslenkov et al 2016 akpınar et al 2016 and bingölbali et al 2019 used this reanalysis to study wind waves in the black sea 2 2 bathymetry and computational grid a specific feature of the black sea is its coastal and bottom topography their comprehensive description can be found in ignatov 2007 we will provide here a brief description of its main characteristics the coastline of the northwestern and northern part of the sea as well as the western crimean coast is generally plain the deltas of major rivers running into the black sea danube dnieper dniester are also located on the northern part of the shoreline the coastline of the southern part of the crimean peninsula as well as the eastern southern and southwestern coasts of the sea are mountainous except the kolkhida lowland in the southeastern part of the black sea the coasts are mostly abrasive in mountainous areas and accumulative in plain and lowland areas the black sea shelf extends till depths of 200 m and has a diverse morphology it is most expressed in the northwestern part of the black sea whereas in many other areas the shelf width does not exceed 10 km the narrowest shelf is observed along the mountainous coasts of the black sea ignatov 2007 subdivides the black sea shelf into 7 regions bulgarian near bosporus northwestern crimean kerch taman caucasian east anatolian and west anatolian the principal characteristics of these areas are given in table 1 the shelf is followed by a relatively steep continental slope and an abyssal plain with maximal depths exceeding 2200 m there are two types of computational grids commonly used in modelling studies of wind waves rectangular and unstructured ones rectangular grids allow to perform faster computations but their resolution is constant therefore detailed data on wave parameters in coastal areas can be acquired either using a single high resolution mesh or using multiple nested meshes both options lead to increasing of computational time another option is to use unstructured triangular computational grids in such grids the density of the nodes can be customized thus one can obtain high resolution results concerning a specific region of interest during a single model run general concepts related to the generation and application of unstructured grids were described by zijlema 2010 dietrich et al 2011 and dietrich et al 2012 in this study we applied an unstructured grid created using the sms aquaveo software the grid is based on digitized nautical maps of the entire black sea and its coastal areas these maps contain isolines corresponding to the shoreline and depths of 5 10 20 50 100 200 300 500 1000 1500 and 2000 m as well as depth values at selected individual locations afterwards the grid itself was created using the paving method the initial distance between the points located along the coast was set to 500 m the grid resolution linearly decreases towards the offshore areas to reach 15 km thus the grid resolution depends only from the offshore distance finally grid nodes were added manually at areas of specific interest increasing the resolution there till 200 m the grid contains 42 284 nodes and 77 036 elements fig 1 the model output grid is equivalent to the computational grid 2 3 model setup in this study we used the third generation swan wind wave model version 41 10 the spectral directional resolution was set to 5 in frequency space there were 38 logarithmically distributed discrete frequencies between 0 03 and 1 hz gen3 mode was applied exponential wave growth was parametrized according to komen et al 1984 bottom friction was described according to the jonswap formulation hasselmann et al 1973 the processes of refraction and diffraction whitecapping quadruplets triad wave interactions and bottom friction were considered the timestep of the computations was 30 min whereas the results were recorded to output files every 3 h the computations were performed continuously for every year to avoid gaps caused by model heat up the computations for each year except for 1979 started at midnight of december 29th of the previous year thus there were 3 days which corresponds to 144 computational time steps for the model to reach adequate performance 2 4 model validation the importance of model validation is crucial since it is the only reliable method to assess the adequacy of the model output and avoid unrealistic results results of trusted instrumental measurements are needed to perform the validation in this study we use various types of such data results of in situ wave measurements in the coastal area of the black sea performed by a laser level sensor and a buoy and remote satellite observations during validation we compared first of all swh values since it is the only parameter available from all four datasets modelling results laser level measurements buoy measurements and satellite altimetry in the case of the buoy measurements we also compared wp and wave directions we will first provide brief technical descriptions of each dataset a discussion on the statistical validation parameters is given afterwards in section 2 4 4 2 4 1 laser level sensor data to assess model performance in shallow water conditions data of instrumental swh measurements carried out in the harbour of novorossijsk port were used for these measurements a riegl ld90 3200hip laser level meter was applied which was mounted at the end of a 1 km long pier the accuracy of the laser level varies between 25 and 75 mm depending on the environmental conditions and its resolution is 2 mm the water depth at the installation point is 20 m the timestep of these measurements was 15 20 min myslenkov and chernyshova 2016 described these measurements in more details measurements corresponding to the model output timestep were extracted from the initial dataset data for the period from 2010 until 2012 was selected for validation which corresponds to 8103 data values the comparison of measured and modelled swh values is shown on a scatter diagram fig 2 and a timeseries plot for the year 2010 fig 3 a trend to underestimate swh values is observed on the scatter diagram however the timeseries show that this trend is mostly due to calmer months between may and september when typical values of measured swh are around 0 5 m and only seldom exceed 1 m it means that the model s uncertainties increase in calmer conditions in other seasons almost all storms are represented adequately by the model 2 4 2 wave buoy data buoy measurements were performed by a datawell wave buoy installed off the city of gelendzhik on the northeastern coast of the black sea the offshore distance of the buoy is 7 km the water depth at the installation point is 85 m the buoy was installed within the nato tu waves project and operated with several interruptions from july 1996 until december 2003 the default timestep of the measurements was 3 h during storms it increased till 1 h 10 126 pairs of measured and modelled significant wave height values were used for validation a detailed description of the applied data is given in bukhanovskij et al 2000 the comparison of these values is illustrated on a scatter diagram fig 4 and a timeseries plot for the year 1997 fig 5 figs 5 and 6 show a quite good agreement between the model and the buoy measurements the modelled significant wave height values may be somewhat lower than the measured ones at the same time all individual storms recorded by the buoy are represented by the model as well besides swh the buoy measures wave periods and directions as well the comparison of modelled and measured wp values is illustrated on a scatter diagram fig 6 and a timeseries plot for the year 1997 fig 7 these figures show a quite good agreement between the wp values obtained during instrumental measurements and modelling experiments the model seems to slightly underestimate wp between may and september more detailed parameters of the wp validation will be given in section 2 4 4 fig 8 shows the comparison of wave directions measured by the buoy and calculated by the model no systematical shifts can be noted regarding the comparison however a higher variance is observed in case of buoy data especially during the stormy months between october and january 2 4 3 satellite altimeter data data obtained with the altika altimeter installed on the saral satellite steunou et al 2015 was used as another source to validate the modelling results as shown by previous studies the data quality of this altimeter is better if compared to similar results acquired by e g envisat or jason 1 and jason 2 satellites janssen et al 2007 jayaram et al 2015 compared data on wave height and wind speed obtained with the altika altimeter with buoys and concluded that for the wave heights the standard deviation is 0 21 m and the bias is 0 04 m for the wind speed these values are 1 75 m s and 0 25 m s respectively altimeter data on the significant wave height have an approximately 7 km spatial resolution and are available via the rads http rads tudelft nl rads rads shtml data corresponding to the period from march 15th 2013 until december 31st 2016 was used for validation according to the principles described by abdalla et al 2011 the following data was rejected from the validation process values with a standard deviation of the altimeter significant wave height exceeding 0 4 m values with swh lower than 0 3 m values with distance to the shore closer than 10 km moreover significant wave heights from the altimeter were compared with modelling results for grid points located not more than 8 km and 1 h from the place and time the satellite observation was made thus 61 289 data pairs were selected for validation figs 9 and 10 fig 10 shows a good agreement between measured and modelled significant wave height values the linear approximation in this case is similar to the one obtained for in situ buoy observations 2 4 4 seasonal variability in the validation parameters for comparisons against each data set following statistical parameters were calculated the bias b i a s 1 n i 1 n m o d i o b s i the mean absolute error m a e 1 n i 1 n m o d i o b s i the root mean square error r m s e 1 n i 1 n m o d i o b s i 2 the scatter index s i r m s e 1 2 i 1

standard deviations respectively these parameters were calculated for the entire available datasets and each month separately their seasonal variability is shown on figs 11 and 12 their monthly averaged and total values are also given in appendix a table a 1 and a 2 regarding swh values the following features can be observed on fig 11 and table a 1 the correlation coefficient r is commonly higher if we compare modelled data against satellite measurements this seems to happen because the volume of satellite data is approx 6 8 times larger than the volume of each other dataset moreover satellite data are located all across the black sea and not in a single point next to its coast monthly r values vary from 0 77 in may to 0 89 in september on the other hand r values corresponding to buoy and laser level measurements have a well pronounced intra annual variability thus r for laser level measurements varies from 0 39 in july to 0 86 in november the same values for buoy measurements vary from 0 51 in august to 0 80 in april and 0 81 in june overall larger r of in situ measurements is observed from october until april whereas in late spring summer and early autumn their values tend to decrease the si for satellite data which varies from 0 32 to 0 38 is lower than this index for in situ measurements for all months moreover highest si values calculated using the in situ data up to 0 76 m for the case of laser level are observed between july and september at the same time when minimal r values were found the differences in the bias mae and rmse calculated for various data sources are not that expressed as in the case of r and si average monthly bias values are always below 0 which means that modelling results systematically underestimate observations some conclusions can be made from the above described results the general slight underestimation of modelled swh which is most pronounced when comparing modelling results with satellite measurements can be explained by a certain underestimation of the wind speed by the reanalysis itself it is a common problem reported within others by akpınar et al 2012 and arkhipkin et al 2014 furthermore the reanalysis often does not represent adequately enough local wind effects caused by orography such as mountain valley circulations and bora winds this issue is best observed in the comparison of modelled results with in situ nearshore measurements especially the laser level thus in summer the mean monthly bias and r values are minimal because local winds mainly govern the wave generation in this season myslenkov and chernyshova 2016 showed that these calm months contribute significantly to the weak correlation in other seasons higher swh values in the region where in situ observations were carried out may be caused not only by the prevailing atmospheric circulation but also by strong bora winds alpers et al 2011 gavrikov and ivanov 2015 such winds are not always represented by the reanalysis but can generate waves with swh up to 2 5 m toropov et al 2012 in case of the wave periods no seasonal variability of r can be found its values vary between 0 6 in august and 0 84 in february the only parameter with an expressed intra annual variability is the bias which drops to values below 0 4 s in the period between may and september in contrast in other months it varies between 0 21 and 0 10 s it is due to the already mentioned underestimation of wp values during the warm season finally we can compare our validation parameters with those obtained in some other similar research for example divinsky and kosyan 2017 also used an unstructured computational grid and validated their model output using several data sources in situ adcp measurements wave buoys string wave recorders and satellite altimetry akpınar and bingölbali 2016 in their study used the same model and wind forcing as we did our validation parameters generally agree with those published in the mentioned studies 3 results and discussion 3 1 offshore areas to demonstrate some features of the wind wave climate of the entire black sea we will describe the distribution of total and seasonal 1 1 in this paper seasons are defined as follows winter december january and february spring march april and may summer june july and august autumn september october and november swh wl and wp maxima and means produced by the model figs 13 15 shows the distribution of annual maxima according to our results the highest swh in the black sea are observed in the southwestern area of the sea where they exceed 8 5 m two other areas with swh exceeding 8 m are found one spreading from the southeastern coasts of the crimean peninsula towards the northeastern coast of the sea between anapa and novorossijsk in russia and another located in the southeastern part of the sea maximal swh decrease around the coasts of the sea and in its shallow northwestern area the distributions of annual wl and wp maxima look quite similar moreover areas with wl and wp maxima in general coincide with those where swh maxima are observed wl and wp maxima are found in the southeastern part of the sea and a relatively narrow area adjacent to its southwestern coast to the east of the bosphorus wl maxima in these areas exceed 160 and 150 m respectively wp maxima 10 5 s typical values of wl and wp maxima on the remaining areas of the sea vary between 80 and 140 m and 8 10 s respectively the seasonal variability of swh wl and wp maxima can be seen on figs 16 18 absolute swh maxima correspond to winter in this season they exceed 8 5 m in the southwestern part of the sea close to the bosphorus at the same time another area with swh maxima is observed in the eastern part of the sea where this parameter exceeds 8 0 m both these areas are observed in the total distribution of the swh maxima as well in spring swh maxima slightly decrease and do not exceed 7 5 m another clearly expressed area with swh maxima appears close to the southwestern coast of the crimean peninsula in summer the storminess is weaker therefore swh maxima in this season are the lowest compared to other seasons they exceed 6 m only in several compact areas in the southwestern part of the sea on the bigger part of the remaining black sea swh maxima in summer are below 5 0 m finally in autumn storminess intensifies and swh maxima exceed 8 0 m again however in this season the area with such values spreads along the southern coasts of the crimean and taman peninsulas which makes a difference between the distribution of this parameter in winter and autumn wl maxima are observed in autumn in the southeastern part of the black sea fig 17d they exceed 160 m in this case in other seasons higher values of wl maxima are observed in winter and spring when they may be over 150 m long such wl maxima correspond to areas in the southwest and southeast of the sea in winter and in the southeast only in spring in summer wl maxima do not exceed 130 m the spatial distribution of wp maxima in all seasons is similar to that of the wl maxima fig 18 the most pronounced area with highest wp is observed in the southeastern part of the sea in autumn in this case wp maxima exceed 10 5 s in winter and spring wp maxima are usually somewhat lower between 10 0 and 10 5 s finally in summer wp maxima do not exceed 9 5 s except a compact area close to the eastern shore of the black sea the distributions of annual swh wl and wp means are shown on figs 19 21 annual swh means do not exceed 1 1 m and their highest values are found in the southwestern part of the black sea it means that this region is generally more affected by higher waves a finding shown earlier by arkhipkin et al 2014 in terms of the total duration of waves with swh exceeding 4 m on the bigger part of the remaining black sea annual swh means are between 0 8 and 1 0 m lower annual swh means correspond to southeastern and northwestern marginal areas of the sea generally annual swh means decrease towards the coasts regarding the nearshore areas highest swh means correspond to the southwestern coasts of the sea as well as to some areas on the western and southern coast the spatial pattern of annual wl and wp means distribution is quite similar figs 20 and 21 these parameters increase southwards and reach their highest values along the southeastern coast of the black sea in these areas wl and wp means exceed 22 m and 4 0 s correspondingly in the central areas of the sea annual wl and wp means are somewhat lower 18 22 m and 3 6 4 0 s correspondingly a decrease of these parameters is best observed in the shallow northwestern area of the black sea where minimal annual wl and wp means are observed below 8 m and 2 8 s correspondingly unlike the case of swh maxima the spatial pattern of mean swh distribution remains nearly the same in all seasons fig 22 the most expressed swh means are found in the southwestern part of the black sea with values ranging from 1 3 to 1 4 m in winter till 0 7 0 8 in summer consequently the highest swh averages in the nearshore areas correspond to winter in this season average swh exceed 1 0 m along the southwestern western and northeastern coasts of the sea the increase of average swh from the shoreline towards the high seas is most expressed in winter along the northwestern western and southwestern coasts of the black sea regarding the wl and wp means their highest values are also observed in winter figs 23 and 24 on the bigger part of the sea they exceed 26 m and 4 4 s but their highest values correspond to a compact area located to the northwest of sinop where they exceed 28 m and 4 6 s lowest wl and wp means in winter correspond to the northwestern part of the black sea where their values are below 12 m and 3 2 s respectively this spatial pattern remains nearly unchanged in spring and autumn but the highest values decrease till 20 22 m and 24 26 s in spring in summer average wl and wp are minimal and exceed 16 m and 3 6 s along the southern coasts of the sea 3 2 coastal areas an advantage of the unstructured computational grid used in this study is the possibility to obtain high definition data for the coastal areas in this section we will describe the results based on analysis of timeseries of wind wave parameters for 12 points located in the coastal areas of the black sea the kerch strait gelendzhik sochi hopa giresun sinop zonguldak bosphorus galata gloria the karkinit platform and katziveli fig 25 table 2 these points were selected because they are of high interest for scientific or industrial purposes thus long time wave observations were carried out at sinop hopa gelendzhik katziveli the karkinit platform and gloria within the nato tu waves project furthermore scientific investigations in the nearshore areas are continuously carried out by research institutions located at gelendzhik katziveli and galata several other locations have an expressed transportation significance since they are located close to ports e g sochi giresun and sinop and on intense shipping routes bosphorus and kerch strait a similar criterion for selecting research locations was used by rusu et al 2018 at these points data from a grid node located 2 6 km offshore was selected for further analysis such a distance was selected to take into account the wave energy generated by winds blowing from the shore if they occur and are represented by the reanalysis an exception was made for the stations corresponding to kerch strait karkinit platform gloria and galata despite these 4 stations are located rather far away offshore 14 50 km their wave conditions still may be affected by relatively small depths 22 43 m generally the water depth at selected locations varies from 22 to 97 m examples of model performance in nearshore areas can be observed on figs 26 and 27 which show the distribution of maximal wave parameters around the points in kerch strait and gelendzhik the plotted fields are smooth and have no outbursts data corresponding to the selected locations adequately represents the wave parameters in the adjacent areas moreover the interaction of wave fields with the complex coastal shoreline e g in the entrance of the kerch strait and bays located in novorossijsk and gelendzhik is observed as well however such maps are not the best way to represent long term data series corresponding to a single location therefore in order to describe the typical wave climate features in these points we will discuss the wave roses which show the joint distribution of swh and wave direction and box and whisker diagrams of swh wl and wp designed for the entire dataset and each of the seasons the distribution of the predominant wave directions shown on fig 28 is usually defined by the location of the study point relatively to the shoreline at several points which are located closer to the shoreline or at relatively small depths the bigger part of waves comes from directions perpendicular the coast or close to such directions which may be caused by refraction and predominant winds this is best observed in cases of bosphorus fig 28 a galata fig 28 b and giresun fig 28 d thus in bosphorus 34 7 of the waves correspond to the ne direction 23 3 correspond to nne and 16 9 correspond to ene which gives nearly 75 altogether in galata the parts of waves coming from e and ene are nearly equal 21 9 and 22 0 correspondingly beside them remarkable are ese ne and se directions each having 10 9 11 8 of waves in giresun most expressed are the nnw 30 5 and nw 27 5 directions all other have less than 15 of waves the diversity of wave directions is minimal in hopa fig 28 f where 53 9 of waves correspond to wnw 19 3 to nw and 10 7 to w making 83 9 altogether this can be explained by constant winds blowing from the seaside at this point furthermore the wind patterns here are governed by the orographic conditions the coast is surrounded by mountains which block winds blowing from the shore on the other hand wave directions are most diverse at points located further away from the coast such are gloria fig 28 e and the karkinit platform fig 28 g thus in gloria there are three predominant wave directions s 12 9 ene 12 6 and ne 12 0 altogether they constitute only 37 5 of waves the remaining part is distributed among other directions at the karkinit platform the predominant directions are sw 11 8 ssw 10 5 and ene 8 3 the least amount of waves come from se 2 2 due to the fine resolution of the computational grid and the reanalysis quality it is sometimes possible to reproduce typical wave features caused by local winds this is most evident in the case of gelendzhik fig 28 c where a local peak corresponding to ne and ene is observed 9 7 of waves there come from these directions this is the effect of the bora a strong cold katabatic wind typical for the northeastern coastal areas of the black sea especially for the shoreline between novorossijsk and gelendzhik such winds usually occur during autumn and winter if they are associated with negative air temperatures they can lead to ice accretion on vessels and coastal constructions which is the most dangerous consequence of the bora gavrikov and ivanov 2015 a detailed numerical study of such winds and associated waves was performed by toropov et al 2012 at several points which are located close to the shoreline there are two expressed peaks in the distribution of wave directions thus in katziveli fig 28 h at the very south of the crimean peninsula 23 8 of waves come from e and 25 3 from wsw and w only 13 4 of waves come from sse s and ssw which are the directions relatively perpendicular to the coastline this can be due to the fact that waves here are generated by winds blowing along the coastline and that the effects of refraction are still not fully displayed because of the considerable depth 61 m a similar effect is observed at sochi fig 28 k where 22 2 of waves come from sse 23 7 from w and 17 1 from wsw the distribution of swh wl and wp and their seasonal variability is better observed on the box and whisker plots 2 2 box and whisker plots for this study were designed in the following way the lower and upper limits of the boxes represent the 25 and 75 percentile of the data correspondingly the lines inside the boxes indicate the median 50 percentile of the data the lower and upper whiskers represent the 5 and 95 percentiles correspondingly the dots indicate individual data values lying beyond the 5 95 percentiles interval fig 29 shows such a plot for all values of the swh without seasonality swh maxima exceed 6 m at six studied locations gelendzhik 6 7 m kerch strait 6 9 m katziveli 7 1 m karkinit platform 6 6 m bosphorus 7 1 m and sinop 6 3 m which corresponds to the swh maxima pattern shown on fig 13 at other locations swh maxima are between 4 7 m at sochi and 5 5 m at zonguldak the 95th percentile of swh exceeds 2 m only at bosphorus 2 1 m at other points this value is below 2 m with a minimal record at giresun 1 4 m a remarkable feature is that despite equal swh maxima are observed at katziveli and bosphorus 7 1 m in both cases the 95th percentiles values are significantly different 2 1 m at bosphorus and 1 7 at katziveli this demonstrates that higher waves are more frequent at bosphorus and in the surrounding area of the black sea which was demonstrated earlier by arkhipkin et al 2014 the seasonal swh variability at the study points can be observed on fig 30 highest swh values are achieved in winter and autumn in winter storminess in terms of maximal significant wave heights and their 95th percentile is slightly higher in the southwestern and southern areas of the black sea thus at bosphorus the highest swh value and their 95th percentile are 7 1 and 2 8 m and in sinop 6 3 and 2 4 m correspondingly on the other hand in autumn highest swh values correspond to points located in the northern and northeastern parts of the sea gelendzhik kerch strait katziveli and karkinit platform however highest 95th percentile values are found at points located mainly in other regions of the sea bosphorus 2 2 m sinop 2 0 m karkinit 2 0 m and gloria 2 0 m summer is the calmest season on the black sea swh maxima exceed 4 m only at four points bosphorus 5 7 m sinop 5 2 m katziveli 4 2 m and zonguldak 4 0 m lowest swh maxima are located along the western coast of the black sea these values in gloria and galata are 2 7 and 2 6 m correspondingly the swh maxima in sochi is somewhat lower 2 5 m however in terms of the 95th percentile calmest is the northern and northeastern area of the sea where the 95th percentile is below 1 m e g at sochi 0 8 m gelendzhik 0 9 m and katziveli 0 9 m the total distribution of the wl values is shown on fig 31 wl maxima correspond to hopa 154 m sochi 150 m gelendzhik 145 m and bosphorus 143 m the 95th percentiles are highest along the southern coast of the black sea at bosphorus 56 7 m zonguldak 57 3 m sinop 51 6 m and giresun 52 0 m and on the northeastern coast in gelendzhik 51 1 m on the other hand in terms of wl maxima and their 95th percentile the waves are shortest in the northwestern area of the sea and along its western coast thus at the karkinit platform the maximal wave length is 102 4 m and the 95th percentile is 35 9 m at gloria these values are 109 4 m and 41 5 m at galata 109 2 m and 41 1 m correspondingly such a difference may be caused by the considerable fetch length which reaches the southern and eastern coasts of the black sea on the one hand and relatively small depths of the northwestern black sea shelf on the other the seasonal distribution of wl is shown on fig 32 a significant decrease is observed in summer in this season highest wl values are observed along the eastern and southeastern coasts of the black sea in sochi 119 4 m hopa 117 5 m and giresun 112 8 m the 95th percentile of wave lengths in summer is below 40 m at all stations except zonguldak 41 1 m moreover kerch strait is the only location where this parameter is below 20 m 18 5 m the distribution of wp is relatively uniform along the coasts of the black sea fig 33 wp maxima are between 9 0 s in gloria and 10 7 s in sochi the 95th percentile of wave periods is higher along the southern coasts of the sea where it is between 6 5 s at bosphorus and 6 1 s in hopa the minimal value of the 95th percentile of wp corresponds to the karkinit platform 5 2 s similar to the case of significant wave heights and wave lengths wave periods are lower in summer and higher in winter and autumn fig 34 thus in summer maximal wave periods do not exceed 10 s and their 95th percentile is between 4 s and 6 s at all stations except kerch strait 5 5 s an increase of median wp values relative to other regions is observed at points corresponding to the southern coast of the sea bosphorus zonguldak sinop and giresun this tendency is most evident in summer and autumn and it agrees with the location of highest wp means along this part of the shoreline compare with figs 21 and 24 4 conclusions this study shows the results of a 38 years long wind wave hindcast covering the period from 1979 until 2016 for the black sea which was carried out using the swan wind wave model an original unstructured computational grid and ncep cfsr and ncep cfsv2 wind data as forcing modelling results were validated against wave buoy measurements and remote satellite observations both comparisons showed satisfactory results typical values of the average monthly bias were between 0 and 0 2 m of the correlation coefficient between 0 8 and 0 9 to show the features of the wave climate for the entire black sea we have described spatial distributions of annual and seasonal swh wl and wp maxima and means maximal values of significant wave heights exceed 8 5 m and correspond to the southwestern area of the black sea areas with maximal wave lengths and periods are located in the eastern part of the sea these values there exceed 160 m and 10 5 s correspondingly annual swh means exceed 1 m in the southwestern area of the sea while annual wl and wp means reach 24 m and 4 2 s in areas along the southern coast of the black sea generally such spatial patterns match well with previous results obtained in similar studies e g by rusu et al 2018 and akpınar and bingölbali 2016 to assess the features of wind wave climate in the coastal areas total and seasonal timeseries corresponding to 12 points located along the coasts of the black sea were studied maximal values of significant wave heights over 6 m correspond to areas along the northeastern and southwestern coasts of the black sea and the southern coast of the crimean peninsula maximal values of wave lengths and wave periods over 140 m and 10 s correspondingly are located along the northeastern and southern coasts of the black sea the data described in this paper are expected to be used in further research of long term variability of wind wave parameters storminess trends and coastal transformation caused by wave action in the black sea credit authorship contribution statement

21366,the autonomy of any airborne land borne or waterborne vehicle starts with controlling its speed to achieve cruise speed control the conventional approach is to use closed loop feedback control systems that require high precision sensors underwater sensors are expensive due to harsh environment and corrosive properties of seawater in this study we propose a speed control system for autonomous underwater vehicles auvs that closes the control loop via a feedforward mechanism eliminating the need for these expensive sensors the feedforward control is based on the recently developed self propulsion estimation model which can accurately predict propeller rotation rate for conventional auv forms the model is first validated by comparing the predicted resistance and propeller rotation rate of darpa suboff with the experimental and numerical results published in the literature after observing a good match the feedforward control system is used to ensure that the auv reaches a predetermined surge speed two different underwater vehicles are considered in presenting the results of this study the darpa suboff and the gavia auv which has real time measurements available in the literature the feedforward control system developed in this study achieves the desired speed with negligible errors transient response analysis shows that the computer simulation results are in good agreement with experimental results for the gavia auv keywords auv motion control cruise control self propulsion hull propeller interaction darpa suboff gavia auv 1 introduction as autonomous water vehicles increasingly occupy the world s maritime agenda nowadays marine and control engineers work together to develop and enhance control systems to increase the robustness of these marine vehicles although airborne drones have found extensive use in our daily lives it is not possible to make similar statements for waterborne drones recently there has been a surge of interest in utilizing autonomous underwater vehicles auvs to study the underwater environment combined with high precision sensors and robust control systems these underwater vehicles provide us with considerable capabilities to discover the seas as the autonomy levels of underwater vehicles increase so do our capabilities to work in the marine field an intelligent underwater vehicle shall first meet the fundamental requirement of floating in water therefore most studies concerning auvs focus on keeping the depth of the vehicle at a desirable and constant level to achieve this auvs need to reach a minimum speed due to the hydrodynamic properties of these types of water vehicles nickell and woolsey 2005 auvs are generally positively buoyant and to keep their depth at desired levels they are required to cruise with a certain speed the reference eng et al 2016 presents a novel algorithm to keep a given auv at a minimum speed so that it maintains a constant depth the algorithm regulates the cruising speed at a minimum level to keep the desired depth and is experimentally verified with starfish auv an underwater vehicle developed by the national university of singapore chitre 2008 the paper tanakitkorn et al 2017 studies the energy consumption of delphin2 auv on board and considers the impact of net positive buoyancy on the control performance the authors focus on the vertical motions of the vehicle so that it has three degrees of freedom and use a proportional integral derivative pid based diving control system the authors in yu et al 2018 also consider speed depth relationship of auvs and describe a unified control architecture for variable speed following missions the authors claim that the controller guarantees smooth speed switching in the entire speed profile controlling an underwater vehicle s speed is important to fulfill its tasks an example of such tasks can be found in mallios et al 2016 where auvs are utilized in mapping underwater caves surfaces it is shown that the mapping quality obtained by the vehicle depends on the estimation of its trajectory and speed due to high sensitivity of speed estimation in such tasks there is a considerable ongoing research on velocity measurements with different techniques the reference rui fang et al 2011 states that convenient methods to measure velocity are limited by external disturbances in the oceans the authors propose a velocity measurement based on geomagnetic data to increase precision besides the high precision measurements of the vehicle speed motional aspects of the vehicle should also be considered fast vehicle response is one of the desired capabilities an auv is expected to possess so that it can reach the desired speed as quickly as possible continuous interference to propeller rotation increases fuel consumption and delays the vehicle response in catching the desired speed speed control using feedback control systems usually results in an oscillatory behavior due to consistent changes in the propeller rotation rate reducing the economic life of the auv as well as increasing the cost of transportation this study focuses on the stabilization of the auv to a given target velocity unlike the conventional closed loop systems using feedback from sensors this study uses a feedforward mechanism that can accurately predict the propeller rotation rate with respect to the target velocity two different underwater vehicles are considered in this study the darpa suboff and the gavia auv the latter having real time measurements available in the literature the controller is based on a novel self propulsion estimation model published recently in the literature by the first author of this study kinaci et al 2020 the self propulsion estimation model can predict the propeller rotation rate for any target auv velocity section 2 presents the iterative nature of the self propulsion estimation model and its minimum requirements prior to the implementation of the model it is first tested in various cases to see its predictions versus real measurements and numerical simulations section 3 is devoted to the validation of the self propulsion estimation model the total resistance of the darpa suboff and its propeller rotation rate are predicted by the model and compared with the experimental and cfd computational fluid dynamics based results section 4 presents the simulation conditions and the feedforward control mechanism adopted to the control of vehicle speed computer simulation results are given in section 5 finally the conclusions are presented in section 6 2 self propulsion estimation model the self propulsion estimation model employed in this study can also be found in kinaci et al 2018 gokce et al 2019 and kinaci et al 2020 we describe an iterative process with the following inputs for the feedforward speed estimation of interest to be formally defined in section 4 i bare hull resistance r t resistance of the vehicle in a range of given speeds excluding the propeller is needed this is conventionally obtained by towing tank experiments or cfd application ii open water

coefficient values of k 0 k 1 and k 2 are extracted from the thrust curves by fitting a second order equation iii wake fraction w the underwater vehicle changes the flow received by the propeller the effect of the vehicle on the propeller is reflected on the hydrodynamic performance of the propeller by wake fraction w iv thrust deduction factor t a running propeller increases the total resistance of the ship this effect of the propeller on vehicle resistance is reflected on the vehicle propeller system by thrust deduction factor t details of the aforementioned self propulsion estimation parameters and their practical algebraic derivations are presented in the following sections the flow diagram of the propeller rotation rate calculation for the self propulsion estimation model can be seen in fig 1 2 1 water resistance for underwater vehicles water resistance for underwater vehicles is based on hughes decomposition of total ship resistance molland 2011 the vehicle body resistance r

surface ships ittc 1975 and here it is simplified for a cylindrical underwater body underwater vehicles operate far from the free surface boundary and therefore it can generally be assumed that they are not generating waves in this case wave resistance can be neglected i e 8 r w 0 2 2 propeller thrust a conventional fixed pitch propeller thrust t can be calculated by the following equation 9 t k t ρ n 2 d 4 where n is the propeller rotation rate per second d is the propeller diameter and k t is the thrust coefficient propeller performance is assessed in open water propeller tests where the thrust torque and open water efficiency can be graphed with respect to its advance coefficient j given by 10 j v a n d where v a denotes the flow velocity that the propeller receives v a is different than the underwater vehicle speed v because the underwater vehicle disturbs the flow coming to the propeller these two speeds can be related via the wake fraction denoted by w and v a can be calculated by the equation 11 v a v 1 w calculation of v a makes it possible to compute the advance coefficient j by equation 10 the propeller performance can be found for a given range usually 0 1 j 1 2 either by experiments or numerical simulations after determining the advance coefficient j of the propeller the corresponding thrust coefficient k t the torque coefficient k q and the propeller efficiency η 0 can be read from propeller performance diagrams the thrust and torque identities may be used when finding the speed of an underwater vehicle in our case we will go with the thrust

select an arbitrary propeller rotation rate n as an initial value for the propeller rotation rate s3 we know the propeller diameter d from its geometry using v a obtained in step s1 calculate the

in step s6 as it can be seen from the flowchart in fig 1 and the detailed definitions of steps given s1 s7 the high fidelity model behavior is derived by means of sole underwater vehicle and sole propeller hydrodynamics kinaci et al 2018 the model takes hull propeller interactions into account and uses the underwater vehicle propulsion interaction parameters t and w the effects of wake fraction and thrust deduction factor on the underwater vehicle propulsion are briefly visualized in fig 2 2 3 wake fraction and thrust deduction factor the self propulsion estimation model considers the interaction between the underwater vehicle and the propeller via the wake fraction w and the thrust deduction factor t with the following assumptions a1 an open water propeller receives uniform flow but the inflow coming to a propeller working behind an underwater vehicle is non uniform when the underwater vehicle is moving with a speed v the propeller does not receive a flow with speed v the difference is because of the disturbances on the flow coming to the propeller due to the body of the underwater vehicle this effect of the underwater vehicle on the hydrodynamic performance of the propeller is compensated by the wake fraction parameter as denoted by w in this paper a2 a bare hull underwater vehicle s resistance is lower than an underwater vehicle with a running propeller when the propeller is fitted at the stern side of the underwater vehicle it speeds up the flow due to its rotation this increase in the flow velocity creates a low pressure zone at the aft of the underwater vehicle which creates an additional resistance the additional resistance due to the existence of the propeller is represented by thrust deduction factor and denoted by t the self propulsion estimation model presented in this paper is dependent on w and t there are two conventional methods to obtain these parameters either by model tests in towing tanks or numerical simulations table 1

advised imo recommends a conservative estimate for the thrust deduction factor t given by 13 t 0 7 w recommendations of the imo will be followed in this study in order to obtain the wake fraction and thrust deduction parameters for practical purposes 3 validation of self propulsion estimation model as stated previously at the self propulsion estimation model steps s1 s7 and detailed assumptions in a1 a2 in section 2 the feedforward self propulsion estimation model requires four sets of information bare hull resistance open water propeller performance wake fraction and thrust deduction factor the wake fraction and thrust deduction factor are determined empirically from the imo guidelines as given in table 1 however the underwater vehicle resistance and propulsion parameters should be investigated first for the assessment of the validity of the self propulsion estimation model therefore we selected the darpa suboff aff 1 model given in groves et al 1989 different perspectives of the model are illustrated in fig 3 the geometric properties of the aff 1 model used in this study are given in table 2 3 1 validation of bare hull total resistance experimental results of total resistance of the model are given in liu and huang 1998 sezen 2018 conducted numerical simulations of the same form the total resistance obtained via the self propulsion estimation model are given in comparison with these two results in fig 4 as it can be seen from fig 4 all computational results are compatible and the self propulsion estimation model is well correlated with the experimental total resistance 3 2 validation of underwater vehicle propulsion the total resistance of the underwater vehicle should be compensated by the propeller to drive the vehicle forward the validity of the underwater vehicle resistance of the self propulsion estimation model was tested and good results were obtained in this section validation of the underwater vehicle propulsion will be given to do that we will also make use of the wake fraction and thrust deduction factor and this will lead us to test the validity of the self propulsion estimation model as a whole as a prerequisite for using the model open water propeller diagram is required in the literature the darpa suboff is fitted with e1619 propeller the propeller has 7 blades and its open water tests are conducted by chase and carrica 2013 results of the experiments are given in fig 5 we will be using thrust identity during the estimation of the underwater vehicle speed therefore a second order equation will be fitted to the thrust coefficient curve given in fig 4 as in equation 12 and obtain coefficients k 0 k 1 and k 2 while validating the underwater vehicle propulsion case the wake fraction w and thrust deduction factor t should also be considered all these values and the diameter of the propeller are given in table 3 using the values presented in table 3 and the bare hull total resistance given in fig 4 the self propulsion estimation model can be applied and propeller rotation rates at each underwater vehicle speed can be obtained results of the model are computed and compared with numerical simulation results in fig 6 sezen et al 2018 self propulsion estimation model results are found to be in coherence with sezen et al 2018 having very good agreement especially in lower underwater vehicle speeds 4 simulation scenarios after a thorough validation of the self propulsion estimation model in section 3 simulation scenarios for the underwater vehicle in forward motion are conducted the underwater vehicle is considered to be only moving in the forward direction sway heave roll pitch and yaw motions are neglected in this study hence a single degree of freedom simulation model is derived for an underwater vehicle for the surge motion only 4 1 simulation model newton s second law of motion is given by 14 f d m t v d t the force acting on an underwater vehicle during its surge motion can be split into two propeller thrust t that drives the vehicle forward and its resistance r t which opposes it the displacement of the underwater vehicle is assumed to be stable during the motion therefore the total mass in motion m t is constant in this case equation 14 can be written as follows 15 r t t m t d v d t an underwater vehicle moves a mass of water as it moves through it considering only the forward motion an underwater vehicle with mass m will move an added mass of water m x in surge direction decomposition of total mass in motion m t into its components yields 16 m m x d v d t r t t we are interested in finding the forward speed v of the underwater vehicle integrating the equation and rearranging it to leave ship speed alone on the left hand side results in 17 v v 0 r t t m m x d t transforming the integral form of equation 16 into the numerical form we obtain 18 v i 1 v i r t i t i m m x δ t 4 2 simulation conditions accelerating motion of darpa suboff aff 1 model is simulated to see the speed variations of the underwater vehicle in time the simulation model is based on equation 18 the underwater vehicle starts from zero speed and zero propeller rotation rate initially v 0 0 and n 0 0 the time step is selected as δ t 0 005 s in equation 18 the bare hull resistance r t the thrust t the mass m and the added mass m x are the unknowns for the bare hull resistance r t we use the self propulsion estimation model curve presented in fig 4 given by a third order taylor series expansion of the form 19 r t r v v r v v v 2 r v v v v 3 where r v r v v and r v v v are the first second and third order derivatives of resistance with respect to the velocity the thrust t s provided by the propeller was calculated using equation 9 in simulations superscript s denotes values in simulations for all parameters where the propeller rotation rate n is controlled by the propeller rotation rate control system presented in the next subsection the rotation rate is also represented by a third order taylor series expansion using the self propulsion estimation model curve in fig 6 20 n n v v n v v v 2 n v v v v 3 in equation 20 n v n v v and n v v v are the first second and third order derivatives of propeller rotation rate with respect to the velocity these derivatives are obtained from the self propulsion estimation model curve given in fig 6 a curve fitting process via the least squares approach summarized in appendix 1 is used to extract the derivatives from equation 19 and equation 20 the inputs and outputs of the underwater vehicle resistance and underwater vehicle propulsion blocks are given in fig 7 the mass of the underwater vehicle can be calculated by the following equality 21 m ρ where the water is assumed to be at 20 c and the water density is ρ 998 21 k g m 3 the surge motion added mass m x can be taken as 5 of the vehicle s mass as advised by clarke et al 1983 all these parameters have been calculated and given in table 4 coefficients of resistance are intentionally given as negative values due to the coordinate system used it opposes the direction of thrust in this case equation 18 can be reorganized as follows 22 v i 1 v i r v v i r v v v i 2 r v v v v i 3 k t ρ n i 1 2 d 4 m m x δ t note that the propeller diameter d is determined from its geometrical properties and the thrust coefficient k t can be calculated using the self propulsion estimation model explained in section 2 the parameters used in the simulations are given in table 4 4 3 feedforward speed control mechanism the feedforward speed control system considered in this study makes use of the self propulsion estimation model defined with 7 steps given in section 2 the block diagram of the feedforward speed control mechanism of the underwater vehicle is described in detail in fig 8 the underwater vehicle dynamics block based on the self propulsion estimation model consists of underwater vehicle resistance and propulsion sub blocks first the self propulsion estimation model is run for a given range of underwater vehicle velocities as in fig 1 then bare hull resistance and propeller rotation rate values obtained with respect to the vehicle velocity are expanded into a third order taylor series as in equation 19 and equation 20 respectively the values of the parameters r v r v v r v v v n v n v v and n v v v are obtained using the curve fitting algorithm described in appendix 1 the rotation rate coefficients are used along with equation 20 for obtaining the predicted rotation rate n p used in simulations the value of the propeller rotation rate starts from zero n 0 0 at time t 0 and reaches n s n p the settling condition depends on the selected rate of change of propeller rotation n the speed of the underwater vehicle converges to the desired steady speed when the equality r t s t s is satisfied the algorithm for the propeller rotation rate denoted by n c o n t is given as follows 24 n i 1 n i n δ t n c o n t 0 n i 0 n i 1 0 n i n p n p n i n p n p n v v t n v v v t 2 n v v v v t 3 here n p is the rotation rate at which the underwater vehicle reaches the desired speed v t simulation converges to the steady speed gradually until the equality r t s t s is achieved the resistance r t s is calculated using equation 19 and the thrust t s is determined by equation 9 the thrust coefficient k t is determined from the open water propeller diagram given in fig 5 and it is being handled inside the underwater vehicle propulsion block the underwater vehicle mass and added mass are calculated from the geometric properties of the vehicle as explained previously the desired speed is the main input of the control system and the propeller rotation rate control saturates as soon as the propeller reaches n p appendix 2 presents a summary of parameters involved in the feedforward control mechanism with the self propulsion estimation model used in this study the i o relationship of the underwater vehicle dynamics block can be clearly seen in fig 9 5 results results of this study are presented in two parts the first part discusses the results obtained for darpa aff 1 model comparison of the feedforward speed control mechanism presented in this paper with the available real time measurement data is given in the second part of this section 5 1 darpa aff 1 model results two simulations were carried out for target underwater vehicle speeds of v t 1 4 m s and v t 2 7 5 m s using the rotation rate coefficients given in table 4 and equation 20 the self propulsion estimation model predicts the propeller rotation rates for these cases as n p 1 13 349 r p s and n p 1 24 492 r p s the vehicle speed and the propeller rotation rate are initially zero i e v 0 0 and n 0 0 the propeller s rotational acceleration is n d n d t 20 r p s s the propeller reaches n p 1 and n p 2 in 0 665 and 1 225 s respectively this can also be seen in fig 10 upper left for the first 5 s of simulation after propeller reaches the predicted rotation rate it keeps this rate to the end of the simulation the plots of the resistance r t s upper right the thrust t s lower left and the sum of the thrust and resistance lower right graphs are given in fig 10 only the first 30 s of simulations for r t s t s are given to show the additional thrust at the beginning of motion which results in acceleration of the underwater vehicle fig 11 shows the time plot of the speed in the simulations the thrust resistance and speed converge to the steady state values given in table 5 in this table r t r is the steady state resistance that satisfies r t r r t s after a steady value for r t s is achieved the same holds for the steady state thrust and the steady state velocity where t r t s and v r v s after t s and v s convergence the percent error given in table 5 is computed as 25 e v t v r v t x 100 in order to clearly show the stability convergence for a wide range of initial conditions a monte carlo esque simulation scheme is provided in fig 12 that investigates a family of initial propeller rates spanning from 0 to 100 rps with an increment of 10 rps the scheme is carried out for simulation 2 case as seen the speed converges to the initial target v t 2 7 5 m s for each propeller rotation rate set at the start of the simulation 5 2 comparison with real time measurements the feedforward speed control mechanism presented in this study was implemented for a commercialized autonomous underwater vehicle named gavia auv and developed by teledyne marine gavia s length can be in the range between 1 8 m l 4 5 m depending on the configuration but it has a fixed diameter of d s 0 2 m configurations depend on the market it can be designed for commercial defense and security or scientific purposes fig 13 shows a profile view of the auv taken from its brochure gavia auv and sea raptor brochure 2019 helgason 2012 conducted a thorough study on the motions of gavia auv and measured surge sway and heave velocities as well as its heading velocities and covered distances by the auv are recorded and published in this study this paper focuses only on surge results surge velocities were measured for three different propeller rotation rates 187 r p m 197 r p m and 203 r p m simulations in this study were conducted for 187 r p m case our feedforward speed control mechanism is based on the self propulsion estimation model and as previously stated in section 2 this model strictly requires bare hull total resistance r t open water propeller diagram so that we have k 0 k 1 and k 2 wake fraction w and thrust deduction factor t it is possible to estimate the bare hull total resistance the wake fraction and the thrust deduction using the geometrical properties of the auv but we also require knowing the propeller characteristics the geometrical properties of the auv in helgason 2012 are given but there are no data about its propeller neither in this study nor in gavia auv and sea raptor brochure 2019 therefore we used the propeller of darpa aff 1 model k 0 k 1 and k 2 values are taken from the open water propeller diagram of e1619 considering the diameter of the vehicle propeller diameter was chosen to be d 0 085 m the geometric properties of the auv are given in table 6 and propulsion parameters used in our simulations are given in table 7 the wetted area s of the gavia auv is not provided and we do not have the exact geometry of the auv due to lack of data we calculated the wetted area of a cylinder having dimensions of l x d 1 8 m x 0 2 m and used it in our simulations table 6 after running the self propulsion estimation model the resistance coefficients r v r v v r v v v and the rotation rate coefficients n v n v v n v v v were obtained these coefficients are given in table 8 simulations are conducted in a water at 20 c with density ρ 998 21 k g m 3 and dynamic viscosity μ 0 001002 k g m 1 s 1 the propeller s rotational acceleration is as in darpa aff 1 case n 20 r p s s helgason 2012 published surge velocity measurements at 187 r p m which correspond to a propeller rotation rate of 3 117 r p s at this rotation rate the self propulsion estimation model returns a target vehicle velocity of v t 0 2024 m s the feedforward speed control system results and helgason s measurement data are compared in fig 14 unfortunately helgason provides only the first 28 s of measurement data therefore it was not possible to extend the comparison beyond 28 s we could not make the assessment of steady state error as the vehicle did not reach a steady velocity in his measurements however the transient speed increase in the simulation shows a satisfactory agreement with the measurement data it is considered that the uncertainties in the gavia auv parameters especially the propulsion system lead to the discrepancy in the transient state results parameters after 350 s when the simulation settled to a steady state are given in table 9 the simulation reached a perfect steady state as the percent error between the target and achieved speeds is found to be e 0 2 6 conclusions in this paper we elaborate the feedforward speed control of underwater vehicles in surge direction the controller relies on the self propulsion estimation model that predicts the propeller rotation rate for any given target speed the results of this study illustrate that the control system can accurately predict and control cruising speed for conventional auv forms in all cases studied in this paper the percent errors between the target speeds and the steady state speeds were found to be less than 1 additionally the simulation results show that the controller does not only predict the steady state response but it can also predict accurately the transient response of these vehicles it is believed that the feedforward control system proposed in this study is more cost effective than the conventional feedback systems because it eliminates the need for expensive underwater sensors to be implemented in commercial auvs future studies are planned to relate the auv cruising speed with its desired depth this will require coupling the surge and heave motions of the auv in which the buoyancy of the vehicle should also be regarded we plan to take real time measurements so that we can implement parameter identification methods to determine the hydrodynamic coefficients

21366,the autonomy of any airborne land borne or waterborne vehicle starts with controlling its speed to achieve cruise speed control the conventional approach is to use closed loop feedback control systems that require high precision sensors underwater sensors are expensive due to harsh environment and corrosive properties of seawater in this study we propose a speed control system for autonomous underwater vehicles auvs that closes the control loop via a feedforward mechanism eliminating the need for these expensive sensors the feedforward control is based on the recently developed self propulsion estimation model which can accurately predict propeller rotation rate for conventional auv forms the model is first validated by comparing the predicted resistance and propeller rotation rate of darpa suboff with the experimental and numerical results published in the literature after observing a good match the feedforward control system is used to ensure that the auv reaches a predetermined surge speed two different underwater vehicles are considered in presenting the results of this study the darpa suboff and the gavia auv which has real time measurements available in the literature the feedforward control system developed in this study achieves the desired speed with negligible errors transient response analysis shows that the computer simulation results are in good agreement with experimental results for the gavia auv keywords auv motion control cruise control self propulsion hull propeller interaction darpa suboff gavia auv 1 introduction as autonomous water vehicles increasingly occupy the world s maritime agenda nowadays marine and control engineers work together to develop and enhance control systems to increase the robustness of these marine vehicles although airborne drones have found extensive use in our daily lives it is not possible to make similar statements for waterborne drones recently there has been a surge of interest in utilizing autonomous underwater vehicles auvs to study the underwater environment combined with high precision sensors and robust control systems these underwater vehicles provide us with considerable capabilities to discover the seas as the autonomy levels of underwater vehicles increase so do our capabilities to work in the marine field an intelligent underwater vehicle shall first meet the fundamental requirement of floating in water therefore most studies concerning auvs focus on keeping the depth of the vehicle at a desirable and constant level to achieve this auvs need to reach a minimum speed due to the hydrodynamic properties of these types of water vehicles nickell and woolsey 2005 auvs are generally positively buoyant and to keep their depth at desired levels they are required to cruise with a certain speed the reference eng et al 2016 presents a novel algorithm to keep a given auv at a minimum speed so that it maintains a constant depth the algorithm regulates the cruising speed at a minimum level to keep the desired depth and is experimentally verified with starfish auv an underwater vehicle developed by the national university of singapore chitre 2008 the paper tanakitkorn et al 2017 studies the energy consumption of delphin2 auv on board and considers the impact of net positive buoyancy on the control performance the authors focus on the vertical motions of the vehicle so that it has three degrees of freedom and use a proportional integral derivative pid based diving control system the authors in yu et al 2018 also consider speed depth relationship of auvs and describe a unified control architecture for variable speed following missions the authors claim that the controller guarantees smooth speed switching in the entire speed profile controlling an underwater vehicle s speed is important to fulfill its tasks an example of such tasks can be found in mallios et al 2016 where auvs are utilized in mapping underwater caves surfaces it is shown that the mapping quality obtained by the vehicle depends on the estimation of its trajectory and speed due to high sensitivity of speed estimation in such tasks there is a considerable ongoing research on velocity measurements with different techniques the reference rui fang et al 2011 states that convenient methods to measure velocity are limited by external disturbances in the oceans the authors propose a velocity measurement based on geomagnetic data to increase precision besides the high precision measurements of the vehicle speed motional aspects of the vehicle should also be considered fast vehicle response is one of the desired capabilities an auv is expected to possess so that it can reach the desired speed as quickly as possible continuous interference to propeller rotation increases fuel consumption and delays the vehicle response in catching the desired speed speed control using feedback control systems usually results in an oscillatory behavior due to consistent changes in the propeller rotation rate reducing the economic life of the auv as well as increasing the cost of transportation this study focuses on the stabilization of the auv to a given target velocity unlike the conventional closed loop systems using feedback from sensors this study uses a feedforward mechanism that can accurately predict the propeller rotation rate with respect to the target velocity two different underwater vehicles are considered in this study the darpa suboff and the gavia auv the latter having real time measurements available in the literature the controller is based on a novel self propulsion estimation model published recently in the literature by the first author of this study kinaci et al 2020 the self propulsion estimation model can predict the propeller rotation rate for any target auv velocity section 2 presents the iterative nature of the self propulsion estimation model and its minimum requirements prior to the implementation of the model it is first tested in various cases to see its predictions versus real measurements and numerical simulations section 3 is devoted to the validation of the self propulsion estimation model the total resistance of the darpa suboff and its propeller rotation rate are predicted by the model and compared with the experimental and cfd computational fluid dynamics based results section 4 presents the simulation conditions and the feedforward control mechanism adopted to the control of vehicle speed computer simulation results are given in section 5 finally the conclusions are presented in section 6 2 self propulsion estimation model the self propulsion estimation model employed in this study can also be found in kinaci et al 2018 gokce et al 2019 and kinaci et al 2020 we describe an iterative process with the following inputs for the feedforward speed estimation of interest to be formally defined in section 4 i bare hull resistance r t resistance of the vehicle in a range of given speeds excluding the propeller is needed this is conventionally obtained by towing tank experiments or cfd application ii open water

coefficient values of k 0 k 1 and k 2 are extracted from the thrust curves by fitting a second order equation iii wake fraction w the underwater vehicle changes the flow received by the propeller the effect of the vehicle on the propeller is reflected on the hydrodynamic performance of the propeller by wake fraction w iv thrust deduction factor t a running propeller increases the total resistance of the ship this effect of the propeller on vehicle resistance is reflected on the vehicle propeller system by thrust deduction factor t details of the aforementioned self propulsion estimation parameters and their practical algebraic derivations are presented in the following sections the flow diagram of the propeller rotation rate calculation for the self propulsion estimation model can be seen in fig 1 2 1 water resistance for underwater vehicles water resistance for underwater vehicles is based on hughes decomposition of total ship resistance molland 2011 the vehicle body resistance r

e ρ v l μ where l is the underwater vehicle length and μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid after determining the frictional resistance coefficient using equation 3 frictional resistance r f can be calculated by equation 2 viscous pressure resistance r v p can be related to frictional resistance using form factor ittc 2017 denoted by k as 5 r v p k r f the form factor of an underwater vehicle is generally based on its block coefficient and length to breadth ratio in the case that experiments are not available the form factor can be found by the relation 6 k 32 8 c b l d s 2 0 03 here d s is the diameter of the underwater body and c b is its block coefficient which can be calculated by 7 c b 4 π d s 2 l where is the displacement of the underwater vehicle equation 6 is originally given for surface ships ittc 1975 and here it is simplified for a cylindrical underwater body underwater vehicles operate far from the free surface boundary and therefore it can generally be assumed that they are not generating waves in this case wave resistance can be neglected i e 8 r w 0 2 2 propeller thrust a conventional fixed pitch propeller thrust t can be calculated by the following equation 9 t k

thrust torque and open water efficiency can be graphed with respect to its advance coefficient j given by 10 j v a n d where v a denotes the flow velocity that the propeller receives v a is different than the underwater vehicle speed v because the underwater vehicle disturbs the flow coming to the propeller these two speeds can be related via the wake fraction denoted by w and v a can be calculated by the equation 11 v a v 1 w calculation of v a makes it possible to compute the advance coefficient j by equation 10 the propeller performance can be found for a given range usually 0 1 j 1 2 either by experiments or numerical simulations after determining the advance coefficient j of the propeller the corresponding thrust coefficient k t the torque coefficient k q and the propeller efficiency η 0 can be read from propeller performance diagrams the thrust and torque identities may be used when finding the speed of an underwater vehicle in our case we will go with the thrust identity case and thus only k t will be required a second order equation to the thrust coefficient curve is fitted by the least squares method described in appendix 1 12 k t k 0 k 1 j k 2 j 2 the coefficients k 0 k 1 and k 2 will be used in this study to represent the propeller in estimating the underwater vehicle speed the steps of the flow diagram given in fig 1 are listed below for better assessment of the self propulsion estimation model s1 wake fraction w is considered as an initial input of the iteration v a is calculated for the underwater vehicle of interest using equation 11 s2 select an arbitrary propeller rotation rate n as an initial value for the propeller rotation rate s3 we know the propeller diameter d from its geometry using v a obtained in step s1 calculate the advance coefficient j using equation 10 s4 using open water propeller performance diagram curve fit the open water propeller thrust coefficient to obtain k 0 k 1 and k 2 s5 using j obtained in step s3 and k 0 k 1 k 2 in step s4 calculate the thrust coefficient k t by equation 12 s6 using the fluid density ρ propeller diameter d propeller rotation rate selected in step s2 and thrust coefficient k t obtained in step s5 calculate the thrust t by equation 9 s7 thrust deduction factor t and bare hull resistance r t are given as inputs check if r t t 1 t is satisfied by using the thrust t calculated in step s6 as it can be seen from the flowchart in fig 1 and the detailed definitions of steps given s1 s7 the high fidelity model behavior is derived by means of sole underwater vehicle and sole propeller hydrodynamics kinaci et al 2018 the model takes hull propeller interactions into account and uses the underwater vehicle propulsion interaction parameters t and w the effects of wake fraction and thrust deduction factor on the underwater vehicle propulsion are briefly visualized in fig 2 2 3 wake fraction and thrust deduction factor the self propulsion estimation model considers the interaction between the underwater vehicle and the propeller via the wake fraction w and the thrust deduction factor t with the following assumptions a1 an open water propeller receives uniform flow but the inflow coming to a propeller working behind an underwater vehicle is non uniform when the underwater vehicle is moving with a speed v the propeller does not receive a flow with speed v the difference is because of the disturbances on the flow coming to the propeller due to the body of the underwater vehicle this effect of the underwater vehicle on the hydrodynamic performance of the propeller is compensated by the wake fraction parameter as denoted by w in this paper a2 a bare hull underwater vehicle s resistance is lower than an underwater vehicle with a running propeller when the propeller is fitted at the stern side of the underwater vehicle it speeds up the flow due to its rotation this increase in the flow velocity creates a low pressure zone at the aft of the underwater vehicle which creates an additional resistance the additional resistance due to the existence of the propeller is represented by thrust deduction factor and denoted by t the self propulsion estimation model presented in this paper is dependent on w and t there are two conventional methods to obtain these parameters either by model tests in towing tanks or numerical simulations table 1 lists the recommended wake fraction w values for single or twin propellers by the international maritime organization imo a linear interpolation for intermediate values of block coefficient c b is advised imo recommends a conservative estimate for the thrust deduction factor t given by 13 t 0 7 w recommendations of the imo will be followed in this study in order to obtain the wake fraction and thrust deduction parameters for practical purposes 3 validation of self propulsion estimation model as stated previously at the self propulsion estimation model steps s1 s7 and detailed assumptions in a1 a2 in section 2 the feedforward self propulsion estimation model requires four sets of information bare hull resistance open water propeller performance wake fraction and thrust deduction factor the wake fraction and thrust deduction factor are determined empirically from the imo guidelines as given in table 1 however the underwater vehicle resistance and propulsion parameters should be investigated first for the assessment of the validity of the self propulsion estimation model therefore we selected the darpa suboff aff 1 model given in groves et al 1989 different perspectives of the model are illustrated in fig 3 the geometric properties of the aff 1 model used in this study are given in table 2 3 1 validation of bare hull total resistance experimental results of total resistance of the model are given in liu and huang 1998 sezen 2018 conducted numerical simulations of the same form the total resistance obtained via the self propulsion estimation model are given in comparison with these two results in fig 4 as it can be seen from fig 4 all computational results are compatible and the self propulsion estimation model is well correlated with the experimental total resistance 3 2 validation of underwater vehicle propulsion the total resistance of the underwater vehicle should be compensated by the propeller to drive the vehicle forward the validity of the underwater vehicle resistance of the self propulsion estimation model was tested and good results were obtained in this section validation of the underwater vehicle propulsion will be given to do that we will also make use of the wake fraction and thrust deduction factor and this will lead us to test the validity of the self propulsion estimation model as a whole as a prerequisite for using the model open water propeller diagram is required in the literature the darpa suboff is fitted with e1619 propeller the propeller has 7 blades and its open water tests are conducted by chase and carrica 2013 results of the experiments are given in fig 5 we will be using thrust identity during the estimation of the underwater vehicle speed therefore a second order equation will be fitted to the thrust coefficient curve given in fig 4 as in equation 12 and obtain coefficients k 0 k 1 and k 2 while validating the underwater vehicle propulsion case the wake fraction w and thrust deduction factor t should also be considered all these values and the diameter of the propeller are given in table 3 using the values presented in table 3 and the bare hull total resistance given in fig 4 the self propulsion estimation model can be applied and propeller rotation rates at each underwater vehicle speed can be obtained results of the model are computed and compared with numerical simulation results in fig 6 sezen et al 2018 self propulsion estimation model results are found to be in coherence with sezen et al 2018 having very good agreement especially in lower underwater vehicle speeds 4 simulation scenarios after a thorough validation of the self propulsion estimation model in section 3 simulation scenarios for the underwater vehicle in forward motion are conducted the underwater vehicle is considered to be only moving in the forward direction sway heave roll pitch and yaw motions are neglected in this study hence a single degree of freedom simulation model is derived for an underwater vehicle for the surge motion only 4 1 simulation model newton s second law of motion is given by 14 f d m t v d t the force acting on an underwater vehicle during its surge motion can be split into two propeller thrust t that drives the vehicle forward and its resistance r t which opposes it the displacement of the underwater vehicle is assumed to be stable during the motion therefore the total mass in motion m t is constant in this case equation 14 can be written as follows 15 r t t m t d v d t an underwater vehicle moves a mass of water as it moves through it considering only the forward motion an underwater vehicle with mass m will move an added mass of water m x in surge direction decomposition of total mass in motion m t into its components yields 16 m m x d v d t r t t we are interested in finding the forward speed v of the underwater vehicle integrating the equation and rearranging it to leave ship speed alone on the left hand side results in 17 v v 0 r t t m m x d t transforming the integral form of equation 16 into the numerical form we obtain 18 v i 1 v i r t i t i m m x δ t 4 2 simulation conditions accelerating motion of darpa suboff aff 1 model is simulated to see the speed variations of the underwater vehicle in time the simulation model is based on equation 18 the underwater vehicle starts from zero speed and zero propeller rotation rate initially v 0 0 and n 0 0 the time step is selected as δ t 0 005 s in equation 18 the bare hull resistance r t the thrust t the mass m and the added mass m x are the unknowns for the bare hull resistance r t we use the self propulsion estimation model curve presented in fig 4 given by a third order taylor series expansion of the form 19 r t r v v r v v v 2 r v v v v 3 where r v r v v and r v v v are the first second and third order derivatives of resistance with respect to the velocity the thrust t s provided by the propeller was calculated using equation 9 in simulations superscript s denotes values in simulations for all parameters where the propeller rotation rate n is controlled by the propeller rotation rate control system presented in the next subsection the rotation rate is also represented by a third order taylor series expansion using the self propulsion estimation model curve in fig 6 20 n n v v n v v v 2 n v v v v 3 in equation 20 n v n v v and n v v v are the first second and third order derivatives of propeller rotation rate with respect to the velocity these derivatives are obtained from the self propulsion estimation model curve given in fig 6 a curve fitting process via the least squares approach summarized in appendix 1 is used to extract the derivatives from equation 19 and equation 20 the inputs and outputs of the underwater vehicle resistance and underwater vehicle propulsion blocks are given in fig 7 the mass of the underwater vehicle can be calculated by the following equality 21 m ρ where the water is assumed to be at 20 c and the water density is ρ 998 21 k g m 3 the surge motion added mass m x can be taken as 5 of the vehicle s mass as advised by clarke et al 1983 all these parameters have been calculated and given in table 4 coefficients of resistance are intentionally given as negative values due to the coordinate system used it opposes the direction of thrust in this case equation 18 can be reorganized as follows 22 v i 1 v i r v v i r v v v i 2 r v v v v i 3 k t ρ n i 1 2 d 4 m m x δ t note that the propeller diameter d is determined from its geometrical properties and the thrust coefficient k t can be calculated using the self propulsion estimation model explained in section 2 the parameters used in the simulations are given in table 4 4 3 feedforward speed control mechanism the feedforward speed control system considered in this study makes use of the self propulsion estimation model defined with 7 steps given in section 2 the block diagram of the feedforward speed control mechanism of the underwater vehicle is described in detail in fig 8 the underwater vehicle dynamics block based on the self propulsion estimation model consists of underwater vehicle resistance and propulsion sub blocks first the self propulsion estimation model is run for a given range of underwater vehicle velocities as in fig 1 then bare hull resistance and propeller rotation rate values obtained with respect to the vehicle velocity are expanded into a third order taylor series as in equation 19 and equation 20 respectively the values of the parameters r v r v v r v v v n v n v v and n v v v are obtained using the curve fitting algorithm described in appendix 1 the rotation rate coefficients are used along with equation 20 for obtaining the predicted rotation rate n p used in simulations the value of the propeller rotation rate starts from zero n 0 0 at time t 0 and reaches n s n p the settling condition depends on the selected rate of change of propeller rotation n the speed of the underwater vehicle converges to the desired steady speed when the equality r t s t s is satisfied the algorithm for the propeller rotation rate denoted by n c o n t is given as follows 24 n i 1 n i n δ t n c o n t 0 n i 0 n i 1 0 n i n p n p n i n p n p n v v t n v v v t 2 n v v v v t 3 here n p is the rotation rate at which the underwater vehicle reaches the desired speed v t simulation converges to the steady speed gradually until the equality r t s t s is achieved the resistance r t s is calculated using equation 19 and the thrust t s is determined by equation 9 the thrust coefficient k t is determined from the open water propeller diagram given in fig 5 and it is being handled inside the underwater vehicle propulsion block the underwater vehicle mass and added mass are calculated from the geometric properties of the vehicle as explained previously the desired speed is the main input of the control system and the propeller rotation rate control saturates as soon as the propeller reaches n p appendix 2 presents a summary of parameters involved in the feedforward control mechanism with the self propulsion estimation model used in this study the i o relationship of the underwater vehicle dynamics block can be clearly seen in fig 9 5 results results of this study are presented in two parts the first part discusses the results obtained for darpa aff 1 model comparison of the feedforward speed control mechanism presented in this paper with the available real time measurement data is given in the second part of this section 5 1 darpa aff 1 model results two simulations were carried out for target underwater vehicle speeds of v t 1 4 m s and v t 2 7 5 m s using the rotation rate coefficients given in table 4 and equation 20 the self propulsion estimation model predicts the propeller rotation rates for these cases as n p 1 13 349 r p s and n p 1 24 492 r p s the vehicle speed and the propeller rotation rate are initially zero i e v 0 0 and n 0 0 the propeller s rotational acceleration is n d n d t 20 r p s s the propeller reaches n p 1 and n p 2 in 0 665 and 1 225 s respectively this can also be seen in fig 10 upper left for the first 5 s of simulation after propeller reaches the predicted rotation rate it keeps this rate to the end of the simulation the plots of the resistance r t s upper right the thrust t s lower left and the sum of the thrust and resistance lower right graphs are given in fig 10 only the first 30 s of simulations for r t s t s are given to show the additional thrust at the beginning of motion which results in acceleration of the underwater vehicle fig 11 shows the time plot of the speed in the simulations the thrust resistance and speed converge to the steady state values given in table 5 in this table r t r is the steady state resistance that satisfies r t r r t s after a steady value for r t s is achieved the same holds for the steady state thrust and the steady state velocity where t r t s and v r v s after t s and v s convergence the percent error given in table 5 is computed as 25 e v t v r v t x 100 in order to clearly show the stability convergence for a wide range of initial conditions a monte carlo esque simulation scheme is provided in fig 12 that investigates a family of initial propeller rates spanning from 0 to 100 rps with an increment of 10 rps the scheme is carried out for simulation 2 case as seen the speed converges to the initial target v t 2 7 5 m s for each propeller rotation rate set at the start of the simulation 5 2 comparison with real time measurements the feedforward speed control mechanism presented in this study was implemented for a commercialized autonomous underwater vehicle named gavia auv and developed by teledyne marine gavia s length can be in the range between 1 8 m l 4 5 m depending on the configuration but it has a fixed diameter of d s 0 2 m configurations depend on the market it can be designed for commercial defense and security or scientific purposes fig 13 shows a profile view of the auv taken from its brochure gavia auv and sea raptor brochure 2019 helgason 2012 conducted a thorough study on the motions of gavia auv and measured surge sway and heave velocities as well as its heading velocities and covered distances by the auv are recorded and published in this study this paper focuses only on surge results surge velocities were measured for three different propeller rotation rates 187 r p m 197 r p m and 203 r p m simulations in this study were conducted for 187 r p m case our feedforward speed control mechanism is based on the self propulsion estimation model and as previously stated in section 2 this model strictly requires bare hull total resistance r t open water propeller diagram so that we have k 0 k 1 and k 2 wake fraction w and thrust deduction factor t it is possible to estimate the bare hull total resistance the wake fraction and the thrust deduction using the geometrical properties of the auv but we also require knowing the propeller characteristics the geometrical properties of the auv in helgason 2012 are given but there are no data about its propeller neither in this study nor in gavia auv and sea raptor brochure 2019 therefore we used the propeller of darpa aff 1 model k 0 k 1 and k 2 values are taken from the open water propeller diagram of e1619 considering the diameter of the vehicle propeller diameter was chosen to be d 0 085 m the geometric properties of the auv are given in table 6 and propulsion parameters used in our simulations are given in table 7 the wetted area s of the gavia auv is not provided and we do not have the exact geometry of the auv due to lack of data we calculated the wetted area of a cylinder having dimensions of l x d 1 8 m x 0 2 m and used it in our simulations table 6 after running the self propulsion estimation model the resistance coefficients r v r v v r v v v and the rotation rate coefficients n v n v v n v v v were obtained these coefficients are given in table 8 simulations are conducted in a water at 20 c with density ρ 998 21 k g m 3 and dynamic viscosity μ 0 001002 k g m 1 s 1 the propeller s rotational acceleration is as in darpa aff 1 case n 20 r p s s helgason 2012 published surge velocity measurements at 187 r p m which correspond to a propeller rotation rate of 3 117 r p s at this rotation rate the self propulsion estimation model returns a target vehicle velocity of v t 0 2024 m s the feedforward speed control system results and helgason s measurement data are compared in fig 14 unfortunately helgason provides only the first 28 s of measurement data therefore it was not possible to extend the comparison beyond 28 s we could not make the assessment of steady state error as the vehicle did not reach a steady velocity in his measurements however the transient speed increase in the simulation shows a satisfactory agreement with the measurement data it is considered that the uncertainties in the gavia auv parameters especially the propulsion system lead to the discrepancy in the transient state results parameters after 350 s when the simulation settled to a steady state are given in table 9 the simulation reached a perfect steady state as the percent error between the target and achieved speeds is found to be e 0 2 6 conclusions in this paper we elaborate the feedforward speed control of underwater vehicles in surge direction the controller relies on the self propulsion estimation model that predicts the propeller rotation rate for any given target speed the results of this study illustrate that the control system can accurately predict and control cruising speed for conventional auv forms in all cases studied in this paper the percent errors between the target speeds and the steady state speeds were found to be less than 1 additionally the simulation results show that the controller does not only predict the steady state response but it can also predict accurately the transient response of these vehicles it is believed that the feedforward control system proposed in this study is more cost effective than the conventional feedback systems because it eliminates the need for expensive underwater sensors to be implemented in commercial auvs future studies are planned to relate the auv cruising speed with its desired depth this will require coupling the surge and heave motions of the auv in which the buoyancy of the vehicle should also be regarded we plan to take real time measurements so that we can implement parameter identification methods to determine the hydrodynamic coefficients

21367,in recent years coastal erosion in the vietnamese mekong delta vmd is occurring at a rapid rate which is leading to considerable damage of infrastructure and the human made environment various solutions have been proposed to protect the coastline in the vmd including pile rock breakwaters prbws prbws have several advantages that make them particularly applicable to the coast of west ca mau and the mekong delta the focus of this study is to test prbw efficiency in the vmd by evaluating a physical experimental model followed by evaluation of observations in the field from the ca mau province a series of experiments were undertaken to build an empirical formula of the wave transmission coefficient the results show that the prbw structure works effectively in the case of emergence when the wave transmission coefficient kt is between 0 3 and 0 4 but in this case the wave reflection coefficient is quite large i e kr of 0 45 0 6 the experimentally obtained and measured transmission coefficient kt show strong agreement the analytical results show that a prbw dissipates most of the energy for short periodic waves however long periodic waves can still be transmitted through the prbw the prbw shows significant advantages over other styles of breakwaters including an increased potential to reduce erosion high stability and a reduced deadweight of construction materials these advantages mean that prbws have a great potential to aid restoration of mangrove forests that are sheltered behind the breakwater in the vmd region keywords pile rock breakwater prbw wave transmission wave reflection wave dissipation wave spectra coastal mekong delta 1 introduction in recent decades coastal provinces and cities in the vietnamese mekong delta vmd have suffered severe land erosion in the west coast south of vietnam in particular this severe erosion has led to hundreds of hectares of land being washed away along the coastline and has destroyed many houses and infrastructure for example approximately 200 km of shoreline in the ca mau and kien giang provinces have been affected by severe erosion according to xing et al 2017 see fig 1 coastal erosion in the vmd typically begins with erosion of the topsoil around the mangrove roots this process accelerates over time gradually depleting the remaining headlands covered with mangrove vegetation albers and jan 2015 to decrease the rate of erosion a range of breakwater technologies have been deployed in the vmd including rubble mound breakwaters t fence breakwaters geotube breakwaters perforated wall breakwaters and pile rock breakwaters prbws due to their construction prbws have several advantages over other styles of breakwaters compared to traditional trapezoidal rubble mound breakwaters prbws have a typically smaller geometrical size leading to the benefit of a reduced deadweight of construction materials prbw construction consists of a frame of two rows of piles which is then infilled with rock rubble during construction the piles penetrate deep into the seabed which fastens the rock core and provides the structure with strong wave resistance due to their deep penetration prbws are also typically more suitable for weak soil foundation and severe seabed scour liu 2012 an example application of a prbw is in the ca mau province where they have successfully been constructed to minimize critical erosion that threatens the safety of sea dykes and protected mangrove forests the first construction of prbws in this region was 300 m long and constructed in 2010 at the coastline in khanh tien u minh district ca mau province this initial construction was later extended to approximately 22 km in 2019 see fig 2 after a decade of operation this prbw has demonstrated high efficiency and has reduced the impact of incoming waves leading to accretion and regeneration of mangroves on the west coast of the ca mau province the success of this prbw is a good indication that this style of breakwater is applicable for broader application across the soft soil foundation across the coast of the vmd a range of studies have considered the effectiveness of prbws for example nguyen huu nhan 2015 applied a coupled modelling of hydrodynamics and spectral sea wave on shallow water to evaluate the effectiveness of a prbw on the west sea of ca mau the results from this study showed high effectiveness of the prbw for aiding alluvial accumulation preventing rip circulation and wave action and protecting the coastline and mangrove belt liu 2012 applied linear potential theory to analyze the wave absorption of prbws the results from this study showed the relationship between wave transmission reflection and dissipation coefficients when the wave interacts with this a prbw but they did not validate their results with physical model experiments furthermore herbich 1998 conducted experiments to predict the transformation of waves passing through closely spaced pile or large cylinder breakwaters several researchers have conducted experiments and numerical modelling to reproduce the hydrodynamic near field processes and the vortex generation and dissipation by applying the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations for low crested permeable breakwaters garcia et al 2004 hsu et al 2004 martinelli et al 2006 this rans model has the ability to reproduce the near field flow characteristics around low crested structures moreover hur 2004 and hur et al 2011 investigated the effect of the slope gradient of submerged breakwaters by using a three dimensional numerical model and a three dimensional wave basin for their experiments johnson et al 2005 and johnson 2006 conducted research to study waves currents and wave breaking around submerged breakwaters and verified their results with three dimensional wave basin experiments and wave flume experiments at aalborg university denmark and the university of cantabria spain kramer et al 2005 respectively the results from these studies showed that the mike 21 model offers some confidence in the ability of the models to reproduce waves and currents of submerged breakwaters more recently ha 2019 undertook research on analytical and numerical analysis for the stability of prbw that are subjected to combined loading the authors of this study developed a method to calculate the bearing capacity of the prbw on soft clay soils this investigation of wave performance was not a comprehensive analysis in the contest of the west coast vmd and the research was mainly based on applying a formula for conventional rubble mound breakwaters that was not suitable to be applied to prbws based on the previous research on prbws the main objective of this study is to better understand the hydraulic performance of this type of breakwaters by analyzing the results from performing a series of physical model wave transmission experiments the specific objectives of this study are to 1 propose innovative structures of prbw that are both suitable for the soft soil foundation and also have a fast construction process that has the potential to save concrete and rubble construction materials in the vmd 2 determine the wave reduction transmission and dissipation coefficients through these prbws 3 develop an experimental formula for wave transmission to inform future design and construction of prwbs to address these specific objectives this paper is structured as follows in section 2 we describe the experimental setup and results of investigating wave transmission through a prbw based on observations in the laboratory in section 3 we then validate the experimental results by investigating wave transmission through prbw from observations in the field finally in section 4 we make conclusions from both the laboratory experiments as well as the observations in the field and provide recommendations for future work 2 wave transmission through prbw from observations in the laboratory in this section we first introduce the experimental model configuration followed by more details on the flume setup and instrumentation in the laboratory we then present the experimental scenarios explored and finish with a discussion of the experimental results 2 1 model configuration the in situ dimensions of the designed prbw structure were collected during a project that investigated coastal protection works in the vmd in 2017 the type of pile used in this structure is a pre stressed concrete pile with a diameter of 30 cm length of 8 m and a width crest of 2 6 m as indicated in the longitudinal cross section see fig 3 there is a row of piles with spacing of 30 cm between each pile in addition to the piles this prbw structure used rock rubble with dimensions of approximately 25 35 cm the cross section a a in fig 3 shows the melaleuca mattresses and geo textile layer below the rocks as well as the vertical beams 50 30 cm and the horizontal beam 30 30 cm above the rocks to fit the prbw into the wave flume in the laboratory the dimensions of the model structure were scaled to 1 5 of the in situ size the maximum model scale was selected based on the ability of the wave flume to house the breakwater and the boundary conditions of the experiment the model scale was selected as the following nl 5 scale of length and height n t n l 2 24 scale of time n v n l 2 24 scale of velocity and nm n3 l 125 scale of mass the dimensions of the actual breakwater and the model breakwater considered in this study are described in table 1 according to the designed parameters of the actual structure the rubbles had a grade of dn 25 35 cm the experimental rubbles grade is calculated from the model scale and is specified in table 2 the experimental rubbles grade is sieved according to laboratory standards to ensure consistency in the dimensions porosity and overall similarity in front of the structure there is rip rap which prevents erosion at a 7 cm height equal to 2 layers of rubble and is 50 cm wide fig 4 2 2 flume setup and instrumentation the experiments were carried out in the wave flume at the river and marine hydrodynamic laboratory of the southern institute of water resources research binh duong province vietnam the experimental equipment was installed by hr wallingford the flume is 35 m long effective 1 2 m wide and 1 5 m high it is equipped with an automated system of active reflection compensation arc and is capable of generating both regular and irregular waves up to 0 3 m in height and 3 s in peak period fig 4 reliable resistance type wave gauges have the ability to measure wave signals at a sampling frequency up to 100 hz accuracy 0 1 mm the single piston paddle long crested wavemaker has a width of 1 2 m the maximum water depth in the flume is 1 0 m and the maximum wave height is 0 6 m corresponding to a period of 2 0 s the wave flume setup has two wave absorbers that are separated by a thick foam sheet at the wave generator side and a trapezoidal prism of rubbles and gravel in rear side the remaining energy after the wave passes through the breakwater after 90 of the total wave energy is absorbed is absorbed by the rubble absorber the reflected wave energy from the paddle is absorbed after 95 of the total wave energy is absorbed by the thick foam sheet it is important to note that in the vmd the wave height in the southwest monsoon is largest in the deep water of the study area and is about 1 1 5 m with a period of 3 6 s the experiments in this study are instead built under the assumption that wave conditions are under medium weather conditions without storms the boundary conditions of the wave parameters were generated by the joint north sea wave observation project jonswap spectra with a γ value of 3 30 which was validated by the agence française de développement afd project the selection of featured wave parameters is based on various research of wave observation in the vmd by the southern institute of water resources research siwrr and is combined with wave transmission derived from a numerical model wave parameters in the front and behind the breakwater were measured with 6 capacitance wave gauges incident and reflected waves were separated by using 4 gauges with software processing in wave measurement by the hr wallingford system the wave gauge system to measure water level fluctuation included the following wave probes calibration stems calibration pins wave probe tripod stands twin wire cables and a wave probe monitor the wave height measurable range of this system was 300 mm the output signal was 10 v accuracy was 0 1 mm and internal noise limiting filter was 3 db at 20 hz signal bandwidth four gauges were installed in front of the breakwater wg1 2 3 4 and were used for measuring the incident wave and to separate the reflected wave and the incident wave in front of the breakwater two gauges were installed behind the breakwater wg5 6 and were used to determine the height of the wave passing through the breakwater each of the experiments lasted approximately 500 tp s to adequately produce the main frequency domain of the desired wave spectra the locations of wave gauges are described in the experiment layout illustrated in fig 5 2 3 experimental scenarios to investigate the wave transmission through the prbw 78 scenarios were used including 6 scenarios for changing water level and crest freeboard rc and 13 scenarios for changing wave parameters hs tp l the experimental scenarios are shown in detail in table 3 the water levels corresponding to the experimental scenarios considered are shown in fig 6 2 4 results and discussion wave transmission through prbws is generally a function of relative crest freeboard crest width breakwater slope porosity permeability and wave characteristics van der meer and daemen 1994 angremond et al 1996 in this study we analyzed the experimental data to formulate an empirical equation for wave transmission and examined the effects on wave transmission of the most influential parameters including the relative crest freeboard and the wave slope other secondary parameters implicitly included in this study are the crest width and the porosity of the prbw 2 4 1 change in the wave spectra and the wave period before and after the breakwater the changes in the wave spectra after passing the breakwater are show in fig 7 the wg4 and wg5 gauges indicate the recorded wave signal in front of and after the construction respectively fig 7 provides a visual representation of an important characteristic of the wave hydrodynamics for prbw and it is clear that the wave amplitude in front of the breakwater is significantly higher than the amplitude after transmitting through the breakwater the spectral transformation across the breakwater with a high crest emergence rc 0 and submergence rc 0 are illustrated in fig 8 logically wave energy considerably dissipates when the crest of the breakwater has an emergence of rc 0 see fig 8b than when the crest of breakwater has submergence with rc 0 see fig 8d in the submergence situation rc 0 the wave arrives in front of the structure with high energy of 7 10 3 m2 hz see fig 8c and after the wave transmits through the breakwater the energy is still high and equivalent to 2 10 3 m2 hz with a range of frequency within 0 5 1 hz see fig 8d the energy for both the emergence and the submergence case in front of structure are approximately the same comparing fig 8a c channel 4 this is not the case however after the breakwater where the differences in the energy spectra distribution for the emergence and the submergence cases are significant see fig 8b d this result occurs due to the wave energy being dissipated or reflected when the waves interact with the breakwater structure under the emergence case the changes about the peak period of the spectra crest tp and period of t1 3 of the measured waves in front of and behind the structure are shown in fig 9 the trend illustrates that the period of t1 3 has a significant change when comparing the peak period of spectra tp in front of and behind the breakwater structure behind the structure t1 3 has a trend of becoming larger than in front of the structure see deviation from the 1 1 line while tp has no significant change follows the 1 1 line this relationship is consistent with the theory of wave spectra analysis the reason this occurs is that the waves have a shorter period when dissipated after interacting with structure only long waves transmit through the structure because their t1 3 behind the structure are bigger than those in front of the structure this observed trend agrees with earlier studies by liu 2012 and dhinakaran 2011 the changes of wave period in front of and behind the breakwater structure have noticeable differences when considering either the case of the emerged breakwater rc 0 and the case of the submerged breakwater rc 0 with period wave spectra tm see fig 9 right panel in the case of the emerged breakwater the tm behind the structure has a larger trend than those in front of the structure this behavior is vice versa in the case of the submerged breakwater in the case of rc 0 the breakwater with crest width structure b 1 4lm min and b 1 10lm max works for wave transmission in the shallow water region however the crest width of the prbw is not large enough for waves to break on in the observable laboratory experiments the effect of shallow water makes the waves periods behind the structure reduce in comparison with those in front of the structure 2 4 2 change of wave height in front of the breakwater structure the fluctuation of water level in front of the structure increases due to the influence of wave reflection created from the interaction of the incident waves and the breakwater structure when the incident waves interfere with the reflected waves a fluctuated synthetic water level is created which then impacts the total wave height in front of the breakwater structure hm0 f as the resonance waves are always larger than the incident waves it follows that as the incident waves increase so do the resonance waves this variation is expressed by the before construction wave coefficient kf which is determined by the ratio between the wave height before construction hm0 f and the incident wave height hm0 i according to the formula 1 k f h m 0 f h m 0 i fig 10 shows that when the breakwater works in the submerged condition the coefficient kf is small i e kf 1 1 2 this is because most of the waves pass through the breakwater crest when the breakwater works in the emerged condition the coefficient kf is typically equal to 1 1 4 and reaches a maximum value corresponding to rc hm0 1 5 this relationship shows that incident and reflected waves can interact with each other to create a high total wave that interacts with the prbw and this relationship should be taken into consideration when designing prbw constructions 2 4 3 equations describing the influence of factors on the wave transmission process when a wave impacts a porous breakwater one part of the wave energy will be reflected in front of the structure another part of the wave energy will be dissipated and absorbed and the rest of the wave energy will be transmitted through the back of the breakwater theoretically this hydrodynamic problem obeys the law of conservation of energy and can be expressed in mathematical form by the energy balance formula burcharth and hughes 1993 2 e i e t e r e d in which ei et er and ed are the energy of the incident wave the transmitted wave the reflected wave and the dissipated wave respectively this energy balance formula can be rewritten as follows 3 1 h t h i 2 h r h i 2 e d e i n r n r 4 1 k t 2 k r 2 k d 2 in which the wave transmission coefficient k t h m 0 t h m 0 i is determined by the height of transmitted wave behind the structure hm0 t over the height of the incident wave in front of the structure hm0 t the k r h m 0 r h m 0 i wave reflection coefficient is determined by the height of reflected wave in front of the structure over the height of the incident wave in front of the structure hm0 t finally the kd coefficient can be determined based on the results of formula 4 5 k d 2 1 k t 2 k r 2 2 4 4 influence of the breakwater crest freeboard the relative crest freeboard rc hm0 i plays the most important role in wave transmission with regard to coastal structures this relative crest freeboard rc hm0 i depends on the following factors water level d structure height h and incident wave height hm0 i it follows that the transmission coefficient quickly declines in a linear trend with the increase of the relative freeboard and becomes almost constant kt 0 30 when rc hm0 0 50 generally a wave has low transmission through the breakwater when there is high crest emergence on the other hand the breakwater structure is not effective in damping the wave transmission when it gets submerged i e kt 0 7 0 8 as rc hm0 0 50 the reflection coefficient is plotted against the relative freeboard in fig 11 which indicates that this breakwater is highly reflective particularly in the case when the crest emerges above the water level i e kr 0 45 0 60 reflection generally increases as rc hm0 increases as the breakwater structure is not sufficiently porous to absorb wave energy in the case of high crest emergence reflected waves reach maximum value when rc hm0 i 1 2 with kr 0 55 0 60 when rc hm0 i 2 as in the low water level case the reflected waves have a slight decrease due to the rip rap in front of the structure this rip rap serves as a preventative measure to reduce erosion and absorbs a part of the reflected waves in front of the breakwater structure the relationship between rc hm0 i and kt kr kd is shown clearly when 1 5 rc hm0 i 1 5 fig 11 this is because it is the transitional boundary between the emerged and the submerged state of the breakwater the wave transmission coefficient kt demonstrates an inverted relationship with respect to the relative crest freeboard while the coefficients of wave reflection and wave energy dissipation illustrate a covariate trend with respect to relative crest freeboard when the breakwater submerges rc 0 a large number of waves transmit through the breakwater leading to a large wave transmission coefficient and small coefficients of wave reflection and wave energy dissipation on the other hand as the breakwater emerges rc increases wave reflection and wave energy dissipation increase leading to a smaller wave transmission coefficient the breakwater emerges until the wave overflows its crest rc hm0 i 1 5 and then the relationship chart between rc hm0 i with kt kr kd is almost horizontal this proves that the relative crest freeboard is not influential to the coefficient this observed trend in fig 11 is in agreement with the earlier work on linear potential theory by liu 2012 the higher the relative crest freeboard the more the wave energy dissipates see fig 12 the reflected waves reach maximum value when rc hm0 i 1 2 and kr 0 5 0 56 when rc hm0 i 2 the reflected wave energy has a slight decrease due to the rip rap in front of the breakwater structure this rip rap prevents erosion and absorbs a part of the reflected wave energy in front of the structure at low water level fig 12 shows the percentage of transmitted reflected and dissipated wave energy through the prbw corresponding to a varying relative crest freeboard rc hm0 i we see that the smallest dissipated wave energy 26 corresponds to the prbw in the submerged state rc hm0 i 1 5 in the case of the largest transmitted wave energy 68 the reflected wave energy is the smallest 6 the value of the dissipated wave energy increases gradually when changing from submerged state to emerged state 58 we also see that the reflected wave energy also increases with this trend and the largest 32 corresponds to rc hm0 i 1 5 which has a decreased transmitted wave energy 10 as the relative crest freeboard continues to increase rc hm0 i 1 5 the wave energy dissipated continues to increase the transmitted wave energy decreases slightly almost unchanged by about 10 and the reflected wave energy decreases slightly 2 4 5 influence of the wave slope on the front of the breakwater structure the relationship between the slope of waves and the wave coefficients is considered based on sp in which sp is slope of the wave corresponding to the peak period of the spectra crest tp the slope of the wave in front of the breakwater structure has an inverted relationship with coefficients of wave transmission and wave reflection see fig 13 between the wave reflection coefficient and the wave transmission coefficient that are measured directly in experiment the sensitivity of the correlation between the slope of the wave in front of the structure to the wave transmission coefficient is higher than the wave reflection coefficient this is indicated in fig 13 by the angular coefficient a which is greater in the resulting correlation lines direct measurements from the experiments of the wave transmission and the wave reflection coefficients results in the formulation of the correlation between the wave dissipation coefficient and the slope of wave this is a covariate relationship as indicated by fig 13 where the effect of the slope of the wave on the coefficient of wave dissipation depends on the value of the crest freeboard rc the relationship between rc hm0 i and both the wave transmission coefficient kt and the coefficient of wave reflection kr with different periods of waves is shown in fig 14 the effect of changing the wave period on the coefficient of wave transmission tends to be clearer than the wave reflection coefficient in the three wave conditions of hs 8 cm 12 cm and 16 cm especially in the case where rc hm0 i 0 1 5 with the same experimental wave height the greater the periodic wave t 2 23s the greater the transmission coefficient and the reflection coefficient compared to the small period wave t 1 34s the trend of the changing of the kt wave transmission coefficient is the most clear in the cases corresponding to rc hm0 i 0 1 5 2 4 6 developing an experimental formula to describe the wave transmission through a pile rock breakwater the earlier analysis of parameters that influence wave transmission through prbws is the base for building an experimental formula to describe this process the experimental formula that we present is built based on the previously available formula of van der meer and daemen 1994 and angremond et al 1996 therefore the wave transmission coefficient and the wave reflection coefficient are effected by several main factors including the relative freeboard rc hm0 i and the slope of the waves so note that compared to angremond et al 1996 the crest width b is not present in our equation eq 6 since in this case the porous breakwater is considered a narrow crested type of structure in fact its effect is implicitly included the general experimental formula is shown as 6 k t f r c h m 0 i s p k t a r c h m 0 i b s p c where a b are experimental constants of effectiveness of the factors relative freeboard rc hm0 i slope of waves sp c is a featured constant of other factors that is not considered in this experiment a b and c are determined by regression analysis with the data of the corresponding variables obtained from the experimental results the values of a b and c in this formula are obtained from regression analysis of the experimental data results from the fitting of the formulation of wave transmission with the relative freeboard rc hm0 i and the slope of the waves so the values of a b c are calculated my maximizing the correlation coefficient r2 results of this analysis are shown in fig 15 and demonstrate that the r2 value reaches a maximum of 0 83 when a 0 167 b 4 172 c 0 634 the fitted negative values of a and b show that there is an inverted relationship between the relative freeboard and the slope of the waves so the result of the regression analysis method gives the corresponding formula 7 k t 0 167 r c h m 0 i 4 172 s 0 0 634 with the range of application of the formula corresponding to r c h m 0 i 1 49 1 48 s o 0 009 0 051 k t 0 28 0 84 3 wave transmission through pile rock breakwater from observation in the field 3 1 observational setup to calculate the effectiveness of wave reduction from a prbw in the field a measurement campaign was carried out at a prbw structure located along the ganh hao coastline from the 18 19th of february 2020 a north east monsoon dominant time period along the coastline of the mekong delta there are two main wind seasons and the east sea is influenced by the northeast monsoon from november to march next year the installed instruments to measure wave reduction include two wave gauges with code ossi 010 022 that were provided by ocean sensor systems inc usa the locations of the installed equipment are approximately 30 m in front of and behind the prbw the measuring instrument locations on the front side of the prbw instrument sn001 and on the rear side of the prbw instrument sn002 at ganh hao are illustrated in fig 16 3 2 analysis of the results and comparison with experimental laboratory results the relationship between the wave height h1 3 and the wave period t1 3 from the field measured data is shown in fig 17 the observed wave height h1 3 ranges from 0 09 m to 0 81 m and the wave period values ranged from 3 04 s to 7 72 s analyzing the results we see that there is a positive trend between h1 3 and t1 3 when h1 3 0 4 m and in this range the wave period increases from 3 s to 7 s however when h1 3 0 4 m and h1 3 increases from 0 4 m to 0 8 m the wave period has only a slight variation around a value of t1 3 7 s indicated by the red line in fig 17 this stabilizing of the t1 3 is an indication that the wave threshold and the wave characteristic in this region has fully reached its maximum value the similarity in the shape of the wave spectrum between the observed field measurements and the laboratory experimental data is shown in fig 18 at the location before the construction the blue line the wave spectrum has a peak shape of power spectrum with a high energy distribution within frequency range of 0 1 0 16 hz in the field observations fig 18a and a frequency range of 0 5 1 0 hz in the laboratory experiments fig 18b note that in both cases there are some other frequency bands with smaller energy distributions at the location behind construction the red line the wave spectrum is flattened and the frequency bands are larger than is typical with a very small power spectrum due to the energy dissipation process when the wave transmits through the breakwater interestingly the appearance of gravity waves i e infragravity waves is also found in both field measurement and experimental data with frequency ranges from 0 006 hz to 0 02 hz see fig 18 the measured wave spectra as shown in fig 18 at a location on the foreshore instruments wg4 and sn002 clearly exhibits multiple peaks and flattens as the wave increases low frequency or infragravity waves are present and generated by the breaking processes of short period waves on the shallow foreshore as noted by baldock 2012 alternatively forced bound long waves induced by wave grouping are also released as free infragravity waves at the breaking points of the gravity waves the existence of these infragravity waves is probably inherent to the wave dynamics on a shallow foreshore as short gravity waves break the relative importance of infragravity waves start to increase this trend is in agreement with the earlier study performed by baldock 2012 fig 19 shows the results of analyzing the transmission coefficient between the field measurement and the laboratory experiment the results show that the transmission coefficient kt is similar in both the trends and the variable values in relation to the relative crest freeboard rc hi the transmission coefficient kt through the breakwater ranges from 0 26 to 0 56 corresponding to the rc hi value varying from 0 to 1 4 in the field measurements notably the wave transmission coefficient obtained from field measurement tends to be smaller than those derived from the laboratory experiment this difference may be due to the influence of the model ratio and other factors that impact the field measurement moreover the physical model reproduces wave propagation in two dimensions with a scale of 1 5 however the field measurement results are three dimensional and the ratio is 1 1 4 conclusions and recommendations pile rock breakwaters show significant potential to reduce erosion and rehabilitate mangrove forests in the vmd prbws have significant advantages over other styles of breakwaters these advantages include a reduced deadweight of construction materials and additional stability when compared to traditional trapezoidal breakwaters based on previous research that focused on prbw the main objective of this study was to better understand the hydraulic performance of prbws by analyzing the results from performing a series of physical model wave transmission experiments to address this objective this study has built a physical model to test hydraulic performance and wave transmission through prbw in the laboratory and compared with observations in the field the wave transmission process through the prbw is influenced by two important factors the relative crest freeboard rc hm0 and the slope of waves the results from the wave transmission through a prbw from observations in the laboratory showed the following 1 the short wave energy is mostly dissipated or reflected and that the waves behind the prbw are mostly long wave energy 2 the prbw structure works effectively with the wave transmission coefficient kt 0 3 0 4 when the breakwater works in the emerged state 3 the effect of the slope of the wave on the wave transmission coefficient is clearer than the wave reflection coefficient following the observations in the laboratory an experimental formula to describe the wave transmission through a prwb was developed and then applied to observations in the field this allowed the development of a relationship diagram between the transmission coefficient kt and the relative crest freeboard rc hi in both the experimental data and the field measured data the results indicate a high reliability for further design of prbws in addition to this relationship the experimental and measured results both showed the emergence of and increase of gravity waves the results from this work provide direction on the future design process of prbws firstly particular attention should be paid to the case of a high wave reflection coefficient kr 0 45 0 56 secondly in the case of an emerged breakwater special attention must be paid to the design of toe scour protection and for the case when the wave height before the prbw hm0 f is larger than the incident wave height hm0 i when this is 1 1 4 times larger this needs to be considered carefully to calculate the stability and the structure of the prbw future investigations related to prbws will need to consider the additional complexity of analyzing the complex wave energy dissipation by permeable breakwaters in addition to this future work will need to investigate variables that were not considered in this study including the influence of the width of the breakwater s crest and influence of the size of the rocks in the prbw on the wave transmission coefficient declaration of competing

21367,in recent years coastal erosion in the vietnamese mekong delta vmd is occurring at a rapid rate which is leading to considerable damage of infrastructure and the human made environment various solutions have been proposed to protect the coastline in the vmd including pile rock breakwaters prbws prbws have several advantages that make them particularly applicable to the coast of west ca mau and the mekong delta the focus of this study is to test prbw efficiency in the vmd by evaluating a physical experimental model followed by evaluation of observations in the field from the ca mau province a series of experiments were undertaken to build an empirical formula of the wave transmission coefficient the results show that the prbw structure works effectively in the case of emergence when the wave transmission coefficient kt is between 0 3 and 0 4 but in this case the wave reflection coefficient is quite large i e kr of 0 45 0 6 the experimentally obtained and measured transmission coefficient kt show strong agreement the analytical results show that a prbw dissipates most of the energy for short periodic waves however long periodic waves can still be transmitted through the prbw the prbw shows significant advantages over other styles of breakwaters including an increased potential to reduce erosion high stability and a reduced deadweight of construction materials these advantages mean that prbws have a great potential to aid restoration of mangrove forests that are sheltered behind the breakwater in the vmd region keywords pile rock breakwater prbw wave transmission wave reflection wave dissipation wave spectra coastal mekong delta 1 introduction in recent decades coastal provinces and cities in the vietnamese mekong delta vmd have suffered severe land erosion in the west coast south of vietnam in particular this severe erosion has led to hundreds of hectares of land being washed away along the coastline and has destroyed many houses and infrastructure for example approximately 200 km of shoreline in the ca mau and kien giang provinces have been affected by severe erosion according to xing et al 2017 see fig 1 coastal erosion in the vmd typically begins with erosion of the topsoil around the mangrove roots this process accelerates over time gradually depleting the remaining headlands covered with mangrove vegetation albers and jan 2015 to decrease the rate of erosion a range of breakwater technologies have been deployed in the vmd including rubble mound breakwaters t fence breakwaters geotube breakwaters perforated wall breakwaters and pile rock breakwaters prbws due to their construction prbws have several advantages over other styles of breakwaters compared to traditional trapezoidal rubble mound breakwaters prbws have a typically smaller geometrical size leading to the benefit of a reduced deadweight of construction materials prbw construction consists of a frame of two rows of piles which is then infilled with rock rubble during construction the piles penetrate deep into the seabed which fastens the rock core and provides the structure with strong wave resistance due to their deep penetration prbws are also typically more suitable for weak soil foundation and severe seabed scour liu 2012 an example application of a prbw is in the ca mau province where they have successfully been constructed to minimize critical erosion that threatens the safety of sea dykes and protected mangrove forests the first construction of prbws in this region was 300 m long and constructed in 2010 at the coastline in khanh tien u minh district ca mau province this initial construction was later extended to approximately 22 km in 2019 see fig 2 after a decade of operation this prbw has demonstrated high efficiency and has reduced the impact of incoming waves leading to accretion and regeneration of mangroves on the west coast of the ca mau province the success of this prbw is a good indication that this style of breakwater is applicable for broader application across the soft soil foundation across the coast of the vmd a range of studies have considered the effectiveness of prbws for example nguyen huu nhan 2015 applied a coupled modelling of hydrodynamics and spectral sea wave on shallow water to evaluate the effectiveness of a prbw on the west sea of ca mau the results from this study showed high effectiveness of the prbw for aiding alluvial accumulation preventing rip circulation and wave action and protecting the coastline and mangrove belt liu 2012 applied linear potential theory to analyze the wave absorption of prbws the results from this study showed the relationship between wave transmission reflection and dissipation coefficients when the wave interacts with this a prbw but they did not validate their results with physical model experiments furthermore herbich 1998 conducted experiments to predict the transformation of waves passing through closely spaced pile or large cylinder breakwaters several researchers have conducted experiments and numerical modelling to reproduce the hydrodynamic near field processes and the vortex generation and dissipation by applying the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations for low crested permeable breakwaters garcia et al 2004 hsu et al 2004 martinelli et al 2006 this rans model has the ability to reproduce the near field flow characteristics around low crested structures moreover hur 2004 and hur et al 2011 investigated the effect of the slope gradient of submerged breakwaters by using a three dimensional numerical model and a three dimensional wave basin for their experiments johnson et al 2005 and johnson 2006 conducted research to study waves currents and wave breaking around submerged breakwaters and verified their results with three dimensional wave basin experiments and wave flume experiments at aalborg university denmark and the university of cantabria spain kramer et al 2005 respectively the results from these studies showed that the mike 21 model offers some confidence in the ability of the models to reproduce waves and currents of submerged breakwaters more recently ha 2019 undertook research on analytical and numerical analysis for the stability of prbw that are subjected to combined loading the authors of this study developed a method to calculate the bearing capacity of the prbw on soft clay soils this investigation of wave performance was not a comprehensive analysis in the contest of the west coast vmd and the research was mainly based on applying a formula for conventional rubble mound breakwaters that was not suitable to be applied to prbws based on the previous research on prbws the main objective of this study is to better understand the hydraulic performance of this type of breakwaters by analyzing the results from performing a series of physical model wave transmission experiments the specific objectives of this study are to 1 propose innovative structures of prbw that are both suitable for the soft soil foundation and also have a fast construction process that has the potential to save concrete and rubble construction materials in the vmd 2 determine the wave reduction transmission and dissipation coefficients through these prbws 3 develop an experimental formula for wave transmission to inform future design and construction of prwbs to address these specific objectives this paper is structured as follows in section 2 we describe the experimental setup and results of investigating wave transmission through a prbw based on observations in the laboratory in section 3 we then validate the experimental results by investigating wave transmission through prbw from observations in the field finally in section 4 we make conclusions from both the laboratory experiments as well as the observations in the field and provide recommendations for future work 2 wave transmission through prbw from observations in the laboratory in this section we first introduce the experimental model configuration followed by more details on the flume setup and instrumentation in the laboratory we then present the experimental scenarios explored and finish with a discussion of the experimental results 2 1 model configuration the in situ dimensions of the designed prbw structure were collected during a project that investigated coastal protection works in the vmd in 2017 the type of pile used in this structure is a pre stressed concrete pile with a diameter of 30 cm length of 8 m and a width crest of 2 6 m as indicated in the longitudinal cross section see fig 3 there is a row of piles with spacing of 30 cm between each pile in addition to the piles this prbw structure used rock rubble with dimensions of approximately 25 35 cm the cross section a a in fig 3 shows the melaleuca mattresses and geo textile layer below the rocks as well as the vertical beams 50 30 cm and the horizontal beam 30 30 cm above the rocks to fit the prbw into the wave flume in the laboratory the dimensions of the model structure were scaled to 1 5 of the in situ size the maximum model scale was selected based on the ability of the wave flume to house the breakwater and the boundary conditions of the experiment the model scale was selected as the following nl 5 scale of length and height n t n l 2 24 scale of time n v n l 2 24 scale of velocity and nm n3 l 125 scale of mass the dimensions of the actual breakwater and the model breakwater considered in this study are described in table 1 according to the designed parameters of the actual structure the rubbles had a grade of dn 25 35 cm the experimental rubbles grade is calculated from the model scale and is specified in table 2 the experimental rubbles grade is sieved according to laboratory standards to ensure consistency in the dimensions porosity and overall similarity in front of the structure there is rip rap which prevents erosion at a 7 cm height equal to 2 layers of rubble and is 50 cm wide fig 4 2 2 flume setup and instrumentation the experiments were carried out in the wave flume at the river and marine hydrodynamic laboratory of the southern institute of water resources research binh duong province vietnam the experimental equipment was installed by hr wallingford the flume is 35 m long effective 1 2 m wide and 1 5 m high it is equipped with an automated system of active reflection compensation arc and is capable of generating both regular and irregular waves up to 0 3 m in height and 3 s in peak period fig 4 reliable resistance type wave gauges have the ability to measure wave signals at a sampling frequency up to 100 hz accuracy 0 1 mm the single piston paddle long crested wavemaker has a width of 1 2 m the maximum water depth in the flume is 1 0 m and the maximum wave height is 0 6 m corresponding to a period of 2 0 s the wave flume setup has two wave absorbers that are separated by a thick foam sheet at the wave generator side and a trapezoidal prism of rubbles and gravel in rear side the remaining energy after the wave passes through the breakwater after 90 of the total wave energy is absorbed is absorbed by the rubble absorber the reflected wave energy from the paddle is absorbed after 95 of the total wave energy is absorbed by the thick foam sheet it is important to note that in the vmd the wave height in the southwest monsoon is largest in the deep water of the study area and is about 1 1 5 m with a period of 3 6 s the experiments in this study are instead built under the assumption that wave conditions are under medium weather conditions without storms the boundary conditions of the wave parameters were generated by the joint north sea wave observation project jonswap spectra with a γ value of 3 30 which was validated by the agence française de développement afd project the selection of featured wave parameters is based on various research of wave observation in the vmd by the southern institute of water resources research siwrr and is combined with wave transmission derived from a numerical model wave parameters in the front and behind the breakwater were measured with 6 capacitance wave gauges incident and reflected waves were separated by using 4 gauges with software processing in wave measurement by the hr wallingford system the wave gauge system to measure water level fluctuation included the following wave probes calibration stems calibration pins wave probe tripod stands twin wire cables and a wave probe monitor the wave height measurable range of this system was 300 mm the output signal was 10 v accuracy was 0 1 mm and internal noise limiting filter was 3 db at 20 hz signal bandwidth four gauges were installed in front of the breakwater wg1 2 3 4 and were used for measuring the incident wave and to separate the reflected wave and the incident wave in front of the breakwater two gauges were installed behind the breakwater wg5 6 and were used to determine the height of the wave passing through the breakwater each of the experiments lasted approximately 500 tp s to adequately produce the main frequency domain of the desired wave spectra the locations of wave gauges are described in the experiment layout illustrated in fig 5 2 3 experimental scenarios to investigate the wave transmission through the prbw 78 scenarios were used including 6 scenarios for changing water level and crest freeboard rc and 13 scenarios for changing wave parameters hs tp l the experimental scenarios are shown in detail in table 3 the water levels corresponding to the experimental scenarios considered are shown in fig 6 2 4 results and discussion wave transmission through prbws is generally a function of relative crest freeboard crest width breakwater slope porosity permeability and wave characteristics van der meer and daemen 1994 angremond et al 1996 in this study we analyzed the experimental data to formulate an empirical equation for wave transmission and examined the effects on wave transmission of the most influential parameters including the relative crest freeboard and the wave slope other secondary parameters implicitly included in this study are the crest width and the porosity of the prbw 2 4 1 change in the wave spectra and the wave period before and after the breakwater the changes in the wave spectra after passing the breakwater are show in fig 7 the wg4 and wg5 gauges indicate the recorded wave signal in front of and after the construction respectively fig 7 provides a visual representation of an important characteristic of the wave hydrodynamics for prbw and it is clear that the wave amplitude in front of the breakwater is significantly higher than the amplitude after transmitting through the breakwater the spectral transformation across the breakwater with a high crest emergence rc 0 and submergence rc 0 are illustrated in fig 8 logically wave energy considerably dissipates when the crest of the breakwater has an emergence of rc 0 see fig 8b than when the crest of breakwater has submergence with rc 0 see fig 8d in the submergence situation rc 0 the wave arrives in front of the structure with high energy of 7 10 3 m2 hz see fig 8c and after the wave transmits through the breakwater the energy is still high and equivalent to 2 10 3 m2 hz with a range of frequency within 0 5 1 hz see fig 8d the energy for both the emergence and the submergence case in front of structure are approximately the same comparing fig 8a c channel 4 this is not the case however after the breakwater where the differences in the energy spectra distribution for the emergence and the submergence cases are significant see fig 8b d this result occurs due to the wave energy being dissipated or reflected when the waves interact with the breakwater structure under the emergence case the changes about the peak period of the spectra crest tp and period of t1 3 of the measured waves in front of and behind the structure are shown in fig 9 the trend illustrates that the period of t1 3 has a significant change when comparing the peak period of spectra tp in front of and behind the breakwater structure behind the structure t1 3 has a trend of becoming larger than in front of the structure see deviation from the 1 1 line while tp has no significant change follows the 1 1 line this relationship is consistent with the theory of wave spectra analysis the reason this occurs is that the waves have a shorter period when dissipated after interacting with structure only long waves transmit through the structure because their t1 3 behind the structure are bigger than those in front of the structure this observed trend agrees with earlier studies by liu 2012 and dhinakaran 2011 the changes of wave period in front of and behind the breakwater structure have noticeable differences when considering either the case of the emerged breakwater rc 0 and the case of the submerged breakwater rc 0 with period wave spectra tm see fig 9 right panel in the case of the emerged breakwater the tm behind the structure has a larger trend than those in front of the structure this behavior is vice versa in the case of the submerged breakwater in the case of rc 0 the breakwater with crest width structure b 1 4lm min and b 1 10lm max works for wave transmission in the shallow water region however the crest width of the prbw is not large enough for waves to break on in the observable laboratory experiments the effect of shallow water makes the waves periods behind the structure reduce in comparison with those in front of the structure 2 4 2 change of wave height in front of the breakwater structure the fluctuation of water level in front of the structure increases due to the influence of wave reflection created from the interaction of the incident waves and the breakwater structure when the incident waves interfere with the reflected waves a fluctuated synthetic water level is created which then impacts the total wave height in front of the breakwater structure hm0 f as the resonance waves are always larger than the incident waves it follows that as the incident waves increase so do the resonance waves this variation is expressed by the before construction wave coefficient kf which is determined by the ratio between the wave height before construction hm0 f and the incident wave height hm0 i according to the formula 1 k f h m 0 f h m 0 i fig 10 shows that when the breakwater works in the submerged condition the coefficient kf is small i e kf 1 1 2 this is because most of the waves pass through the breakwater crest when the breakwater works in the emerged condition the coefficient kf is typically equal to 1 1 4 and reaches a maximum value corresponding to rc hm0 1 5 this relationship shows that incident and reflected waves can interact with each other to create a high total wave that interacts with the prbw and this relationship should be taken into consideration when designing prbw constructions 2 4 3 equations describing the influence of factors on the wave transmission process when a wave impacts a porous breakwater one part of the wave energy will be reflected in front of the structure another part of the wave energy will be dissipated and absorbed and the rest of the wave energy will be transmitted through the back of the breakwater theoretically this hydrodynamic problem obeys the law of conservation of energy and can be expressed in mathematical form by the energy balance formula burcharth and hughes 1993 2 e i e t e r e d in which ei et er and ed are the energy of the incident wave the transmitted wave the reflected wave and the dissipated wave respectively this energy balance formula can be rewritten as follows 3 1 h t h i 2 h r h i 2 e d e i n r n r 4 1 k t 2 k r 2 k d 2 in which the wave transmission coefficient k t h m 0 t h m 0 i is determined by the height of transmitted wave behind the structure hm0 t over the height of the incident wave in front of the structure hm0 t the k r h m 0 r h m 0 i wave reflection coefficient is determined by the height of reflected wave in front of the structure over the height of the incident wave in front of the structure hm0 t finally the kd coefficient can be determined based on the results of formula 4 5 k d 2 1 k t 2 k r 2 2 4 4 influence of the breakwater crest freeboard the relative crest freeboard rc hm0 i plays the most important role in wave transmission with regard to coastal structures this relative crest freeboard rc hm0 i depends on the following factors water level d structure height h and incident wave height hm0 i it follows that the transmission coefficient quickly declines in a linear trend with the increase of the relative freeboard and becomes almost constant kt 0 30 when rc hm0 0 50 generally a wave has low transmission through the breakwater when there is high crest emergence on the other hand the breakwater structure is not effective in damping the wave transmission when it gets submerged i e kt 0 7 0 8 as rc hm0 0 50 the reflection coefficient is plotted against the relative freeboard in fig 11 which indicates that this breakwater is highly reflective particularly in the case when the crest emerges above the water level i e kr 0 45 0 60 reflection generally increases as rc hm0 increases as the breakwater structure is not sufficiently porous to absorb wave energy in the case of high crest emergence reflected waves reach maximum value when rc hm0 i 1 2 with kr 0 55 0 60 when rc hm0 i 2 as in the low water level case the reflected waves have a slight decrease due to the rip rap in front of the structure this rip rap serves as a preventative measure to reduce erosion and absorbs a part of the reflected waves in front of the breakwater structure the relationship between rc hm0 i and kt kr kd is shown clearly when 1 5 rc hm0 i 1 5 fig 11 this is because it is the transitional boundary between the emerged and the submerged state of the breakwater the wave transmission coefficient kt demonstrates an inverted relationship with respect to the relative crest freeboard while the coefficients of wave reflection and wave energy dissipation illustrate a covariate trend with respect to relative crest freeboard when the breakwater submerges rc 0 a large number of waves transmit through the breakwater leading to a large wave transmission coefficient and small coefficients of wave reflection and wave energy dissipation on the other hand as the breakwater emerges rc increases wave reflection and wave energy dissipation increase leading to a smaller wave transmission coefficient the breakwater emerges until the wave overflows its crest rc hm0 i 1 5 and then the relationship chart between rc hm0 i with kt kr kd is almost horizontal this proves that the relative crest freeboard is not influential to the coefficient this observed trend in fig 11 is in agreement with the earlier work on linear potential theory by liu 2012 the higher the relative crest freeboard the more the wave energy dissipates see fig 12 the reflected waves reach maximum value when rc hm0 i 1 2 and kr 0 5 0 56 when rc hm0 i 2 the reflected wave energy has a slight decrease due to the rip rap in front of the breakwater structure this rip rap prevents erosion and absorbs a part of the reflected wave energy in front of the structure at low water level fig 12 shows the percentage of transmitted reflected and dissipated wave energy through the prbw corresponding to a varying relative crest freeboard rc hm0 i we see that the smallest dissipated wave energy 26 corresponds to the prbw in the submerged state rc hm0 i 1 5 in the case of the largest transmitted wave energy 68 the reflected wave energy is the smallest 6 the value of the dissipated wave energy increases gradually when changing from submerged state to emerged state 58 we also see that the reflected wave energy also increases with this trend and the largest 32 corresponds to rc hm0 i 1 5 which has a decreased transmitted wave energy 10 as the relative crest freeboard continues to increase rc hm0 i 1 5 the wave energy dissipated continues to increase the transmitted wave energy decreases slightly almost unchanged by about 10 and the reflected wave energy decreases slightly 2 4 5 influence of the wave slope on the front of the breakwater structure the relationship between the slope of waves and the wave coefficients is considered based on sp in which sp is slope of the wave corresponding to the peak period of the spectra crest tp the slope of the wave in front of the breakwater structure has an inverted relationship with coefficients of wave transmission and wave reflection see fig 13 between the wave reflection coefficient and the wave transmission coefficient that are measured directly in experiment the sensitivity of the correlation between the slope of the wave in front of the structure to the wave transmission coefficient is higher than the wave reflection coefficient this is indicated in fig 13 by the angular coefficient a which is greater in the resulting correlation lines direct measurements from the experiments of the wave transmission and the wave reflection coefficients results in the formulation of the correlation between the wave dissipation coefficient and the slope of wave this is a covariate relationship as indicated by fig 13 where the effect of the slope of the wave on the coefficient of wave dissipation depends on the value of the crest freeboard rc the relationship between rc hm0 i and both the wave transmission coefficient kt and the coefficient of wave reflection kr with different periods of waves is shown in fig 14 the effect of changing the wave period on the coefficient of wave transmission tends to be clearer than the wave reflection coefficient in the three wave conditions of hs 8 cm 12 cm and 16 cm especially in the case where rc hm0 i 0 1 5 with the same experimental wave height the greater the periodic wave t 2 23s the greater the transmission coefficient and the reflection coefficient compared to the small period wave t 1 34s the trend of the changing of the kt wave transmission coefficient is the most clear in the cases corresponding to rc hm0 i 0 1 5 2 4 6 developing an experimental formula to describe the wave transmission through a pile rock breakwater the earlier analysis of parameters that influence wave transmission through prbws is the base for building an experimental formula to describe this process the experimental formula that we present is built based on the previously available formula of van der meer and daemen 1994 and angremond et al 1996 therefore the wave transmission coefficient and the wave reflection coefficient are effected by several main factors including the relative freeboard rc hm0 i and the slope of the waves so note that compared to angremond et al 1996 the crest width b is not present in our equation eq 6 since in this case the porous breakwater is considered a narrow crested type of structure in fact its effect is implicitly included the general experimental formula is shown as 6 k t f r c h m 0 i s p k t a r c h m 0 i b s p c where a b are experimental constants of effectiveness of the factors relative freeboard rc hm0 i slope of waves sp c is a featured constant of other factors that is not considered in this experiment a b and c are determined by regression analysis with the data of the corresponding variables obtained from the experimental results the values of a b and c in this formula are obtained from regression analysis of the experimental data results from the fitting of the formulation of wave transmission with the relative freeboard rc hm0 i and the slope of the waves so the values of a b c are calculated my maximizing the correlation coefficient r2 results of this analysis are shown in fig 15 and demonstrate that the r2 value reaches a maximum of 0 83 when a 0 167 b 4 172 c 0 634 the fitted negative values of a and b show that there is an inverted relationship between the relative freeboard and the slope of the waves so the result of the regression analysis method gives the corresponding formula 7 k t 0 167 r c h m 0 i 4 172 s 0 0 634 with the range of application of the formula corresponding to r c h m 0 i 1 49 1 48 s o 0 009 0 051 k t 0 28 0 84 3 wave transmission through pile rock breakwater from observation in the field 3 1 observational setup to calculate the effectiveness of wave reduction from a prbw in the field a measurement campaign was carried out at a prbw structure located along the ganh hao coastline from the 18 19th of february 2020 a north east monsoon dominant time period along the coastline of the mekong delta there are two main wind seasons and the east sea is influenced by the northeast monsoon from november to march next year the installed instruments to measure wave reduction include two wave gauges with code ossi 010 022 that were provided by ocean sensor systems inc usa the locations of the installed equipment are approximately 30 m in front of and behind the prbw the measuring instrument locations on the front side of the prbw instrument sn001 and on the rear side of the prbw instrument sn002 at ganh hao are illustrated in fig 16 3 2 analysis of the results and comparison with experimental laboratory results the relationship between the wave height h1 3 and the wave period t1 3 from the field measured data is shown in fig 17 the observed wave height h1 3 ranges from 0 09 m to 0 81 m and the wave period values ranged from 3 04 s to 7 72 s analyzing the results we see that there is a positive trend between h1 3 and t1 3 when h1 3 0 4 m and in this range the wave period increases from 3 s to 7 s however when h1 3 0 4 m and h1 3 increases from 0 4 m to 0 8 m the wave period has only a slight variation around a value of t1 3 7 s indicated by the red line in fig 17 this stabilizing of the t1 3 is an indication that the wave threshold and the wave characteristic in this region has fully reached its maximum value the similarity in the shape of the wave spectrum between the observed field measurements and the laboratory experimental data is shown in fig 18 at the location before the construction the blue line the wave spectrum has a peak shape of power spectrum with a high energy distribution within frequency range of 0 1 0 16 hz in the field observations fig 18a and a frequency range of 0 5 1 0 hz in the laboratory experiments fig 18b note that in both cases there are some other frequency bands with smaller energy distributions at the location behind construction the red line the wave spectrum is flattened and the frequency bands are larger than is typical with a very small power spectrum due to the energy dissipation process when the wave transmits through the breakwater interestingly the appearance of gravity waves i e infragravity waves is also found in both field measurement and experimental data with frequency ranges from 0 006 hz to 0 02 hz see fig 18 the measured wave spectra as shown in fig 18 at a location on the foreshore instruments wg4 and sn002 clearly exhibits multiple peaks and flattens as the wave increases low frequency or infragravity waves are present and generated by the breaking processes of short period waves on the shallow foreshore as noted by baldock 2012 alternatively forced bound long waves induced by wave grouping are also released as free infragravity waves at the breaking points of the gravity waves the existence of these infragravity waves is probably inherent to the wave dynamics on a shallow foreshore as short gravity waves break the relative importance of infragravity waves start to increase this trend is in agreement with the earlier study performed by baldock 2012 fig 19 shows the results of analyzing the transmission coefficient between the field measurement and the laboratory experiment the results show that the transmission coefficient kt is similar in both the trends and the variable values in relation to the relative crest freeboard rc hi the transmission coefficient kt through the breakwater ranges from 0 26 to 0 56 corresponding to the rc hi value varying from 0 to 1 4 in the field measurements notably the wave transmission coefficient obtained from field measurement tends to be smaller than those derived from the laboratory experiment this difference may be due to the influence of the model ratio and other factors that impact the field measurement moreover the physical model reproduces wave propagation in two dimensions with a scale of 1 5 however the field measurement results are three dimensional and the ratio is 1 1 4 conclusions and recommendations pile rock breakwaters show significant potential to reduce erosion and rehabilitate mangrove forests in the vmd prbws have significant advantages over other styles of breakwaters these advantages include a reduced deadweight of construction materials and additional stability when compared to traditional trapezoidal breakwaters based on previous research that focused on prbw the main objective of this study was to better understand the hydraulic performance of prbws by analyzing the results from performing a series of physical model wave transmission experiments to address this objective this study has built a physical model to test hydraulic performance and wave transmission through prbw in the laboratory and compared with observations in the field the wave transmission process through the prbw is influenced by two important factors the relative crest freeboard rc hm0 and the slope of waves the results from the wave transmission through a prbw from observations in the laboratory showed the following 1 the short wave energy is mostly dissipated or reflected and that the waves behind the prbw are mostly long wave energy 2 the prbw structure works effectively with the wave transmission coefficient kt 0 3 0 4 when the breakwater works in the emerged state 3 the effect of the slope of the wave on the wave transmission coefficient is clearer than the wave reflection coefficient following the observations in the laboratory an experimental formula to describe the wave transmission through a prwb was developed and then applied to observations in the field this allowed the development of a relationship diagram between the transmission coefficient kt and the relative crest freeboard rc hi in both the experimental data and the field measured data the results indicate a high reliability for further design of prbws in addition to this relationship the experimental and measured results both showed the emergence of and increase of gravity waves the results from this work provide direction on the future design process of prbws firstly particular attention should be paid to the case of a high wave reflection coefficient kr 0 45 0 56 secondly in the case of an emerged breakwater special attention must be paid to the design of toe scour protection and for the case when the wave height before the prbw hm0 f is larger than the incident wave height hm0 i when this is 1 1 4 times larger this needs to be considered carefully to calculate the stability and the structure of the prbw future investigations related to prbws will need to consider the additional complexity of analyzing the complex wave energy dissipation by permeable breakwaters in addition to this future work will need to investigate variables that were not considered in this study including the influence of the width of the breakwater s crest and influence of the size of the rocks in the prbw on the wave transmission coefficient declaration of competing

21368,this paper presents a spacing configuration based energy saving optimization approach for a pair of auvs to achieve minimum resistance through the hull forms and propeller interactions the traveling resistance is relevant to hull lines optimization design which uncertainties exist in design variables need to be considered seriously a reliability analysis based on the first order reliability method demonstrates that the engineering quality is not acceptable thus the design for six sigma was performed with uncertainty optimization to improve the design levels two body force models rans ut and rans ho were used to represent the propeller as an axial and a tangential momentum source term the results highlight that the radial thrust distribution has a significant impact of the propeller performance for a pair of auvs the energy consumption of the fleet is classified into six zones depending on the spacing configurations with a longitudinal offset and transverse separation this study details and categorizes the relevant sources of the drag reduction and provides the most effective fleet configuration for the optimal energy profits to validate previous experimental results based on energy considerations the optimal fleet configuration is determined to show excellent adaptability and reliability to provide insights for decision makers keywords twin auvs reliability based optimization design design for six sigma dfss body force model spacing configurations fleet energy 1 introduction autonomous underwater vehicles auvs are controlled remotely using integrated actuation systems without external power or umbilical transmission during a mission the operation commands are often not limited to a single hull the members cooperate to perform certain tasks such as pipeline inspection fernandes et al 2015 mine hunting nguyen et al 2014 and deep ocean exploration zhou et al 2011 caiti et al 2014 while maintaining a geometric formation however there is finite incentive to consume less than the vehicle s total useful energy capacity instead of making full use of the energy this is because the propulsion costs are likely to increase the holistic energy costs this has led to increments in the energy consumption of vehicles which should be mitigated when the auv moves without a formation energy consumption may be reduced using the optimum hull form that is required to minimize the traveling resistance joung et al 2009 yan et al 2013 from a practical perspective there could be different sources of uncertainties in a problem e g environmental factors design variables performance estimates if the uncertainty of these parameters is frequently neglected this leads to products with a low robustness and potential hidden dangers in the design process as a result the results can cause a large deviation after continuous iteration and mutual coupling hence the uncertainty of the problem has to be considered by limiting the parameters with the means of probabilistic distributions and spatial variations then the optimal criteria are used for the optimization design in this context diez and peri 2010 takes the lead in setting the uncertainty parameters for the ship design to achieve a robust solution the robust design optimization rdo approach has been developed to solve single objective minimization problems such as those of the shell design diez and peri 2012 wave response papanikolaou et al 2014 and the velocity disturbance xia and shao 2014 with the advent of reliability based concept design there has also been an increased focus on the application of the reliability based design rbd hannapel and vlahopoulos 2010 this ensures that the optimal solution will satisfy the constraints in the presence of the uncertainty within a prescribed reliability level further computational efficiency in any stage during ship shell development is ensured using the first order reliability method form yang et al 2012 for estimating the reliability however this method is generally used to solve higher order equations otherwise it loses its assessment accuracy in some applications choi and yoo 2012 to replace the expensive functions during the optimization for shortening the computational time the subject of developing the approximation models hannapel 2012 related to the uncertainties is rational the design of experiment doe technique was developed to acquire the performance information which is quite useful for the ship design aldous et al 2015 recently based on estimation methods for the engineering design of distribution parameters the accuracy of the performance has been improved by extending the doe these methods include the taguchi method tm zheng et al 2016 monte carlo methods mcm hou et al 2018 and the response surface methodology rsm lafifi et al 2019 to satisfy the increasing demand for quality the design for six sigma dfss koziotek and derlukiewicz 2012 was presented to reduce the variability results to obtain higher productivity and quality and avoid potential defects dfss can effectively ensure that the quality level reaches 6σ which is widely used in several engineering design fields in the aspect of beginning the ship design this reflects the filtered data of the dfss which has more reliability for the environmental disturbance hou et al 2018 in addition a part of the energy benefit is contributed by the propulsive efficiency which has been enhanced likewise the hydrodynamic performance on the propeller is an influential factor stevenson et al 2007 phillips et al 2008 hough and ordway 1965 introduced the body force model to prescribe the thrust and moment distributions based on the radial circulation distributions the interactions of the rotating propeller which induce the axial and swirl accelerations in the fluid acting on the propeller are considered to be the source terms depending on the coupling method used with the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations the rans ut and rans ho models were developed to calculate the viscous flow over the stern by performing simulations phillips et al 2010a the results can be used to reveal the hydrodynamic behaviors in the same way as the experimental results a series of studies has been performed over a range of operational reynolds numbers to investigate the influence of the propeller race on the towed prolate spheroids and the self propelled auvs phillips et al 2010 rattanasiri et al 2012 2012a 2014 for a fleet of auvs the energy consumption consists of the individual energy cost of a single hull and the entire loss is related to the total drag variations in recent years many experiments suggest that the drag of a single hull is reduced for the specific fleet formation that is based on the spacing between the members in contrast the fleet energy profits can be promoted by ameliorating the individual drag reduction positively to some extent rattanasiri et al 2013 2015 afterwards molland and utama 2002 proposed the fleet configuration concept although not completely unified this concept distinguishes two standard spacing references namely the transverse separation s l and the longitudinal offset d l the main problem is that it is very unitary to perform the formation scheme when the energy changes preclude the propeller s effect at least for the unified hull dimension in fact the performance of the individual auv is determined by its hull shape which considerable influences the fleet energy benefit liang et al 2017 in summary the concept of fleet energy consumption is introduced as a drag reduction index that consists of three aspects and the overall procedures can be described as shown in fig 1 minimal energy consumption of an individual auv is required to minimize the single resistance obtained from the optimal hull shape the influence of propulsion is considered to obtain the complete drag for an independent auv which is achieved by predicting the hydrodynamic performance of the propeller by coupling the interactions between the hull and the propeller this study was extended to investigate the combined drag reduction of a fleet dominated by the spacing between members this study aims to provide guidance for operators for developing an energy saving approach for multiple auvs with various spacing configurations the auv hull lines are assumed to have a nystrom axial symmetry revolution body with uncertainty parameters based on the datcom formula the traveling resistance is obtained by establishing a deterministic design optimization dod model using the multi island genetic algorithm miga the first order reliability method form is employed to assess the reliability that corresponds to the levels of risks in the uncertainties thereby using dfss technology to improve the quality for the ship design optimization considering the influence of the thrust and torque two body force models rans ut and rans ho are used in simulations to predict the propeller self propulsion factors the energy consumption of the auvs fleet is defined as the index of the drag reduction which depends upon the transverse separation and the longitudinal offset the dominant spacing has been classified into six regions to investigate the effect of the various configurations on the energy budget 2 bare hull study 2 1 nystrom shape assumed in hull nystrom 1863 proposed the mathematical formula of the regular axial symmetry revolution body the head shape can be determined by rotating an ellipse around the main axis and the tail shape is formed by rotating a parabola around a straight line perpendicular to the directrix the nystrom type auv is composed of three parts the fore body the parallel middle body and the after body the implementation of the hull lines is controlled using six adjustable design parameters the formula of the hull shape is shown in eq 1 1 f o r e b o d y s h a p e y s x d 2 1 x s l s n s 1 n s a f t e r b o d y s h a p e y w x d 2 1 x w l w 1 n w where d is the middle body diameter a l s d is the fore body curve design parameter b l p d is the parallel middle body curve design parameter c l w d is the after body curve design parameter n s is the shape index of the fore body curve and n w is the shape index of the after body curve these six adjustable design parameters control the curves length and shape x is the distance from the vertex of bow l s is the fore body length l p is the cylinder length l w is the after body length x s and x w are the distance from the maximum radius of the fore body and the after body respectively the main properties of the nystrom auv are described in fig 2 2 2 resistance estimation method in regard to the research on the axial symmetry revolution body for expressing the auv hull shape the sailing resistance is calculated using an empirical formula computational fluid dynamics cfd and a model experiment the real environment is established artificially which leads to a high cost and a long period when employing the test model similarly when using the cfd method fast calculation results can be achieved only on high collocation computer hardware systems which are relatively expensive compared with the aforementioned methods the cost can be significantly reduced by using the empirical formula however the error is critical even though the mathematical algorithm is only considered in order to overcome the shortcoming of the low accuracy in the conventional formula de barros et al 2008 introduced the datcom formula using a semi empirical estimate method for predicting the auv traveling resistance for the bare hull the datcom formula shown in eq 2 provided a better approximation in comparison with the experimental results 2 r t 1 2 c v ρ s b u 2 1 2 c f ρ s s u 2 c v 1 02 c f 1 1 5 l d 1 5 7 l d 3 s s s b where r t is the resistance from a single hull c v is the viscous drag coefficient c f is the estimate of the skin friction drag coefficient according to 1957 ittc criterion l is the whole body length for the bare hull s b and s s are the maximum cross sectional area and the body wetted area respectively ρ is the water density and u is the traveling speed in this research nystrom body is considered as a single auv case and its resistance is estimated from the datcom formula in order to validate the enough accuracy of datcom formula cfd results would be used as the criterion all cases were computed using a k ε based turbulence model with no slip wall condition to solve the rans equations the domain is discretized using multiblock unstructured grids the grid is comprised of five base blocks with a total of 1 2 million elements discretization of the convection terms and viscous terms is achieved using a second order upwind scheme and the second order centered scheme respectively the pressure velocity coupling is solved by simple method fig 3 shows that the values estimated from the datcom formula are in agreement with the results of the numerical simulation the advantage of the datcom formula is that it has an excellent fitting accuracy for the ship resistance therefore it can be used in the single bare hull design process 2 3 deterministic optimization design dod to reduce the energy consumption of the auv during navigation the minimum traveling resistance is taken as the optimization objective this can limit the constraint conditions by restricting the volume and length because the electromechanical equipment requires sufficient installation space for the deterministic case without considering the random disturbance in the optimization results it is feasible that the constraints would be satisfied when inputting the design variables of six adjustable parameters in section 2 1 therefore an optimization target of the minimum resistance is realized by the deterministic optimization design dod model with the miga gao et al 2016 as described in table 1 table 2 shows the results of 5000 iterations of the miga notably the optimal design parameters come close to the constraint boundaries this means that uncertainty is probably present in the form of processing inaccuracies due to machine operating conditions generally in practical engineering it is inevitable that there will be some external factors associated with the machine or operators such as artificial disturbances dimension errors and drill wears that introduce uncertainty risks in other words stochastic uncertainties exist in the real world uncertainty analyses and optimization therefore have extreme importance for ship design considering the damage caused by dimension deviation the input design variables of a and n s and the output design variables of v and l are considered to be the risk factors if they are disturbed even slightly the design variables can easily violate the constraint boundaries due to the anisotropy of the materials and the processing technology in practical production in this study form was applied for the uncertainty analysis with respect to the dod results the aim is to control the design variables away from the failure surface 3 uncertainty optimization design 3 1 form reliability analysis since the uncertain characteristics of the parameters have a direct effect on the system performance s uncertainty a reliability analysis should be carried out to accurately estimate the performance uncertainty in the initial design stage an advantage of form is that when a small amount of uncertain factors are considered in the two dimensional space as a random distribution the accuracy of the computations can be effectively ensured here suppose the uncertainty parameters b i represents the variables in the performance function and p corresponds to a nonlinear system at this point the reliability closely corresponds to the probability of satisfying constraints in the system which is given by a set of means and variances this can be determined using eqs 3 and 4 3 μ p p μ b 1 μ b 2 μ b i 4 σ p 2 i 1 n p b i 2 σ b i 2 where μ b i is the mean of b i σ b i 2 is the variance of b i p b i is the system sensitivity associated with b i and μ p and σ p 2 are the mean and the variance of the performance function respectively as demonstrated in eq 3 and eq 4 the definition of the variance of the performance function in terms of the uncertainty parameters variances and the sensitivity only needs a low computational efficiency to solve the problem of the auv hull optimization the form transforms all of the random variables into standard normal variables hou et al 2018 this method converts the basic x variable space of a formulated limit state function g x into a u space where the variables u i are independent and are standard normal variables the failure limit state surface g 0 separates all combinations of x that lie in the failure domain f from those in the survival domain s consequently the probability of failure p f can be obtained using eq 5 5 p f p r x f p r g x 0 g x 0 f x x d x s where f x x is the joint probability density function pdf of x the reliability index β is the minimum distance between the point defined by the values of the mean point and the failure surface in other words β may be regarded as a safety margin to define how far the system is from failure as depicted in fig 4 if the condition fails higher risks may occur for determining the design point in order to observe these variables conveniently to satisfy the boundaries conditions or not in a realistic application the results from the reliability analysis of the dod model are used to measure the design quality of the σ level in the presence of the data the performance probability is estimated considering the source of the uncertainties as detailed in section 2 3 and table 3 the standard deviation σ is limited to 1 of μ which is useful when evaluating the quality of the results accordingly σ is defined as a small percentage of μ which can improve the reliability of the performance measures regarding the probability limitation that was discussed previously six design variables exhibited a strong normal distribution these design variables are regarded as uncertainty inputs and they have a finite range within a fixed interval in contrast the outputs are limited to a relatively wide range to satisfy the constraints and may present a greater danger due to uncertainty the inputs could dominate the outputs directly if the design results of the inputs are unacceptable slightly the output errors have a significant harmful effect on production performance the former is therefore considered a minor uncertainty factor and the latter as a main uncertainty factor accordingly v and l were identified as significant factors affecting the response outputs that is if the output quality level improves it is likely that all the uncertainty parameters will be within a suitable range for the design according to the σ level the quality can be measured effectively and considered as a percent variation or a probabilistic constraint which depends on the desired range within σ for the product requirement in this case the σ levels of v and l are all below 1 0 and they correspond to a poor design in practice as shown in table 4 for the purposes of increasing the design standard it is necessary to carry out the uncertainty optimization for the design of the auv hull form to achieve the next step 3 2 uncertainty optimization design based on dfss it might be guaranteed consistently for the manufacturing quality per batch the 3 σ quality level is defined as the range of an acceptable performance within 3 σ this criterion is mostly met for the desired product however in actual situations the 3 σ quality level is considered to be a poor design that contains hidden dangers resulting from its performance limitations as the 3 σ quality level is deemed unacceptable a new design concept based on the 6 σ quality was developed by motorola harry and schroeder 2000 this concept reflects the number of defects per million parts converted by the σ level the variability metrics are listed in table 5 as a powerful tool dfss is widely used in manufacturing processes typically the robust design for the six sigma quality includes two core ideas mean on target and minimize variation which are decomposed into the target function f and this can be determined as follows 6 f i 1 n ω 1 i s 1 i μ y i ω 2 i s 2 i σ y i 2 where i is the performance response of the performance parameter set y n is the number of responses μ y i and σ y i 2 are the mean and the variance of y i respectively ω 1 i and ω 2 i are the weights and s 1 i and s 2 i are the normalization coefficients in all cases it is prescribed that the mean target is identified so it is minimized or maximized the sign is used when the response mean minimized and the sign is used when the response mean is maximized fig 5 presents the implementations of the 6 σ approach which transforms all variables into the standardized form a generic optimization problem based on dfss is given as follows 7 m i n i m i z e s f μ y x σ y x s u b j e c t t o g μ y x σ y x 0 x l s l n σ x μ x x u s l n σ x c o n s t r a i n t s μ y n σ y l o w e r s p e c i f i c a t i o n l i m i t μ y n σ y u p p e r s p e c i f i c a t i o n l i m i t in order to find the set of basic variables x that includes the input parameters the target function f and the limit state function g are subject to constraints that the sigma level number m must reach m 6 to ensure the high quality requirement this aims to improve the two probabilistic design quality goals reliability and robustness to achieve a 6σ design with respect to improvement of the two mentioned quality goals the reliability is increased by striving to maintain the performance within the constraints or acceptable limits that are associated with the shifted distribution consistently the robustness is improved by reducing the variability and sensitivity of the design that is associated with the shrunk distribution koch et al 2004 fig 6 represents the 3 σ design is promoted to 6 σ design with the aim of the probability that the performance will remain within the set limits is essentially 100 the performance distribution must be shrunk to improve the robustness also the reliability is strived to maintain performance within acceptable limits which is defined as the probability of satisfying constraints the lower specification limit lsl and the upper specification limit usl for the target variations are held fixed to a certain value with both shift and shrink the reliability level is achieved the robustness improved and the worst case performance not significantly affected this is the desired goal in implementing dfss in this section the dfss optimization is applied to the hull design of a bare auv which is subjected to uncertain usage conditions as mentioned earlier the parameters are set in accordance with the probability distribution the previous inputs are all normally distributed and can be simply transformed to avoid errors due to the worst case performances table 6 also presents the uncertainty optimization results that the criteria achieved which are significant by using the origin of the data from the dod model an exceptional improvement in the σ level σ level 6 directly indicates that the dfss technique that is used in the auv hull has a good performance for the quality requirement as demonstrated in fig 7 there are three types of results for the hull line design that are related to the initial condition the dod model and dfss technology 4 body force model for the self propelled auv to understand the features of the flow encircling the propeller disc the body force models developed by hough and ordway 1965 were used as a new simulation method for describing the hydrodynamic performance of vehicles powered by a propulsion system a more insightful numerical simulation that is based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method indicates that this is an efficient computation that can obtain an accurate outcome which has been demonstrated in a few published papers phillips et al 2008 rattanasiri et al 2012 following this approach the geometry of the propeller is not explicitly represented and a radial distribution of the thrust and torque is provided the tip and root are assumed to be null in order to meet the best circulation mode two models rans ut and rans ho were used in this study based on whether the torque distribution exists or not 4 1 uniform thrust distribution model rans ut the rans ut body force model is applied to the conceptual design of the auv propeller while assuming a uniform distribution of the thrust over the propeller disc and neglecting the torque the axial momentum source term f b x and the tangential momentum source term f b θ can determined through eq 8 and eq 9 respectively 8 f b x t δ x π r p 2 r h 2 9 f b θ 0 where δ x is the thickness of the propeller sub domain r p and r h are the radius of the propeller and the hub respectively and t is the self propelled thrust according to the numerical predictions or the open water tests fig 8 following this approach the physical dimensions of the virtual domain should be selected to represent the propeller perfectly however the mesh domain with the cylinder hardly coincides to the real region modeled from the propeller irregular shape thus the calculated solution of the thrust based on the body force model is modified to approximate the theoretical value specifically the error is limited to 2 based on the thrust correction 4 2 hough and ordway thrust and torque distribution model rans ho the rans ho body force model was proposed by hough and ordway and they considered the circulation distribution which has zero loading at the tip and the root it assumes that the thrust and the torque are required to capture the slipstream directly through the propeller this distribution was coupled with a rans simulation and was implemented by rattanasiri et al 2015 the aforementioned technique was adopted for the present study the non dimensional thrust distribution f b x and the non dimensional torque distribution f b θ are given by eqs 10 13 10 f b x a x r 1 r 11 f b θ a θ r 1 r 1 y h r y h and 12 a x c t h δ x 105 16 4 3 y h 1 y h 13 a θ k q δ x j 2 105 π 4 3 y h 1 y h note that k q is the torque coefficient with a finite thickness δ x the momentum source terms are then applied to an annulus and are defined using eqs 14 16 14 r y y h 1 y h 15 y r p r p 16 y h r h r p where r is the non dimensional radius r p is the distance from an arbitrary point in the propeller domain to the axes and c t h and k t represent the thrust coefficient with different forms as shown in eq 17 17 c t h k t π 8 j 2 t 1 2 ρ v a 2 π r p 2 18 j v a 2 n r r p 19 v a 1 ω t v where v is the vehicle speed v a is the advance speed j is the advance coefficient ω t is the wake fraction and n r is the revolutions per second 4 3 self propulsion factors prediction according to the optimization results of the auv hull based on the dfss in section 3 the body force model is used to predict the propeller self propulsion factors herein the ratio of the finite length of the propeller disc and the maximum diameter of the disc is suggested to be more than 0 1 as verified by a series of experimental tests phillips et al 2010 hence the propeller performance is selected from the mau4 54 type to align the area on the after body of the auv the other parameters are shown in table 7 the lower section of fig 9 presents this in detail it has to be noted that k q and k t are obtained by the experimental open water curves therefore the thrust coefficient and the torque coefficient equations are related to j they are fitted through the cubic polynomial curves as shown 20 k t 0 03939 j 3 0 1946 j 2 0 2467 j 0 2946 21 10 k q 0 09343 j 3 0 2475 j 2 0 2129 j 0 3211 an equality thrust method is used with rans ut and rans ho to predict the self propulsion factors depending on whether the torque distribution is considered it is impossible to measure all the parameters of the self propulsion factors directly an estimate formula is employed to obtain the thrust coefficient with respect to j as presented by eq 22 22 k t t j 2 4 ρ v a 2 r p 2 where k t is the estimation of the thrust coefficient after rendering the k t curve and the experimental open water curves of k q and k t into the same figure the advance coefficient j is obtained which is the abscissa of the intersection point and this is demonstrated in fig 10 in addition the other parameters were obtained from the j result and are presented in table 8 when comparing the results the propeller self propulsion factors predicted by rans ho are clearly similar to those predicted by rans ut although the tangential velocity is distributed which surrounds the disc the propeller dimensions are dominated by the axial momentum source term rather than the tangential momentum source term in other words if the auv propeller is operated at only a thrust distribution then the performance related to the considered torque can be determined equivalently moreover the simulation time is significantly reduced because only the thrust is acting on the cylindrical region with an axial velocity distribution hence the computational cost can be effectively reduced the prediction of the propeller self propulsion factors was accurately performed by the rans ho and rans ut body force models these models were validated by researchers from shanghai jiaotong university wu et al 2013 their summaries for the problems are very close to our study results consequently in later sections the resultant effect of the propeller interaction is more achievable given by the rans ut body force model to effectively lighten the computational burden and to maintain the precision 5 optimal configuration of the fleet on the drag to thoroughly investigate the interference of the propeller on the downstream flow assuming that the auv is fully submerged in deep water the effect of the wave is neglected by implementing the thrust distribution on the propeller using rans ut the impact of the propeller is to re energize the wake for a single hull however this race will interact with the following auv directly downstream hence it impacts its own drag even the total energy consumption of an auv fleet may be driven by the change in the individual drag for one vehicle 5 1 twin hulls formation a comparative test with a pair of auvs formation was performed to understand the flow over the body especially the resistance characteristics of the viscous interaction between the bodies molland and utama 2002 the spacing for the twin hull formation is defined as a transverse separation s l and a longitudinal offset d l with a number of ratios the parameters are defined as follows d represents the longitudinal distance between each nose of the bodies s is the transverse distance between the sidelines of each body l is the total length of a single auv a 0 is the auv leader that is designed by the uncertainty optimization that is based on dfss in section 3 and the propeller self propulsion factors are determined by the rans ut body force model in section 4 the follower auvs a 1 a 2 a 3 with different transverse separations and longitudinal offsets are related to a 0 as demonstrated in fig 11 they are classified into the parallel formation the drafting formation and the interactive formation by varying the transverse separation s l 0 165 0 0 17 0 27 0 37 and 0 47 the longitudinal offset d l 0 0 27 0 57 0 87 1 17 1 47 and 1 77 were selected the magnitude of the drag variations for each member is consistent rattanasiri et al 2012 5 2 energy consumption related to the drag the largest contribution to the drag of the fleet in the self propelled auv has an impact on spacing which was validated by rattanasiri in a series of tests for a variety of configurations rattanasiri et al 2013 in this study some findings are discussed in terms of the drag reduction to determine the energy consumption for the fleet according to the fluctuation trend of the individual drags and the combined drag an energy budget index should be defined as a percentage difference which can be expressed using eq 23 23 a r a 0 r a r a 100 b r a 1 r a r a 100 c r a 0 r a 1 2 r a 2 r a 100 where a and b represent the percentage differences of the individual drags of the leader a 0 and the follower a 1 while maintaining a fixed formation as mentioned in section 5 1 referenced to a single self propelled auv drag c is the percentage difference of the combined drag referenced to the sum of the two single hull drags twice as much as the single drag r a 0 and r a 1 are the drag coefficients of a 0 and a 1 for sailing cooperatively in a fleet and r a is the single case drag coefficient the signs and indicate the increase and the decrease of the self propelled drag and it also represents the energy benefit and deficit respectively 5 3 spacing configurations for the auv fleet it should be noted that the results suggest some energy beneficial configurations exist for the individuals and the whole fleet for some configurations this may increase the burden for the members in some specific configurations although the changes of the individual drags exist the same trend very small gains or losses are possible for the fleet these results are classified into six regions as shown in fig 12 depending on the different signs for the configuration percentage difference given in table 9 5 3 1 parallel region the parallel region is when the leader and the follower travel towards the inflow direction with a parallel formation this configuration is defined at d l 0 which indicates that the noses are aligned with the same tangent an increment in the total drag is demonstrated in fig 13 a it depends on the increase in each hull as shown in fig 14 a however it hardly increases more than 2 focusing on a single vehicle for comparison the drag increment of the leader is approximately equal to that of the follower owing to the symmetric numerical fluid domain theoretically the comparison between the two hulls reveals identical drag variations in the wind tunnel mercker 1986 however the source of the error is likely affected by the wall condition that is established as a finite tank rather than an infinite field in addition the drag increment for each hull is reduced along with the extended spacing owing to the viscous interactions these characteristics of the drag penalty were suggested in an experimental study molland and utama 2002 that the minimum transverse separation must be at least 0 5 l to preclude body to body interaction 5 3 2 echelon region the follower achieves synchronization between 0 27 d l 0 57 meanwhile the transverse separation is limited at s l 0 17 and s l 0 47 in addition the configuration of the fleet has the same formation as the echelon or a part of vee can be divided into the echelon region from fig 13 b and fig 14 b there is a significant increase in the leader s drag and the follower shows a contrary tendency finally these changes have a slightly negative influence on the combined drag since this region is discontinuous with a symmetric distribution the viscous interactions experience a strong disturbance when a pair body surface adheres at s l 0 17 otherwise this appears to be a relatively steady state for a long distance where s l 0 47 particularly in an unaccompanied auv the rise and fall of the individual drags are almost equal in addition the follower has an increment in its energy profit this is due to the change in the pressure dominated by the bow shape however an increase of the total drag that is exerted onto the fleet leads to very little loss of energy in other words there are no benefits that refer to the fleet energy in this region 5 3 3 low gain region as the longitudinal offset is limited to one body length with d l 1 17 the scope of the transverse separation s l is extended from 0 17 to 0 47 from this the spacing configuration of the fleet is categorized as a low gain region the individual drag corresponding to a single hull presents the trend that these coefficients first increase and then decrease toward the zero drag depicted in fig 14 b the measurand is the combined drag in the fleet which reflects the low energy savings and it is on average less than 2 phillips et al 2008 as demonstrated in fig 13 b when considering fig 14 b there is an inflection point that is clearly located at d l 0 87 which leads to a violent drop for the individual drag this is caused by the force interaction that a low gain is obtained for the fleet s energy although the characteristics of the single hull resistance are similar to those in the echelon region the energy scheme was optimized with a relatively smaller magnitude 5 3 4 following region as a unique region where the nose of the follower is fixed near the trailing edge of the leader the transverse separation and the longitudinal offset are limited at s l 0 and d l 0 87 respectively for the first time the drag of the leader auv is provided with a reduction in fig 14 b a moderate increase of 0 8 in the combined drag was observed as shown in fig 13 b the source of the drag dropping which is significant for the leader was identified to be the increased pressure recovery as suggested by rattanasiri et al 2014 the downstream pressure of the frontal vehicle was reinforced due to the bow stagnation point of a 1 offset backward thus the pressure resistance of the a 0 is reduced leading to a decrease in the individual drag this configuration presents a streamline formation for the fleets underwater however the augment of the total energy consumption may adversely affect the endurance 5 3 5 low interaction region by placing the follower at a posterior lateral position for d l 1 17 and 0 s l 0 37 the reference to the leader where the longitudinal distance between a pair of propellers is beyond one body length at the beginning the individual drag of the frontal auv experiences a significant decrease at 0 s l 0 17 in fig 14 a thus both hulls are surrounded by the steady flow and obtain a wake recovery to supply the energy for the fleet consequently less than 5 energy is saved in the formation as demonstrated in fig 13 a these characteristics occurred due to the body to body interactions near the body surface the boundary layer flow is considered to exhibit turbulent changes the beginning of this region will be referred to as the transition point in which the velocity shows an abnormal fluctuation or an anomaly silverstein and becker 1938 the maximum drag dropping of the fleet is implemented by the minimum race deduction of the leader s propeller when the spacing configuration is s l 0 these results agree with those obtained in by molland and utama 2002 in which the optimal transverse separation is obtained at s l 0 05 5 3 6 beneficial region for the largest region where the vehicle behind the frontal propeller is submerged in a fully developed turbulent flow the longitudinal offset is limited at d l 1 17 but the transverse separation s l is extended to all the conditions according to fig 13 b and fig 14 a the combined drag is decreased by the follower s propeller wake recovery rattanasiri et al 2014 thus the total energy significantly improves across the fleet by having an increase in the longitudinal offset until d l 1 47 the variation of the leader drag tends to be stable because of the reinforced downstream flow thus these hydrodynamic behaviors are replicated from cars that have a slipstream in the convoy the results of this study are close to the empirical constants applied in cars tested by crabtree 1998 for example regardless of the auvs or the road vehicles at d l 1 17 and s l 0 the drag reduction of the leader is 18 in the end the combined drag for the fleets is reduced by at least half for the individuals at 9 the propeller of the leading auv may directly affect the bow of the following auv by producing a downstream flow when d l 1 77 the distance between the twin hulls is sufficient for the interaction of the propeller wake to be neglected rattanasiri et al 2015 therefore the individual drag coefficients for the leader and the follower are equal to the single hull s drag coefficient hence a b and c can be estimated to be zero by adopting this configuration it is obvious that the energy profits improve the productivity for the auv fleet 6 conclusion this study attempts to investigate the energy saving approach for the auvs fleet depending on both the spacing configurations and the propeller interactions which has a high relevance to hull form design this is first achieved by creating the hull lines design for an individual vehicle and then extended to consider a fleet of two self propelled auvs operating at a range of longitudinal offset and transverse separation it is found that because the previous analysis for the most significant sources of uncertainty is not performed the deterministic optimization design has been conducted for the case study considered here the design variables are likely to violate the constraint boundaries easily in operating environment hence the form reliability analysis is employed to assess the quality levels of the parameters however the results indicate that some parameters are found to have the unacceptable reliabilities which is not reaching the design standard in engineering as a result the dfss technology that is used in this study to improve the quality levels holds great potential in engineering optimization for vehicle design it is demonstrated that the body force models rans ut and rans ho for replicating the impact of the propeller could be used by modeling the momentum source terms the results highlight the radial thrust distribution has a significant impact of the propeller performance the tangential momentum source term is determined by the torque distribution however it is found to have a faint effect on the propeller performance in comparison to the axial momentum source term by aiming to understand the energy budget of a fleet to achieve energy savings this study provides useful information for the operator to determine an effective formation of a pair of auvs this stems from the fact that the type and the particular configuration of the vehicle under study along with the influence of the propeller race must be considered and that dominant spacing must be chosen six zones are identified based on the characteristics of the drag changes these are the parallel region echelon region low gain region following region low interaction region and beneficial region the optimum energy configuration can be indicated in the transverse separation and the longitudinal offset with respect to the spacing of the twin hull as is discussed in this research the beneficial region where the follower is placed directly behind the leader with the longitudinal distance beyond one body length is found the most effective formation based on energy considerations our future work will be focused on increasing the number of auvs in a fleet while addressing a comparison of the energy consumption that may be influenced by the team formation in addition towing tank experiments will be conducted to verify the reliability of the uncertainty parameters in the hull design credit authorship contribution

21368,this paper presents a spacing configuration based energy saving optimization approach for a pair of auvs to achieve minimum resistance through the hull forms and propeller interactions the traveling resistance is relevant to hull lines optimization design which uncertainties exist in design variables need to be considered seriously a reliability analysis based on the first order reliability method demonstrates that the engineering quality is not acceptable thus the design for six sigma was performed with uncertainty optimization to improve the design levels two body force models rans ut and rans ho were used to represent the propeller as an axial and a tangential momentum source term the results highlight that the radial thrust distribution has a significant impact of the propeller performance for a pair of auvs the energy consumption of the fleet is classified into six zones depending on the spacing configurations with a longitudinal offset and transverse separation this study details and categorizes the relevant sources of the drag reduction and provides the most effective fleet configuration for the optimal energy profits to validate previous experimental results based on energy considerations the optimal fleet configuration is determined to show excellent adaptability and reliability to provide insights for decision makers keywords twin auvs reliability based optimization design design for six sigma dfss body force model spacing configurations fleet energy 1 introduction autonomous underwater vehicles auvs are controlled remotely using integrated actuation systems without external power or umbilical transmission during a mission the operation commands are often not limited to a single hull the members cooperate to perform certain tasks such as pipeline inspection fernandes et al 2015 mine hunting nguyen et al 2014 and deep ocean exploration zhou et al 2011 caiti et al 2014 while maintaining a geometric formation however there is finite incentive to consume less than the vehicle s total useful energy capacity instead of making full use of the energy this is because the propulsion costs are likely to increase the holistic energy costs this has led to increments in the energy consumption of vehicles which should be mitigated when the auv moves without a formation energy consumption may be reduced using the optimum hull form that is required to minimize the traveling resistance joung et al 2009 yan et al 2013 from a practical perspective there could be different sources of uncertainties in a problem e g environmental factors design variables performance estimates if the uncertainty of these parameters is frequently neglected this leads to products with a low robustness and potential hidden dangers in the design process as a result the results can cause a large deviation after continuous iteration and mutual coupling hence the uncertainty of the problem has to be considered by limiting the parameters with the means of probabilistic distributions and spatial variations then the optimal criteria are used for the optimization design in this context diez and peri 2010 takes the lead in setting the uncertainty parameters for the ship design to achieve a robust solution the robust design optimization rdo approach has been developed to solve single objective minimization problems such as those of the shell design diez and peri 2012 wave response papanikolaou et al 2014 and the velocity disturbance xia and shao 2014 with the advent of reliability based concept design there has also been an increased focus on the application of the reliability based design rbd hannapel and vlahopoulos 2010 this ensures that the optimal solution will satisfy the constraints in the presence of the uncertainty within a prescribed reliability level further computational efficiency in any stage during ship shell development is ensured using the first order reliability method form yang et al 2012 for estimating the reliability however this method is generally used to solve higher order equations otherwise it loses its assessment accuracy in some applications choi and yoo 2012 to replace the expensive functions during the optimization for shortening the computational time the subject of developing the approximation models hannapel 2012 related to the uncertainties is rational the design of experiment doe technique was developed to acquire the performance information which is quite useful for the ship design aldous et al 2015 recently based on estimation methods for the engineering design of distribution parameters the accuracy of the performance has been improved by extending the doe these methods include the taguchi method tm zheng et al 2016 monte carlo methods mcm hou et al 2018 and the response surface methodology rsm lafifi et al 2019 to satisfy the increasing demand for quality the design for six sigma dfss koziotek and derlukiewicz 2012 was presented to reduce the variability results to obtain higher productivity and quality and avoid potential defects dfss can effectively ensure that the quality level reaches 6σ which is widely used in several engineering design fields in the aspect of beginning the ship design this reflects the filtered data of the dfss which has more reliability for the environmental disturbance hou et al 2018 in addition a part of the energy benefit is contributed by the propulsive efficiency which has been enhanced likewise the hydrodynamic performance on the propeller is an influential factor stevenson et al 2007 phillips et al 2008 hough and ordway 1965 introduced the body force model to prescribe the thrust and moment distributions based on the radial circulation distributions the interactions of the rotating propeller which induce the axial and swirl accelerations in the fluid acting on the propeller are considered to be the source terms depending on the coupling method used with the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations the rans ut and rans ho models were developed to calculate the viscous flow over the stern by performing simulations phillips et al 2010a the results can be used to reveal the hydrodynamic behaviors in the same way as the experimental results a series of studies has been performed over a range of operational reynolds numbers to investigate the influence of the propeller race on the towed prolate spheroids and the self propelled auvs phillips et al 2010 rattanasiri et al 2012 2012a 2014 for a fleet of auvs the energy consumption consists of the individual energy cost of a single hull and the entire loss is related to the total drag variations in recent years many experiments suggest that the drag of a single hull is reduced for the specific fleet formation that is based on the spacing between the members in contrast the fleet energy profits can be promoted by ameliorating the individual drag reduction positively to some extent rattanasiri et al 2013 2015 afterwards molland and utama 2002 proposed the fleet configuration concept although not completely unified this concept distinguishes two standard spacing references namely the transverse separation s l and the longitudinal offset d l the main problem is that it is very unitary to perform the formation scheme when the energy changes preclude the propeller s effect at least for the unified hull dimension in fact the performance of the individual auv is determined by its hull shape which considerable influences the fleet energy benefit liang et al 2017 in summary the concept of fleet energy consumption is introduced as a drag reduction index that consists of three aspects and the overall procedures can be described as shown in fig 1 minimal energy consumption of an individual auv is required to minimize the single resistance obtained from the optimal hull shape the influence of propulsion is considered to obtain the complete drag for an independent auv which is achieved by predicting the hydrodynamic performance of the propeller by coupling the interactions between the hull and the propeller this study was extended to investigate the combined drag reduction of a fleet dominated by the spacing between members this study aims to provide guidance for operators for developing an energy saving approach for multiple auvs with various spacing configurations the auv hull lines are assumed to have a nystrom axial symmetry revolution body with uncertainty parameters based on the datcom formula the traveling resistance is obtained by establishing a deterministic design optimization dod model using the multi island genetic algorithm miga the first order reliability method form is employed to assess the reliability that corresponds to the levels of risks in the uncertainties thereby using dfss technology to improve the quality for the ship design optimization considering the influence of the thrust and torque two body force models rans ut and rans ho are used in simulations to predict the propeller self propulsion factors the energy consumption of the auvs fleet is defined as the index of the drag reduction which depends upon the transverse separation and the longitudinal offset the dominant spacing has been classified into six regions to investigate the effect of the various configurations on the energy budget 2 bare hull study 2 1 nystrom shape assumed in hull nystrom 1863 proposed the mathematical formula of the regular axial symmetry revolution body the head shape can be determined by rotating an ellipse around the main axis and the tail shape is formed by rotating a parabola around a straight line perpendicular to the directrix the nystrom type auv is composed of three parts the fore body the parallel middle body and the after body the implementation of the hull lines is controlled using six adjustable design parameters the formula of the hull shape is shown in eq 1 1 f o r e b o d y s h a p e y s x d 2 1 x s l s n s 1 n s a f t e r b o d y s h a p e y w x d 2 1 x w l w 1 n w where d is the middle body diameter a l s d is the fore body curve design parameter b l p d is the parallel middle body curve design parameter c l w d is the after body curve design parameter n s is the shape index of the fore body curve and n w is the shape index of the after body curve these six adjustable design parameters control the curves length and shape x is the distance from the vertex of bow l s is the fore body length l p is the cylinder length l w is the after body length x s and x w are the distance from the maximum radius of the fore body and the after body respectively the main properties of the nystrom auv are described in fig 2 2 2 resistance estimation method in regard to the research on the axial symmetry revolution body for expressing the auv hull shape the sailing resistance is calculated using an empirical formula computational fluid dynamics cfd and a model experiment the real environment is established artificially which leads to a high cost and a long period when employing the test model similarly when using the cfd method fast calculation results can be achieved only on high collocation computer hardware systems which are relatively expensive compared with the aforementioned methods the cost can be significantly reduced by using the empirical formula however the error is critical even though the mathematical algorithm is only considered in order to overcome the shortcoming of the low accuracy in the conventional formula de barros et al 2008 introduced the datcom formula using a semi empirical estimate method for predicting the auv traveling resistance for the bare hull the datcom formula shown in eq 2 provided a better approximation in comparison with the experimental results 2 r t 1 2 c v ρ s b u 2 1 2 c f ρ s s u 2 c v 1 02 c f 1 1 5 l d 1 5 7 l d 3 s s s b where r t is the resistance from a single hull c v is the viscous drag coefficient c f is the estimate of the skin friction drag coefficient according to 1957 ittc criterion l is the whole body length for the bare hull s b and s s are the maximum cross sectional area and the body wetted area respectively ρ is the water density and u is the traveling speed in this research nystrom body is considered as a single auv case and its resistance is estimated from the datcom formula in order to validate the enough accuracy of datcom formula cfd results would be used as the criterion all cases were computed using a k ε based turbulence model with no slip wall condition to solve the rans equations the domain is discretized using multiblock unstructured grids the grid is comprised of five base blocks with a total of 1 2 million elements discretization of the convection terms and viscous terms is achieved using a second order upwind scheme and the second order centered scheme respectively the pressure velocity coupling is solved by simple method fig 3 shows that the values estimated from the datcom formula are in agreement with the results of the numerical simulation the advantage of the datcom formula is that it has an excellent fitting accuracy for the ship resistance therefore it can be used in the single bare hull design process 2 3 deterministic optimization design dod to reduce the energy consumption of the auv during navigation the minimum traveling resistance is taken as the optimization objective this can limit the constraint conditions by restricting the volume and length because the electromechanical equipment requires sufficient installation space for the deterministic case without considering the random disturbance in the optimization results it is feasible that the constraints would be satisfied when inputting the design variables of six adjustable parameters in section 2 1 therefore an optimization target of the minimum resistance is realized by the deterministic optimization design dod model with the miga gao et al 2016 as described in table 1 table 2 shows the results of 5000 iterations of the miga notably the optimal design parameters come close to the constraint boundaries this means that uncertainty is probably present in the form of processing inaccuracies due to machine operating conditions generally in practical engineering it is inevitable that there will be some external factors associated with the machine or operators such as artificial disturbances dimension errors and drill wears that introduce uncertainty risks in other words stochastic uncertainties exist in the real world uncertainty analyses and optimization therefore have extreme importance for ship design considering the damage caused by dimension deviation the input design variables of a and n s and the output design variables of v and l are considered to be the risk factors if they are disturbed even slightly the design variables can easily violate the constraint boundaries due to the anisotropy of the materials and the processing technology in practical production in this study form was applied for the uncertainty analysis with respect to the dod results the aim is to control the design variables away from the failure surface 3 uncertainty optimization design 3 1 form reliability analysis since the uncertain characteristics of the parameters have a direct effect on the system performance s uncertainty a reliability analysis should be carried out to accurately estimate the performance uncertainty in the initial design stage an advantage of form is that when a small amount of uncertain factors are considered in the two dimensional space as a random distribution the accuracy of the computations can be effectively ensured here suppose the uncertainty parameters b i represents the variables in the performance function and p corresponds to a nonlinear system at this point the reliability closely corresponds to the probability of satisfying constraints in the system which is given by a set of means and variances this can be determined using eqs 3 and 4 3 μ p p μ b 1 μ b 2 μ b i 4 σ p 2 i 1 n p b i 2 σ b i 2 where μ b i is the mean of b i σ b i 2 is the variance of b i p b i is the system sensitivity associated with b i and μ p and σ p 2 are the mean and the variance of the performance function respectively as demonstrated in eq 3 and eq 4 the definition of the variance of the performance function in terms of the uncertainty parameters variances and the sensitivity only needs a low computational efficiency to solve the problem of the auv hull optimization the form transforms all of the random variables into standard normal variables hou et al 2018 this method converts the basic x variable space of a formulated limit state function g x into a u space where the variables u i are independent and are standard normal variables the failure limit state surface g 0 separates all combinations of x that lie in the failure domain f from those in the survival domain s consequently the probability of failure p f can be obtained using eq 5 5 p f p r x f p r g x 0 g x 0 f x x d x s where f x x is the joint probability density function pdf of x the reliability index β is the minimum distance between the point defined by the values of the mean point and the failure surface in other words β may be regarded as a safety margin to define how far the system is from failure as depicted in fig 4 if the condition fails higher risks may occur for determining the design point in order to observe these variables conveniently to satisfy the boundaries conditions or not in a realistic application the results from the reliability analysis of the dod model are used to measure the design quality of the σ level in the presence of the data the performance probability is estimated considering the source of the uncertainties as detailed in section 2 3 and table 3 the standard deviation σ is limited to 1 of μ which is useful when evaluating the quality of the results accordingly σ is defined as a small percentage of μ which can improve the reliability of the performance measures regarding the probability limitation that was discussed previously six design variables exhibited a strong normal distribution these design variables are regarded as uncertainty inputs and they have a finite range within a fixed interval in contrast the outputs are limited to a relatively wide range to satisfy the constraints and may present a greater danger due to uncertainty the inputs could dominate the outputs directly if the design results of the inputs are unacceptable slightly the output errors have a significant harmful effect on production performance the former is therefore considered a minor uncertainty factor and the latter as a main uncertainty factor accordingly v and l were identified as significant factors affecting the response outputs that is if the output quality level improves it is likely that all the uncertainty parameters will be within a suitable range for the design according to the σ level the quality can be measured effectively and considered as a percent variation or a probabilistic constraint which depends on the desired range within σ for the product requirement in this case the σ levels of v and l are all below 1 0 and they correspond to a poor design in practice as shown in table 4 for the purposes of increasing the design standard it is necessary to carry out the uncertainty optimization for the design of the auv hull form to achieve the next step 3 2 uncertainty optimization design based on dfss it might be guaranteed consistently for the manufacturing quality per batch the 3 σ quality level is defined as the range of an acceptable performance within 3 σ this criterion is mostly met for the desired product however in actual situations the 3 σ quality level is considered to be a poor design that contains hidden dangers resulting from its performance limitations as the 3 σ quality level is deemed unacceptable a new design concept based on the 6 σ quality was developed by motorola harry and schroeder 2000 this concept reflects the number of defects per million parts converted by the σ level the variability metrics are listed in table 5 as a powerful tool dfss is widely used in manufacturing processes typically the robust design for the six sigma quality includes two core ideas mean on target and minimize variation which are decomposed into the target function f and this can be determined as follows 6 f i 1 n ω 1 i s 1 i μ y i ω 2 i s 2 i σ y i 2 where i is the performance response of the performance parameter set y n is the number of responses μ y i and σ y i 2 are the mean and the variance of y i respectively ω 1 i and ω 2 i are the weights and s 1 i and s 2 i are the normalization coefficients in all cases it is prescribed that the mean target is identified so it is minimized or maximized the sign is used when the response mean minimized and the sign is used when the response mean is maximized fig 5 presents the implementations of the 6 σ approach which transforms all variables into the standardized form a generic optimization problem based on dfss is given as follows 7 m i n i m i z e s f μ y x σ y x s u b j e c t t o g μ y x σ y x 0 x l s l n σ x μ x x u s l n σ x c o n s t r a i n t s μ y n σ y l o w e r s p e c i f i c a t i o n l i m i t μ y n σ y u p p e r s p e c i f i c a t i o n l i m i t in order to find the set of basic variables x that includes the input parameters the target function f and the limit state function g are subject to constraints that the sigma level number m must reach m 6 to ensure the high quality requirement this aims to improve the two probabilistic design quality goals reliability and robustness to achieve a 6σ design with respect to improvement of the two mentioned quality goals the reliability is increased by striving to maintain the performance within the constraints or acceptable limits that are associated with the shifted distribution consistently the robustness is improved by reducing the variability and sensitivity of the design that is associated with the shrunk distribution koch et al 2004 fig 6 represents the 3 σ design is promoted to 6 σ design with the aim of the probability that the performance will remain within the set limits is essentially 100 the performance distribution must be shrunk to improve the robustness also the reliability is strived to maintain performance within acceptable limits which is defined as the probability of satisfying constraints the lower specification limit lsl and the upper specification limit usl for the target variations are held fixed to a certain value with both shift and shrink the reliability level is achieved the robustness improved and the worst case performance not significantly affected this is the desired goal in implementing dfss in this section the dfss optimization is applied to the hull design of a bare auv which is subjected to uncertain usage conditions as mentioned earlier the parameters are set in accordance with the probability distribution the previous inputs are all normally distributed and can be simply transformed to avoid errors due to the worst case performances table 6 also presents the uncertainty optimization results that the criteria achieved which are significant by using the origin of the data from the dod model an exceptional improvement in the σ level σ level 6 directly indicates that the dfss technique that is used in the auv hull has a good performance for the quality requirement as demonstrated in fig 7 there are three types of results for the hull line design that are related to the initial condition the dod model and dfss technology 4 body force model for the self propelled auv to understand the features of the flow encircling the propeller disc the body force models developed by hough and ordway 1965 were used as a new simulation method for describing the hydrodynamic performance of vehicles powered by a propulsion system a more insightful numerical simulation that is based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method indicates that this is an efficient computation that can obtain an accurate outcome which has been demonstrated in a few published papers phillips et al 2008 rattanasiri et al 2012 following this approach the geometry of the propeller is not explicitly represented and a radial distribution of the thrust and torque is provided the tip and root are assumed to be null in order to meet the best circulation mode two models rans ut and rans ho were used in this study based on whether the torque distribution exists or not 4 1 uniform thrust distribution model rans ut the rans ut body force model is applied to the conceptual design of the auv propeller while assuming a uniform distribution of the thrust over the propeller disc and neglecting the torque the axial momentum source term f b x and the tangential momentum source term f b θ can determined through eq 8 and eq 9 respectively 8 f b x t δ x π r p 2 r h 2 9 f b θ 0 where δ x is the thickness of the propeller sub domain r p and r h are the radius of the propeller and the hub respectively and t is the self propelled thrust according to the numerical predictions or the open water tests fig 8 following this approach the physical dimensions of the virtual domain should be selected to represent the propeller perfectly however the mesh domain with the cylinder hardly coincides to the real region modeled from the propeller irregular shape thus the calculated solution of the thrust based on the body force model is modified to approximate the theoretical value specifically the error is limited to 2 based on the thrust correction 4 2 hough and ordway thrust and torque distribution model rans ho the rans ho body force model was proposed by hough and ordway and they considered the circulation distribution which has zero loading at the tip and the root it assumes that the thrust and the torque are required to capture the slipstream directly through the propeller this distribution was coupled with a rans simulation and was implemented by rattanasiri et al 2015 the aforementioned technique was adopted for the present study the non dimensional thrust distribution f b x and the non dimensional torque distribution f b θ are given by eqs 10 13 10 f b x a x r 1 r 11 f b θ a θ r 1 r 1 y h r y h and 12 a x c t h δ x 105 16 4 3 y h 1 y h 13 a θ k q δ x j 2 105 π 4 3 y h 1 y h note that k q is the torque coefficient with a finite thickness δ x the momentum source terms are then applied to an annulus and are defined using eqs 14 16 14 r y y h 1 y h 15 y r p r p 16 y h r h r p where r is the non dimensional radius r p is the distance from an arbitrary point in the propeller domain to the axes and c t h and k t represent the thrust coefficient with different forms as shown in eq 17 17 c t h k t π 8 j 2 t 1 2 ρ v a 2 π r p 2 18 j v a 2 n r r p 19 v a 1 ω t v where v is the vehicle speed v a is the advance speed j is the advance coefficient ω t is the wake fraction and n r is the revolutions per second 4 3 self propulsion factors prediction according to the optimization results of the auv hull based on the dfss in section 3 the body force model is used to predict the propeller self propulsion factors herein the ratio of the finite length of the propeller disc and the maximum diameter of the disc is suggested to be more than 0 1 as verified by a series of experimental tests phillips et al 2010 hence the propeller performance is selected from the mau4 54 type to align the area on the after body of the auv the other parameters are shown in table 7 the lower section of fig 9 presents this in detail it has to be noted that k q and k t are obtained by the experimental open water curves therefore the thrust coefficient and the torque coefficient equations are related to j they are fitted through the cubic polynomial curves as shown 20 k t 0 03939 j 3 0 1946 j 2 0 2467 j 0 2946 21 10 k q 0 09343 j 3 0 2475 j 2 0 2129 j 0 3211 an equality thrust method is used with rans ut and rans ho to predict the self propulsion factors depending on whether the torque distribution is considered it is impossible to measure all the parameters of the self propulsion factors directly an estimate formula is employed to obtain the thrust coefficient with respect to j as presented by eq 22 22 k t t j 2 4 ρ v a 2 r p 2 where k t is the estimation of the thrust coefficient after rendering the k t curve and the experimental open water curves of k q and k t into the same figure the advance coefficient j is obtained which is the abscissa of the intersection point and this is demonstrated in fig 10 in addition the other parameters were obtained from the j result and are presented in table 8 when comparing the results the propeller self propulsion factors predicted by rans ho are clearly similar to those predicted by rans ut although the tangential velocity is distributed which surrounds the disc the propeller dimensions are dominated by the axial momentum source term rather than the tangential momentum source term in other words if the auv propeller is operated at only a thrust distribution then the performance related to the considered torque can be determined equivalently moreover the simulation time is significantly reduced because only the thrust is acting on the cylindrical region with an axial velocity distribution hence the computational cost can be effectively reduced the prediction of the propeller self propulsion factors was accurately performed by the rans ho and rans ut body force models these models were validated by researchers from shanghai jiaotong university wu et al 2013 their summaries for the problems are very close to our study results consequently in later sections the resultant effect of the propeller interaction is more achievable given by the rans ut body force model to effectively lighten the computational burden and to maintain the precision 5 optimal configuration of the fleet on the drag to thoroughly investigate the interference of the propeller on the downstream flow assuming that the auv is fully submerged in deep water the effect of the wave is neglected by implementing the thrust distribution on the propeller using rans ut the impact of the propeller is to re energize the wake for a single hull however this race will interact with the following auv directly downstream hence it impacts its own drag even the total energy consumption of an auv fleet may be driven by the change in the individual drag for one vehicle 5 1 twin hulls formation a comparative test with a pair of auvs formation was performed to understand the flow over the body especially the resistance characteristics of the viscous interaction between the bodies molland and utama 2002 the spacing for the twin hull formation is defined as a transverse separation s l and a longitudinal offset d l with a number of ratios the parameters are defined as follows d represents the longitudinal distance between each nose of the bodies s is the transverse distance between the sidelines of each body l is the total length of a single auv a 0 is the auv leader that is designed by the uncertainty optimization that is based on dfss in section 3 and the propeller self propulsion factors are determined by the rans ut body force model in section 4 the follower auvs a 1 a 2 a 3 with different transverse separations and longitudinal offsets are related to a 0 as demonstrated in fig 11 they are classified into the parallel formation the drafting formation and the interactive formation by varying the transverse separation s l 0 165 0 0 17 0 27 0 37 and 0 47 the longitudinal offset d l 0 0 27 0 57 0 87 1 17 1 47 and 1 77 were selected the magnitude of the drag variations for each member is consistent rattanasiri et al 2012 5 2 energy consumption related to the drag the largest contribution to the drag of the fleet in the self propelled auv has an impact on spacing which was validated by rattanasiri in a series of tests for a variety of configurations rattanasiri et al 2013 in this study some findings are discussed in terms of the drag reduction to determine the energy consumption for the fleet according to the fluctuation trend of the individual drags and the combined drag an energy budget index should be defined as a percentage difference which can be expressed using eq 23 23 a r a 0 r a r a 100 b r a 1 r a r a 100 c r a 0 r a 1 2 r a 2 r a 100 where a and b represent the percentage differences of the individual drags of the leader a 0 and the follower a 1 while maintaining a fixed formation as mentioned in section 5 1 referenced to a single self propelled auv drag c is the percentage difference of the combined drag referenced to the sum of the two single hull drags twice as much as the single drag r a 0 and r a 1 are the drag coefficients of a 0 and a 1 for sailing cooperatively in a fleet and r a is the single case drag coefficient the signs and indicate the increase and the decrease of the self propelled drag and it also represents the energy benefit and deficit respectively 5 3 spacing configurations for the auv fleet it should be noted that the results suggest some energy beneficial configurations exist for the individuals and the whole fleet for some configurations this may increase the burden for the members in some specific configurations although the changes of the individual drags exist the same trend very small gains or losses are possible for the fleet these results are classified into six regions as shown in fig 12 depending on the different signs for the configuration percentage difference given in table 9 5 3 1 parallel region the parallel region is when the leader and the follower travel towards the inflow direction with a parallel formation this configuration is defined at d l 0 which indicates that the noses are aligned with the same tangent an increment in the total drag is demonstrated in fig 13 a it depends on the increase in each hull as shown in fig 14 a however it hardly increases more than 2 focusing on a single vehicle for comparison the drag increment of the leader is approximately equal to that of the follower owing to the symmetric numerical fluid domain theoretically the comparison between the two hulls reveals identical drag variations in the wind tunnel mercker 1986 however the source of the error is likely affected by the wall condition that is established as a finite tank rather than an infinite field in addition the drag increment for each hull is reduced along with the extended spacing owing to the viscous interactions these characteristics of the drag penalty were suggested in an experimental study molland and utama 2002 that the minimum transverse separation must be at least 0 5 l to preclude body to body interaction 5 3 2 echelon region the follower achieves synchronization between 0 27 d l 0 57 meanwhile the transverse separation is limited at s l 0 17 and s l 0 47 in addition the configuration of the fleet has the same formation as the echelon or a part of vee can be divided into the echelon region from fig 13 b and fig 14 b there is a significant increase in the leader s drag and the follower shows a contrary tendency finally these changes have a slightly negative influence on the combined drag since this region is discontinuous with a symmetric distribution the viscous interactions experience a strong disturbance when a pair body surface adheres at s l 0 17 otherwise this appears to be a relatively steady state for a long distance where s l 0 47 particularly in an unaccompanied auv the rise and fall of the individual drags are almost equal in addition the follower has an increment in its energy profit this is due to the change in the pressure dominated by the bow shape however an increase of the total drag that is exerted onto the fleet leads to very little loss of energy in other words there are no benefits that refer to the fleet energy in this region 5 3 3 low gain region as the longitudinal offset is limited to one body length with d l 1 17 the scope of the transverse separation s l is extended from 0 17 to 0 47 from this the spacing configuration of the fleet is categorized as a low gain region the individual drag corresponding to a single hull presents the trend that these coefficients first increase and then decrease toward the zero drag depicted in fig 14 b the measurand is the combined drag in the fleet which reflects the low energy savings and it is on average less than 2 phillips et al 2008 as demonstrated in fig 13 b when considering fig 14 b there is an inflection point that is clearly located at d l 0 87 which leads to a violent drop for the individual drag this is caused by the force interaction that a low gain is obtained for the fleet s energy although the characteristics of the single hull resistance are similar to those in the echelon region the energy scheme was optimized with a relatively smaller magnitude 5 3 4 following region as a unique region where the nose of the follower is fixed near the trailing edge of the leader the transverse separation and the longitudinal offset are limited at s l 0 and d l 0 87 respectively for the first time the drag of the leader auv is provided with a reduction in fig 14 b a moderate increase of 0 8 in the combined drag was observed as shown in fig 13 b the source of the drag dropping which is significant for the leader was identified to be the increased pressure recovery as suggested by rattanasiri et al 2014 the downstream pressure of the frontal vehicle was reinforced due to the bow stagnation point of a 1 offset backward thus the pressure resistance of the a 0 is reduced leading to a decrease in the individual drag this configuration presents a streamline formation for the fleets underwater however the augment of the total energy consumption may adversely affect the endurance 5 3 5 low interaction region by placing the follower at a posterior lateral position for d l 1 17 and 0 s l 0 37 the reference to the leader where the longitudinal distance between a pair of propellers is beyond one body length at the beginning the individual drag of the frontal auv experiences a significant decrease at 0 s l 0 17 in fig 14 a thus both hulls are surrounded by the steady flow and obtain a wake recovery to supply the energy for the fleet consequently less than 5 energy is saved in the formation as demonstrated in fig 13 a these characteristics occurred due to the body to body interactions near the body surface the boundary layer flow is considered to exhibit turbulent changes the beginning of this region will be referred to as the transition point in which the velocity shows an abnormal fluctuation or an anomaly silverstein and becker 1938 the maximum drag dropping of the fleet is implemented by the minimum race deduction of the leader s propeller when the spacing configuration is s l 0 these results agree with those obtained in by molland and utama 2002 in which the optimal transverse separation is obtained at s l 0 05 5 3 6 beneficial region for the largest region where the vehicle behind the frontal propeller is submerged in a fully developed turbulent flow the longitudinal offset is limited at d l 1 17 but the transverse separation s l is extended to all the conditions according to fig 13 b and fig 14 a the combined drag is decreased by the follower s propeller wake recovery rattanasiri et al 2014 thus the total energy significantly improves across the fleet by having an increase in the longitudinal offset until d l 1 47 the variation of the leader drag tends to be stable because of the reinforced downstream flow thus these hydrodynamic behaviors are replicated from cars that have a slipstream in the convoy the results of this study are close to the empirical constants applied in cars tested by crabtree 1998 for example regardless of the auvs or the road vehicles at d l 1 17 and s l 0 the drag reduction of the leader is 18 in the end the combined drag for the fleets is reduced by at least half for the individuals at 9 the propeller of the leading auv may directly affect the bow of the following auv by producing a downstream flow when d l 1 77 the distance between the twin hulls is sufficient for the interaction of the propeller wake to be neglected rattanasiri et al 2015 therefore the individual drag coefficients for the leader and the follower are equal to the single hull s drag coefficient hence a b and c can be estimated to be zero by adopting this configuration it is obvious that the energy profits improve the productivity for the auv fleet 6 conclusion this study attempts to investigate the energy saving approach for the auvs fleet depending on both the spacing configurations and the propeller interactions which has a high relevance to hull form design this is first achieved by creating the hull lines design for an individual vehicle and then extended to consider a fleet of two self propelled auvs operating at a range of longitudinal offset and transverse separation it is found that because the previous analysis for the most significant sources of uncertainty is not performed the deterministic optimization design has been conducted for the case study considered here the design variables are likely to violate the constraint boundaries easily in operating environment hence the form reliability analysis is employed to assess the quality levels of the parameters however the results indicate that some parameters are found to have the unacceptable reliabilities which is not reaching the design standard in engineering as a result the dfss technology that is used in this study to improve the quality levels holds great potential in engineering optimization for vehicle design it is demonstrated that the body force models rans ut and rans ho for replicating the impact of the propeller could be used by modeling the momentum source terms the results highlight the radial thrust distribution has a significant impact of the propeller performance the tangential momentum source term is determined by the torque distribution however it is found to have a faint effect on the propeller performance in comparison to the axial momentum source term by aiming to understand the energy budget of a fleet to achieve energy savings this study provides useful information for the operator to determine an effective formation of a pair of auvs this stems from the fact that the type and the particular configuration of the vehicle under study along with the influence of the propeller race must be considered and that dominant spacing must be chosen six zones are identified based on the characteristics of the drag changes these are the parallel region echelon region low gain region following region low interaction region and beneficial region the optimum energy configuration can be indicated in the transverse separation and the longitudinal offset with respect to the spacing of the twin hull as is discussed in this research the beneficial region where the follower is placed directly behind the leader with the longitudinal distance beyond one body length is found the most effective formation based on energy considerations our future work will be focused on increasing the number of auvs in a fleet while addressing a comparison of the energy consumption that may be influenced by the team formation in addition towing tank experiments will be conducted to verify the reliability of the uncertainty parameters in the hull design credit authorship contribution

21369,the oscillation patterns of two 1 dof cylinder oscillators undergoing viv and galloping are investigated in a free surface water channel for 3 2 104 re 1 2 105 the cylinders are arranged in tandem and supported by springs for a range of different spring stiffness and damping parameters the efficiency of a current energy converter cec based on flow induced oscillation fio of multiple cylinders in tandem is critically related to the cylinder oscillation patterns due to the limited number of studies on the fio for multiple cylindrical or prismatic bodies their oscillation patterns have neither been identified nor classified the surfaces of the cylinders are modified by turbulence stimulation to enhance fio three different center to center spacing five stiffness and six damping ratios for a total of 90 sets of experiments were conducted the current velocity range is from 0 34 m s to 1 32 m s from more than 2000 tests five major patterns nine sub patterns are identified and classified the patterns are defined based on the amplitudes frequencies and the phase angle differences between the two cylinders the characteristics and mechanics of each oscillation pattern are explored and explained from the perspective of fluid structure interaction fsi by systematically varying the parameters the underlying hydrodynamic mechanisms including the coupling level between vortices and cylinders the shielding effect the wake effect and the stability states are revealed few preliminary observations on the connection between oscillation pattern and harnessed power by the tandem cylinders are reported keywords hydrokinetic energy harnessing flow induced oscillation vortex induced vibration galloping tandem cylinders synergistic oscillation patterns 1 introduction flow induced oscillation fio is a phenomenon that occurs with flexible or elastically supported cylindrical prismatic structures in a fluid stream vortex induced vibration viv and galloping are the two most common fio for elongated bodies with bluff cross sections in currents viv is mainly induced by the wake vortex shedding while galloping is due to the instability of a shear layer fios of circular cylinders are widely studied because of the extensive engineering applications underwater and in air comprehensive reviews of viv were published by bearman 1984 and williamson and govardhan 2004 galloping does not occur with smooth circular cylinders in a uniform flow asymmetry is required for galloping and it may be caused by body geometry or flow thus studies on galloping are on non circular cylinders and prisms park et al 2013 ding et al 2015 mannini et al 2014 or on cylinders in nonuniform flows hover and triantafyllou 2001 the marine renewable energy laboratory mrelab developed a turbulence stimulation method labeled passive turbulence control ptc to destabilize a shear layer and trigger galloping for single or multiple circular cylinders using selective surface roughness distribution bernitsas et al 2008 park et al 2011 a map of ptc to fio was developed to reveal the effect of the roughness distribution on the dynamic response of circular cylinders in uniform flow this map is a guide for fio enhancement for harnessing marine hydrodynamic energy park et al 2013 2017 in fied testing the effect of ptc was achieved by adding locally metal sheet layers without surface roughness along with anti fouling coating marine fouling was prevented the fio characteristics change substantially when there are multiple cylinders in the flow because there are more factors affecting the fluid structure interaction the vortex shedding timing and the transition path of the vortices are changed by the presence of other cylinders shed vortices may also merge counteract or shift to other forms during or following shedding the spacing between the cylinders is the most crucial factor which greatly affects the vortex shedding behavior and the pressure distribution around cylinders igarashi 1981 classified two regimes for two stationary cylinders in tandem according to whether von kármán vortex streets are generated between the two cylinders zdravkovich 1985 1977 analyzed the vortex behavior more comprehensively and presented a map of vortex shedding modes for two cylinders placed side by side in tandem and in staggered arrangements with various spacing assi et al 2006 2010 2013 performed a series of experiments on the wake induced vibration wiv of a cylinder on springs in the wake of a fixed cylinder wiv did not only build up a higher oscillation amplitude than the viv of a single isolated cylinder but also sustained it when the vortex shedding frequency from the upstream cylinder was far higher than the natural frequency of the downstream cylinder it was suggested that the oscillation of the downstream cylinder was dominated by the unsteady vortex structure interactions rather than the resonance of the oscillation and vortex shedding as in viv assi et al 2013 also presented the concept of wake stiffness in which the wake vortices from the upstream cylinder has an effect similar to a linear spring on the oscillation of the downstream cylinder even if the structural springs were removed the wake spring effect was validated within a range of amplitude of oscillation in most of the fio viv and galloping scenarios with a single oscillating cylinder the oscillation is sinusoidal with only one dominant oscillation frequency when both tandem placed cylinders are oscillating the interactions are more complex because the upstream cylinder is not only affecting the downstream cylinder but is also being affected by the mutual interaction xu et al 2019 kim et al 2009 investigated fio of two circular cylinders in tandem with different spacing values response was classified in five different regimes with qualitatively different response the oscillation of the upstream cylinder was observed to be suppressed by the fixed downstream cylinder in regime iv while the downstream cylinder is independent on the upstream cylinder in other regimes the fio of the upstream cylinder has a strong influence on the downstream cylinder the inflow velocity for the downstream cylinder is always slower than that of the upstream cylinder due to the blockage of the upstream cylinder as a result the wake vortex shedding frequencies for the two cylinders are always different in viv according to the strouhal law st f s d c u where st is strouhal number f s is the vortex shedding frequency for a stationary cylinder d c is the characteristic dimension perpendicular to the flow and u is the inflow velocity the vortices shed from the two cylinders can either work together to enhance the oscillation or work against each other to suppress the oscillation this depends on the interaction of the vortices and the motions of the cylinders which depend on the oscillator parameters i e spring stiffness damping ratio spacing between cylinders and flow speed mahbub alam and zhou 2007 studied the phase lag between the vortex shedding with the lift force with various cross sections when 4 7 104 re 6 5 104 an empirical equation was derived to relate the phase lag with strouhal number center to center spacing and the minimum spacing at which the vortices can shed in the gap qin et al 2019 systematically examined how vortex behavior including reattachment detachment rolling up and shedding affect the fio characteristics of two cylinders in tandem within the approximate range of 5 103 re 6 104 fan et al 2020b 2020a investigated the fio mode of a more complicated system which has three 2 dof cylinders placed in tandem by both wind tunnel experiments and cfd simulations four regimes were classified according to the fio mode and spacing with a reynolds number range of 3 1 103 re 6 2 104 they also proposed four wake interference criteria based on velocities wake induced galloping was observed in cfd results galloping is not triggered by the wake vortex shedding but the instability of the shear layer as a highly non linear phenomenon galloping of a two cylinder system shows more attractors in the current study which were not identified in previous studies the underlying mechanism of fluid structure interactions can be explored by studying the oscillation patterns the pattern characteristics can provide a better understanding when designing the system parameters of structures in water or air flows that would help in stabilizing structures prone to fio either for suppression as in risers or for enhancement to improve the performance of hydrokinetic energy converters the fio characteristics of two elastically supported cylinders in tandem were systematically investigated by the mrelab experimentally computationally and analytically to optimize the performance of the vivace converter developed by bernitsas et al 2008 ptc introduced by park et al 2011 was applied by lan et al 2018 who identified three oscillation patterns of two cylinders in viv and galloping with a combination of stiffness and damping ratio this was based on phase lag between the motion of two cylinders in tandem namely the in phase pattern the out of phase pattern and the continuously changing pattern between the two sun et al 2017 experimentally tested the energy harnessing performance of two cylinders in tandem with center to center spacing ratio 1 57 x 0 d 2 57 spring stiffness 400 n m k 1200 n m and total damping ratio from 0 02 ζ 0 26 in the present study the tests in the research by sun et al 2017 for hydrokinetic energy harnessing are analyzed from a hydrodynamic perspective more patterns are observed than the previous study of lan et al 2018 with an improved classification method which is based on the coupling level of the oscillations of the two cylinders the details of the experimental set up are presented in section 2 the pattern classification method is introduced in section 3 in section 4 maps of the oscillation patterns vs damping ratio ζ and reynolds number re are presented a flow chart describing the fluid structure interaction process is proposed to understand the mutual effect between the cylinders and explain the causes for each pattern from the perspective of hydrodynamics some special cases are studied specifically in this section and conclusions are summarized at the end 2 experiment set up all tests were performed in the low turbulence free surface water ltfsw channel in the mrelab of the university of michigan fig 1 a the test section is 1 0 m in width 1 52 m in depth and 2 44 m in length 37 85 m3 of water is circulating in the channel with a maximum speed of 1 35 m s the water temperature was maintained around 19 5 c the water depth at the test section was 1 17 m for the present study the inflow velocity ranges from 0 34 m s to 1 35 m s and a 0 04 m s interval was used taking the diameter of the cylinder d 0 0889 m as the characteristic dimension the reynolds number range is 3 2 104 re 1 2 105 the test models are two aluminum circular cylinders modified with ptc strips for turbulence simulation as shown in fig 1 b two strips are applied to each cylinder covering the surface from 20 to 36 with respect to the forward stagnation point which was previously studied extensively as the best choice for harnessing energy in galloping sun et al 2017 the system parameters are presented in table 1 the cylinders are supported by two end springs emulated by the vck controller in order to achieve the desired stiffness and damping ratio the cylinder is constrained to move in the crossflow direction only as shown in fig 1 c the system calibration method for designing and implementing a no bias controller called vck system can be found in previous work by sun et al 2015 the displacement signal of each cylinder is recorded by the encoder of the servo motor with a resolution of less than 0 0001 m according to previous research the 2nd cylinder would have very limited influence on the 1st cylinder for spacing x 0 d 3 0 which means that the 1st cylinder would act like an isolated single cylinder kim et al 2013 kim and bernitsas 2016 the oscillation pattern of the 1st cylinder would not be affected by the 2nd cylinder in that situation it is more like a problem of the downstream cylinder s oscillation pattern under different kinds of perturbation from the wake of the upstream cylinder i e wake induced vibration rather than the interactive fio pattern studied in this paper this paper is aimed at understanding the synergy of two cylinders in flow induced oscillations thus the spacing range selected in this research is relatively narrow 90 sets of tests were involved in this study with three parameters including 3 center to center spacing values x 0 d 1 57 2 01 2 57 5 stiffness values k 400 n m 600 n m 800 n m 1000 n m 1200 n m and 6 total damping ratios ζ 0 06 0 10 0 14 0 18 0 22 0 26 for each of the ninety sets of tests about 25 velocity values were tested note that the stiffness and damping ratio for both cylinders are identical during each set of tests a detailed analysis of the test measurements can be found in sun et al 2017 3 pattern classification 3 1 classification method cylinder oscillation especially monochromatic is quantified by its amplitude and frequency in the case of two cylinders their relative position is important to illustrate and understand the fio mechanism the phase angle difference pad between the two cylinders defines their relative position pad is defined as the angular degree of the instantaneous position of the upstream 1st cylinder y 1 t leading that of the downstream 2nd cylinder y 2 t as shown in equation 1 where y 1 t and y 2 t represent the hilbert transform projection of y 1 t and y 2 t respectively 1 pad α 1 α 2 y 1 t y 2 t y 2 t y 1 t y 1 t y 2 t y 1 t y 2 t besides pad other tools used to illustrate the properties of the various response patterns are a the power spectral density calculated by discrete fourier transform dft to present the overall frequency content of a signal b the instantaneous frequency for each cycle calculated to show how the oscillation pattern shifts from one stage to the other within the same experiment huang et al 2009 huang and shen 2014 c the instantaneous frequency normalized by the natural frequency in vacuo d the instantaneous power calculated according to equation 2 where p harness i t is the instantaneous harnessing power c harness is the harnessing damping coefficient ẏ i t is the instantaneous oscillating velocity of the cylinder the derivation of equation 2 can be found in previous papers sun et al 2016 sun and bernitsas 2019 2 p h a r n e s s i t c h a r n e s s y i t y i t suffice to mention here that in the classical linear oscillator model with linear viscous damping the instantaneous damping force is c h a r n e s s y i t when multiplied by the oscillating cylinder velocity y i t it yields the instantaneous power in oscillating cylinder e p harness shows the power harnessing ability of a vivace converter in each pattern and stage f the phase diagram is used to understand the non linear behavior of the oscillating cylinders based on all the parameters mentioned above five major patterns for a total of nine sub patterns are identified the properties of each pattern are shown in figs 2 16 with a summary table in fig 17 3 2 pattern 1a pattern 1 is the fully synchronized pattern in which the fio s of the two cylinders have the same and only one frequency there are two sub patterns for pattern 1 patten 1a is the most common pattern in the tests as shown in fig 2 the oscillations of the two cylinders are synchronized in frequency the psd shows that both cylinders appear to have monochromatic responses with minimal variation in the instantaneous frequency as a function of time thus the time histories of both cylinders appear to be sinusoidal the two motions are also in phase the cycle to cycle frequencies of the two cylinders are nearly constant and equal the phase angle difference between the oscillations of the cylinders is also constant in the current case the pad is about 0 but it can be any constant in other cases for pattern 1 in this case the 1st upstream cylinder has a higher oscillation amplitude than that of the 2nd downstream cylinder detailed results can be found in sun et al 2017 for the amplitude ratio frequency harnessed power and efficiency ding et al 2019 conducted numerical simulations to explore the fsi mechanisms of a two cylinder vivace the flow field and dynamical response of a typical pattern 1a are shown in fig 3 the oscillations and the lift force of the two cylinders are synchronized in frequency with a 20⁰ pad the vortices shed from the upper lower side of the 1st cylinder touch the corresponding side of the 2nd cylinder and merge with the wake vortices of the 2nd cylinder as a consequence there is only one vortex street behind the two cylinders there is no independent wake shedding from the 2nd cylinder in this scenario the oscillations of the two cylinders are both controlled by the vortices shed from the 1st cylinder 3 3 pattern 1b pattern 1b is similar to pattern 1 but the 2nd cylinder has a higher amplitude than the 1st cylinder as shown in fig 4 the oscillations of the two cylinders are still synchronized in frequency but are out of phase with a pad around 140 note that the value of pad is not used to distinguish pattern 1b from pattern 1a both of the patterns can have a constant pad of any value within the range 180 180 the instantaneous frequencies also show more variation than pattern 1a which means the oscillations are as stable as in pattern 1a an example can also be found in ding et al 2019 where the flow field is visualized fig 5 note that the spacing stiffness and damping ratio of the cfd simulation is the same with the experimental test in fig 4 but the reynolds number is different the oscillations are still synchronized but the amplitude of the 2nd cylinder is slightly higher than that of the 1st cylinder compared to the flow field of pattern 1a in fig 3 a major difference is that the wake vortices of the 1st cylinder do not shed in the gap region but shed behind the 2nd cylinder as can be seen in each phase of the cycle there is always a vortical band connecting the two cylinders the exciting force for the 1st cylinder is smaller than the 2nd cylinder because the shedding mainly occurs behind the 2nd cylinder 3 4 pattern 2a pattern 2 is a partially coupled pattern in which the cylinders may have more than one response frequency but the dominant frequencies are the same pattern 2 has two sub patterns in pattern 2a the 1st cylinder has only one oscillation frequency while the 2nd cylinder has more than one oscillating frequency as shown in fig 6 the dominant frequencies of the two cylinders are equal the time history of the 2nd cylinder shows beating which indicates that the cylinder oscillation has two close frequencies this is confirmed by the psd pad is periodically changing within a specific range according to the frequency difference this pattern implies that the 2nd cylinder is subjected to the influence of the upstream wake vortex shedding from the 1st cylinder and also to its own wake vortex shedding however due to the shielding effect the inflow velocity for the two cylinders are not the same hence the vortex shedding frequencies are not the same either the wake shedding of the 1st cylinder is much more powerful as can be seen from the power spectrum curve ding et al 2015 presented a cfd study on the fio of multiple cylinders one case is shown in fig 7 the beating displacement history implies that the 2nd cylinder has two frequencies the evolution of the flow field shows clearly that each of the cylinders has its own vortex shedding the first frequency of the 2nd cylinder comes from its own wake vortex shedding note that this frequency should be lower than that of the 1st cylinder due to the shielding effect as mentioned earlier meanwhile the 2nd cylinder is also under the impact of the vortices shed from the 1st cylinder which explains the source and nature of the second frequency conceptually there could be another pattern to match pattern 3 when the 1st cylinder having more than one frequency while the 2nd cylinder having only one however this phenomenon was not observed experimentally this is the case because the wake of the 2nd cylinder is too weak and too far away from the 1st cylinder to have an impact on the oscillation of the 1st cylinder without the 2nd cylinder being affected by the wake of the 1st cylinder 3 5 pattern 2b as shown in fig 8 pattern 2b occurs when both cylinders have more than one frequency but their dominant frequencies are the same this means that the vibration and the wake of the 2nd cylinder have a stronger influence on the 1st cylinder the influence on the 1st cylinder is due to the fluid structure interactions in the gap region specifically depending on the timing the upstream vortices hit the 2nd cylinder and whether those vortices wrap around the second cylinder or shed through the gap between the two cylinders the frequency of excitation changes creating a two frequency excitation for both cylinders the evolution of the flow field in one cycle was simulated with a 2d urans method by ding et al 2013 and is shown in fig 9 this is presented only for the purpose of visualization so the spacing and damping ratios differ from the experimental test both cylinders are oscillating with two frequencies according to the displacement histories and psd while the dominant frequencies are the same the 1st cylinder is at the same location in phase 1 t tn 1 0 112 and phase 8 t tn 1 2 081 however the shed vortices of the 1st cylinder in phase 8 have very different forms compared with that in phase 1 it is the presence of the 2nd cylinder periodically affecting the formation of the wake vortices of the 1st cylinder and thus affecting the hydrodynamic force and the oscillation of the 1st cylinder 3 6 pattern 3a pattern 3 is the decoupled pattern in which the two cylinders have different dominant frequencies pattern 3 also has two sub patterns as shown in fig 10 pattern 3a is very similar to pattern 2b but the distinction between patterns 3a and 2b is clear there is more than one frequency for each cylinder but the dominant frequencies are different compared to pattern 2b pattern 3a has a lower level weaker of coupling between the cylinders it implies that each cylinder s oscillation is controlled by its own vortex shedding even though affected by the other s thus this pattern is classified as the decoupled pattern 3 7 pattern 3b pattern 3b represents cases in which both cylinders have one frequency but the frequencies are not equal the frequency of the 1st cylinder is always higher than that of the 2nd as shown in fig 11 due to the shielding effect the inflow velocity for the 2nd cylinder is always lower than that of the 1st cylinder in the initial branch and the upper branch of viv the oscillating frequency is positively associated with the flow velocity therefore the frequency for the 2nd cylinder is unlikely to be higher than that of the 1st cylinder in these two branches on the other hand if the two cylinders are placed apart by more than 3 0d the 2nd cylinder would have very limited influence on the 1st cylinder the 1st cylinder would act like an isolated single cylinder it would enter galloping after the upper branch of viv no lower branch of viv was observed for a single ptc cylinder according to previous research by kim et al 2013 the oscillation frequencies of two tandem cylinders with ptc and variable spacings are provided in fig 12 in this pattern the oscillations of the two cylinders are fully de coupled the wake vortex shedding of each cylinder must be strong enough to take control of its own cylinder oscillation and make the interactions between the cylinders negligible no cases were identified experimentally where the 2nd cylinder had a higher frequency than the first this is expected because the 2nd cylinder usually has a lower inflow velocity due to the shielding effect therefore the vortex shedding frequency should also be lower than that of the 1st cylinder s according to the strouhal law for stationary cylinders 3 8 pattern 4a in pattern 4 only one of the two cylinders is oscillating while the other one remains practically stationary pattern 4a occurs when the 1st cylinder is oscillating while the 2nd cylinder s oscillation is negligible as illustrated in fig 13 this is mainly the case because the wake vortex shedding of the 1st cylinder drives the 1st cylinder to oscillate but suppresses the wake of the 2nd cylinder at the same time when the shedding directions are opposite note that in some cases the cylinders remain static because of the static coulomb friction force cfd results ding et al 2013 are shown in fig 14 note that the damping ratio of the cfd case is lower than that of the experimental case the oscillation of the 1st cylinder is much more intense than that of the 2nd cylinder the vortices shed from the 1st cylinder grab the wake vortex of the 2nd cylinder while passing by leaving the 2nd cylinder without circulation no obvious vortex street can be found behind the 2nd cylinder therefore the amplitude of the 2nd cylinder is nearly completely suppressed 3 9 pattern 4b pattern 4b is just the opposite of pattern 4a which can be seen in fig 15 the wake vortex shedding of the 1st cylinder is not strong enough to oscillate the 1st cylinder but it is strong enough to oscillate the 2nd cylinder when its vortex shedding is in phase 3 10 pattern 5 pattern 5 is different from the others as the oscillation mode shifts from one pattern to another the shifting occurs intermittently but not periodically from the perspective of nonlinear dynamics it indicates that a non linear phenomenon where more than one stable attractor exists an example is shown in fig 16 multiple variations have been observed experimentally and computationally ding et al 2013 2016 3 11 summary the identification method and the characteristics of each pattern are summarized in table 2 a1 and a2 represent the oscillation amplitude of the 1st cylinder and the 2nd cylinder respectively f1 and f2 are the oscillation frequency for the 1st cylinder and the 2nd cylinder respectively when there is only one prominent frequency for each cylinder when there is more than one frequency fi j i j 1 2 is the j th most prominent frequency of the i th cylinder the hydrodynamic mechanisms are summarized in table 3 y 1 and y 2 represent the cylinder motions w 1 and w 2 represent the wake vortex shedding of the upstream and downstream cylinder respectively a summary of the dynamic characteristics of all the patterns is plotted in fig 17 for easy comparison 4 maps of patterns vs ζ re in fio regions fifteen maps of the patterns are presented in figs 18 20 for the three tandem spacing and the five spring stiffness values tested the patterns are mapped on the damping ratio reynolds number domain ζ re noted that in galloping only patterns 1 and 5 exist and all the other patterns occur in viv and transition so the viv patterns are investigated first three colors are used to indicate the coupling level of the motions of the tandem cylinders a green labels indicate fully synchronized motions in patterns 1 and 5 b yellow labels indicate pattern2 in which the coupling between the cylinders is still dominant but other factors play part in the motions c blue labels indicate pattern 3 in which the coupling is not dominant anymore or even the motions may be decoupled d red labels indicate pattern 4 which describes the scenarios where only one of the cylinders is oscillating while the other one is practically stationary as shown in figs 18 20 most of the cases in the initial branch of viv are synchronized patterns interspersed with patterns 4a and 4b pattern 4b occurs because the wake vortex shedding behind the 2nd cylinder is too weak and slow due to shielding by the 1st cylinder the oscillation of the 2nd cylinder in this branch is completely controlled by the wake vortices from the 1st cylinder as the flow speed increases viv shifts to the upper branch when the vortex shedding mode changes from the 2s mode to 2p mode for the 1st cylinder williamson and roshko 1988 the decoupled patterns start to show when the wake vortices of the 2nd cylinder are strong enough and the vortex shedding frequency is high enough to get coupled with the natural frequency of the 2nd cylinder two oscillation frequencies exist in this region one is from the vortex shedding of the 1st cylinder and the other one is from the 2nd further increase of the flow velocity increases the strouhal frequency of the 1st cylinder becoming too high to remain coupled with the natural frequency then viv tends to cease or enter the lower branch while the viv of the 2nd cylinder is still in high intensity as shown in pattern 1b the oscillation of the 2nd cylinder can have a significant influence on the 1st cylinder where pattern 2b occurs as shown in fig 18 pattern 5 mainly occurs when x 0 d 1 57 in the transition region around re 8 75 104 and in galloping re 9 104 in the transition region both driving mechanisms of viv and galloping exist when the onset of galloping occurs before the end of the viv upper branch the oscillation shifts intermittently between the viv mode and the galloping mode once galloping is fully developed both of the cylinders are synchronized again pattern 5 still occurs in some cases in fully developed galloping it will be analyzed more specifically in the following section the occurrence of each pattern is summarized in fig 21 as can be seen pattern 1a is the most common pattern at all three spacings tested the percentage of pattern 1 increases with x0 d while the sub pattern 1b decreases this means that as the spacing becomes wider it is easier for the two cylinders to synchronize but the amplitude of the 2nd cylinder can hardly be higher than that of the 1st cylinder the proportions of pattern 4 and pattern 5 decrease with x0 d the overall percentage of patterns 2 and 3 does not change significantly with x0 d when x0 d 1 57 the major sub patterns are pattern 2b and pattern 3a in which the upstream cylinder has two frequencies when x0 d 2 01 and 2 57 the major sub patterns are pattern 2a and pattern 3b in which the upstream cylinder has only one frequency this is the case because the influence of the downstream cylinder on the upstream cylinder diminishes as the spacing between the two cylinders widens 4 1 effect of parameters on fio energy to understand the coupling process in viv the relations between the cylinder oscillations are presented in fig 22 u 1 and u 2 represent the average inflow for the 1st and 2nd cylinder respectively y 1 and y 2 represent the cylinder motions w 1 and w 2 represent the wake vortex shedding interaction i j represents the interaction between the i th cylinder and the j th wake which includes the vortex force applied on the i th cylinder from the j th wake and also the disturbance of the vortices in wake j from the i th cylinder u 1 is the incoming flow velocity which is set by the channel u 2 is determined by u 1 the shielding effect of the 1st cylinder and the spacing between the cylinders longer spacing gives the flow more space to recover its velocity y 1 is controlled by the stiffness damping ratio and interaction1 1 from the wake vortex shedding w 1 here we neglect the direct effect from w 2 because of the distance w 1 is mainly the von kármán vortex street which is synchronized with the motion y 1 however it is also under the effect of y 2 y 2 is undergoing two interactions interaction2 1 and interaction2 2 interaction2 1 decreases with increasing spacing w 2 is synchronized with y 2 and also disturbed by w 1 such disturbances could be enhancing or suppressing depending on the frequency and phase values the effect of the disturbances decreases with increasing spacing as well the damping ratio ζ can affect the oscillation amplitude which leads to the changes in the shielding effect this can be observed in all of the cases in figs 19 and 20 when the spacing is 2 01 or 2 57 higher damping ratios narrow the partially coupled pattern 2 or decoupled pattern 3 regions which means that lower oscillation amplitudes cause a higher coupling level in viv the higher amplitudes of y 2 lead to stronger wake vortex shedding w 2 which makes it harder to be controlled by w 1 so the frequency component is more prominent than in the high damping low amplitude cases another possible reason is that the high amplitude of y 1 leads to a stronger shielding effect which means the u 2 is lower for the low damping cases and the vortex shedding frequency would be lower according to strouhal law therefore there could be a more significant difference between the vortex shedding frequencies of w 1 and w 2 and it would be more difficult for the motions to get coupled however the partially coupled and decoupled regions do not shrink with higher damping ratios at spacing 1 57 as shown in fig 18 that occurs mainly because the short gap distance leads to a minimal velocity recovery for u 2 due to the shielding effect the higher difference between u 1 and u 2 causes a more significant difference between the vortex shedding frequencies of w 1 and w 2 so it is too narrow in this particular spacing for the wakes to be synchronized regardless of the amplitudes of y 1 and y 2 in other cases with longer velocity recovery distances the difference between u 1 and u 2 would be smaller and it would also be easier for the cylinders to get coupled that is the reason why more synchronized patterns appear in figs 19 and 20 spring stiffness controls the natural frequency and then leads to the coupling level between y 1 and w 1 at a certain inflow velocity and the coupling level among w 1 y 2 and w 2 as well as the stiffness of the cylinders increases the oscillations tend to be fully coupled or synchronized as can be seen in figs 18 20 there are fewer decoupled patterns pattern 3 with the higher stiffness for all the spacing and damping ratios 4 2 oscillation patterns and converted hydrokinetic power the patterns are summarized based on their oscillational characteristics which is also the foundation of the power harnessing calculation in oscillations kinetic power exchanges between the cylinders and the fluid it is reasonable to expect that there may exist a relationship between patterns and power in the oscillator fig 23 shows the energy harnessing power related to the patterns the colors in the graph represent the different coupling level four cases are selected for each spacing to represent the low stiffness low damping cases the low stiffness high damping cases the high stiffness low damping cases and the high stiffness high damping cases regardless in all the tandem cylinder tests the harnessed energy of the upstream cylinder increases significantly compared to the isolated cylinder oscillator sun et al 2017 as can be seen in the first row of fig 23 a when x 0 d 1 57 k 400 n m ζ 0 06 and 0 18 there is a slight drop of the harnessed power of the 1st cylinder p 1 when the pattern changes from fully synchronized pattern to decoupled patterns in viv around re 5 104 at the same point there is also a jump of the harnessing power of the 2nd cylinder p 2 it occurs when w 2 starts to get coupled with y 2 and viv occurs for both cylinders individually as stated before the decoupled patterns show at higher velocity when the stiffness increases to 1000 n m as shown in the second row of fig 23 a where the galloping is initially triggered on the 1st cylinder while viv occurs to the 2nd cylinder in this region p 1 increases dramatically and p 2 changes marginally as the spacing increases to 2 01 as shown in fig 23 b the decoupled region is much wider when k 400 n m and ζ 0 06 starting from re 4 4 104 and ending before galloping both p 1 and p 2 increase gradually with the flow velocity which means both cylinders are in viv the decoupled region narrows down with higher stiffness and damping ratio values there is a slight boost for p 2 when decoupled patterns occur but it does not affect p 1 as much as p 2 the situation for x 0 d 2 57 is similar to 2 01 as shown in fig 23 c 4 3 case study some special cases in the tests patterns 4 and 5 do not occur regularly they are studied further in this section pattern 4 occurs in viv while pattern 5 occurs in galloping and the transition region between viv and galloping 4 3 1 low flow velocity with one cylinder stationary pattern 4 in pattern 4a the 1st cylinder is oscillating but the 2nd cylinder is basically stationary in pattern 4b the situation is reversed the 1st cylinder is stationary while the 2nd cylinder is oscillating both patterns occur before or at the beginning of the viv regions pattern 4b appears only at the very beginning of some sets of tests when the spacing is 1 57 and 2 57 while pattern 4a occurs at little higher velocities when the spacing ratio is 2 01 pattern 4a also occurs at the lowest velocities for low damping values that is the case because the cylinders may start to oscillate at velocities below the testing range as explained in fig 14 pattern 4a occurs when w 1 is strong enough to drive y 1 but w 2 is not strong enough to drive y 2 under the suppression from w 1 and the out of phase force f i n t e r a c t i o n 2 1 inequalities 3 1 3 2 model this scenario 3 1 f i n t e r a c t i o n 1 1 f c o u l o m b s t a t i c 3 2 f i n t e r a c t i o n 2 2 f i n t e r a c t i o n 2 1 f c o u l o m b s t a t i c pattern 4b occurs when w 1 is not strong enough to drive y 1 but w 2 is strong enough to drive y 2 after the enhancing from w 1 and the in phase force f i n t e r a c t i o n 2 1 inequalities 4 1 4 2 model this scenario 4 1 f i n t e r a c t i o n 1 1 f c o u l o m b s t a t i c 4 2 f i n t e r a c t i o n 2 2 f i n t e r a c t i o n 2 1 f c o u l o m b s t a t i c since f i n t e r a c t i o n 1 1 monotonically increases before or at the beginning of viv it is easy to understand that pattern 4b can only occur at the lowest velocity of each set of tests if f i n t e r a c t i o n 1 1 is high enough to drive y 1 at a certain velocity then it should also be able to drive it at higher velocities in most of the cases pattern 4b is followed by pattern 1a which means the cylinders are synchronized however as the inflow velocity u 1 increases a little this synchronization is broken w 1 is no longer helping w 2 to drive y 2 and they even work against each other so that the amplitude of the total hydrodynamic force is lower than that of the static coulomb friction force and pattern 4a appears this trend should also work for the cases with spacing equal to 2 01 however no pattern 4b is recorded it is speculated that the test range was not wide or fine enough to reveal pattern 4b 4 3 2 phase shift phenomena pattern 5 pattern 5 mostly occurs at low k ζ and spacing as shown in figs 18 20 when the amplitude is high the frequency is low and the spacing ratio is 1 57 the oscillation shifts between two different scenarios without any apparent change in external flow conditions the pattern is a manifestation of the nonlinearity of the oscillations from the nonlinear dynamic point of view there are multiple stable limit oscillation cycles lco and the lcos are close to each other small perturbations can lead the motion trajectory from one lco to another lco taking the case in fig 16 for example the phase difference between the motions is 180 for the first 14 s the cylinders are oscillating perfectly out of phase the amplitude of the 1st cylinder is higher than that of the 2nd cylinder then the 1st cylinder starts oscillating slower and the 2nd cylinder starts oscillating faster the pad keeps dropping for the next 30 s during which the 1st cylinder oscillates one and a half cycles more than the 2nd cylinder the two cylinders oscillate in phase from the 44th second until the end of the recording in this case there are at least two stable lcos one is the out of phase mode in the first 14 s and the other one is the in phase mode in the last 14 s the middle period can also be a stable stage similar to pattern 3b or just the transition path between the two obvious attractors there are other types of pattern 5 being observed some of them are selected and presented in fig 24 they all share five obvious similarities 1 during the shift the instantaneous frequency changes 2 during the shift the 1st cylinder s frequency is reduced oscillating slower and the 2nd cylinder s frequency increases oscillating faster 3 pad shifts always by about 180 4 the oscillations of the cylinders change simultaneously 5 the shifts cause changes to the energy harnessing power they also exhibit some different characteristics 1 there are two shifting processes one being instantaneous and the other very slow as shown in fig 16 the process starts from the 15th second and ends at the 44th second it takes 29 s or 48 of the sampling time 60 s however it takes only 5 s for the oscillation mode to change from out of phase mode to in phase mode in the case of fig 24 a 2 the vibration shifts from in phase mode to out of phase mode within 3 s in fig 24 b it is only 8 or 5 of the sampling time the shift can be unidirectional or bidirectional according to the pad in fig 24 c and d in the current research the fio patterns of two ptc cylinder in tandem are classified based on displacement and frequency measurements other dynamical characteristics i e the hydrodynamic force and the phase shift between force and displacement contain additional information to reveal the underlying mechanics further flow field analysis including vortex patterns and shear layer stability may be helpful in explaining the underlying mechanism for each pattern they all deserve further investigation in the future 6 conclusions the oscillation patterns for two tandem placed cylinders with turbulence stimulation in the form of selective roughness were identified and classified in this study the classification method and the characteristics of each pattern were presented the occurrence of each pattern was explained based on the interaction between cylinder motion and timing of vortices interfering with the 2nd cylinder or its shear layers or its wake 1 in the viv region the oscillations of the two cylinders mainly have three coupling levels fully synchronized partially coupled and fully decoupled depending on the fluid structure interaction among the two cylinders and the two wake vortex shedding the synchronized mode occurs when both cylinders are dominated by the wake of the upstream cylinder the partially coupled and fully decoupled modes occur when the wake of the downstream cylinder is strong enough to affect or dominate the oscillation of the 2nd cylinder in viv as the flow speed increases oscillation mode changes from fully synchronized to partially coupled and then fully decoupled 2 some key phenomena are observed especially on how the downstream cylinder is affecting the upstream cylinder in the viv region this occurs when the inflow velocity is beyond the region of the viv of the 1st cylinder but the 2nd cylinder is still in viv due to the shielding effect the oscillation of the 2nd cylinder periodically perturbs the wake of the 1st cylinder and gives the upstream cylinder another frequency 3 the system parameters including cylinder spacing spring stiffness and damping ratio are playing important roles in the fio patterns generally speaking higher damping ratio and higher stiffness make it easier for the two cylinders to synchronize the motions of the cylinders tend to decouple with lower damping ratio and lower stiffness especially when the wake vortex shedding frequency of the 2nd cylinder approaches the natural frequency in 5 104 re 8 105 4 nonlinear behavior occurs in the galloping region multiple attractors exist in galloping which leads to pattern shifting some crucial factors deserve further

21369,the oscillation patterns of two 1 dof cylinder oscillators undergoing viv and galloping are investigated in a free surface water channel for 3 2 104 re 1 2 105 the cylinders are arranged in tandem and supported by springs for a range of different spring stiffness and damping parameters the efficiency of a current energy converter cec based on flow induced oscillation fio of multiple cylinders in tandem is critically related to the cylinder oscillation patterns due to the limited number of studies on the fio for multiple cylindrical or prismatic bodies their oscillation patterns have neither been identified nor classified the surfaces of the cylinders are modified by turbulence stimulation to enhance fio three different center to center spacing five stiffness and six damping

tandem cylinders are reported keywords hydrokinetic energy harnessing flow induced oscillation vortex induced vibration galloping tandem cylinders synergistic oscillation patterns 1 introduction flow induced oscillation fio is a phenomenon that occurs with flexible or elastically supported cylindrical prismatic structures in a fluid stream vortex induced vibration viv and galloping are the two most common fio for elongated bodies with bluff cross sections in currents viv is mainly induced by the wake vortex shedding while galloping is due to the instability of a shear layer fios of circular cylinders are widely studied because of the extensive engineering applications underwater and in air comprehensive reviews of viv were published by bearman 1984 and williamson and govardhan 2004 galloping does not occur with smooth circular cylinders in a uniform flow asymmetry is required for galloping and it may be caused by body geometry or flow thus studies on galloping are on non circular cylinders and prisms park et al 2013 ding et al 2015 mannini et al 2014 or on cylinders in nonuniform flows hover and triantafyllou 2001 the marine renewable energy laboratory mrelab developed a turbulence stimulation method labeled passive turbulence control ptc to destabilize a shear layer and trigger galloping for single or multiple circular cylinders using selective surface roughness distribution bernitsas et al 2008 park et al 2011 a map of ptc to fio was developed to reveal the effect of the roughness distribution on the dynamic response of circular cylinders in uniform flow this map is a guide for fio enhancement for harnessing marine hydrodynamic energy park et al 2013 2017 in fied testing the effect of ptc was achieved by adding locally metal sheet layers without surface roughness along with anti fouling coating marine fouling was prevented the fio characteristics change substantially when there are multiple cylinders in the flow because there are more factors affecting the fluid structure interaction the vortex shedding timing and the transition path of the vortices are changed by the presence of other cylinders shed vortices may also merge counteract or shift to other forms during or following shedding the spacing between the cylinders is the most crucial factor which greatly affects the vortex shedding behavior and the pressure distribution around cylinders igarashi 1981 classified two regimes for two stationary cylinders in tandem according to whether von kármán vortex streets are generated between the two cylinders zdravkovich 1985 1977 analyzed the vortex behavior more comprehensively and presented a map of vortex shedding modes for two cylinders placed side by side in tandem and in staggered arrangements with various spacing assi et al 2006 2010 2013 performed a series of experiments on the wake induced vibration wiv of a cylinder on springs in the wake of a fixed cylinder wiv did not only build up a higher oscillation amplitude than the viv of a single isolated cylinder but also sustained it when the vortex shedding frequency from the upstream cylinder was far higher than the natural frequency of the downstream cylinder it was suggested that the oscillation of the downstream cylinder was dominated by the unsteady vortex structure interactions rather than the resonance of the oscillation and vortex shedding as in viv assi et al 2013 also presented the concept of wake stiffness in which the wake vortices from the upstream cylinder has an effect similar to a linear spring on the oscillation of the downstream cylinder even if the structural springs were removed the wake spring effect was validated within a range of amplitude of oscillation in most of the fio viv and galloping scenarios with a single oscillating cylinder the oscillation is sinusoidal with only one dominant oscillation frequency when both tandem placed cylinders are oscillating the interactions are more complex because the upstream cylinder is not only affecting the downstream cylinder but is also being affected by the mutual interaction xu et al 2019 kim et al 2009 investigated fio of two circular cylinders in tandem with different spacing values response was classified in five different regimes with qualitatively different response the oscillation of the upstream cylinder was observed to be suppressed by the fixed downstream cylinder in regime iv while the downstream cylinder is independent on the upstream cylinder in other regimes the fio of the upstream cylinder has a strong influence on the downstream cylinder the inflow velocity for the downstream cylinder is always slower than that of the upstream cylinder due to the blockage of the upstream cylinder as a result the wake vortex shedding frequencies for the two cylinders are always different in viv according to the strouhal law st f s d c u where st is strouhal number f s is the vortex shedding frequency for a stationary cylinder d c is the characteristic dimension perpendicular to the flow and u is the inflow velocity the vortices shed from the two cylinders can either work together to enhance the oscillation or work against each other to suppress the oscillation this depends on the interaction of the vortices and the motions of the cylinders which depend on the oscillator parameters i e spring stiffness damping ratio spacing between cylinders and flow speed mahbub alam and zhou 2007 studied the phase lag between the vortex shedding with the lift force with various cross sections when 4 7 104 re 6 5 104 an empirical equation was derived to relate the phase lag with strouhal number center to center spacing and the minimum spacing at which the vortices can shed in the gap qin et al 2019 systematically examined how vortex behavior including reattachment detachment rolling up and shedding affect the fio characteristics of two cylinders in tandem within the approximate range of 5 103 re 6 104 fan et al 2020b 2020a investigated the fio mode of a more complicated system which has three 2 dof cylinders placed in tandem by both wind tunnel experiments and cfd simulations four regimes were classified according to the fio mode and spacing with a reynolds number range of 3 1 103 re 6 2 104 they also proposed four wake interference criteria based on velocities wake induced galloping was observed in cfd results galloping is not triggered by the wake vortex shedding but the instability of the shear layer as a highly non linear phenomenon galloping of a two cylinder system shows more attractors in the current study which were not identified in previous studies the underlying mechanism of fluid structure interactions can be explored by studying the oscillation patterns the pattern characteristics can provide a better understanding when designing the system parameters of structures in water or air flows that would help in stabilizing structures prone to fio either for suppression as in risers or for enhancement to improve the performance of hydrokinetic energy converters the fio characteristics of two elastically supported cylinders in tandem were systematically investigated by the mrelab experimentally computationally and analytically to optimize the performance of the vivace converter developed by bernitsas et al 2008 ptc introduced by park et al 2011 was applied by lan et al 2018 who identified three oscillation patterns of two cylinders in viv and galloping with a combination of stiffness and damping ratio this was based on phase lag between the motion of two cylinders in tandem namely the in phase pattern the out of phase pattern and the continuously changing pattern between the two sun et al 2017 experimentally tested the energy harnessing performance of two cylinders in tandem with center to center spacing ratio 1 57 x 0 d 2 57 spring stiffness 400 n m k 1200 n m and total damping ratio from 0 02 ζ 0 26 in the present study the tests in the research by sun et al 2017 for hydrokinetic energy harnessing are analyzed from a hydrodynamic perspective more patterns are observed than the previous study of lan et al 2018 with an improved classification method which is based on the coupling level of the oscillations of the two cylinders the details of the experimental set up are presented in section 2 the pattern classification method is introduced in section 3 in section 4 maps of the oscillation patterns vs damping ratio ζ and reynolds number re are presented a flow chart describing the fluid structure interaction process is proposed to understand the mutual effect between the cylinders and explain the causes for each pattern from the perspective of hydrodynamics some special cases are studied specifically in this section and conclusions are summarized at the end 2 experiment set up all tests were performed in the low turbulence free surface water ltfsw channel in the mrelab of the university of michigan fig 1 a the test section is 1 0 m in width 1 52 m in depth and 2 44 m in length 37 85 m3 of water is circulating in the channel with a maximum speed of 1 35 m s the water temperature was maintained around 19 5 c the water depth at the test section was 1 17 m for the present study the inflow velocity ranges from 0 34 m s to 1 35 m s and a 0 04 m s interval was used taking the diameter of the cylinder d 0 0889 m as the characteristic dimension the reynolds number range is 3 2 104 re 1 2 105 the test models are two aluminum circular cylinders modified with ptc strips for turbulence simulation as shown in fig 1 b two strips are applied to each cylinder covering the surface from 20 to 36 with respect to the forward stagnation point which was previously studied extensively as the best choice for harnessing energy in galloping sun et al 2017 the system parameters are presented in table 1 the cylinders are supported by two end springs emulated by the vck controller in order to achieve the desired stiffness and damping ratio the cylinder is constrained to move in the crossflow direction only as shown in fig 1 c the system calibration method for designing and implementing a no bias controller called vck system can be found in previous work by sun et al 2015 the displacement signal of each cylinder is recorded by the encoder of the servo motor with a resolution of less than 0 0001 m according to previous research the 2nd cylinder would have very limited influence on the 1st cylinder for spacing x 0 d 3 0 which means that the 1st cylinder would act like an isolated single cylinder kim et al 2013 kim and bernitsas 2016 the oscillation pattern of the 1st cylinder would not be affected by the 2nd cylinder in that situation it is more like a problem of the downstream cylinder s oscillation pattern under different kinds of perturbation from the wake of the upstream cylinder i e wake induced vibration rather than the interactive fio pattern studied in this paper this paper is aimed at understanding the synergy of two cylinders in flow induced oscillations thus the spacing range selected in this research is relatively narrow 90 sets of tests were involved in this study with three parameters including 3 center to center spacing values x 0 d 1 57 2 01 2 57 5 stiffness values k 400 n m 600 n m 800 n m 1000 n m 1200 n m and 6 total damping ratios ζ 0 06 0 10 0 14 0 18 0 22 0 26 for each of the ninety sets of tests about 25 velocity values were tested note that the stiffness and damping ratio for both cylinders are identical during each set of tests a detailed analysis of the test measurements can be found in sun et al 2017 3 pattern classification 3 1 classification method cylinder oscillation especially monochromatic is quantified by its amplitude and frequency in the case of two cylinders their relative position is important to illustrate and understand the fio mechanism the phase angle difference pad between the two cylinders defines their relative position pad is defined as the angular degree of the instantaneous position of the upstream 1st cylinder y 1 t leading that of the downstream 2nd cylinder y 2 t as shown in equation 1 where y 1 t and y 2 t represent the hilbert transform projection of y 1 t and y 2 t respectively 1 pad α 1 α 2 y 1 t y 2 t y 2 t y 1 t y 1 t y 2 t y 1 t y 2 t besides pad other tools used to illustrate the properties of the various response patterns are a the power spectral density calculated by discrete fourier transform dft to present the overall frequency content of a signal b the instantaneous frequency for each cycle calculated to show how the oscillation pattern shifts from one stage to the other within the same experiment huang et al 2009 huang and shen 2014 c the instantaneous frequency normalized by the natural frequency in vacuo d the instantaneous power calculated according to equation 2 where p harness i t is the instantaneous harnessing power c harness is the harnessing damping coefficient ẏ i t is the instantaneous oscillating velocity of the cylinder the derivation of equation 2 can be found in previous papers sun et al 2016 sun and bernitsas 2019 2 p h a r n e s s i t c h a r n e s s y i t y i t suffice to mention here that in the classical linear oscillator model with linear viscous damping the instantaneous damping force is c h a r n e s s y i t when multiplied by the oscillating cylinder velocity y i t it yields the instantaneous power in oscillating cylinder e p harness shows the power harnessing ability of a vivace converter in each pattern and stage f the phase diagram is used to understand the non linear behavior of the oscillating cylinders based on all the parameters mentioned above five major patterns for a total of nine sub patterns are identified the properties of each pattern are shown in figs 2 16 with a summary table in fig 17 3 2 pattern 1a pattern 1 is the fully synchronized pattern in which the fio s of the two cylinders have the same and only one frequency there are two sub patterns for pattern 1 patten 1a is the most common pattern in the tests as shown in fig 2 the oscillations of the two cylinders are synchronized in frequency the psd shows that both cylinders appear to have monochromatic responses with minimal variation in the instantaneous frequency as a function of time thus the time histories of both cylinders appear to be sinusoidal the two motions are also in phase the cycle to cycle frequencies of the two cylinders are nearly constant and equal the phase angle difference between the oscillations of the cylinders is also constant in the current case the pad is about 0 but it can be any constant in other cases for pattern 1 in this case the 1st upstream cylinder has a higher oscillation amplitude than that of the 2nd downstream cylinder detailed results can be found in sun et al 2017 for the amplitude ratio frequency harnessed power and efficiency ding et al 2019 conducted numerical simulations to explore the fsi mechanisms of a two cylinder vivace the flow field and dynamical response of a typical pattern 1a are shown in fig 3 the oscillations and the lift force of the two cylinders are synchronized in frequency with a 20⁰ pad the vortices shed from the upper lower side of the 1st cylinder touch the corresponding side of the 2nd cylinder and merge with the wake vortices of the 2nd cylinder as a consequence there is only one vortex street behind the two cylinders there is no independent wake shedding from the 2nd cylinder in this scenario the oscillations of the two cylinders are both controlled by the vortices shed from the 1st cylinder 3 3 pattern 1b pattern 1b is similar to pattern 1 but the 2nd cylinder has a higher amplitude than the 1st cylinder as shown in fig 4 the oscillations of the two cylinders are still synchronized in frequency but are out of phase with a pad around 140 note that the value of pad is not used to distinguish pattern 1b from pattern 1a both of the patterns can have a constant pad of any value within the range 180 180 the instantaneous frequencies also show more variation than pattern 1a which means the oscillations are as stable as in pattern 1a an example can also be found in ding et al 2019 where the flow field is visualized fig 5 note that the spacing stiffness and damping ratio of the cfd simulation is the same with the experimental test in fig 4 but the reynolds number is different the oscillations are still synchronized but the amplitude of the 2nd cylinder is slightly higher than that of the 1st cylinder compared to the flow field of pattern 1a in fig 3 a major difference is that the wake vortices of the 1st cylinder do not shed in the gap region but shed behind the 2nd cylinder as can be seen in each phase of the cycle there is always a vortical band connecting the two cylinders the exciting force for the 1st cylinder is smaller than the 2nd cylinder because the shedding mainly occurs behind the 2nd cylinder 3 4 pattern 2a pattern 2 is a partially coupled pattern in which the cylinders may have more than one response frequency but the dominant frequencies are the same pattern 2 has two sub patterns in pattern 2a the 1st cylinder has only one oscillation frequency while the 2nd cylinder has more than one oscillating frequency as shown in fig 6 the dominant frequencies of the two cylinders are equal the time history of the 2nd cylinder shows beating which indicates that the cylinder oscillation has two close frequencies this is confirmed by the psd pad is periodically changing within a specific range according to the frequency difference this pattern implies that the 2nd cylinder is subjected to the influence of the upstream wake vortex shedding from the 1st cylinder and also to its own wake vortex shedding however due to the shielding effect the inflow velocity for the two cylinders are not the same hence the vortex shedding frequencies are not the same either the wake shedding of the 1st cylinder is much more powerful as can be seen from the power spectrum curve ding et al 2015 presented a cfd study on the fio of multiple cylinders one case is shown in fig 7 the beating displacement history implies that the 2nd cylinder has two frequencies the evolution of the flow field shows clearly that each of the cylinders has its own vortex shedding the first frequency of the 2nd cylinder comes from its own wake vortex shedding note that this frequency should be lower than that of the 1st cylinder due to the shielding effect as mentioned earlier meanwhile the 2nd cylinder is also under the impact of the vortices shed from the 1st cylinder which explains the source and nature of the second frequency conceptually there could be another pattern to match pattern 3 when the 1st cylinder having more than one frequency while the 2nd cylinder having only one however this phenomenon was not observed experimentally this is the case because the wake of the 2nd cylinder is too weak and too far away from the 1st cylinder to have an impact on the oscillation of the 1st cylinder without the 2nd cylinder being affected by the wake of the 1st cylinder 3 5 pattern 2b as shown in fig 8 pattern 2b occurs when both cylinders have more than one frequency but their dominant frequencies are the same this means that the vibration and the wake of the 2nd cylinder have a stronger influence on the 1st cylinder the influence on the 1st cylinder is due to the fluid structure interactions in the gap region specifically depending on the timing the upstream vortices hit the 2nd cylinder and whether those vortices wrap around the second cylinder or shed through the gap between the two cylinders the frequency of excitation changes creating a two frequency excitation for both cylinders the evolution of the flow field in one cycle was simulated with a 2d urans method by ding et al 2013 and is shown in fig 9 this is presented only for the purpose of visualization so the spacing and damping ratios differ from the experimental test both cylinders are oscillating with two frequencies according to the displacement histories and psd while the dominant frequencies are the same the 1st cylinder is at the same location in phase 1 t tn 1 0 112 and phase 8 t tn 1 2 081 however the shed vortices of the 1st cylinder in phase 8 have very different forms compared with that in phase 1 it is the presence of the 2nd cylinder periodically affecting the formation of the wake vortices of the 1st cylinder and thus affecting the hydrodynamic force and the oscillation of the 1st cylinder 3 6 pattern 3a pattern 3 is the decoupled pattern in which the two cylinders have different dominant frequencies pattern 3 also has two sub patterns as shown in fig 10 pattern 3a is very similar to pattern 2b but the distinction between patterns 3a and 2b is clear there is more than one frequency for each cylinder but the dominant frequencies are different compared to pattern 2b pattern 3a has a lower level weaker of coupling between the cylinders it implies that each cylinder s oscillation is controlled by its own vortex shedding even though affected by the other s thus this pattern is classified as the decoupled pattern 3 7 pattern 3b pattern 3b represents cases in which both cylinders have one frequency but the frequencies are not equal the frequency of the 1st cylinder is always higher than that of the 2nd as shown in fig 11 due to the shielding effect the inflow velocity for the 2nd cylinder is always lower than that of the 1st cylinder in the initial branch and the upper branch of viv the oscillating frequency is positively associated with the flow velocity therefore the frequency for the 2nd cylinder is unlikely to be higher than that of the 1st cylinder in these two branches on the other hand if the two cylinders are placed apart by more than 3 0d the 2nd cylinder would have very limited influence on the 1st cylinder the 1st cylinder would act like an isolated single cylinder it would enter galloping after the upper branch of viv no lower branch of viv was observed for a single ptc cylinder according to previous research by kim et al 2013 the oscillation frequencies of two tandem cylinders with ptc and variable spacings are provided in fig 12 in this pattern the oscillations of the two cylinders are fully de coupled the wake vortex shedding of each cylinder must be strong enough to take control of its own cylinder oscillation and make the interactions between the cylinders negligible no cases were identified experimentally where the 2nd cylinder had a higher frequency than the first this is expected because the 2nd cylinder usually has a lower inflow velocity due to the shielding effect therefore the vortex shedding frequency should also be lower than that of the 1st cylinder s according to the strouhal law for stationary cylinders 3 8 pattern 4a in pattern 4 only one of the two cylinders is oscillating while the other one remains practically stationary pattern 4a occurs when the 1st cylinder is oscillating while the 2nd cylinder s oscillation is negligible as illustrated in fig 13 this is mainly the case because the wake vortex shedding of the 1st cylinder drives the 1st cylinder to oscillate but suppresses the wake of the 2nd cylinder at the same time when the shedding directions are opposite note that in some cases the cylinders remain static because of the static coulomb friction force cfd results ding et al 2013 are shown in fig 14 note that the damping ratio of the cfd case is lower than that of the experimental case the oscillation of the 1st cylinder is much more intense than that of the 2nd cylinder the vortices shed from the 1st cylinder grab the wake vortex of the 2nd cylinder while passing by leaving the 2nd cylinder without circulation no obvious vortex street can be found behind the 2nd cylinder therefore the amplitude of the 2nd cylinder is nearly completely suppressed 3 9 pattern 4b pattern 4b is just the opposite of pattern 4a which can be seen in fig 15 the wake vortex shedding of the 1st cylinder is not strong enough to oscillate the 1st cylinder but it is strong enough to oscillate the 2nd cylinder when its vortex shedding is in phase 3 10 pattern 5 pattern 5 is different from the others as the oscillation mode shifts from one pattern to another the shifting occurs intermittently but not periodically from the perspective of nonlinear dynamics it indicates that a non linear phenomenon where more than one stable attractor exists an example is shown in fig 16 multiple variations have been observed experimentally and computationally ding et al 2013 2016 3 11 summary the identification method and the characteristics of each pattern are summarized in table 2 a1 and a2 represent the oscillation amplitude of the 1st cylinder and the 2nd cylinder respectively f1 and f2 are the oscillation frequency for the 1st cylinder and the 2nd cylinder respectively when there is only one prominent frequency for each cylinder when there is more than one frequency fi j i j 1 2 is the j th most prominent frequency of the i th cylinder the hydrodynamic mechanisms are summarized in table 3 y 1 and y 2 represent the cylinder motions w 1 and w 2 represent the wake vortex shedding of the upstream and downstream cylinder respectively a summary of the dynamic characteristics of all the patterns is plotted in fig 17 for easy comparison 4 maps of patterns vs ζ re in fio regions fifteen maps of the patterns are presented in figs 18 20 for the three tandem spacing and the five spring stiffness values tested the patterns are mapped on the damping ratio reynolds number domain ζ re noted that in galloping only patterns 1 and 5 exist and all the other patterns occur in viv and transition so the viv patterns are investigated first three colors are used to indicate the coupling level of the motions of the tandem cylinders a green labels indicate fully synchronized motions in patterns 1 and 5 b yellow labels indicate pattern2 in which the coupling between the cylinders is still dominant but other factors play part in the motions c blue labels indicate pattern 3 in which the coupling is not dominant anymore or even the motions may be decoupled d red labels indicate pattern 4 which describes the scenarios where only one of the cylinders is oscillating while the other one is practically stationary as shown in figs 18 20 most of the cases in the initial branch of viv are synchronized patterns interspersed with patterns 4a and 4b pattern 4b occurs because the wake vortex shedding behind the 2nd cylinder is too weak and slow due to shielding by the 1st cylinder the oscillation of the 2nd cylinder in this branch is completely controlled by the wake vortices from the 1st cylinder as the flow speed increases viv shifts to the upper branch when the vortex shedding mode changes from the 2s mode to 2p mode for the 1st cylinder williamson and roshko 1988 the decoupled patterns start to show when the wake vortices of the 2nd cylinder are strong enough and the vortex shedding frequency is high enough to get coupled with the natural frequency of the 2nd cylinder two oscillation frequencies exist in this region one is from the vortex shedding of the 1st cylinder and the other one is from the 2nd further increase of the flow velocity increases the strouhal frequency of the 1st cylinder becoming too high to remain coupled with the natural frequency then viv tends to cease or enter the lower branch while the viv of the 2nd cylinder is still in high intensity as shown in pattern 1b the oscillation of the 2nd cylinder can have a significant influence on the 1st cylinder where pattern 2b occurs as shown in fig 18 pattern 5 mainly occurs when x 0 d 1 57 in the transition region around re 8 75 104 and in galloping re 9 104 in the transition region both driving mechanisms of viv and galloping exist when the onset of galloping occurs before the end of the viv upper branch the oscillation shifts intermittently between the viv mode and the galloping mode once galloping is fully developed both of the cylinders are synchronized again pattern 5 still occurs in some cases in fully developed galloping it will be analyzed more specifically in the following section the occurrence of each pattern is summarized in fig 21 as can be seen pattern 1a is the most common pattern at all three spacings tested the percentage of pattern 1 increases with x0 d while the sub pattern 1b decreases this means that as the spacing becomes wider it is easier for the two cylinders to synchronize but the amplitude of the 2nd cylinder can hardly be higher than that of the 1st cylinder the proportions of pattern 4 and pattern 5 decrease with x0 d the overall percentage of patterns 2 and 3 does not change significantly with x0 d when x0 d 1 57 the major sub patterns are pattern 2b and pattern 3a in which the upstream cylinder has two frequencies when x0 d 2 01 and 2 57 the major sub patterns are pattern 2a and pattern 3b in which the upstream cylinder has only one frequency this is the case because the influence of the downstream cylinder on the upstream cylinder diminishes as the spacing between the two cylinders widens 4 1 effect of parameters on fio energy to understand the coupling process in viv the relations between the cylinder oscillations are presented in fig 22 u 1 and u 2 represent the average inflow for the 1st and 2nd cylinder respectively y 1 and y 2 represent the cylinder motions w 1 and w 2 represent the wake vortex shedding interaction i j represents the interaction between the i th cylinder and the j th wake which includes the vortex force applied on the i th cylinder from the j th wake and also the disturbance of the vortices in wake j from the i th cylinder u 1 is the incoming flow velocity which is set by the channel u 2 is determined by u 1 the shielding effect of the 1st cylinder and the spacing between the cylinders longer spacing gives the flow more space to recover its velocity y 1 is controlled by the stiffness damping ratio and interaction1 1 from the wake vortex shedding w 1 here we neglect the direct effect from w 2 because of the distance w 1 is mainly the von kármán vortex street which is synchronized with the motion y 1 however it is also under the effect of y 2 y 2 is undergoing two interactions interaction2 1 and interaction2 2 interaction2 1 decreases with increasing spacing w 2 is synchronized with y 2 and also disturbed by w 1 such disturbances could be enhancing or suppressing depending on the frequency and phase values the effect of the disturbances decreases with increasing spacing as well the damping ratio ζ can affect the oscillation amplitude which leads to the changes in the shielding effect this can be observed in all of the cases in figs 19 and 20 when the spacing is 2 01 or 2 57 higher damping ratios narrow the partially coupled pattern 2 or decoupled pattern 3 regions which means that lower oscillation amplitudes cause a higher coupling level in viv the higher amplitudes of y 2 lead to stronger wake vortex shedding w 2 which makes it harder to be controlled by w 1 so the frequency component is more prominent than in the high damping low amplitude cases another possible reason is that the high amplitude of y 1 leads to a stronger shielding effect which means the u 2 is lower for the low damping cases and the vortex shedding frequency would be lower according to strouhal law therefore there could be a more significant difference between the vortex shedding frequencies of w 1 and w 2 and it would be more difficult for the motions to get coupled however the partially coupled and decoupled regions do not shrink with higher damping ratios at spacing 1 57 as shown in fig 18 that occurs mainly because the short gap distance leads to a minimal velocity recovery for u 2 due to the shielding effect the higher difference between u 1 and u 2 causes a more significant difference between the vortex shedding frequencies of w 1 and w 2 so it is too narrow in this particular spacing for the wakes to be synchronized regardless of the amplitudes of y 1 and y 2 in other cases with longer velocity recovery distances the difference between u 1 and u 2 would be smaller and it would also be easier for the cylinders to get coupled that is the reason why more synchronized patterns appear in figs 19 and 20 spring stiffness controls the natural frequency and then leads to the coupling level between y 1 and w 1 at a certain inflow velocity and the coupling level among w 1 y 2 and w 2 as well as the stiffness of the cylinders increases the oscillations tend to be fully coupled or synchronized as can be seen in figs 18 20 there are fewer decoupled patterns pattern 3 with the higher stiffness for all the spacing and damping ratios 4 2 oscillation patterns and converted hydrokinetic power the patterns are summarized based on their oscillational characteristics which is also the foundation of the power harnessing calculation in oscillations kinetic power exchanges between the cylinders and the fluid it is reasonable to expect that there may exist a relationship between patterns and power in the oscillator fig 23 shows the energy harnessing power related to the patterns the colors in the graph represent the different coupling level four cases are selected for each spacing to represent the low stiffness low damping cases the low stiffness high damping cases the high stiffness low damping cases and the high stiffness high damping cases regardless in all the tandem cylinder tests the harnessed energy of the upstream cylinder increases significantly compared to the isolated cylinder oscillator sun et al 2017 as can be seen in the first row of fig 23 a when x 0 d 1 57 k 400 n m ζ 0 06 and 0 18 there is a slight drop of the harnessed power of the 1st cylinder p 1 when the pattern changes from fully synchronized pattern to decoupled patterns in viv around re 5 104 at the same point there is also a jump of the harnessing power of the 2nd cylinder p 2 it occurs when w 2 starts to get coupled with y 2 and viv occurs for both cylinders individually as stated before the decoupled patterns show at higher velocity when the stiffness increases to 1000 n m as shown in the second row of fig 23 a where the galloping is initially triggered on the 1st cylinder while viv occurs to the 2nd cylinder in this region p 1 increases dramatically and p 2 changes marginally as the spacing increases to 2 01 as shown in fig 23 b the decoupled region is much wider when k 400 n m and ζ 0 06 starting from re 4 4 104 and ending before galloping both p 1 and p 2 increase gradually with the flow velocity which means both cylinders are in viv the decoupled region narrows down with higher stiffness and damping ratio values there is a slight boost for p 2 when decoupled patterns occur but it does not affect p 1 as much as p 2 the situation for x 0 d 2 57 is similar to 2 01 as shown in fig 23 c 4 3 case study some special cases in the tests patterns 4 and 5 do not occur regularly they are studied further in this section pattern 4 occurs in viv while pattern 5 occurs in galloping and the transition region between viv and galloping 4 3 1 low flow velocity with one cylinder stationary pattern 4 in pattern 4a the 1st cylinder is oscillating but the 2nd cylinder is basically stationary in pattern 4b the situation is reversed the 1st cylinder is stationary while the 2nd cylinder is oscillating both patterns occur before or at the beginning of the viv regions pattern 4b appears only at the very beginning of some sets of tests when the spacing is 1 57 and 2 57 while pattern 4a occurs at little higher velocities when the spacing ratio is 2 01 pattern 4a also occurs at the lowest velocities for low damping values that is the case because the cylinders may start to oscillate at velocities below the testing range as explained in fig 14 pattern 4a occurs when w 1 is strong enough to drive y 1 but w 2 is not strong enough to drive y 2 under the suppression from w 1 and the out of phase force f i n t e r a c t i o n 2 1 inequalities 3 1 3 2 model this scenario 3 1 f i n t e r a c t i o n 1 1 f c o u l o m b s t a t i c 3 2 f i n t e r a c t i o n 2 2 f i n t e r a c t i o n 2 1 f c o u l o m b s t a t i c pattern 4b occurs when w 1 is not strong enough to drive y 1 but w 2 is strong enough to drive y 2 after the enhancing from w 1 and the in phase force f i n t e r a c t i o n 2 1 inequalities 4 1 4 2 model this scenario 4 1 f i n t e r a c t i o n 1 1 f c o u l o m b s t a t i c 4 2 f i n t e r a c t i o n 2 2 f i n t e r a c t i o n 2 1 f c o u l o m b s t a t i c since f i n t e r a c t i o n 1 1 monotonically increases before or at the beginning of viv it is easy to understand that pattern 4b can only occur at the lowest velocity of each set of tests if f i n t e r a c t i o n 1 1 is high enough to drive y 1 at a certain velocity then it should also be able to drive it at higher velocities in most of the cases pattern 4b is followed by pattern 1a which means the cylinders are synchronized however as the inflow velocity u 1 increases a little this synchronization is broken w 1 is no longer helping w 2 to drive y 2 and they even work against each other so that the amplitude of the total hydrodynamic force is lower than that of the static coulomb friction force and pattern 4a appears this trend should also work for the cases with spacing equal to 2 01 however no pattern 4b is recorded it is speculated that the test range was not wide or fine enough to reveal pattern 4b 4 3 2 phase shift phenomena pattern 5 pattern 5 mostly occurs at low k ζ and spacing as shown in figs 18 20 when the amplitude is high the frequency is low and the spacing ratio is 1 57 the oscillation shifts between two different scenarios without any apparent change in external flow conditions the pattern is a manifestation of the nonlinearity of the oscillations from the nonlinear dynamic point of view there are multiple stable limit oscillation cycles lco and the lcos are close to each other small perturbations can lead the motion trajectory from one lco to another lco taking the case in fig 16 for example the phase difference between the motions is 180 for the first 14 s the cylinders are oscillating perfectly out of phase the amplitude of the 1st cylinder is higher than that of the 2nd cylinder then the 1st cylinder starts oscillating slower and the 2nd cylinder starts oscillating faster the pad keeps dropping for the next 30 s during which the 1st cylinder oscillates one and a half cycles more than the 2nd cylinder the two cylinders oscillate in phase from the 44th second until the end of the recording in this case there are at least two stable lcos one is the out of phase mode in the first 14 s and the other one is the in phase mode in the last 14 s the middle period can also be a stable stage similar to pattern 3b or just the transition path between the two obvious attractors there are other types of pattern 5 being observed some of them are selected and presented in fig 24 they all share five obvious similarities 1 during the shift the instantaneous frequency changes 2 during the shift the 1st cylinder s frequency is reduced oscillating slower and the 2nd cylinder s frequency increases oscillating faster 3 pad shifts always by about 180 4 the oscillations of the cylinders change simultaneously 5 the shifts cause changes to the energy harnessing power they also exhibit some different characteristics 1 there are two shifting processes one being instantaneous and the other very slow as shown in fig 16 the process starts from the 15th second and ends at the 44th second it takes 29 s or 48 of the sampling time 60 s however it takes only 5 s for the oscillation mode to change from out of phase mode to in phase mode in the case of fig 24 a 2 the vibration shifts from in phase mode to out of phase mode within 3 s in fig 24 b it is only 8 or 5 of the sampling time the shift can be unidirectional or bidirectional according to the pad in fig 24 c and d in the current research the fio patterns of two ptc cylinder in tandem are classified based on displacement and frequency measurements other dynamical characteristics i e the hydrodynamic force and the phase shift between force and displacement contain additional information to reveal the underlying mechanics further flow field analysis including vortex patterns and shear layer stability may be helpful in explaining the underlying mechanism for each pattern they all deserve further investigation in the future 6 conclusions the oscillation patterns for two tandem placed cylinders with turbulence stimulation in the form of selective roughness were identified and classified in this study the classification method and the characteristics of each pattern were presented the occurrence of each pattern was explained based on the interaction between cylinder motion and timing of vortices interfering with the 2nd cylinder or its shear layers or its wake 1 in the viv region the oscillations of the two cylinders mainly have three coupling levels fully synchronized partially coupled and fully decoupled depending on the fluid structure interaction among the two cylinders and the two wake vortex shedding the synchronized mode occurs when both cylinders are dominated by the wake of the upstream cylinder the partially coupled and fully decoupled modes occur when the wake of the downstream cylinder is strong enough to affect or dominate the oscillation of the 2nd cylinder in viv as the flow speed increases oscillation mode changes from fully synchronized to partially coupled and then fully decoupled 2 some key phenomena are observed especially on how the downstream cylinder is affecting the upstream cylinder in the viv region this occurs when the inflow velocity is beyond the region of the viv of the 1st cylinder but the 2nd cylinder is still in viv due to the shielding effect the oscillation of the 2nd cylinder periodically perturbs the wake of the 1st cylinder and gives the upstream cylinder another frequency 3 the system parameters including cylinder spacing spring stiffness and damping ratio are playing important roles in the fio patterns generally speaking higher damping ratio and higher stiffness make it easier for the two cylinders to synchronize the motions of the cylinders tend to decouple with lower damping ratio and lower stiffness especially when the wake vortex shedding frequency of the 2nd cylinder approaches the natural frequency in 5 104 re 8 105 4 nonlinear behavior occurs in the galloping region multiple attractors exist in galloping which leads to pattern shifting some crucial factors deserve further investigation such as the shielding effect and the velocity recovery behind an oscillating cylinder the visualization of the vortices behavior around the cylinders in viv and the multiple attractors
