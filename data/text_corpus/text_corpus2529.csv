12645,peroxymonosulfate pms activation based on iron based catalyst has caught increasing attention in wastewater treatment but is strongly impeded by the sluggish kinetics of fe ii recovery in this study nitrogen doped carbon encapsulated fe3c with dual reaction centres coupled via cfe channel was developed by electrospinning and chemical vapor deposition cvd technique the remarkable catalysis performance was conferred by the formation of cfe short bond which linked c poor electron reaction centres from n doped carbon frameworks and the fe rich electron reaction centres from fe3c fe nc 800 achieved 100 sulfamethoxazole smx degradation within 20 min and showed excellent cycle stability after 5 cycles the electron transfer rate between the dual reaction region was accelerated due to short transport distance and low transmission resistance electrons from pollutants were compensated to fe3 via cfe bond bridges promoting the regeneration of fe2 and accelerating the efficiency of the fe2 fe3 cycle besides the experiments of reactive oxygen species ros quenching and capture revealed the degradation pathway both radical and nonradical oxidation played a key role in the fe nc 800 pms system this work will offer a valuable clue on the design of multi benefit catalysts to achieve efficient removal of pollutants in wastewater keywords nitrogen doped carbon dual reaction centres pms activation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction currently the massive emission of organic pollutants have become a significant threat to the global water environment and pose a continuous hazard to human health 1 2 due to their non biodegradability it is urgent to remove these organic pollutants from aquatic environment efficiently and economically as an efficient water treatment technology advanced oxidation processes aops are applied for eliminating these emerging contaminants 3 peroxymonosulfate pms activation is receiving widespread attention due to the generation of various reactive oxygen species ros such as sulfate so4 hydroxyl radicals oh and single oxygen 1o2 4 for pms activation transition metal co fe mn etc ions present promising advantages in wastewater treatment 5 7 specifically fe is considered to be one of the most potential active metals in pms activation to remove persistent organic pollutants with low cost naturally abundant low toxic and outstanding redox activity 8 however fe3 fe2 0 77 v has a more negative redox potential compared to hso5 so5 1 10 v for the reaction of fe2 hso5 eq 1 the low rate between the reaction fe3 and hso5 eq 2 which is not favorable for the recycle of fe3 fe2 9 on the other hand it is necessary to ensure that the electron transfer from the metal based catalyst to the pms allows the oo bond to be broken to produce free radicals 10 therefore more efforts are urgently required to design and develop novel fe based catalysts for pms activation by accelerating both electron transfer and efficient fe3 fe2 recycle 1 fe 2 hso 5 fe 3 so 4 oh 2 fe 3 hso 5 fe 2 so 5 h some methods in intensifying electron transfer during pms activation process have been recently implemented such as utilizing defect engineering assistance to adjust the electronic state of the surface 11 12 regulating morphologic structure to enhance electron utilization 13 14 and adding light aid to provide electrons 15 among them the construction of dual active centers including electron poor and electron rich reaction centres is becoming a significant method for enhancing the efficiency of pms activation 16 18 the electron poor reaction region is responsible for accepting the electrons from the pollutant as the acceptor after which the electrons are transported to the electron rich reaction region and ultimately utilized for the activation of pms zhang et al synthesized an innovative cu Î³ fe2o3 catalyst with the ability to produce highly reactive so4 efficiently the excellent performance was attributed to a dual reaction centre through the fe o cu bridge coupling transferring the electrons obtained from fe to the cu site 19 also it has been reported that the formation of electron rich activation centres over c o fe bonds can enhance catalysis reaction performance and accelerate the degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride 20 although the construction of dual reactive centers displayed a satisfactory catalytic prospect in enhancing the activation of pms the rate of electron transfer between the rich and the poor reactive centers was an important factor hindering the further improvement in the efficiency of pms activation the long bond between the rich and the poor reactive centers is a form of multi atomic electron transport however the electron transfer among multiple atoms leads to problems of long transport distance and transmission resistance from rotation and vibration of chemical bonds such problems slow down inter atomic electron transport to some extent therefore in order to speed up the transmission of electrons between the poor and rich electron centers the construction of a short cfe bond as the electron shuttle to directly connect the poor to rich electron centers would achieve the purpose of improving the catalytic activity on the other hand carbon materials are widely used to accelerate fe3 fe2 cycles via donating electrons or chelating with fe3 21 moreover recent studies of heteroatoms doping especially nitrogen doping were concerned for the properties of cost efficiency and facile surface chemistry for functional modification in advanced oxidation processes 22 24 the nonmetal nitrogen doping provides more excellent feature to carbon based catalysts for instance the introduction of nitrogen not only increases the stability of catalyst 25 but also achieves the efficient distribution of pollutant molecules on the carbon network by improving the surface affinity of carbon based catalysts 26 28 thus the nitrogen doped carbon based material is considered as a promising pms promotor that also exhibits excellent synergy in further facilitating the cycle between fe3 and fe2 inspired by this fe3c embedded nitrogen doped carbon catalyst with dual reaction centers over cfe short bond was successfully synthesized by coupling electrospinning with subsequent chemical vapor deposition cvd strategies scanning electron microscopy tests sem were applied to probe catalyst morphology and the obtained catalyst was systematically recorded by x ray diffraction xrd patterns and raman the catalysis properties and the influences of reaction parameters initial ph catalyst dosages and pms dosages et al on catalytic performance were discussed comprehensively by decomposing sulfamethoxazole smx in water the degradation efficiency of different pollutants and the reusability of the catalyst were also evaluated moreover the catalytic mechanism was proposed via electrochemical analysis classic quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance epr measurements 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals polyacrylonitrile pan mw 150 000 iron iii acetylacetonate fe acac 3 peroxymonosulfate pms sulfamethoxazole smx bisphenol a bpa p benzoquinone p bq and p chlorophenol pcp were obtained from shanghai aladdin chemistry co ltd tetracycline hydrochloride tc was supplied from shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd n n dimethylformamide dmf 99 9 tert butyl alcohol tba humic acid ha nacl naoh nahco3 and hcl were purchased by sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china melamine methanol meoh and furfuryl alcohol ffa were purchased from tianjin damao chemical reagent factory 2 2 preparation of the fe nc fe nc composites were fabricated through electrospinning technique and cvd strategies 1 g of pan and 0 23 m fe acac 3 were dissolved in 10 ml dmf by stirring until uniform then the mixture was drawn into a 10 ml plastic injection syringe setting the electrostatic spinning parameters to the voltage of 20 kv the distance from nozzle to collector is 15 cm and the injection speed of 1 8 l h 1 then the pan fe was obtained after that the resulted pan fe was preoxidized under air atmosphere specific conditions heating rate of 2 c min 1 target temperature of 250 c stabilization time of 2 h the resulting sample was ground and 2 g of melamine was added then sample was pyrolyzed at different temperatures in an ar atmosphere specific conditions heating rate of 5 c min 1 stabilization time of 2 h using fe nc x as the name of the final composites x indicates the carbonization temperature 600 800 and 1000 for comparison fe c 800 and nc 800 were synthesized by implementing the same process but without melamine and fe acac 3 respectively 2 3 characterization the obtaining x ray diffraction xrd patterns and scanning electron microscopy sem images were applied to investigate the crystal structure and morphology of samples brunauer emmet teller bet methods and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectra were analyzed to record the prepared materials the technique of x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was used to investigate the chemical compositions and the states of products raman spectra was recorded by using raman spectroscopic system with a 633 nm laser which identify the defect degree of materials the linear scanning voltammetry lsv and chronoamperometry i t curve were performed by electrochemical test the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was adapted to investigate the charge transferresistance 2 4 experimental procedures and analytical methods the removal efficiency of smx analyzed catalytic activity of catalysts in degradation process all experiments were carried out in 50 ml of smx solution with the same stirring rate in a typical degradation experiment 10 mg of fe nc was put into the 30 ppm smx solution which was stirred for 30 min at 25 c to achieve equilibrium between adsorption and desorption the initial ph of solution was 7 4 adjusting by hcl or naoh before the degradation reaction then the dosage of 1 mm pms was injected into the solution containing the pollutant and catalyst to start the reaction a 0 5 ml sample was withdrawn at specified intervals and quenched the reaction by 0 25 ml meoh immediately after that the mixture filtered with a 0 22 Î¼m filter the smx concentration was detected under fixed environmental conditions 0 1 wt acetic acid and acetonitrile 55 45 v v were chosen as the mobile phases for high performance liquid chromatography hplc task adjusting the flow rate and wavelength were 0 8 ml min 1 and 270 nm respectively methods for analyzing the concentration of pollutants in experiments were mentioned in table s1 the concentration of iron leaching was detected by inductively coupled optical emission spectrometry icp oes the electron paramagnetic resonance epr tests were carried out to qualitatively identify reactive radicals with dmpo and tmep as the trapping agent furthermore the quenching experiments were conducted utilizing meoh tba ffa and p bq as scavengers the procedure was similar to the degradation experiments described above except that quantitative meoh tba ffa and p bq were added prior to the reaction to eliminate the effects of so4 oh 1o2 and o2 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalyst characterization fig s1 illustrated in detail the fabrication procedure of fe nc 800 fe was dispersed in and anchored to nanofibrous support through electrospinning technique using melamine as a nitrogen and carbon source fe nc 800 can be successfully fabricated through the one step calcination at 800 c under ar gas the morphology of fe nc 800 was observed by sem fig 1a b and c showed that the iron loaded carbon nanofibrous exhibited interwoven morphology in addition distinctive short branching nanostructures were observed in the sample and small branches were derived on the support material which were attributed to the formation of nitrogen doped carbon nanotube ncnt structures as previous reported work yang et al synthesized catalysts with high capacity ncnt encapsulated metal nanoparticles by adding melamine via pyrolysis process 28 the nanoparticles embedded in small branches were due to the exposure of little fe3c on the surface of carbon nanofibers 23 the phases and crystalline configuration of prepared catalysts were determined using xrd technique and the results were summarized in fig 2a the broad peak at 26 4 was designated as the 002 diffraction plane of graphitized carbon 29 notably the intensity of the graphitic carbon diffraction peak showed the role of melamine in the graphitization process 30 in the patterns of fe nc 800 and fe c 800 the planes of 210 102 031 112 and 131 were matched well with the peak at 37 8 43 8 44 9 45 9 and 48 6 respectively these derived from the presence of fe3c jcpds no 85 1317 fe nc 800 had higher peak intensity suggested that melamine promoted the exposure of fe3c also fe0 related xrd patterns were identified in fe nc 800 the relatively peaks at 44 7 65 0 and 82 3 were well indexed to the crystalline planes of 110 200 and 211 in fe0 jcpds 06 0696 the above results demonstrated that iron in fe c 800 was transformed into fe0 and fe3c after co pyrolysis therefore cfe bond may have been constructed in the fe nc 800 which would confer the catalyst with versatility for pms activation and pollutants degradation the catalyst was further characterized via the ft ir spectra to analyze the surface functional groups and the chemical bonds fig s2 the band approximately at 1202 cm 1 was ascribed to the cn vibrations and the band at 1572 cm 1 was caused by the present of cc bond 31 additionally the peaks at 2810 and 2812 cm 1 were characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric bendings of ch2 groups 32 the stretch bandwidth from 3000 to 3400 cm 1 indicated the existence of oh bonds respectively 33 3 2 catalytic performance in order to reflect the differences in catalytic reaction the degradation efficiency of different reaction systems was evaluated by the degradation of smx as shown in fig 2b for the system without any catalyst only 23 66 of smx was removed by pms directly which was ascribed to the self decomposition of pms generating the small amounts of ros in the absence of catalyst meanwhile 11 55 of smx was degraded by the physical adsorption of fe nc 800 without addition of pms showing that the contribution of adsorption in smx degradation to illustrate this clearly the brunauer emmett teller bet test was performed the nitrogen adsorption desorption curve test verified the surface area and pore properties of the obtained catalysts fig s3 fe nc 800 exhibited a representative type iv isotherm and pronounced hysteresis sloop demonstrating the presence of mesoporosity 34 the surface areas pore volume and pore sizes are 282 7 m2 g 0 25 cm3 g and 3 37 nm respectively and fe c 800 are 232 4 m2 g 0 15 cm3 g and 1 54 nm respectively for nc 800 the surface area 230 8 m2 g pore volume 0 18 cm3 g and pore sizes 1 61 nm were significantly lower than for the optimum catalyst therefore fe nc 800 had the remarkable advantage of being able to effectively adsorb pollutants because of the essential importance of adsorption for degradation 35 these results revealed fe nc 800 can expose more accessible active sites possibly promoting the degradation of pollutants 36 notably when pms and fe nc 800 were added simultaneously to the smx solution the degradation efficiency of smx increased rapidly and achieved 100 in 20 min the above findings proved that smx was removed by adsorption and degradation with the degradation process dominating smx removal after adsorption reaching equilibrium in contrast for the catalysts without fe or melamine the removal efficiencies of smx were 89 8 and 97 9 after 20 min respectively combined with the value of k the optimal k value of 0 3269 min 1 was discovered from the catalysis system of fe nc 800 in contrast the k values of 0 1470 and 0 1059 min 1 in fe c 800 pms and nc 800 pms systems were well below the best value fig 2c due to the efficient catalytic performance of fe nc 800 catalyst it is reasonable to consider synergistic effects between fe and melamine in the composite these results clearly demonstrated that the cfe bonds as well as the large pore volume and surface areas are essential for activating pms in the catalyst reaction in order to demonstrate the present of cfe bonds elemental chemical valence and bonding features of different samples were further detected through xps technique in fig 3a the c n o and fe elements were verified to be present in the prepared mixture as illustrated in fig 3b the detail fitting results of c 1 s can be decomposed into five peaks among them the binding energies of cc chemical bond could be found at 284 8 ev the peaks fitted to co and o c o which contained oxygen atoms locating at 286 3 and 288 9 ev respectively the peak located at 285 3 ev was in accordance with cn revealing that the carbon structure with n doping the peaks at 283 8 ev can be convoluted to the cfe bonds come from fe3c in composites specially fe nc 800 possessed the cfe bond successfully implying that the interaction of fe and n doped carbon frameworks which was expected to be the active site for pms activation fig s4 combined the results of the degradation efficiency of smx in fe nc 800 pms system with those of fe c 800 pms and nc 800 pms system indicated that the successful synthesis of cfe is a key point for improving catalytic performance consistent with the xrd results the n 1 s spectra in fig 3c displayed four sub bands the binding energies of 398 4 ev corresponded to pyridinic n 400 2 ev to adsorbed pyrrolic n 401 2 ev was referred to graphitic n and 404 4 ev to oxidized n species it had been verified the generation of nitrogen atoms in the carbon framework as previous work reported the doped nitrogen atoms can produce more defects in carbon skeleton and accelerate the rate of electron transfer thereby enhancing catalytic activity 37 fig 3d showed the spectra of fe 2p which were observed in six peaks it is found that there are two peaks at 709 8 fe 2p3 2 and 723 0 ev fe 2p1 2 were in conformity with fe ii besides two signals corresponded to respective fe iii species including 713 5 fe 2p3 2 and 725 9 ev fe 2p1 2 the co existence of fe iii and fe ii suggested that fe iii could be converted to fe ii in fe nc 800 thus solving the problem of fe ii regeneration difficulty 7 two main bands at 706 7 and 719 5 ev coincided with fe0 2p3 2 and fe0 2p1 2 which might be due to uncontrollable reduction reaction on the surfaces the presence of fe0 played a key role in further accelerating the iron cycle 3 2 1 catalyst optimization in general the dosing of raw materials will impact the catalytic performance of the as prepared catalyst the doping dosage of fe acac 3 was modulated from 0 17 0 23 0 29 to 0 35 m in the composite denoted 1fe nc 800 fe nc 800 2fe nc 800 and 3fe nc 800 respectively the degradation rate of smx is exhibited in fig 4a it can be clearly found that 1fe nc 800 86 5 fe nc 800 100 2fe nc 800 92 3 and 3fe nc 800 96 8 demonstrated significant difference under the same catalytic conditions at 20 min and the values of k were 0 0976 0 3296 0 1340 0 1585 min 1 respectively notably as the dosage of fe was further added to 0 23 m the degradation rate gradually improved this result was attributed to the formation of more active sites that produced more ros to support accelerated smx removal kinetics also the additive content of iron source will change the morphology of the obtained catalysts which supported the aforementioned differences in degradation efficiency when the iron content was inadequate fig s5a iron cannot be fully exposed on the electrospun nanofibers which was detrimental to the synthesis of the catalytic site the limited number of active sites and ineffective synthesis of cfe bonds in the composite materials both contributed to the slow fe ii regeneration if the iron source was excessive fig s5b resulting in severe aggregation of iron particles 38 moreover iron doping can affect the catalytic degradation of the catalyst by altering the adsorption ability of the catalyst the adsorption and degradation efficiency of smx increased when the iron dosage increased from 0 17 m to 0 23 m inferring the stronger ability of pms activation with more smx adsorption sites however the adsorption and degradation efficiency of smx decreased significantly with increasing from 0 23 m to 0 35 m owing to the severe aggregation of the fe particle the surface adsorption sites were covered and the degradation rate of smx was gradually reduced 39 besides the catalytic performance of composites at different pyrolysis temperatures was analyzed comprehensively as illustrated in fig 4b smx removal rate was enhanced gradually as the carbonation temperature raised from 600 c to 800 c the kinetic rate constant on fe nc 800 0 3296 min 1 was approximately 3 times greater than those on fe nc 600 0 1047 min 1 to further raise the pyrolysis temperature to 1000 c the degradation efficiency of smx did not increase significantly at the applied high energy and the k value was only increased by 0 0156 min 1 a sufficiently high pyrolysis temperature facilitated the decomposition of the melamine and the reduction of the iron species to metallic iron at the same time the defective structure formed in high temperatures facilitates improved charge transfer processes 40 pyrolysis time is also a key factor in the degradation efficiency of smx carbonization was tested at 800 c for 1 2 and 4 h then denoted fe nc 800 1 fe nc 800 and fe nc 800 4 respectively it was found that the smx removal rates of 88 7 and 94 0 could be obtained for fe nc 800 1 and fe nc 800 4 fig 4c respectively in comparison to fe nc 800 0 3296 min 1 the respective k values for fe nc 800 1 and fe nc 800 4 drop to 0 0813 min 1 and 0 099 min 1 taken together the smx catalytic rate of fe nc 800 was clearly superior to that of the other catalysts so the catalyst prepared by pyrolysis at 800 c for 2 h was chosen for the next step of the study to further demonstrate the structural defects of the catalyst under different pyrolytic conditions the raman spectrum was investigated the d band at 1352 cm 1 reflects the defective level or lattice distortions in carbon atoms and the g band at 1583 cm 1 represents the graphitization degree of carbons generally the ratio id ig is derived by comparing the intensity in the d and g bands which can be used to determine the extent of defects in carbon based complexes 41 as displayed in fig s6a the id ig ratios of fe nc 600 fe nc 800 and fe nc 1000 were 2 51 2 27 and 2 15 respectively therefore this result suggested that the component graphitization level was improved due to the formation of more sp2 sites generation via higher pyrolysis temperature 42 in addition the result for the effect of different pyrolysis times suggested that more defect sites and disordered structures were created via extend time at the same pyrolysis temperature fig s6b although the higher level of defects of fe nc 800 4 than that of fe nc 800 the catalytic capability is inferior to fe nc 800 therefore it is vital to satisfy the balance of graphitization and defect engineering of carbon material for better catalytic activity 43 the relatively id ig 2 27 of catalyst with a significant degree of defect to accelerate the activation of pms by improving Ï electron mobility and facilitating electron transfer 3 2 2 effect of various factors on smx degradation based on experiments conducted with the fe nc 800 pms system the influence of different catalyst dosages of 0 1 0 2 0 4 g l on smx removal was evaluated fig 5a showed that the degradation rate of fe nc 800 significantly promoted with the catalyst dosages enhanced from 0 1 to 0 2 g l and meanwhile all of smx was completely degraded in 20 min theoretically this phenomenon can be explained that increasing the dosage of catalyst offered more active sites and contact area for the pms to ensure rapid decomposition of the pms to produce sufficient ros 44 however the value of k showed a decreasing trend 0 1423 min 1 if the addition level was continued to be increased to 0 4 g l the above result was attributed to the insufficient amount of pms which did not adequate to generate enough ros also the excessive catalyst would have contributed to the effect of so4 removal 45 therefore 0 2 g l fe nc 800 was selected to further study as depicted in fig 5b the smx removal ability in fe nc 800 pms reaction system with various pms dosage 0 5 2 mm was investigated it can be found that the degradation rate of smx enhanced from 72 3 to 100 0 and k values gradually improved from 0 0375 to 0 3296 min 1 when the pms concentration increased from 0 5 to 1 mm this phenomenon can be inferred that more pms will immediately produce more active species and attack to smx favouring increased degradation efficiency 46 in general excessive pms did not further enhance the degradation efficiency but rather caused the free radicals to be quenched 47 therefore it was distinctly found that the removal rate of smx was inhibited with further increasing the pms concentration to 1 mm fig 5c exhibited the effect of the fe nc 800 in different ph conditions from 3 4 to 9 4 to explore the removal rate it can be seen that 97 0 smx was degraded in 30 min explaining that fe nc 800 can effectively remove smx in broaden working ph also the corresponding reaction rate constant of smx degradation upgraded from 0 1746 to 0 3296 min 1 and then significantly declined to 0 1063 min 1 when ph further increased from 7 4 to 9 4 what was more the degradation efficiency of fe nc 800 was the highest removal rate for smx at ph value of 7 4 specifically the abundant h in the over acid environment was able to react with the ros secondly the electrostatic repulsion between the catalyst and contaminant would hinder the removal of the target contaminant 48 in an alkaline environment the degradation efficiency of the pollutant was reduced probably due to the conversion of the dominant radical to oh which had a short lifetime leading to the inhibition of degradation of the target contaminant 49 remarkably there was a correlation between solution ph and the amount of fe nc 800 adsorbed when the increase of ph from 3 4 to 5 4 the adsorption of smx was positively correlated with ph however further increasing the ph to 9 4 the adsorption of smx by fe nc 800 was inhibited the above data demonstrated that adsorption promoted the degradation of smx to some certain extent which was consistent with the results obtained previously however excessive adsorption led to the occupation of the active site resulting in poor catalytic performance 50 besides because ha and several inorganic ions e g cl hco3 are inevitably universal existence in the actual aqueous environment which would cause a potential impact on the catalytic ability hence the anti interference performance of the fe nc 800 was tested in the anions and ha fig 5d reflected the results of different cl concentrations on smx degradation when the concentration of cl was added at 1 and 5 mm in the reaction system the degradation of smx was inhibited slightly it is possible that this result was due to the production of less reactive chlorine substances such as cl and hocl eqs 3 5 51 which impede the degradation of smx notably as the amount of cl was further increased to 10 mm the inhibition of smx degradation was negligible according to previous reports cl could react with pms by double electron transfer and then be oxidized to produce highly reactive substances such as hclo and cl2 eqs 6 7 52 53 besides the concentration of hco3 from 1 5 and 10 mm showed a significant suppression effect on smx degradation which could be explained in two ways fig 5e firstly hco3 could alter the surface of fe nc 800 because of as a buffering complex damaging the activation of pms and the production of free radicals 54 also the lower oxidation potential of co3 and hco3 were produced by hco3 reacting with so4 and oh eqs 8 10 55 on the other hand the existence of hco3 would increase the ph in the reaction system thus decreasing catalytic activity 56 when 10 and 50 mg l of ha were added to the reaction system the smx degradation rate was about 61 1 and 58 9 in 5 min respectively indicating that the surface active sites of catalyst were covered by ha fig 5f 57 based on all the above results and discussion the fe nc 800 displayed an outstanding anti interference ability for the ha and anions suggesting that it was a superior catalyst for pollutants remediation in actual water 3 cl so 4 so 4 2 cl 4 cl oh hocl 5 hocl h cl h 2 o 6 cl hso 5 so 4 2 hocl 7 2 cl hso 5 h so 4 2 cl 2 h 2 o 8 hco 3 so 4 hco 3 so 4 2 9 hco 3 oh co 3 h 2 o 10 hco 3 hso 5 hco 3 hso 4 3 3 evaluation the universality and stability of catalyst the universality stability and reusability of the fe nc 800 were important issues for its potential applications the excellent pms activation performance of fe nc 800 by the degradation experiments of different pollutants and cycling reaction runs was confirmed as illustrated in fig s7a the high degradation rate was sustained when smx was substituted with pcp bpa or tc as the target pollutant pcp bpa and tc were effectively removed within 30 min with up to 98 70 99 50 and 89 4 respectively thus the result of degradation experiments of different pollutants can prove that as prepared fe nc 800 possessed excellent universal applicability during the smx degradation process to further prove the stability and reusability of the catalyst fe nc 800 was also applied as heterogeneous catalysts to perform the cycle experiments of smx degradation after five cycles the removal efficiency of smx still achieved 99 3 in 30 min certificating the superior degradation capacity of fe nc 800 fig 6a additionally the degradation kinetics of cycle experiments were similarly illustrated fig s7b the k values of five cycles were 0 2092 0 1789 0 1949 and 0 1678 min 1 respectively however the k value decreased by 0 1618 min 1 from cycle 1 to cycle 5 and the adsorption capacity of the catalyst was significantly reduced this was because active sites might be masked by the intermediates of smx degradation thus impeding pms activation and the adsorption of smx 58 besides the fe leaching of catalyst as an important factor was evaluated the obtained fe nc 800 with little leaching was only 0 26 mg l as previously reported leaching fe ions cannot contribute to the effective activation of pms due to its concentration below 0 3 mg l 59 the excellent cycle stability of fe nc 800 also attested that fe leaching was negligible to further analyze the stability of fe nc 800 the xrd characteristic peaks of fresh and recovered samples were compared with each other as seen from fig 6b the characteristic peaks belonging to fe3c exhibited a slight decrease while the intensity of the other peaks had not changed significantly after the reaction as depicted in fig s8 no significant morphology variations of fe nc 800 after 5 cycles exhibited that still had a satisfactory function compared to the initial catalyst all of these illustrated that the active sites of iron species had superior stability the xps spectra of n 1 s for used fe nc 800 were analyzed to further reflect the change in valence states of the different species fig 6c compared to fresh catalyst the corresponding pyridinic n content decreased from 45 7 to 32 5 after five cycles the amount of graphitic n showed the same change which retard from 26 1 to 20 0 this phenomenon provided the evidence for graphitic n and pyridinic n as the active nitrogen substances for pms decomposition fig 6e 31 60 61 additionally the xps spectra of fe 2p for used fe nc 800 catalyst was investigated fig 6d after the reaction fe0 and fe ii decreased respectively from 22 6 and 51 5 to 19 1 and 50 8 respectively whereas fe iii increased significantly fig 6e the change in iron valence state before and after the reaction indicates that the prepared catalyst has good stability and both fe0 and fe ii are involved in the activation of pms to produce ros by providing electrons in the meantime fe iii can able to accept electrons to realize the cycle between fe ii and fe iii 3 4 identification of ros and removal mechanism in order to recognize the category of the primary free radicals responsible for smx degradation in the fe nc 800 pms reaction system individual quenching experiments were conducted by adding methanol tba p bq and ffa as scavenger fig 7a b in this study methanol was spiked into the reaction solution as a typical scavenger for oh 9 7 108 m s and so4 3 2 106 m s 45 additionally the effect of tba was applied to identify the presence of oh 62 when methanol was introduced into the fe nc 800 pms system the degradation rate of smx can realize 92 4 within 20 min and the value of k was 0 1616 min 1 when tba was present in the catalytic system the degradation efficiency decreased from 100 to 97 1 and the value of k was 0 1103 min 1 from this it be inferred that oh and so4 participated in the smx degradation reaction besides ffa 3 2 107 m s and p bq 1 0 109 m s were severally used to identify the role of singlet oxygen 1o2 and superoxide radical o2 63 when ffa and p bq were put into reactive solution smx degradation efficiency dropped significantly to 75 9 and 71 8 in 20 min respectively also the corresponding degradation rate constants decreased substantially from 0 3269 to 0 0471 and 0 045 min 1 respectively these results indicated that 1o2 participated to a great extent and o2 was the dominant ros in the smx removal reaction therefore it can be inferred that so4 oh o2 and 1o2 were generated during the reaction system the reactive radicals were determined directly by epr spectroscopy the dmpo and temp were spiked into the reaction solution as spin trapping agent to further clarify the existence of ros species relevant epr signal of so4 and oh were discovered when the dmpo as trapper in the degradation system fig 7c affirming the formation of so4 and oh in the reaction process similar phenomenon also occurred in the epr tests for o2 species with the characteristic peaks of temp o2 fig 7d implying o2 was also generated for attacking pollutants from fig 7e a high strength characteristic triple lined signal with proportion of 1 1 1 was observed by using temp as a trapping agent to capture 1o2 signal based on these results the radical and nonradical processes both contributed to smx degradation it is known that electron transfer between contaminants pms and carbon based catalysts have an important influence on the non radical degradation pathway therefore the linear scanning voltammetry lsv tests were carried out under different conditions fig s9a an increasing trend of current was observed after pms and smx were incorporated into reaction solution attributing to the active sites of fe nc 800 could interact with pms the result of the chronoamperometry i t curve of fe nc 800 was depicted in fig s9b the current density had a notable enhanced was observed after the addition of pms 250 s and smx 450 s therefore the electron transfer among the smx molecules pms and the surface of fe nc 800 was confirmed to be involved in the smx degradation 7 the characteristic peaks at 712 0 and 724 9ev in the spectra of fe c 800 can be attributed to fe iii 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 respectively fig 8a notably the fe iii characteristic peaks of fe nc 800 displayed an apparent negative shift in contrast to fe c 800 the above result inferred that the internal electron of components can transfer to fe iii accelerating the fe3 fe2 redox cycle 64 besides the electron transfer properties were demonstrated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis fig 8b fe nc 800 exhibited smaller semicircle radius than fe c 800 in their nyquist plots indicating a lower transfer resistance for fe nc 800 65 therefore the present of cfe short bond can accelerate electron transfer and enhance fe2 fe3 cycle based on these results and previous literature a plausible pms activation mechanism and smx degradation in the fe nc 800 system can be described as follows fig 9 importantly the excellent surface area and abundant mesoporous of fe nc 800 that enhanced the adsorption of smx when fe nc 800 was utilized to activate pms fe0 reacted with pms to produce fe2 and so4 eq 11 the reaction between fe2 and hso5 for continuous generation of radicals achieved the redox cycle eq 1 2 fe3 was reduced by reaction with fe0 which can provide sufficient fe2 for activation of pms eq 12 besides so4 can further combine with h2o to generate oh eqs 13 14 66 which combined with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and produced perhydroxyl radicals ho2 eqs 15 16 the decomposition of ho2 was responsible for the generation of o2 which react to further generated 1o2 during the pms activation process eqs 17 20 4 also as previously reported 1o2 can be produced by itself decomposition of pms eq 21 58 more importantly the excellent surface area and abundant mesoporous of fe nc 800 that enhanced the adsorption of smx during the catalytic reaction fe3c nanoparticles served as active sites to offer fe rich electron centers and n doped carbon frameworks to provide c poor electron centers both were coupled to form a short cfe bond smx molecules were adsorbed on the carbon framework and their electrons were transferred to the c active centre via Ï Ï stacking the transmission distance of pollutants to the active site was shortened due to the coexistence of the active and adsorption sites the spatial separation of both ensured rapid electron transfer in the catalytic process 28 therefore the cfe bond acted as a connecting dual reaction centre bridge to quickly compensate electrons to fe3 eq 22 interestingly smx had the skills to transfer electrons to pms contributing to the degradation of pollutants n doping can adjust the electronic structure on the carbon skeleton while increasing defects structure in the catalyst and facilitating the transfer of Ï electrons to generate fe2 accelerating the activation process of pms in addition previous reports have demonstrated that pre adsorption of organic matter significantly accelerates the non radical oxidation pathway 67 in conclusion non radical dominated pms activation worked together with radical pathway to efficient degradation of smx 11 2 hso 5 fe 0 fe 2 2 so 4 2 oh 12 fe 0 2 fe 3 2 fe 2 13 so 4 h 2 o so 4 2 h oh 14 so 4 oh so 4 2 oh 15 hso 5 h 2 o h 2 o 2 hso 4

nitrogen doped carbon catalysts embedded with fe3c nanoparticles was successfully synthesized by pyrolysis strategy the fe nc 800 composite showed the outstanding degradation performance in pms activation through the efficient electron transfer caused by the construction of dual reactivity centre fe as the electron rich reaction centre and c as the electron poor reaction centre under the interaction of cfe bond coupling the cfe short bond was successfully constructed as an electron transfer channel to shorten the transmission distance and thus increase the electron transfer rate the electrons were quickly compensated to fe3 by cfe channels accelerating the efficiency of the fe2 fe3 cycle further the rational design of fe nc 800 can not only increase the adsorption capacity to smx but also enhanced the ph value adaptability promoting the pms activation the ability of defect structure to enhance electron transfer could improve catalytic activity of fe nc 800 most importantly the smx decomposition efficiency still maintained over 99 3 after five successive cycles of the reactions based on the radical quenching epr tests and electrochemical analysis confirming the present of radical so4 oh and o2 and non radical 1o2 electron transfer pathway hence this study provides a novel approach for designing high performance catalysts to treat wastewater declaration of competing

12645,peroxymonosulfate pms activation based on iron based catalyst has caught increasing attention in wastewater treatment but is strongly impeded by the sluggish kinetics of fe ii recovery in this study nitrogen doped carbon encapsulated fe3c with dual reaction centres coupled via cfe channel was developed by electrospinning and chemical vapor deposition cvd technique the remarkable catalysis performance was conferred by the formation of cfe short bond which linked c poor electron reaction centres from n doped carbon frameworks and the fe rich electron reaction centres from fe3c fe nc 800 achieved 100 sulfamethoxazole smx degradation within 20 min and showed excellent cycle stability after 5 cycles the electron transfer rate between the dual reaction region was accelerated due to short transport distance and low transmission resistance electrons from pollutants were compensated to fe3 via cfe bond bridges promoting the regeneration of fe2 and accelerating the efficiency of the fe2 fe3 cycle besides the experiments of reactive oxygen species ros quenching and capture revealed the degradation pathway both radical and nonradical oxidation played a key role in the fe nc 800 pms system this work will offer a valuable clue on the design of multi benefit catalysts to achieve efficient removal of pollutants in wastewater keywords nitrogen doped carbon dual reaction centres pms activation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction currently the massive emission of organic pollutants have become a significant threat to the global water environment and pose a continuous hazard to human health 1 2 due to their non biodegradability it is urgent to remove these organic pollutants from aquatic environment efficiently and economically as an efficient water treatment technology advanced oxidation processes aops are applied for eliminating these emerging contaminants 3 peroxymonosulfate pms activation is receiving widespread attention due to the generation of various reactive oxygen species ros such as sulfate so4 hydroxyl radicals oh and single oxygen 1o2 4 for pms activation transition metal co fe mn etc ions present promising advantages in wastewater treatment 5 7 specifically fe is considered to be one of the most potential active metals in pms activation to remove persistent organic pollutants with low cost naturally abundant low toxic and outstanding redox activity 8 however fe3 fe2 0 77 v has a more negative redox potential compared to hso5 so5 1 10 v for the reaction of fe2 hso5 eq 1 the low rate between the reaction fe3 and hso5 eq 2 which is not favorable for the recycle of fe3 fe2 9 on the other hand it is necessary to ensure that the electron transfer from the metal based catalyst to the pms allows the oo bond to be broken to produce free radicals 10 therefore more efforts are urgently required to design and develop novel fe based catalysts for pms activation by accelerating both electron transfer and efficient fe3 fe2 recycle 1 fe 2 hso 5 fe 3 so 4 oh 2 fe 3 hso 5 fe 2 so 5 h some methods in intensifying electron transfer during pms activation process have been recently implemented such as utilizing defect engineering assistance to adjust the electronic state of the surface 11 12 regulating morphologic structure to enhance electron utilization 13 14 and adding light aid to provide electrons 15 among them the construction of dual active centers including electron poor and electron rich reaction centres is becoming a significant method for enhancing the efficiency of pms activation 16 18 the electron poor reaction region is responsible for accepting the electrons from the pollutant as the acceptor after which the electrons are transported to the electron rich reaction region and ultimately utilized for the activation of pms zhang et al synthesized an innovative cu Î³ fe2o3 catalyst with the ability to produce highly reactive so4 efficiently the excellent performance was attributed to a dual reaction centre through the fe o cu bridge coupling transferring the electrons obtained from fe to the cu site 19 also it has been reported that the formation of electron rich activation centres over c o fe bonds can enhance catalysis reaction performance and accelerate the degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride 20 although the construction of dual reactive centers displayed a satisfactory catalytic prospect in enhancing the activation of pms the rate of electron transfer between the rich and the poor reactive centers was an important factor hindering the further improvement in the efficiency of pms activation the long bond between the rich and the poor reactive centers is a form of multi atomic electron transport however the electron transfer among multiple atoms leads to problems of long transport distance and transmission resistance from rotation and vibration of chemical bonds such problems slow down inter atomic electron transport to some extent therefore in order to speed up the transmission of electrons between the poor and rich electron centers the construction of a short cfe bond as the electron shuttle to directly connect the poor to rich electron centers would achieve the purpose of improving the catalytic activity on the other hand carbon materials are widely used to accelerate fe3 fe2 cycles via donating electrons or chelating with fe3 21 moreover recent studies of heteroatoms doping especially nitrogen doping were concerned for the properties of cost efficiency and facile surface chemistry for functional modification in advanced oxidation processes 22 24 the nonmetal nitrogen doping provides more excellent feature to carbon based catalysts for instance the introduction of nitrogen not only increases the stability of catalyst 25 but also achieves the efficient distribution of pollutant molecules on the carbon network by improving the surface affinity of carbon based catalysts 26 28 thus the nitrogen doped carbon based material is considered as a promising pms promotor that also exhibits excellent synergy in further facilitating the cycle between fe3 and fe2 inspired by this fe3c embedded nitrogen doped carbon catalyst with dual reaction centers over cfe short bond was successfully synthesized by coupling electrospinning with subsequent chemical vapor deposition cvd strategies scanning electron microscopy tests sem were applied to probe catalyst morphology and the obtained catalyst was systematically recorded by x ray diffraction xrd patterns and raman the catalysis properties and the influences of reaction parameters initial ph catalyst dosages and pms dosages et al on catalytic performance were discussed comprehensively by decomposing sulfamethoxazole smx in water the degradation efficiency of different pollutants and the reusability of the catalyst were also evaluated moreover the catalytic mechanism was proposed via electrochemical analysis classic quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance epr measurements 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals polyacrylonitrile pan mw 150 000 iron iii acetylacetonate fe acac 3 peroxymonosulfate pms sulfamethoxazole smx bisphenol a bpa p benzoquinone p bq and p chlorophenol pcp were obtained from shanghai aladdin chemistry co ltd tetracycline hydrochloride tc was supplied from shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd n n dimethylformamide dmf 99 9 tert butyl alcohol tba humic acid ha nacl naoh nahco3 and hcl were purchased by sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china melamine methanol meoh and furfuryl alcohol ffa were purchased from tianjin damao chemical reagent factory 2 2 preparation of the fe nc fe nc composites were fabricated through electrospinning technique and cvd strategies 1 g of pan and 0 23 m fe acac 3 were dissolved in 10 ml dmf by stirring until uniform then the mixture was drawn into a 10 ml plastic injection syringe setting the electrostatic spinning parameters to the voltage of 20 kv the distance from nozzle to collector is 15 cm and the injection speed of 1 8 l h 1 then the pan fe was obtained after that the resulted pan fe was preoxidized under air atmosphere specific conditions heating rate of 2 c min 1 target temperature of 250 c stabilization time of 2 h the resulting sample was ground and 2 g of melamine was added then sample was pyrolyzed at different temperatures in an ar atmosphere specific conditions heating rate of 5 c min 1 stabilization time of 2 h using fe nc x as the name of the final composites x indicates the carbonization temperature 600 800 and 1000 for comparison fe c 800 and nc 800 were synthesized by implementing the same process but without melamine and fe acac 3 respectively 2 3 characterization the obtaining x ray diffraction xrd patterns and scanning electron microscopy sem images were applied to investigate the crystal structure and morphology of samples brunauer emmet teller bet methods and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectra were analyzed to record the prepared materials the technique of x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was used to investigate the chemical compositions and the states of products raman spectra was recorded by using raman spectroscopic system with a 633 nm laser which identify the defect degree of materials the linear scanning voltammetry lsv and chronoamperometry i t curve were performed by electrochemical test the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was adapted to investigate the charge transferresistance 2 4 experimental procedures and analytical methods the removal efficiency of smx analyzed catalytic activity of catalysts in degradation process all experiments were carried out in 50 ml of smx solution with the same stirring rate in a typical degradation experiment 10 mg of fe nc was put into the 30 ppm smx solution which was stirred for 30 min at 25 c to achieve equilibrium between adsorption and desorption the initial ph of solution was 7 4 adjusting by hcl or naoh before the degradation reaction then the dosage of 1 mm pms was injected into the solution containing the pollutant and catalyst to start the reaction a 0 5 ml sample was withdrawn at specified intervals and quenched the reaction by 0 25 ml meoh immediately after that the mixture filtered with a 0 22 Î¼m filter the smx concentration was detected under fixed environmental conditions 0 1 wt acetic acid and acetonitrile 55 45 v v were chosen as the mobile phases for high performance liquid chromatography hplc task adjusting the flow rate and wavelength were 0 8 ml min 1 and 270 nm respectively methods for analyzing the concentration of pollutants in experiments were mentioned in table s1 the concentration of iron leaching was detected by inductively coupled optical emission spectrometry icp oes the electron paramagnetic resonance epr tests were carried out to qualitatively identify reactive radicals with dmpo and tmep as the trapping agent furthermore the quenching experiments were conducted utilizing meoh tba ffa and p bq as scavengers the procedure was similar to the degradation experiments described above except that quantitative meoh tba ffa and p bq were added prior to the reaction to eliminate the effects of so4 oh 1o2 and o2 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalyst characterization fig s1 illustrated in detail the fabrication procedure of fe nc 800 fe was dispersed in and anchored to nanofibrous support through electrospinning technique using melamine as a nitrogen and carbon source fe nc 800 can be successfully fabricated through the one step calcination at 800 c under ar gas the morphology of fe nc 800 was observed by sem fig 1a b and c showed that the iron loaded carbon nanofibrous exhibited interwoven morphology in addition distinctive short branching nanostructures were observed in the sample and small branches were derived on the support material which were attributed to the formation of nitrogen doped carbon nanotube ncnt structures as previous reported work yang et al synthesized catalysts with high capacity ncnt encapsulated metal nanoparticles by adding melamine via pyrolysis process 28 the nanoparticles embedded in small branches were due to the exposure of little fe3c on the surface of carbon nanofibers 23 the phases and crystalline configuration of prepared catalysts were determined using xrd technique and the results were summarized in fig 2a the broad peak at 26 4 was designated as the 002 diffraction plane of graphitized carbon 29 notably the intensity of the graphitic carbon diffraction peak showed the role of melamine in the graphitization process 30 in the patterns of fe nc 800 and fe c 800 the planes of 210 102 031 112 and 131 were matched well with the peak at 37 8 43 8 44 9 45 9 and 48 6 respectively these derived from the presence of fe3c jcpds no 85 1317 fe nc 800 had higher peak intensity suggested that melamine promoted the exposure of fe3c also fe0 related xrd patterns were identified in fe nc 800 the relatively peaks at 44 7 65 0 and 82 3 were well indexed to the crystalline planes of 110 200 and 211 in fe0 jcpds 06 0696 the above results demonstrated that iron in fe c 800 was transformed into fe0 and fe3c after co pyrolysis therefore cfe bond may have been constructed in the fe nc 800 which would confer the catalyst with versatility for pms activation and pollutants degradation the catalyst was further characterized via the ft ir spectra to analyze the surface functional groups and the chemical bonds fig s2 the band approximately at 1202 cm 1 was ascribed to the cn vibrations and the band at 1572 cm 1 was caused by the present of cc bond 31 additionally the peaks at 2810 and 2812 cm 1 were characteristic of the asymmetric and symmetric bendings of ch2 groups 32 the stretch bandwidth from 3000 to 3400 cm 1 indicated the existence of oh bonds respectively 33 3 2 catalytic performance in order to reflect the differences in catalytic reaction the degradation efficiency of different reaction systems was evaluated by the degradation of smx as shown in fig 2b for the system without any catalyst only 23 66 of smx was removed by pms directly which was ascribed to the self decomposition of pms generating the small amounts of ros in the absence of catalyst meanwhile 11 55 of smx was degraded by the physical adsorption of fe nc 800 without addition of pms showing that the contribution of adsorption in smx degradation to illustrate this clearly the brunauer emmett teller bet test was performed the nitrogen adsorption desorption curve test verified the surface area and pore properties of the obtained catalysts fig s3 fe nc 800 exhibited a representative type iv isotherm and pronounced hysteresis sloop demonstrating the presence of mesoporosity 34 the surface areas pore volume and pore sizes are 282 7 m2 g 0 25 cm3 g and 3 37 nm respectively and fe c 800 are 232 4 m2 g 0 15 cm3 g and 1 54 nm respectively for nc 800 the surface area 230 8 m2 g pore volume 0 18 cm3 g and pore sizes 1 61 nm were significantly lower than for the optimum catalyst therefore fe nc 800 had the remarkable advantage of being able to effectively adsorb pollutants because of the essential importance of adsorption for degradation 35 these results revealed fe nc 800 can expose more accessible active sites possibly promoting the degradation of pollutants 36 notably when pms and fe nc 800 were added simultaneously to the smx solution the degradation efficiency of smx increased rapidly and achieved 100 in 20 min the above findings proved that smx was removed by adsorption and degradation with the degradation process dominating smx removal after adsorption reaching equilibrium in contrast for the catalysts without fe or melamine the removal efficiencies of smx were 89 8 and 97 9 after 20 min respectively combined with the value of k the optimal k value of 0 3269 min 1 was discovered from the catalysis system of fe nc 800 in contrast the k values of 0 1470 and 0 1059 min 1 in fe c 800 pms and nc 800 pms systems were well below the best value fig 2c due to the efficient catalytic performance of fe nc 800 catalyst it is reasonable to consider synergistic effects between fe and melamine in the composite these results clearly demonstrated that the cfe bonds as well as the large pore volume and surface areas are essential for activating pms in the catalyst reaction in order to demonstrate the present of cfe bonds elemental chemical valence and bonding features of different samples were further detected through xps technique in fig 3a the c n o and fe elements were verified to be present in the prepared mixture as illustrated in fig 3b the detail fitting results of c 1 s can be decomposed into five peaks among them the binding energies of cc chemical bond could be found at 284 8 ev the peaks fitted to co and o c o which contained oxygen atoms locating at 286 3 and 288 9 ev respectively the peak located at 285 3 ev was in accordance with cn revealing that the carbon structure with n doping the peaks at 283 8 ev can be convoluted to the cfe bonds come from fe3c in composites specially fe nc 800 possessed the cfe bond successfully implying that the interaction of fe and n doped carbon frameworks which was expected to be the active site for pms activation fig s4 combined the results of the degradation efficiency of smx in fe nc 800 pms system with those of fe c 800 pms and nc 800 pms system indicated that the successful synthesis of cfe is a key point for improving catalytic performance consistent with the xrd results the n 1 s spectra in fig 3c displayed four sub bands the binding energies of 398 4 ev corresponded to pyridinic n 400 2 ev to adsorbed pyrrolic n 401 2 ev was referred to graphitic n and 404 4 ev to oxidized n species it had been verified the generation of nitrogen atoms in the carbon framework as previous work reported the doped nitrogen atoms can produce more defects in carbon skeleton and accelerate the rate of electron transfer thereby enhancing catalytic activity 37 fig 3d showed the spectra of fe 2p which were observed in six peaks it is found that there are two peaks at 709 8 fe 2p3 2 and 723 0 ev fe 2p1 2 were in conformity with fe ii besides two signals corresponded to respective fe iii species including 713 5 fe 2p3 2 and 725 9 ev fe 2p1 2 the co existence of fe iii and fe ii suggested that fe iii could be converted to fe ii in fe nc 800 thus solving the problem of fe ii regeneration difficulty 7 two main bands at 706 7 and 719 5 ev coincided with fe0 2p3 2 and fe0 2p1 2 which might be due to uncontrollable reduction reaction on the surfaces the presence of fe0 played a key role in further accelerating the iron cycle 3 2 1 catalyst optimization in general the dosing of raw materials will impact the catalytic performance of the as prepared catalyst the doping dosage of fe acac 3 was modulated from 0 17 0 23 0 29 to 0 35 m in the composite denoted 1fe nc 800 fe nc 800 2fe nc 800 and 3fe nc 800 respectively the degradation rate of smx is exhibited in fig 4a it can be clearly found that 1fe nc 800 86 5 fe nc 800 100 2fe nc 800 92 3 and 3fe nc 800 96 8 demonstrated significant difference under the same catalytic conditions at 20 min and the values of k were 0 0976 0 3296 0 1340 0 1585 min 1 respectively notably as the dosage of fe was further added to 0 23 m the degradation rate gradually improved this result was attributed to the formation of more active sites that produced more ros to support accelerated smx removal kinetics also the additive content of iron source will change the morphology of the obtained catalysts which supported the aforementioned differences in degradation efficiency when the iron content was inadequate fig s5a iron cannot be fully exposed on the electrospun nanofibers which was detrimental to the synthesis of the catalytic site the limited number of active sites and ineffective synthesis of cfe bonds in the composite materials both contributed to the slow fe ii regeneration if the iron source was excessive fig s5b resulting in severe aggregation of iron particles 38 moreover iron doping can affect the catalytic degradation of the catalyst by altering the adsorption ability of the catalyst the adsorption and degradation efficiency of smx increased when the iron dosage increased from 0 17 m to 0 23 m inferring the stronger ability of pms activation with more smx adsorption sites however the adsorption and degradation efficiency of smx decreased significantly with increasing from 0 23 m to 0 35 m owing to the severe aggregation of the fe particle the surface adsorption sites were covered and the degradation rate of smx was gradually reduced 39 besides the catalytic performance of composites at different pyrolysis temperatures was analyzed comprehensively as illustrated in fig 4b smx removal rate was enhanced gradually as the carbonation temperature raised from 600 c to 800 c the kinetic rate constant on fe nc 800 0 3296 min 1 was approximately 3 times greater than those on fe nc 600 0 1047 min 1 to further raise the pyrolysis temperature to 1000 c the degradation efficiency of smx did not increase significantly at the applied high energy and the k value was only increased by 0 0156 min 1 a sufficiently high pyrolysis temperature facilitated the decomposition of the melamine and the reduction of the iron species to metallic iron at the same time the defective structure formed in high temperatures facilitates improved charge transfer processes 40 pyrolysis time is also a key factor in the degradation efficiency of smx carbonization was tested at 800 c for 1 2 and 4 h then denoted fe nc 800 1 fe nc 800 and fe nc 800 4 respectively it was found that the smx removal rates of 88 7 and 94 0 could be obtained for fe nc 800 1 and fe nc 800 4 fig 4c respectively in comparison to fe nc 800 0 3296 min 1 the respective k values for fe nc 800 1 and fe nc 800 4 drop to 0 0813 min 1 and 0 099 min 1 taken together the smx catalytic rate of fe nc 800 was clearly superior to that of the other catalysts so the catalyst prepared by pyrolysis at 800 c for 2 h was chosen for the next step of the study to further demonstrate the structural defects of the catalyst under different pyrolytic conditions the raman spectrum was investigated the d band at 1352 cm 1 reflects the defective level or lattice distortions in carbon atoms and the g band at 1583 cm 1 represents the graphitization degree of carbons generally the ratio id ig is derived by comparing the intensity in the d and g bands which can be used to determine the extent of defects in carbon based complexes 41 as displayed in fig s6a the id ig ratios of fe nc 600 fe nc 800 and fe nc 1000 were 2 51 2 27 and 2 15 respectively therefore this result suggested that the component graphitization level was improved due to the formation of more sp2 sites generation via higher pyrolysis temperature 42 in addition the result for the effect of different pyrolysis times suggested that more defect sites and disordered structures were created via extend time at the same pyrolysis temperature fig s6b although the higher level of defects of fe nc 800 4 than that of fe nc 800 the catalytic capability is inferior to fe nc 800 therefore it is vital to satisfy the balance of graphitization and defect engineering of carbon material for better catalytic activity 43 the relatively id ig 2 27 of catalyst with a significant degree of defect to accelerate the activation of pms by improving Ï electron mobility and facilitating electron transfer 3 2 2 effect of various factors on smx degradation based on experiments conducted with the fe nc 800 pms system the influence of different catalyst dosages of 0 1 0 2 0 4 g l on smx removal was evaluated fig 5a showed that the degradation rate of fe nc 800 significantly promoted with the catalyst dosages enhanced from 0 1 to 0 2 g l and meanwhile all of smx was completely degraded in 20 min theoretically this phenomenon can be explained that increasing the dosage of catalyst offered more active sites and contact area for the pms to ensure rapid decomposition of the pms to produce sufficient ros 44 however the value of k showed a decreasing trend 0 1423 min 1 if the addition level was continued to be increased to 0 4 g l the above result was attributed to the insufficient amount of pms which did not adequate to generate enough ros also the excessive catalyst would have contributed to the effect of so4 removal 45 therefore 0 2 g l fe nc 800 was selected to further study as depicted in fig 5b the smx removal ability in fe nc 800 pms reaction system with various pms dosage 0 5 2 mm was investigated it can be found that the degradation rate of smx enhanced from 72 3 to 100 0 and k values gradually improved from 0 0375 to 0 3296 min 1 when the pms concentration increased from 0 5 to 1 mm this phenomenon can be inferred that more pms will immediately produce more active species and attack to smx favouring increased degradation efficiency 46 in general excessive pms did not further enhance the degradation efficiency but rather caused the free radicals to be quenched 47 therefore it was distinctly found that the removal rate of smx was inhibited with further increasing the pms concentration to 1 mm fig 5c exhibited the effect of the fe nc 800 in different ph conditions from 3 4 to 9 4 to explore the removal rate it can be seen that 97 0 smx was degraded in 30 min explaining that fe nc 800 can effectively remove smx in broaden working ph also the corresponding reaction rate constant of smx degradation upgraded from 0 1746 to 0 3296 min 1 and then significantly declined to 0 1063 min 1 when ph further increased from 7 4 to 9 4 what was more the degradation efficiency of fe nc 800 was the highest removal rate for smx at ph value of 7 4 specifically the abundant h in the over acid environment was able to react with the ros secondly the electrostatic repulsion between the catalyst and contaminant would hinder the removal of the target contaminant 48 in an alkaline environment the degradation efficiency of the pollutant was reduced probably due to the conversion of the dominant radical to oh which had a short lifetime leading to the inhibition of degradation of the target contaminant 49 remarkably there was a correlation between solution ph and the amount of fe nc 800 adsorbed when the increase of ph from 3 4 to 5 4 the adsorption of smx was positively correlated with ph however further increasing the ph to 9 4 the adsorption of smx by fe nc 800 was inhibited the above data demonstrated that adsorption promoted the degradation of smx to some certain extent which was consistent with the results obtained previously however excessive adsorption led to the occupation of the active site resulting in poor catalytic performance 50 besides because ha and several inorganic ions e g cl hco3 are inevitably universal existence in the actual aqueous environment which would cause a potential impact on the catalytic ability hence the anti interference performance of the fe nc 800 was tested in the anions and ha fig 5d reflected the results of different cl concentrations on smx degradation when the concentration of cl was added at 1 and 5 mm in the reaction system the degradation of smx was inhibited slightly it is possible that this result was due to the production of less reactive chlorine substances such as cl and hocl eqs 3 5 51 which impede the degradation of smx notably as the amount of cl was further increased to 10 mm the inhibition of smx degradation was negligible according to previous reports cl could react with pms by double electron transfer and then be oxidized to produce highly reactive substances such as hclo and cl2 eqs 6 7 52 53 besides the concentration of hco3 from 1 5 and 10 mm showed a significant suppression effect on smx degradation which could be explained in two ways fig 5e firstly hco3 could alter the surface of fe nc 800 because of as a buffering complex damaging the activation of pms and the production of free radicals 54 also the lower oxidation potential of co3 and hco3 were produced by hco3 reacting with so4 and oh eqs 8 10 55 on the other hand the existence of hco3 would increase the ph in the reaction system thus decreasing catalytic activity 56 when 10 and 50 mg l of ha were added to the reaction system the smx degradation rate was about 61 1 and 58 9 in 5 min respectively indicating that the surface active sites of catalyst were covered by ha fig 5f 57 based on all the above results and discussion the fe nc 800 displayed an outstanding anti interference ability for the ha and anions suggesting that it was a superior catalyst for pollutants remediation in actual water 3 cl so 4 so 4 2 cl 4 cl oh

of catalyst the universality stability and reusability of the fe nc 800 were important issues for its potential applications the excellent pms activation performance of fe nc 800 by the degradation experiments of different pollutants and cycling reaction runs was confirmed as illustrated in fig s7a the high degradation rate was sustained when smx was substituted with pcp bpa or tc as the target pollutant pcp bpa and tc were effectively removed within 30 min with up to 98 70 99 50 and 89 4 respectively thus the result of degradation experiments of different pollutants can prove that as prepared fe nc 800 possessed excellent universal applicability during the smx degradation process to further prove the stability and reusability of the catalyst fe nc 800 was also applied as heterogeneous catalysts to perform the cycle experiments of smx degradation after five cycles the removal efficiency of smx still achieved 99 3 in 30 min certificating the superior degradation capacity of fe nc 800 fig 6a additionally the degradation kinetics of cycle experiments were similarly illustrated fig s7b the k values of five cycles were 0 2092 0 1789 0 1949 and 0 1678 min 1 respectively however the k value decreased by 0 1618 min 1 from cycle 1 to cycle 5 and the adsorption capacity of the catalyst was significantly reduced this was because active sites might be masked by the intermediates of smx degradation thus impeding pms activation and the adsorption of smx 58 besides the fe leaching of catalyst as an important factor was evaluated the obtained fe nc 800 with little leaching was only 0 26 mg l as previously reported leaching fe ions cannot contribute to the effective activation of pms due to its concentration below 0 3 mg l 59 the excellent cycle stability of fe nc 800 also attested that fe leaching was negligible to further analyze the stability of fe nc 800 the xrd characteristic peaks of fresh and recovered samples were compared with each other as seen from fig 6b the characteristic peaks belonging to fe3c exhibited a slight decrease while the intensity of the other peaks had not changed significantly after the reaction as depicted in fig s8 no significant morphology variations of fe nc 800 after 5 cycles exhibited that still had a satisfactory function compared to the initial catalyst all of these illustrated that the active sites of iron species had superior stability the xps spectra of n 1 s for used fe nc 800 were analyzed to further reflect the change in valence states of the different species fig 6c compared to fresh catalyst the corresponding pyridinic n content decreased from 45 7 to 32 5 after five cycles the amount of graphitic n showed the same change which retard from 26 1 to 20 0 this phenomenon provided the evidence for graphitic n and pyridinic n as the active nitrogen substances for pms decomposition fig 6e 31 60 61 additionally the xps spectra of fe 2p for used fe nc 800 catalyst was investigated fig 6d after the reaction fe0 and fe ii decreased respectively from 22 6 and 51 5 to 19 1 and 50 8 respectively whereas fe iii increased significantly fig 6e the change in iron valence state before and after the reaction indicates that the prepared catalyst has good stability and both fe0 and fe ii are involved in the activation of pms to produce ros by providing electrons in the meantime fe iii can able to accept electrons to realize the cycle between fe ii and fe iii 3 4 identification of ros and removal mechanism in order to recognize the category of the primary free radicals responsible for smx degradation in the fe nc 800 pms reaction system individual quenching experiments were conducted by adding methanol tba p bq and ffa as scavenger fig 7a b in this study methanol was spiked into the reaction solution as a typical scavenger for oh 9 7 108 m s and so4 3 2 106 m s 45 additionally the effect of tba was applied to identify the presence of oh 62 when methanol was introduced into the fe nc 800 pms system the degradation rate of smx can realize 92 4 within 20 min and the value of k was 0 1616 min 1 when tba was present in the catalytic system the degradation efficiency decreased from 100 to 97 1 and the value of k was 0 1103 min 1 from this it be inferred that oh and so4 participated in the smx degradation reaction besides ffa 3 2 107 m s and p bq 1 0 109 m s were severally used to identify the role of singlet oxygen 1o2 and superoxide radical o2 63 when ffa and p bq were put into reactive solution smx degradation efficiency dropped significantly to 75 9 and 71 8 in 20 min respectively also the corresponding degradation rate constants decreased substantially from 0 3269 to 0 0471 and 0 045 min 1 respectively these results indicated that 1o2 participated to a great extent and o2 was the dominant ros in the smx removal reaction therefore it can be inferred that so4 oh o2 and 1o2 were generated during the reaction system the reactive radicals were determined directly by epr spectroscopy the dmpo and temp were spiked into the reaction solution as spin trapping agent to further clarify the existence of ros species relevant epr signal of so4 and oh were discovered when the dmpo as trapper in the degradation system fig 7c affirming the formation of so4 and oh in the reaction process similar phenomenon also occurred in the epr tests for o2 species with the characteristic peaks of temp o2 fig 7d implying o2 was also generated for attacking pollutants from fig 7e a high strength characteristic triple lined signal with proportion of 1 1 1 was observed by using temp as a trapping agent to capture 1o2 signal based on these results the radical and nonradical processes both contributed to smx degradation it is known that electron transfer between contaminants pms and carbon based catalysts have an important influence on the non radical degradation pathway therefore the linear scanning voltammetry lsv tests were carried out under different conditions fig s9a an increasing trend of current was observed after pms and smx were incorporated into reaction solution attributing to the active sites of fe nc 800 could interact with pms the result of the chronoamperometry i t curve of fe nc 800 was depicted in fig s9b the current density had a notable enhanced was observed after the addition of pms 250 s and smx 450 s therefore the electron transfer among the smx molecules pms and the surface of fe nc 800 was confirmed to be involved in the smx degradation 7 the characteristic peaks at 712 0 and 724 9ev in the spectra of fe c 800 can be attributed to fe iii 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 respectively fig 8a notably the fe iii characteristic peaks of fe nc 800 displayed an apparent negative shift in contrast to fe c 800 the above result inferred that the internal electron of components can transfer to fe iii accelerating the fe3 fe2 redox cycle 64 besides the electron transfer properties were demonstrated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis fig 8b fe nc 800 exhibited smaller semicircle radius than fe c 800 in their nyquist plots indicating a lower transfer resistance for fe nc 800 65 therefore the present of cfe short bond can accelerate electron transfer and enhance fe2 fe3 cycle based on these results and previous literature a plausible pms activation mechanism and smx degradation in the fe nc 800 system can be described as follows fig 9 importantly the excellent surface area and abundant mesoporous of fe nc 800 that enhanced the adsorption of smx when fe nc 800 was utilized to activate pms fe0 reacted with pms to produce fe2 and so4 eq 11 the reaction between fe2 and hso5 for continuous generation of radicals achieved the redox cycle eq 1 2 fe3 was reduced by reaction with fe0 which can provide sufficient fe2 for activation of pms eq 12 besides so4 can further combine with h2o to generate oh eqs 13 14 66 which combined with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and produced perhydroxyl radicals ho2 eqs 15 16 the decomposition of ho2 was responsible for the generation of o2 which react to further generated 1o2 during the pms activation process eqs 17 20 4 also as previously reported 1o2 can be produced by itself decomposition of pms eq 21 58 more importantly the excellent surface area and abundant mesoporous of fe nc 800 that enhanced the adsorption of smx during the catalytic reaction fe3c nanoparticles served as active sites to offer fe rich electron centers and n doped carbon frameworks to provide c poor electron centers both were coupled to form a short cfe bond smx molecules were adsorbed on the carbon framework and their electrons were transferred to the c active centre via Ï Ï stacking the transmission distance of pollutants to the active site was shortened due to the coexistence of the active and adsorption sites the spatial separation of both ensured rapid electron transfer in the catalytic process 28 therefore the cfe bond acted as a connecting dual reaction centre bridge to quickly compensate electrons to fe3 eq 22 interestingly smx had the skills to transfer electrons to pms contributing to the degradation of pollutants n doping can adjust the electronic structure on the carbon skeleton while increasing defects structure in the catalyst and facilitating the transfer of Ï electrons to generate fe2 accelerating the activation process of pms in addition previous reports have demonstrated that pre adsorption of organic matter significantly accelerates the non radical oxidation pathway 67 in conclusion non radical dominated pms activation worked together with radical pathway to efficient degradation of smx 11 2 hso 5 fe 0 fe 2 2 so 4 2 oh 12 fe 0 2 fe 3 2 fe 2 13 so 4 h 2 o so 4 2 h oh 14 so 4 oh so 4 2 oh 15 hso 5 h 2 o h 2 o 2 hso 4

nitrogen doped carbon catalysts embedded with fe3c nanoparticles was successfully synthesized by pyrolysis strategy the fe nc 800 composite showed the outstanding degradation performance in pms activation through the efficient electron transfer caused by the construction of dual reactivity centre fe as the electron rich reaction centre and c as the electron poor reaction centre under the interaction of cfe bond coupling the cfe short bond was successfully constructed as an electron transfer channel to shorten the transmission distance and thus increase the electron transfer rate the electrons were quickly compensated to fe3 by cfe channels accelerating the efficiency of the fe2 fe3 cycle further the rational design of fe nc 800 can not only increase the adsorption capacity to smx but also enhanced the ph value adaptability promoting the pms activation the ability of defect structure to enhance electron transfer could improve catalytic activity of fe nc 800 most importantly the smx decomposition efficiency still maintained over 99 3 after five successive cycles of the reactions based on the radical quenching epr tests and electrochemical analysis confirming the present of radical so4 oh and o2 and non radical 1o2 electron transfer pathway hence this study provides a novel approach for designing high performance catalysts to treat wastewater declaration of competing

12646,ultraviolet uv disinfection is effective in bacterial disinfection without yielding by products after uv disinfection however bacteria can regrow depending on water quality although there is a paucity of knowledge about the relation of water quality to bacterial regrowth therefore this study aimed to elucidate the effect of dissolved organic matter dom property on the regrowth process of escherichia coli e coli under dark and light conditions the changes in survival ratio of uv disinfected e coli were observed under dark and light conditions in the presence of one of four doms namely sodium pyruvate tryptone starch and fulvic acid after uv disinfection 265 nm the survival ratio of e coli was well described by the second order regrowth model under dark condition the maximum survival ratio s m of e coli during seven day storage ranged from 8 6 to 169 1 while the maximum regrowth rate k max ranged from 0 020 h 1 to 4 03 h 1 in light condition s m ranged from 2 4 to 348 5 k max ranged from 0 029 h 1 to 31 1 h 1 two way anova indicates the significant effects of dom type on those model parameters which was possibly owing to their roles as a source of amino acids and as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species overall dom weakened visible light disinfection after uv disinfection while promoting bacterial dark repair and photoreactivation this study revealed that dom property largely influences regrowth after uv disinfection highlighting the importance for considering such effect in uv disinfection graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords dark repair dissolved organic matter escherichia coli regrowth photoreactivation ultraviolet disinfection data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the field of water treatment ultraviolet uv disinfection has gained attention owing to its high efficiency in disrupting microbial gene sequence and almost absence of toxic by products 1 2 however bacteria are known to possess dna repair mechanisms against the damage caused by uv 3 4 such repair processes possibly reduce the efficacy of uv disinfection and raise concerns about pathogenic revival following uv disinfection 5 8 in fact bacteria sustaining their growing ability or virulence after disinfection poses a series of potential risks they include health risks e g infection and increase of bacterial resistance against disinfectants 9 10 process risks e g membrane fouling and pipe corrosion 11 12 and ecological risks e g change in dominant species and gene abundance variations 9 13 for instance disinfection resistant bacteria have been reported to form biofilms by forming colonies which may serve as shelter for other pathogens 14 moreover the health and ecological risk of disinfected bacteria can be even greater than that of undisinfected bacteria because the dominance of disinfection resistant bacteria in microbial communities tends to increase 11 15 and disinfection resistant bacteria might be more resistant to antibiotics 16 uv bacterial disinfection primarily targets bacterial dna by causing two major types of mutagenic dna damage i e cyclobutene pyrimidine dimers cpds and 6 4 photoproducts 4 17 but bacteria can regrow by repairing dna damage one of the repair mechanisms is photoreactivation in which photolyase enzymes bind specifically to cpds using the energy of light 310 480 nm to repair the damaged dna 4 18 the other is dark repair which replaces damaged dna with undamaged new nucleotides regardless of light availability 4 thus light condition affects these repair processes and subsequent bacterial regrowth 4 17 although the regrowth process is also related to wavelength the dose of irradiation during the uv disinfection process and the water quality 17 wavelength and dose of uv determine the type and degree of damage caused to bacterial genes e g dna repair enzymes or proteins which further influence bacterial regrowth processes after uv disinfection 19 20 for the same uv dose radiation showing a broad wavelength band in disinfection tends to prevent bacterial regrowth compared to monochromatic radiation 21 23 in addition uv at a wavelength of 265 nm seems more effective for escherichia coli e coli disinfection than uv at 280 nm for the same uv dose although disinfection by uv at 280 nm is more effective for inhibiting bacterial regrowth than uv at 265 nm 20 the suppression of regrowth by 280 nm uv is considered to be the damage of photolyase an enzyme responsible for dna repair or other related enzymes induced by this specific wavelength of uv 20 thus wavelength and its range in uv disinfection affect subsequent bacterial regrowth conventional sources of uv light are low pressure lp and medium pressure mp mercury lamps which emit monochromatic light with a wavelength of 253 7 nm and multichromatic light with a wide wavelength range of 200 nm 600 nm respectively 24 recently uv light emitting diodes uv leds are also gaining more attention owing to their several advantages they are mercury free highly energy efficient has a long usage period compact and highly flexible in designing 20 25 unlike conventional lamps uv leds can be designed to emit monochromatic light of any wavelength hence the light source determines the wavelength and its range of irradiated uv which possibly influences disinfection efficiency and post disinfection regrowth thus uv leds possibly allow for optimization of bacterial disinfection in terms of both instantaneous inactivation and inhibition of the post disinfection regrowth in addition to energy consumption in addition to the light condition in disinfection and regrowth phases water quality plays an important role in bacterial regrowth 17 for example low temperature e g 4 c hinders bacterial regrowth while high temperature e g 37 c promotes it 26 regarding components in water relatively low concentrations of dissolved organic matter dom orthophosphate ammonia and alkalinity have hindered the regrowth of uv irradiated bacteria 27 among these components dom is important as an energy source for respiration and bacterial growth 28 30 in general the effect of dom on bacterial growth is known to vary among dom components for example proteins serve as a source of amino acids while starch is one polysaccharide exerting hydroxyl radical scavenging 31 33 humic substances increase the growth efficiency of bacteria in lake water 34 and carboxylic acids are easily metabolized for bacterial growth 35 therefore such coexisting dom affects bacterial regrowth after disinfection possibly in different ways depending on dom properties in fact several organics have been reported to influence the reactivation of viable but non culturable vbnc bacterial cells which are induced by environmental stresses including uv disinfection 36 39 pyruvate restores biosynthesis of dna and proteins in the vbnc state 40 amino acids promote resuscitation of vbnc 41 as they are structural units of proteins and are found in natural water as a part of dom 42 further there has been two hypotheses regarding the combined effect of amino acids 1 the combination promoting resuscitation may vary depending on a specific strain and condition of induction to vbnc and 2 some particular combinations may lead to resuscitation of all strains of bacteria 41 however despite the considerable knowledge on the relationship between dom and bacterial growth 43 45 such a relationship in the regrowth phase after disinfection has only rarely been investigated although regrowth in natural water and wastewater has been often reported 46 47 therefore a fundamental understanding of the effect of dom on bacterial regrowth is critically important to ensure the safety of treated water considering both disinfection and post disinfection phases therefore the aim of the study was to elucidate on the effect of dom properties on the regrowth process after uv disinfection we hypothesized that dom property affects the regrowth pattern of e coli after uv disinfection e g regrowth rate and survival ratio using uv led the regrowth of e coli after uv disinfection in the presence of four different types of dom was investigated which were sodium pyruvate carboxylic acid tryptone protein starch sugar and fulvic acid humic substance all of them possibly support bacterial regrowth because sodium pyruvate and starch serve as reactive oxygen species ros scavengers 32 48 while starch also works as a carbon source tryptone provides amino acids while fulvic acid serves as a nutrient carbon and energy source these doms except fulvic acid have been reported to support bacterial growth as described above and all are contained in bacterial media fulvic acid is commonly found in environmental water therefore we evaluated its effect on the regrowth in natural water bodies the specific objectives of the study were 1 to evaluate the effect of the above four doms on the regrowth of e coli under light and dark conditions after disinfection with uv led and 2 to identify potential dom properties that promote or inhibit the regrowth 2 methods 2 1 preparation of e coli and dom solution e coli nbrc3301 nite biological resource center japan was cultured in luria bertani lb nutrient medium l3022 sigma aldrich at 37 c overnight in a shaker type incubator the cultured e coli suspension was centrifuged and the supernatant was replaced with 0 85 nacl solution saline solution sa this process was repeated three times then 1 ml of e coli saline solution was added to 99 ml of sa so that the final e coli concentration reached approximately 107 cfu ml the saline solution was autoclaved before use 1 g l stock solutions of each dom sodium pyruvate s8636 sigma aldrich tryptone t7293 sigma

scavenger 48 contained in reasoner s agar no 2 r2a medium and has been reported as a product of anaerobic metabolism of glucose an energy source in cells 49 tryptone is a protein contained in lb nutrient medium and has been reported as a decomposition product of casein 50 51 starch is a polysaccharide polymer of Î± glucose contained in the r2a medium for detoxification fulvic acid used in this study was standard fulvic acid suwannee river ii by ihss 2 2 uv irradiation and regrowth tests the 100 ml saline solution of e coli was moved to glass containers inner diameter 76 4 mm and irradiated at room temperature 25 c for 15 30 45 and 60 s with a single led emitting uv at wavelength 265 nm houken 20w 265 dongguan houke electronic co china light intensity 820 5 Î¼w cm2 the distance between the sample surface and the uv led was 60 mm and the water depth in the reactor was 2 2 cm when the irradiation time was 15 30 45 and 60 s the uv dose was 12 3 24 6 36 9 and 49 2 mj cm2 respectively the regrowth of e coli was tested in a solution containing a single type of dom for each type of dom 0 3 ml of the 1 g l dom solution and 30 ml of the saline solution with the disinfected e coli were mixed in 50 ml centrifuge tubes and 50 ml cell cultivation flasks and stored at 25 c under dark and lighted conditions respectively for the 1 g l dom solutions sodium pyruvate was prepared by diluting 4 ml of a 100 mm solution with 40 ml of mili q water while tryptone starch and fulvic acid were prepared by dissolving 0 1 g of the material in 100 ml of mili q water to provide the lighted condition we used fluorescent lamps lu 1000 tokyo rikakikai co ltd japan with a broad emission between 310 and 700 nm and a peak near 580 nm the light intensity at the bottom of the water was 165 Î¼w cm2 measured by the spectral radiometer usr 45v d ushio inc japan naoh solution was added to the tubes and flasks of sodium pyruvate and fulvic acid and ph was adjusted to be neutral i e 6 7 to prevent growth inhibition the dom concentration during storage was 9 9 mg l for all types of dom samples were taken 10 times in total during the 168 hour storage period i e 7 days each sample was diluted with sterilized 0 85 nacl by factors from 100 to 105 to obtain a valid and countable number of colonies on a petri dish 30 300 colonies per plate and plated on sterile petri dishes in triplicate together with lb agar l2897 sigma aldrich as a growth medium these prepared plates were incubated at 37 c for 24 h the plates with dilution resulting in 10 300 colonies were selected for quantification three plates were prepared for each diluted sample and the average number of colonies that appeared on each plate was calculated to determine the concentration of e coli the absorbance of saline solutions containing undisinfected e coli and each type of dom were measured at wavelengths of 265 and 405 nm using a uv vis spectrophotometer uv2600 shimadzu co japan in a quartz cell with a 10 mm optical path length 2 3 data analysis and model fitting to describe uv disinfection a first order model between log removal and the applied uv dose eq 1 1 was used 1 log n 0 0 n 0 k uv dose where n 0 0 and n 0 are the number of colonies cfu ml before and after uv irradiation respectively superscript and subscript of n indicate uv irradiation time s and storage time h respectively uvdose is the provided uv dose mj cm2 and k cm2 mj is the inactivation rate constant to evaluate the number of e coli at each time point the survival ratio s t was defined as follows 2 s t 100 n t n 0 0 where s t is the survival ratio at t hours of storage time and n t is the number of cells at t hours of storage time cfu ml to evaluate the effect of uv irradiation on e coli survival ratios under each dom condition during storage relative survival ratio rs t was calculated by subtracting s t of non disinfected e coli from that of post disinfected e coli as follows 3 rs t s t s t 0 where s t is the survival ratio of uv irradiated e coli after t hours of storage and s t 0 is the survival ratio of non disinfected e coli after t hours of storage to model the reactivation process the following second order regrowth model proposed in a previous study was used 52 4 s t s m 1 s m s 0 1 e k 2 s m t mt where s m is the maximum survival ratio s 0 is the survival ratio immediately after uv disinfection k 2 h 1 is the second order reactivation constant m h 1 is the zero order mortality constant t h is the storage time after disinfection in the model k 2 is not the actual reactivation rate constant the actual reactivation rate constant was estimated by k h 1 5 k k 2 s m s t s t when s t reaches half of s m the reactivation rate k reaches its maximum value k max h 1 k

obtain the parameters s m k max m after the model fitting using solver in microsoft excel microsoft office 2019 a two way analysis of variance anova was also performed in microsoft excel to test the hypothesis that uv dose and the type of dom affect s m and k max 3 results and discussion 3 1 uv disinfection the concentration of e coli decreased from 1 36 106 cfu ml to 620 cfu ml when uv dose increased from 0 mj cm2 to 49 2 mj cm2 the uv dose log removal relationship showed that the concentration of e coli logarithmically decreased with the increasing uv dose at a wavelength of 265 nm fig 1 although the concentration showed a tail for higher uv dose over 36 9 mj cm2 based on this result the inactivation rate constant k was estimated to be 0 081 cm2 mj the absorbance at the 265 nm wavelength was 0 007 for the saline solution and 0 111 for the saline solution containing e coli table 1 the absorbance at 405 nm was 0 04 for the saline solution with e coli while only the sample with fulvic acid showed larger absorbance 0 064 at 405 nm than the saline solution with e coli table 1 the inactivation rate constant in this study k 0 081 cm2 mj was significantly lower than in other reported studies showing 0 41 cm2 mj 20 0 43 cm2 mj 53 and 0 42 cm2 mj 54 despite the application of a wavelength 265 nm identical to this study using uv leds the difference in inactivation rate constant was possibly caused by the difference in experimental setups e g sample volume depth and diameter of the container in our experiment the water depth in the reactor was 2 2 cm which was about double or larger compared to those in these previous studies 1 1 cm based on beer lambert law and the measured absorbance the actual average dose along the pathway in this study was estimated to be 87 4 of that in case that the path length is 1 1 cm despite the same conditions of the apparent uv dose the disinfection mechanism might change depending on the applied uv dose according to literature most e coli cells have remained intact at uv doses 80 mj cm2 55 and a considerably high uv dose 400 mj cm2 has been required to cause irreversible cell membrane damage 56 on the other hand xu et al 56 have reported that a uv dose of 50 mj cm2 caused little dna lesions but apparent damages in mrna such as reca sos response dna damage repair dnaa chromosomal replication indicator protein and ssb single stranded dna binding protein specifically uv dose 50 mj cm2 has reduced reca to the detection limit resulting in loss of sos function and it also has reduced dnaa by 1 log 56 the applied uv dose in our experiment ranged from 12 mj cm2 to 50 mj cm2 therefore the damage on mrna by uv irradiance and the resulting potential of bacterial regrowth possibly varied with the presented experimental conditions of uv dose 3 2 dark repair 3 2 1 dark repair in saline solution in the absence of uv irradiation the survival ratio of e coli in saline solution reduced from 100 to 53 0 in 168 h of storage under dark condition fig 2a in saline solution the trend in dark repair after 15 s 30 s irradiation was different from that of 45 s 60 s irradiation fig 2 this difference was possibility caused primarily by the reduction in transcription levels of mrna such as reca ssb and dnaa in e coli cells irradiated by uv for 45 s as reported by xu et al 56 however after dark storage for 168 h in saline solution the survival ratios of e coli irradiated for 45 s and 60 s were finally larger than those irradiated for 15 s and 30 s previous studies have showed that the bacteria entered a decay phase after 4 h of dark repair probably due to the residual disinfection effect of uv irradiation on bacterial dna 57 58 the hypothesized mechanism of residual disinfection is that the sequential reactions from genetic damage to bacterial membranes and cell walls decrease the concentration of e coli even after uv irradiation 58 while most of the previous studies have set the storage time up to 10 h 20 57 we elongated the storage time to a week resulting in 1 the initial dark repair 2 a lag phase with a slight decrease after 4 h and then 3 significant regrowth after 72 h of storage fig 2 the residual effect of uv irradiation possibly let e coli enter a lag phase and then when the residual effect disappeared the significant regrowth began this hypothesis could explain the observation that e coli concentration stagnated or decreased after 4 h of dark repair and then substantial regrowth started after 72 h fig 2d e on the other hand the higher uv dose resulted in less increase in the survival ratio after 4 h of storage fig 2 this pattern was consistently observed by this study and the previous study 57 indicating that the residual effect of uv irradiation increases with uv dose 3 2 2 dark repair in dom solutions in the absence of uv irradiation e coli in sodium pyruvate and starch solutions showed reductions in survival ratio similar to that of the saline solution while the reduction was the largest to 15 4 with fulvic acid after 168 h of storage in contrast e coli with tryptone showed an increase in survival ratio up to 141 fig 2a when uv irradiation was applied the survival ratio of e coli was affected by the type of dom and the effect was more pronounced when uv irradiation time was longer i e 45 s 60 s in the solution containing tryptone the survival ratio remained stable or increased throughout the storage time fig 2b e where the highest survival ratio was observed after irradiation for 15 s 30 s and 45 s the survival ratio of e coli with starch showed similar trends to that of the saline solution after irradiation for 15 s 30 s and 45 s the relative survival ratio with dom in dark condition increased during storage and ranged from 46 to 103 fig s1 besides the shorter the uv irradiation time was the smaller the variation in the relative survival ratio for each dom type was the second order regrowth model eq 4 fitted well with those experimental data where the coefficient of determination r 2 was higher than 0 92 except for the four cases of 15 s irradiation with the saline solution 15 s with starch and 15 s 30 s with fulvic acid whose r 2 were lower but higher than 0 57 table s1 as a result tryptone showed the largest maximum survival ratio s m and the maximum reactivation rate k max followed by sodium pyruvate fig 3a c table s1 two way anova revealed that dom properties significantly affected k max under dark condition p 0 05 while uv dose showed an insignificant effect on k max p 0 05 table 2 in addition dom properties and uv dose showed a significant effect on s m in dark condition p 0 05 table 2 overall the type of dom was more influential in the dark repair process of e coli after uv disinfection than uv dose in our experimental conditions the overall patterns of regrowth and the timing of the rapid increase of survival ratio was also dependent on irradiation time for all dom types for instance we observed the lag phase right before their regrowth in the cases of irradiation for 45 s and 60 s fig 2d e the duration of the lag phase depended on dom properties where disinfected e coli with sodium pyruvate showed the shortest lag phase among the tested types of dom the lag phases of e coli regrowth with sodium pyruvate tryptone and fulvic acid were shorter than those with saline solution and starch fig 2d e in the cases of irradiation for 15 s and 30 s fig 2b c no lag phase was observed and substantial increases were observed in the first 24 h of storage followed by a gradual increase or steady state depending on the dom type the disinfected e coli reached a similar concentration to the initial concentration before disinfection recovery 90 in tryptone solution while it increased only up to 40 of the initial concentrations in other types of dom 3 2 3 the role of dom in dark repair according to the results of dark repair figs 2 3a c each dom property seems to play a particular role in the regrowth process among the four doms starch showed the most similar results survival ratio k max s m to the no dom condition i e saline solution e coli has been reported to be not able to use starch as a carbon source unless they are genetically modified due to the polymeric structure of starch 59 thus the damaged e coli was not able to utilize starch as substrate for regrowth on the other hand starch was expected to improve regrowth in dark conditions owing to its scavenging effect for the hydroxyl radical 32 33 in our experiment however starch did not promote the recovery of cells and genes damaged by uv disinfection high energy uv irradiation of water forms hydroxyl radicals 60 and hydrogen peroxide 61 but hydroxyl radical is minor due to its instability compared to hydrogen peroxide 62 so ros scavenging effect by starch might be an insignificant process in dark repair sodium pyruvate accelerated the regrowth of uv disinfected e coli fig 2 pyruvate is known as an ros scavenger for hydrogen peroxide 48 63 and has been reported to improve the culturability of non culturable cells of e coli and other species 64 69 one previous study pointed out that this was probably due to the recovery of injured cells 70 in contrast some studies has observed unsuccessful resuscitation of vbnc cells of bacteria other than e coli even after adding ros scavengers 71 74 thus the culturability of vbnc cells might not be solely dependent on sensitivity to ros and vbnc cells need other stimuli such as autoinducer for their resuscitation 70 these results in literature have implied that cells damaged by chemically or environmentally unfavorable conditions i e uv induced dna damaged cells became culturable by ros scavengers considering our experimental results as well ros scavenger for hydrogen peroxide seems to play a critical role in the regrowth of uv induced dna damaged cells regarding starch and sodium pyruvate we could not compare their roles quantitatively here as ros removal rate constant has been reported so far only for the reaction between pyruvate and hydrogen peroxide 75 nevertheless the different regrowth pattern with starch and sodium pyruvate might be explained by the targeted ros for scavenging meaning that scavengers of hydrogen peroxide likely promote e coli regrowth tryptone activated the regrowth process of uv disinfected e coli for example addition of tryptone increased k max of the 45 s irradiated e coli from 0 65 h 1 to 2 95 h 1 and the s m from 45 3 to 111 fig 3a c table s1 tryptone is a decomposed product of casein and is used in lb nutrient medium as a source of amino acids casein contains numerous essential and nonessential amino acids such as leucine and lysine 76 and thus tryptone contains multiple amino acids 77 pinto et al 41 have observed the resuscitation of six e coli strains from vbnc state in the presence of multiple amino acids all of which were contained in tryptone thus tryptone is expected to promote the resuscitation of vbnc e coli cells this study also found that fulvic acid enhanced regrowth compared to saline solution or starch the fulvic acid 2s101f used in this study contains nitrogen sulfur and phosphorus components 78 it has been reported that lack of nitrogen phosphorus and iron may limit the growth of microorganisms 79 fulvic acid assists cell repair and recovery possibly acting as a nutrient and causing regrowth 80 which supported the results in our experiment therefore we may assume that the presence of nitrogen and phosphorus in fulvic acid promoted regrowth of e coli compared to conditions without dom moreover aquatic fulvic acid is a complex mixture of aromatic polymers 81 containing carboxylic acids and lipids which can act as carbon and energy sources for bacteria in distribution systems 82 therefore it is reasonable that fulvic acid can act as nutrient carbon and energy sources for bacteria in the dark repair process after uv disinfection according to the results discussed above among the tested doms tryptone sodium pyruvate and fulvic acid promoted the dark repair of uv disinfected e coli it implied that amino acids biologically available carbon nutrients and ros scavengers promote dark repair of post uv disinfection e coli the degree of these promotions might depend on the dom type not only their concentration in addition the role of each dom should be related to the regrowth process either repairing dna damage or resuscitating vbnc which depends on the uv dose as discussed above this study also confirmed the lag phase possibly resulting from the residual effects of uv disinfection and the lag phase was shortened by tryptone sodium pyruvate and fulvic acid 3 3 photoreactivation 3 3 1 photoreactivation in dom solutions temporal changes in survival ratio were different from the light and dark storage conditions fig s3 under light storage condition the undisinfected e coli concentration was significantly reduced to 0 001 after 168 h of storage in saline solution fig 4a as calculated by eq 4 the relative survival ratio rs t of disinfected e coli increased over time under light storage condition fig s2 the rs t converged to 0 for all dom types except tryptone and sodium pyruvate with 45 s of uv irradiation which exceeded 0 after about 120 h and increased up to 51 3 experimental data fitted well with the model eq 4 where r 2 was over 0 88 for most cases fig 3b d table s2 the model fitness after the 45 s irradiation table s2 was the best r 2 0 9 among all the irradiation times which was the same as the result for dark repair table s1 two way anova revealed that the type of dom significantly affected k max and s m in light storage condition p 0 05 table 3 for all the conditions of irradiation the maximum survival ratio with tryptone was the highest followed by sodium pyruvate fig 4 meanwhile survival ratios of e coli with starch were similar to that with saline solution except for the last 24 h of the 45 s irradiated sample fig 4 in case of the irradiation for 45 s and 60 s fig 4d e the survival ratio with saline and starch solutions increased until 72 h of storage and decreased drastically after 120 h of storage the survival ratio with fulvic acid almost increased with storage time while it did not significantly decrease and remained almost at the maximum ratio 5 19 7 58 the survival ratios with sodium pyruvate and tryptone increased up to 244 and 94 0 respectively and then decreased to approximately 60 in case of 45 s irradiation and to approximately 10 in case of 60 s irradiation for the case of 45 s irradiation fig 4d the final e coli survival ratio in starch was less than in saline solution by over 1 log meaning that the reduction in survival ratio was greater in starch than that in saline solution the survival ratio with sodium pyruvate decreased from 94 0 to 67 6 and then showed a similar ratio to that with tryptone after 168 h which decreased from 204 to 57 0 for the case of 60 s irradiation fig 4e the survival ratio with sodium pyruvate decreased from 42 0 to 7 4 close to that with fulvic acid after 168 h we also observed lag phase before the substantial increase in survival ratio in some conditions for example the conditions with saline solution and starch for 60 s irradiation and with fulvic acid for 45 60 s irradiation after the irradiation for 15 s and 30 s fig 4b c the increase of e coli concentration in saline starch and fulvic acid solutions stopped in the initial 10 h and then their survival ratio slowly decreased to less than about 1 after 168 h of storage survival ratios with sodium pyruvate and tryptone almost reached the maximum ratios 50 270 at 24 h then decreased by around 50 3 and 231 respectively fig 4b c 3 3 2 the role of dom in photoreactivation the decrease in survival ratios under light condition could be due to visible light disinfection vld that was caused by the fluorescent lamps during storage the mechanism of bacterial inactivation by visible light has been considered to be the photo stimulation of endogenous intracellular porphyrins and subsequent generation of ros 83 85 e coli with starch and fulvic acid showed a reduction similar to the saline solution until 120 h while the subsequent reductions after 120 h were smaller than those of the saline solution fig 4a the reductions in survival ratio with sodium pyruvate and tryptone were smaller than those in all other solutions resulting in their final survival ratios being higher than other solutions after 168 h of storage fig 4a the relative survival ratios eq 3 with tryptone for all irradiation times and with sodium pyruvate for 45 s of irradiation exceeded 0 fig s2 this means the final concentration of uv irradiated e coli was higher than that of non uv irradiated e coli for these conditions disinfection resistant bacteria such as those which regrow after disinfection increase disinfection resistance by forming colonies and providing shelter to other bacteria 14 these relative survival ratios which exceed 0 in light condition possibly suggested that vld resistance was increased by promotion of regrowth by tryptone and sodium pyruvate therefore uv disinfection may result in higher bacterial concentrations than no uv irradiation depending on the dom properties starch slightly mitigated the vld caused reduction in undisinfected e coli concentration fig 4a starch plays a role of hydroxyl radical scavenging 32 33 while visible light generates ros 83 85 thus even though e coli cannot use starch for regrowth as described in the section 3 2 starch slightly reduced the effect of vld under the light condition possibly owing to its ros scavenging property sodium pyruvate and tryptone significantly mitigated vld of e coli and further promoted regrowth fig 4 inhibition of vld by sodium pyruvate in this study might be due to the ros scavenging effect of sodium pyruvate on the other hand tryptone is known to increase the resistance of e coli to oxidative stress such as ros induced by vld 86 cytoplasmic oxidative stress is likely to induce a stress response which in turn leads to an increase in oxidative stress resistance of the cells 86 then the augmentation of e coli resistance can be driven by the presence of tryptone 87 in our study the addition of tryptone mitigated the reduction of e coli concentration implying that tryptone is effective in improving the oxidative stress tolerance of e coli which was consistent with literature 86 thus the experimental results suggested that the presence of ros scavengers such as sodium pyruvate and oxidative stress resistance enhancers such as tryptone might inhibit vld in addition the large s m for either case of sodium pyruvate or tryptone fig 3 also indicated that they especially tryptone promoted regrowth under lighted condition as well as dark condition in contrast the presence of fulvic acid did not increase the regrowth rate and the concentration of uv disinfected e coli in light condition however the presence of fulvic acid also mitigated the vld caused reduction of the survival ratio and then the ratio remained almost at the maximum ratio after the rapid regrowth fig 4d e natural organic matter such as fulvic acid and humic acid has been reported to reduce ros concentrations 88 this pattern was consistent with the result of our study in which the reduction of e coli by vld was probably weakened by uv absorption table 1 and the inhibition of ros formation by fulvic acid therefore fulvic acid reduced vld under light condition rather than directly promoting e coli regrowth under light condition in previous studies photoreactivation has been reported to be more effective than dark repair at 10 h of regrowth in saline solution 52 57 also in our experiments the survival ratios under light condition were larger than those under the dark condition in saline solution when comparing the results of 10 hour storage figs 2 and 4 however in the extended regrowth phase up to 1 week photoreactivation was not more effective than dark repair as indicated by s m and k max in the saline solution this might be due to the longer storage time for regrowth in which vld was effective overall lighted condition resulted in greater regrowth during early storage i e 10 h compared to the dark condition while in the light condition vld resulted in the decrease in e coli concentration due to vld then each dom mitigated the vld induced decrease of e coli concentration to a different degree and depending on the type of dom light promoted regrowth or exerted no significant effect on the regrowth of the uv disinfected e coli to be specific results implied that tryptone sodium pyruvate and fulvic acid act as inhibitors of vld induced ros formation or related reactions and tryptone also acts as a source of amino acids promoting the regrowth in the light condition 4 implication for water treatment e coli was used as the model bacteria in this study as it is commonly used as an indicator of disinfection efficiency in water systems however consequences of uv disinfection and repair potentials vary among species of bacteria 89 for example it has been reported that e coli and fecal coliform are reduced by uv disinfection and then they regrow while bacillus subtilis is resistant to uv irradiation because of the formation of spores 89 since the mechanism of uv disinfection is based on uv induced ros formation and pyrimidine dimer formation in dna uv disinfection and subsequent regrowth ability may depend on formation of spores and cell structure of bacteria nevertheless similar regrowth patterns may be expected for bacterial species that are gram negative nonsporulating and rod shaped in addition the roles of dom such as ros scavenging and light screening i e inhibition of vld were considered to be independent from bacterial species therefore the findings from this study should be valid to other species including pathogens to some degree although the variation of the regrowth pattern among bacterial species needs further investigation in this study specific properties of dom such as ros scavenging containing protein or amino acids and humic substances promoted the regrowth of e coli uv disinfection of water should ensure that the uv dose is high enough to suppress reactivation to acceptable levels 90 in general wastewater contains proteins and sugars 91 while surface water of aquatic environments contains humic substances polysaccharides and proteins 92 our experimental results indicated that these common types of dom promote bacterial regrowth although vld can be expected to reduce bacterial concentration under sunlight the presence of these doms may restrict the bactericidal effect of vld after disinfection and also possibly promote regrowth thus the presence of dom showing above properties in uv disinfected water i e secondary wastewater or environmental water increases the risk of regrowth of bacteria possibly including pathogens therefore uv dose and reactor design such as uv pathlength and post light condition are important factors to ensure the safety of disinfected water to be stored released and reused the present study did not obtain evidence showing which mechanism repair of damaged dna or resuscitation of vbnc cells of regrowth was affected by water quality in order to confirm these speculated effects correspondence between dom properties and the regrowth mechanism needs to be further investigated for instance only the plate counting method was used to quantify e coli in our study and this method can only quantify culturable cells meaning that vbnc cells and damaged cells are not monitored the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa can quantify cpds caused by dna damage due to uv disinfection 93 and this method allows us to determine which mechanism was dominant in the regrowth process of bacteria after uv disinfection 5 conclusion this study investigated the effect of dom properties on the regrowth process of e coli after uv disinfection stored under dark and light conditions the major findings are as follows the maximum survival ratio s m of e coli for the 7 days of post disinfection storage ranged from 2 4 to 348 5 while its maximum regrowth rate k max ranged from 0 020 h 1 to 31 1 h 1 under dark and light conditions dom type significantly affected model parameters s m and k max especially tryptone and sodium pyruvate enhanced the regrowth and showed higher maximum concentration of e coli under dark and light conditions tryptone sodium pyruvate and fulvic acid possibly act as inhibitors of vld induced ros formation or related reactions while tryptone also acts as a source of amino acids dom in treated wastewater and environmental water might weaken vld and promote bacterial dark repair and photoreactivation assimilable organic carbon amino acids and ros scavengers could be good

12646,ultraviolet uv disinfection is effective in bacterial disinfection without yielding by products after uv disinfection however bacteria can regrow depending on water quality although there is a paucity of knowledge about the relation of water quality to bacterial regrowth therefore this study aimed to elucidate the effect of dissolved organic matter dom property on the regrowth process of escherichia coli e coli under dark and light conditions the changes in survival ratio of uv disinfected e coli were observed under dark and light conditions in the presence of one of four doms namely sodium pyruvate tryptone starch and fulvic acid after uv disinfection 265 nm the survival ratio of e coli was well described by the second order regrowth model under dark condition the maximum survival ratio s m of e coli during seven day storage ranged from 8 6 to 169 1 while the maximum regrowth rate k max ranged from 0 020 h 1 to 4 03 h 1 in light condition s m ranged from 2 4 to 348 5 k max ranged from 0 029 h 1 to 31 1 h 1 two way anova indicates the significant effects of dom type on those model parameters which was possibly owing to their roles as a source of amino acids and as a scavenger of reactive oxygen species overall dom weakened visible light disinfection after uv disinfection while promoting bacterial dark repair and photoreactivation this study revealed that dom property largely influences regrowth after uv disinfection highlighting the importance for considering such effect in uv disinfection graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords dark repair dissolved organic matter escherichia coli regrowth photoreactivation ultraviolet disinfection data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the field of water treatment ultraviolet uv disinfection has gained attention owing to its high efficiency in disrupting microbial gene sequence and almost absence of toxic by products 1 2 however bacteria are known to possess dna repair mechanisms against the damage caused by uv 3 4 such repair processes possibly reduce the efficacy of uv disinfection and raise concerns about pathogenic revival following uv disinfection 5 8 in fact bacteria sustaining their growing ability or virulence after disinfection poses a series of potential risks they include health risks e g infection and increase of bacterial resistance against disinfectants 9 10 process risks e g membrane fouling and pipe corrosion 11 12 and ecological risks e g change in dominant species and gene abundance variations 9 13 for instance disinfection resistant bacteria have been reported to form biofilms by forming colonies which may serve as shelter for other pathogens 14 moreover the health and ecological risk of disinfected bacteria can be even greater than that of undisinfected bacteria because the dominance of disinfection resistant bacteria in microbial communities tends to increase 11 15 and disinfection resistant bacteria might be more resistant to antibiotics 16 uv bacterial disinfection primarily targets bacterial dna by causing two major types of mutagenic dna damage i e cyclobutene pyrimidine dimers cpds and 6 4 photoproducts 4 17 but bacteria can regrow by repairing dna damage one of the repair mechanisms is photoreactivation in which photolyase enzymes bind specifically to cpds using the energy of light 310 480 nm to repair the damaged dna 4 18 the other is dark repair which replaces damaged dna with undamaged new nucleotides regardless of light availability 4 thus light condition affects these repair processes and subsequent bacterial regrowth 4 17 although the regrowth process is also related to wavelength the dose of irradiation during the uv disinfection process and the water quality 17 wavelength and dose of uv determine the type and degree of damage caused to bacterial genes e g dna repair enzymes or proteins which further influence bacterial regrowth processes after uv disinfection 19 20 for the same uv dose radiation showing a broad wavelength band in disinfection tends to prevent bacterial regrowth compared to monochromatic radiation 21 23 in addition uv at a wavelength of 265 nm seems more effective for escherichia coli e coli disinfection than uv at 280 nm for the same uv dose although disinfection by uv at 280 nm is more effective for inhibiting bacterial regrowth than uv at 265 nm 20 the suppression of regrowth by 280 nm uv is considered to be the damage of photolyase an enzyme responsible for dna repair or other related enzymes induced by this specific wavelength of uv 20 thus wavelength and its range in uv disinfection affect subsequent bacterial regrowth conventional sources of uv light are low pressure lp and medium pressure mp mercury lamps which emit monochromatic light with a wavelength of 253 7 nm and multichromatic light with a wide wavelength range of 200 nm 600 nm respectively 24 recently uv light emitting diodes uv leds are also gaining more attention owing to their several advantages they are mercury free highly energy efficient has a long usage period compact and highly flexible in designing 20 25 unlike conventional lamps uv leds can be designed to emit monochromatic light of any wavelength hence the light source determines the wavelength and its range of irradiated uv which possibly influences disinfection efficiency and post disinfection regrowth thus uv leds possibly allow for optimization of bacterial disinfection in terms of both instantaneous inactivation and inhibition of the post disinfection regrowth in addition to energy consumption in addition to the light condition in disinfection and regrowth phases water quality plays an important role in bacterial regrowth 17 for example low temperature e g 4 c hinders bacterial regrowth while high temperature e g 37 c promotes it 26 regarding components in water relatively low concentrations of dissolved organic matter dom orthophosphate ammonia and alkalinity have hindered the regrowth of uv irradiated bacteria 27 among these components dom is important as an energy source for respiration and bacterial growth 28 30 in general the effect of dom on bacterial growth is known to vary among dom components for example proteins serve as a source of amino acids while starch is one polysaccharide exerting hydroxyl radical scavenging 31 33 humic substances increase the growth efficiency of bacteria in lake water 34 and carboxylic acids are easily metabolized for bacterial growth 35 therefore such coexisting dom affects bacterial regrowth after disinfection possibly in different ways depending on dom properties in fact several organics have been reported to influence the reactivation of viable but non culturable vbnc bacterial cells which are induced by environmental stresses including uv disinfection 36 39 pyruvate restores biosynthesis of dna and proteins in the vbnc state 40 amino acids promote resuscitation of vbnc 41 as they are structural units of proteins and are found in natural water as a part of dom 42 further there has been two hypotheses regarding the combined effect of amino acids 1 the combination promoting resuscitation may vary depending on a specific strain and condition of induction to vbnc and 2 some particular combinations may lead to resuscitation of all strains of bacteria 41 however despite the considerable knowledge on the relationship between dom and bacterial growth 43 45 such a relationship in the regrowth phase after disinfection has only rarely been investigated although regrowth in natural water and wastewater has been often reported 46 47 therefore a fundamental understanding of the effect of dom on bacterial regrowth is critically important to ensure the safety of treated water considering both disinfection and post disinfection phases therefore the aim of the study was to elucidate on the effect of dom properties on the regrowth process after uv disinfection we hypothesized that dom property affects the regrowth pattern of e coli after uv disinfection e g regrowth rate and survival ratio using uv led the regrowth of e coli after uv disinfection in the presence of four different types of dom was investigated which were sodium pyruvate carboxylic acid tryptone protein starch sugar and fulvic acid humic substance all of them possibly support bacterial regrowth because sodium pyruvate and starch serve as reactive oxygen species ros scavengers 32 48 while starch also works as a carbon source tryptone provides amino acids while fulvic acid serves as a nutrient carbon and energy source these doms except fulvic acid have been reported to support bacterial growth as described above and all are contained in bacterial media fulvic acid is commonly found in environmental water therefore we evaluated its effect on the regrowth in natural water bodies the specific objectives of the study were 1 to evaluate the effect of the above four doms on the regrowth of e coli under light and dark conditions after disinfection with uv led and 2 to identify potential dom properties that promote or inhibit the regrowth 2 methods 2 1 preparation of e coli and dom solution e

this study was standard fulvic acid suwannee river ii by ihss 2 2 uv irradiation and regrowth tests the 100 ml saline solution of e coli was moved to glass containers inner diameter 76 4 mm and irradiated at room temperature 25 c for 15 30 45 and 60 s with a single led emitting uv at wavelength 265 nm houken 20w 265 dongguan houke electronic co china light intensity 820 5 Î¼w cm2 the distance between the sample surface and the uv led was 60 mm and the water depth in the reactor was 2 2 cm when the irradiation time was 15 30 45 and 60 s the uv dose was 12 3 24 6 36 9 and 49 2 mj cm2 respectively the regrowth of e coli was tested in a solution containing a single type of dom for each type of dom 0 3 ml of the 1 g l dom solution and 30 ml of the saline solution with the disinfected e coli were mixed in 50 ml centrifuge tubes and 50 ml cell cultivation flasks and stored at 25 c under dark and lighted conditions respectively for the 1 g l dom solutions sodium pyruvate was prepared by diluting 4 ml of a 100 mm solution with 40 ml of mili q water while tryptone starch and fulvic acid were prepared by dissolving 0 1 g of the material in 100 ml of mili q water to provide the lighted condition we used fluorescent lamps lu 1000 tokyo rikakikai co ltd japan with a broad emission between 310 and 700 nm and a peak near 580 nm the light intensity at the bottom of the water was 165 Î¼w cm2 measured by the spectral radiometer usr 45v d ushio inc japan naoh solution was added to the tubes and flasks of sodium pyruvate and fulvic acid and ph was adjusted to be neutral i e 6 7 to prevent growth inhibition the dom concentration during storage was 9 9 mg l for all types of dom samples were taken 10 times in total during the 168 hour storage period i e 7 days each sample was diluted with sterilized 0 85 nacl by factors from 100 to 105 to obtain a valid and countable number of colonies on a petri dish 30 300 colonies per plate and plated on sterile petri dishes in triplicate together with lb agar l2897 sigma aldrich as a growth medium these prepared plates were incubated at 37 c for 24 h the plates with dilution resulting in 10 300 colonies were selected for quantification three plates were prepared for each diluted sample and the average number of colonies that appeared on each plate was calculated to determine the concentration of e coli the absorbance of saline solutions containing undisinfected e coli and each type of dom were measured at wavelengths of 265 and 405 nm using a uv vis spectrophotometer uv2600 shimadzu co japan in a quartz cell with a 10 mm optical path length 2 3 data analysis and model fitting to describe uv disinfection a first order model between log removal and the applied uv dose eq 1 1 was used 1 log n 0 0 n 0 k uv dose where n 0 0 and n 0 are the number of colonies cfu ml before and after uv irradiation respectively superscript and subscript of n indicate uv irradiation time s and storage time h respectively uvdose is the provided uv dose mj cm2 and k cm2 mj is the inactivation rate constant to evaluate the number of e coli at each time point the survival ratio s t was defined as follows 2 s t 100 n t n 0 0 where s t is the survival ratio at t hours of storage time and n t is the number of cells at t hours of storage time cfu ml to evaluate the effect of uv irradiation on e coli survival ratios under each dom condition during storage relative survival ratio rs t was calculated by subtracting s t of non disinfected e coli from that of post disinfected e coli as follows 3 rs t s t s t 0 where s t is the survival ratio of uv irradiated e coli after t hours of storage and s t 0 is the survival ratio of non disinfected e coli after t hours of storage to model the reactivation process the following second order regrowth model proposed in a previous study was used 52 4 s t s m 1 s m s 0 1 e k 2 s m t mt where s m is the maximum survival ratio s 0 is the survival ratio immediately after uv disinfection k 2 h 1 is the second order reactivation constant m h 1 is the zero order mortality constant t h is the storage time after disinfection in the model k 2 is not the actual

obtain the parameters s m k max m after the model fitting using solver in microsoft excel microsoft office 2019 a two way analysis of variance anova was also performed in microsoft excel to test the hypothesis that uv dose and the type of dom affect s m and k max 3 results and discussion 3 1 uv disinfection the concentration of e coli decreased from 1 36 106 cfu ml to 620 cfu ml when uv dose increased from 0 mj cm2 to 49 2 mj cm2 the uv dose log removal relationship showed that the concentration of e coli logarithmically decreased with the increasing uv dose at a wavelength of 265 nm fig 1 although the concentration showed a tail for higher uv dose over 36 9 mj cm2 based on this result the inactivation rate constant k was estimated to be 0 081 cm2 mj the absorbance at the 265 nm wavelength was 0 007 for the saline solution and 0 111 for the saline solution containing e coli table 1 the absorbance at 405 nm was 0 04 for the saline solution with e coli while only the sample with fulvic acid showed larger absorbance 0 064 at 405 nm than the saline solution with e coli table 1 the inactivation rate constant in this study k 0 081 cm2 mj was significantly lower than in other reported studies showing 0 41 cm2 mj 20 0 43 cm2 mj 53 and 0 42 cm2 mj 54 despite the application of a wavelength 265 nm identical to this study using uv leds the difference in inactivation rate constant was possibly caused by the difference in experimental setups e g sample volume depth and diameter of the container in our experiment the water depth in the reactor was 2 2 cm which was about double or larger compared to those in these previous studies 1 1 cm based on beer lambert law and the measured absorbance the actual average dose along the pathway in this study was estimated to be 87 4 of that in case that the path length is 1 1 cm despite the same conditions of the apparent uv dose the disinfection mechanism might change depending on the applied uv dose according to literature most e coli cells have remained intact at uv doses 80 mj cm2 55 and a considerably high uv dose 400 mj cm2 has been required to cause irreversible cell membrane damage 56 on the other hand xu et al 56 have reported that a uv dose of 50 mj cm2 caused little dna lesions but apparent damages in mrna such as reca sos response dna damage repair dnaa chromosomal replication indicator protein and ssb single stranded dna binding protein specifically uv dose 50 mj cm2 has reduced reca to the detection limit resulting in loss of sos function and it also has reduced dnaa by 1 log 56 the applied uv dose in our experiment ranged from 12 mj cm2 to 50 mj cm2 therefore the damage on mrna by uv irradiance and the resulting potential of bacterial regrowth possibly varied with the presented experimental conditions of uv dose 3 2 dark repair 3 2 1 dark repair in saline solution in the absence of uv irradiation the survival ratio of e coli in saline solution reduced from 100 to 53 0 in 168 h of storage under dark condition fig 2a in saline solution the trend in dark repair after 15 s 30 s irradiation was different from that of 45 s 60 s irradiation fig 2 this difference was possibility caused primarily by the reduction in transcription levels of mrna such as reca ssb and dnaa in e coli cells irradiated by uv for 45 s as reported by xu et al 56 however after dark storage for 168 h in saline solution the survival ratios of e coli irradiated for 45 s and 60 s were finally larger than those irradiated for 15 s and 30 s previous studies have showed that the bacteria entered a decay phase after 4 h of dark repair probably due to the residual disinfection effect of uv irradiation on bacterial dna 57 58 the hypothesized mechanism of residual disinfection is that the sequential reactions from genetic damage to bacterial membranes and cell walls decrease the concentration of e coli even after uv irradiation 58 while most of the previous studies have set the storage time up to 10 h 20 57 we elongated the storage time to a week resulting in 1 the initial dark repair 2 a lag phase with a slight decrease after 4 h and then 3 significant regrowth after 72 h of storage fig 2 the residual effect of uv irradiation possibly let e coli enter a lag phase and then when the residual effect disappeared the significant regrowth began this hypothesis could explain the observation that e coli concentration stagnated or decreased after 4 h of dark repair and then substantial regrowth started after 72 h fig 2d e on the other hand the higher uv dose resulted in less increase in the survival ratio after 4 h of storage fig 2 this pattern was consistently observed by this study and the previous study 57 indicating that the residual effect of uv irradiation increases with uv dose 3 2 2 dark repair in dom solutions in the absence of uv irradiation e coli in sodium pyruvate and starch solutions showed reductions in survival ratio similar to that of the saline solution while the reduction was the largest to 15 4 with fulvic acid after 168 h of storage in contrast e coli with tryptone showed an increase in survival ratio up to 141 fig 2a when uv irradiation was applied the survival ratio of e coli was affected by the type of dom and the effect was more pronounced when uv irradiation time was longer i e 45 s 60 s in the solution containing tryptone the survival ratio remained stable or increased throughout the storage time fig 2b e where the highest survival ratio was observed after irradiation for 15 s 30 s and 45 s the survival ratio of e coli with starch showed similar trends to that of the saline solution after irradiation for 15 s 30 s and 45 s the relative survival ratio with dom in dark condition increased during storage and ranged from 46 to 103 fig s1 besides the shorter the uv irradiation time was the smaller the variation in the relative survival ratio for each dom type was the second order regrowth model eq 4 fitted well with those experimental data where the coefficient of determination r 2 was higher than 0 92 except for the four cases of 15 s irradiation with the saline solution 15 s with starch and 15 s 30 s with fulvic acid whose r 2 were lower but higher than 0 57 table s1 as a result tryptone showed the largest maximum survival ratio s m and the maximum reactivation rate k max followed by sodium pyruvate fig 3a c table s1 two way anova revealed that dom properties significantly affected k max under dark condition p 0 05 while uv dose showed an insignificant effect on k max p 0 05 table 2 in addition dom properties and uv dose showed a significant effect on s m in dark condition p 0 05 table 2 overall the type of dom was more influential in the dark repair process of e coli after uv disinfection than uv dose in our experimental conditions the overall patterns of regrowth and the timing of the rapid increase of survival ratio was also dependent on irradiation time for all dom types for instance we observed the lag phase right before their regrowth in the cases of irradiation for 45 s and 60 s fig 2d e the duration of the lag phase depended on dom properties where disinfected e coli with sodium pyruvate showed the shortest lag phase among the tested types of dom the lag phases of e coli regrowth with sodium pyruvate tryptone and fulvic acid were shorter than those with saline solution and starch fig 2d e in the cases of irradiation for 15 s and 30 s fig 2b c no lag phase was observed and substantial increases were observed in the first 24 h of storage followed by a gradual increase or steady state depending on the dom type the disinfected e coli reached a similar concentration to the initial concentration before disinfection recovery 90 in tryptone solution while it increased only up to 40 of the initial concentrations in other types of dom 3 2 3 the role of dom in dark repair according to the results of dark repair figs 2 3a c each dom property seems to play a particular role in the regrowth process among the four doms starch showed the most similar results survival ratio k max s m to the no dom condition i e saline solution e coli has been reported to be not able to use starch as a carbon source unless they are genetically modified due to the polymeric structure of starch 59 thus the damaged e coli was not able to utilize starch as substrate for regrowth on the other hand starch was expected to improve regrowth in dark conditions owing to its scavenging effect for the hydroxyl radical 32 33 in our experiment however starch did not promote the recovery of cells and genes damaged by uv disinfection high energy uv irradiation of water forms hydroxyl radicals 60 and hydrogen peroxide 61 but hydroxyl radical is minor due to its instability compared to hydrogen peroxide 62 so ros scavenging effect by starch might be an insignificant process in dark repair sodium pyruvate accelerated the regrowth of uv disinfected e coli fig 2 pyruvate is known as an ros scavenger for hydrogen peroxide 48 63 and has been reported to improve the culturability of non culturable cells of e coli and other species 64 69 one previous study pointed out that this was probably due to the recovery of injured cells 70 in contrast some studies has observed unsuccessful resuscitation of vbnc cells of bacteria other than e coli even after adding ros scavengers 71 74 thus the culturability of vbnc cells might not be solely dependent on sensitivity to ros and vbnc cells need other stimuli such as autoinducer for their resuscitation 70 these results in literature have implied that cells damaged by chemically or environmentally unfavorable conditions i e uv induced dna damaged cells became culturable by ros scavengers considering our experimental results as well ros scavenger for hydrogen peroxide seems to play a critical role in the regrowth of uv induced dna damaged cells regarding starch and sodium pyruvate we could not compare their roles quantitatively here as ros removal rate constant has been reported so far only for the reaction between pyruvate and hydrogen peroxide 75 nevertheless the different regrowth pattern with starch and sodium pyruvate might be explained by the targeted ros for scavenging meaning that scavengers of hydrogen peroxide likely promote e coli regrowth tryptone activated the regrowth process of uv disinfected e coli for example addition of tryptone increased k max of the 45 s irradiated e coli from 0 65 h 1 to 2 95 h 1 and the s m from 45 3 to 111 fig 3a c table s1 tryptone is a decomposed product of casein and is used in lb nutrient medium as a source of amino acids casein contains numerous essential and nonessential amino acids such as leucine and lysine 76 and thus tryptone contains multiple amino acids 77 pinto et al 41 have observed the resuscitation of six e coli strains from vbnc state in the presence of multiple amino acids all of which were contained in tryptone thus tryptone is expected to promote the resuscitation of vbnc e coli cells this study also found that fulvic acid enhanced regrowth compared to saline solution or starch the fulvic acid 2s101f used in this study contains nitrogen sulfur and phosphorus components 78 it has been reported that lack of nitrogen phosphorus and iron may limit the growth of microorganisms 79 fulvic acid assists cell repair and recovery possibly acting as a nutrient and causing regrowth 80 which supported the results in our experiment therefore we may assume that the presence of nitrogen and phosphorus in fulvic acid promoted regrowth of e coli compared to conditions without dom moreover aquatic fulvic acid is a complex mixture of aromatic polymers 81 containing carboxylic acids and lipids which can act as carbon and energy sources for bacteria in distribution systems 82 therefore it is reasonable that fulvic acid can act as nutrient carbon and energy sources for bacteria in the dark repair process after uv disinfection according to the results discussed above among the tested doms tryptone sodium pyruvate and fulvic acid promoted the dark repair of uv disinfected e coli it implied that amino acids biologically available carbon nutrients and ros scavengers promote dark repair of post uv disinfection e coli the degree of these promotions might depend on the dom type not only their concentration in addition the role of each dom should be related to the regrowth process either repairing dna damage or resuscitating vbnc which depends on the uv dose as discussed above this study also confirmed the lag phase possibly resulting from the residual effects of uv disinfection and the lag phase was shortened by tryptone sodium pyruvate and fulvic acid 3 3 photoreactivation 3 3 1 photoreactivation in dom solutions temporal changes in survival ratio were different from the light and dark storage conditions fig s3 under light storage condition the undisinfected e coli concentration was significantly reduced to 0 001 after 168 h of storage in saline solution fig 4a as calculated by eq 4 the relative survival ratio rs t of disinfected e coli increased over time under light storage condition fig s2 the rs t converged to 0 for all dom types except tryptone and sodium pyruvate with 45 s of uv irradiation which exceeded 0 after about 120 h and increased up to 51 3 experimental data fitted well with the model eq 4 where r 2 was over 0 88 for most cases fig 3b d table s2 the model fitness after the 45 s irradiation table s2 was the best r 2 0 9 among all the irradiation times which was the same as the result for dark repair table s1 two way anova revealed that the type of dom significantly affected k max and s m in light storage condition p 0 05 table 3 for all the conditions of irradiation the maximum survival ratio with tryptone was the highest followed by sodium pyruvate fig 4 meanwhile survival ratios of e coli with starch were similar to that with saline solution except for the last 24 h of the 45 s irradiated sample fig 4 in case of the irradiation for 45 s and 60 s fig 4d e the survival ratio with saline and starch solutions increased until 72 h of storage and decreased drastically after 120 h of storage the survival ratio with fulvic acid almost increased with storage time while it did not significantly decrease and remained almost at the maximum ratio 5 19 7 58 the survival ratios with sodium pyruvate and tryptone increased up to 244 and 94 0 respectively and then decreased to approximately 60 in case of 45 s irradiation and to approximately 10 in case of 60 s irradiation for the case of 45 s irradiation fig 4d the final e coli survival ratio in starch was less than in saline solution by over 1 log meaning that the reduction in survival ratio was greater in starch than that in saline solution the survival ratio with sodium pyruvate decreased from 94 0 to 67 6 and then showed a similar ratio to that with tryptone after 168 h which decreased from 204 to 57 0 for the case of 60 s irradiation fig 4e the survival ratio with sodium pyruvate decreased from 42 0 to 7 4 close to that with fulvic acid after 168 h we also observed lag phase before the substantial increase in survival ratio in some conditions for example the conditions with saline solution and starch for 60 s irradiation and with fulvic acid for 45 60 s irradiation after the irradiation for 15 s and 30 s fig 4b c the increase of e coli concentration in saline starch and fulvic acid solutions stopped in the initial 10 h and then their survival ratio slowly decreased to less than about 1 after 168 h of storage survival ratios with sodium pyruvate and tryptone almost reached the maximum ratios 50 270 at 24 h then decreased by around 50 3 and 231 respectively fig 4b c 3 3 2 the role of dom in photoreactivation the decrease in survival ratios under light condition could be due to visible light disinfection vld that was caused by the fluorescent lamps during storage the mechanism of bacterial inactivation by visible light has been considered to be the photo stimulation of endogenous intracellular porphyrins and subsequent generation of ros 83 85 e coli with starch and fulvic acid showed a reduction similar to the saline solution until 120 h while the subsequent reductions after 120 h were smaller than those of the saline solution fig 4a the reductions in survival ratio with sodium pyruvate and tryptone were smaller than those in all other solutions resulting in their final survival ratios being higher than other solutions after 168 h of storage fig 4a the relative survival ratios eq 3 with tryptone for all irradiation times and with sodium pyruvate for 45 s of irradiation exceeded 0 fig s2 this means the final concentration of uv irradiated e coli was higher than that of non uv irradiated e coli for these conditions disinfection resistant bacteria such as those which regrow after disinfection increase disinfection resistance by forming colonies and providing shelter to other bacteria 14 these relative survival ratios which exceed 0 in light condition possibly suggested that vld resistance was increased by promotion of regrowth by tryptone and sodium pyruvate therefore uv disinfection may result in higher bacterial concentrations than no uv irradiation depending on the dom properties starch slightly mitigated the vld caused reduction in undisinfected e coli concentration fig 4a starch plays a role of hydroxyl radical scavenging 32 33 while visible light generates ros 83 85 thus even though e coli cannot use starch for regrowth as described in the section 3 2 starch slightly reduced the effect of vld under the light condition possibly owing to its ros scavenging property sodium pyruvate and tryptone significantly mitigated vld of e coli and further promoted regrowth fig 4 inhibition of vld by sodium pyruvate in this study might be due to the ros scavenging effect of sodium pyruvate on the other hand tryptone is known to increase the resistance of e coli to oxidative stress such as ros induced by vld 86 cytoplasmic oxidative stress is likely to induce a stress response which in turn leads to an increase in oxidative stress resistance of the cells 86 then the augmentation of e coli resistance can be driven by the presence of tryptone 87 in our study the addition of tryptone mitigated the reduction of e coli concentration implying that tryptone is effective in improving the oxidative stress tolerance of e coli which was consistent with literature 86 thus the experimental results suggested that the presence of ros scavengers such as sodium pyruvate and oxidative stress resistance enhancers such as tryptone might inhibit vld in addition the large s m for either case of sodium pyruvate or tryptone fig 3 also indicated that they especially tryptone promoted regrowth under lighted condition as well as dark condition in contrast the presence of fulvic acid did not increase the regrowth rate and the concentration of uv disinfected e coli in light condition however the presence of fulvic acid also mitigated the vld caused reduction of the survival ratio and then the ratio remained almost at the maximum ratio after the rapid regrowth fig 4d e natural organic matter such as fulvic acid and humic acid has been reported to reduce ros concentrations 88 this pattern was consistent with the result of our study in which the reduction of e coli by vld was probably weakened by uv absorption table 1 and the inhibition of ros formation by fulvic acid therefore fulvic acid reduced vld under light condition rather than directly promoting e coli regrowth under light condition in previous studies photoreactivation has been reported to be more effective than dark repair at 10 h of regrowth in saline solution 52 57 also in our experiments the survival ratios under light condition were larger than those under the dark condition in saline solution when comparing the results of 10 hour storage figs 2 and 4 however in the extended regrowth phase up to 1 week photoreactivation was not more effective than dark repair as indicated by s m and k max in the saline solution this might be due to the longer storage time for regrowth in which vld was effective overall lighted condition resulted in greater regrowth during early storage i e 10 h compared to the dark condition while in the light condition vld resulted in the decrease in e coli concentration due to vld then each dom mitigated the vld induced decrease of e coli concentration to a different degree and depending on the type of dom light promoted regrowth or exerted no significant effect on the regrowth of the uv disinfected e coli to be specific results implied that tryptone sodium pyruvate and fulvic acid act as inhibitors of vld induced ros formation or related reactions and tryptone also acts as a source of amino acids promoting the regrowth in the light condition 4 implication for water treatment e coli was used as the model bacteria in this study as it is commonly used as an indicator of disinfection efficiency in water systems however consequences of uv disinfection and repair potentials vary among species of bacteria 89 for example it has been reported that e coli and fecal coliform are reduced by uv disinfection and then they regrow while bacillus subtilis is resistant to uv irradiation because of the formation of spores 89 since the mechanism of uv disinfection is based on uv induced ros formation and pyrimidine dimer formation in dna uv disinfection and subsequent regrowth ability may depend on formation of spores and cell structure of bacteria nevertheless similar regrowth patterns may be expected for bacterial species that are gram negative nonsporulating and rod shaped in addition the roles of dom such as ros scavenging and light screening i e inhibition of vld were considered to be independent from bacterial species therefore the findings from this study should be valid to other species including pathogens to some degree although the variation of the regrowth pattern among bacterial species needs further investigation in this study specific properties of dom such as ros scavenging containing protein or amino acids and humic substances promoted the regrowth of e coli uv disinfection of water should ensure that the uv dose is high enough to suppress reactivation to acceptable levels 90 in general wastewater contains proteins and sugars 91 while surface water of aquatic environments contains humic substances polysaccharides and proteins 92 our experimental results indicated that these common types of dom promote bacterial regrowth although vld can be expected to reduce bacterial concentration under sunlight the presence of these doms may restrict the bactericidal effect of vld after disinfection and also possibly promote regrowth thus the presence of dom showing above properties in uv disinfected water i e secondary wastewater or environmental water increases the risk of regrowth of bacteria possibly including pathogens therefore uv dose and reactor design such as uv pathlength and post light condition are important factors to ensure the safety of disinfected water to be stored released and reused the present study did not obtain evidence showing which mechanism repair of damaged dna or resuscitation of vbnc cells of regrowth was affected by water quality in order to confirm these speculated effects correspondence between dom properties and the regrowth mechanism needs to be further investigated for instance only the plate counting method was used to quantify e coli in our study and this method can only quantify culturable cells meaning that vbnc cells and damaged cells are not monitored the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa can quantify cpds caused by dna damage due to uv disinfection 93 and this method allows us to determine which mechanism was dominant in the regrowth process of bacteria after uv disinfection 5 conclusion this study investigated the effect of dom properties on the regrowth process of e coli after uv disinfection stored under dark and light conditions the major findings are as follows the maximum survival ratio s m of e coli for the 7 days of post disinfection storage ranged from 2 4 to 348 5 while its maximum regrowth rate k max ranged from 0 020 h 1 to 31 1 h 1 under dark and light conditions dom type significantly affected model parameters s m and k max especially tryptone and sodium pyruvate enhanced the regrowth and showed higher maximum concentration of e coli under dark and light conditions tryptone sodium pyruvate and fulvic acid possibly act as inhibitors of vld induced ros formation or related reactions while tryptone also acts as a source of amino acids dom in treated wastewater and environmental water might weaken vld and promote bacterial dark repair and photoreactivation assimilable organic carbon amino acids and ros scavengers could be good

12647,after a series of biochemical processes the wastewater engendered by the production of phenolic resin is ultimately left with a majority of difficult degradation organic matter most of these organic compounds are harmful to the water environment and require further advanced treatment before discharge in this study the original simple biological activated carbon bac filter column device was improved the new multi layer bac filter does not require backwash after improvement the treatment efficiency of the multi layer bac filter was studied through long term operation and the variation of pollutants in the wastewater was analyzed the results indicated that the multi layer bac filter could effectively remove hardly biodegradable organic matter ammonium nitrogen nh4 n and total nitrogen tn and its mechanism was mainly that hardly biodegradable organic matter and tn were removed by adsorption and biodegradation while nh4 n was only removed by microbial degradation the pore size distribution characteristics on the bac surface were analyzed and it was found that the adsorption and biodegradation reactions mainly occurred in the microporous region the experiment on carbon replacement indicated that the service time of the bac system could be prolonged by choosing the correct time of carbon replacement and adding the appropriate amount of microorganisms based on high throughput sequencing it was found that the microbial communities on bac at the same height were significantly different before and after carbon replacement the results of this paper are of some relevance for the upgrading of advanced treatment processes for chemical wastewater in practical engineering keywords biological activated carbon chemical wastewater advanced treatment carbon replacement carbon usage data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the chemical wastewater engendered by the production of phenolic resin usually contains toxic substances such as phenol and aldehyde which lead to the poor biodegradability of the wastewater moreover these pollutants greatly impact the natural water environment and even at low concentrations they will have toxic effects on aquatic organisms 1 2 through the food chain these pollutants will eventually enter the human body leading to human diseases such as muscle twitching cancer nervous system disorders and even death 3 as the country pays more attention to the ecological environment the quality of wastewater discharged is more stringent the traditional biochemical treatment process as the basic unit of chemical wastewater treatment has limited removal of pollutants to further improve the quality of effluent water in depth treatment is needed common advanced treatment processes include coagulation 4 fenton oxidation 5 ozone oxidation 6 adsorption 7 etc among them activated carbon adsorption technology has a good treatment effect and simple operation however as time goes by the adsorption capacity of activated carbon decreases rapidly and reaches a saturation state to prevent the leakage of pollutants it is necessary to replace new activated carbon but this will lead to high economic costs and limited practical engineering applications to improve the utilization of activated carbon many experts have studied various regeneration technologies such as electrochemical regeneration 8 ozone oxidation regeneration 9 supercritical regeneration 10 etc however these methods have high costs and harsh operating conditions while bac technology is simple green and environmentally friendly this technology combines the dual functions of adsorption and biodegradation which is an effective and economically feasible means for advanced wastewater treatment bac is usually used in the form of filters and the fillers are mainly granular activated carbon gac gac not only has a rough surface and porous structure which can provide the best growth surface and fluid shear force protection for slow growing microorganisms 11 but also can alleviate the load impact of wastewater on microorganisms to a certain extent 12 therefore bac formed by using gac as a carrier to immobilize microorganisms is widely used in wastewater treatment the adsorption capacity of gac decreases with time and the biodegradation process can prolong the use time of activated carbon 13 although biofilm formation can take weeks biological activity begins in the early stages of biofilm formation 14 the mechanism of bac is to adsorb pollutants to the surface or pores and then degrades them by microorganisms which prolongs the residence time of pollutants in the filter to a certain extent the iodine value can be used as an indicator of bac performance in terms of organic matter removal in the initial stage of the filter which is dominated by adsorption however it is not suitable for evaluating the performance in the later stage when adsorption and biodegradation occur simultaneously 15 compared with the existing adsorption indexes the pore size distribution characteristics can be used as a potentially better indicator to characterize the adsorption performance and microbial activity 16 since activated carbon with microorganisms attached was used in this study biodegradation had occurred in the initial stage so pore size distribution was selected as the index to characterize the treatment performance of the bac system in the application of the bac filter backwashing is always a tricky problem with the extension of the filter running time the surface of the filter layer will accumulate mud balls formed by filter media particles suspended solids and viscous substances as well as aging fall off of biofilm these substances will reduce the gap between carbon particles make the filter layer clogged hinder the transmission of nutrition matrix and dissolved oxygen increase the head loss 17 and decrease the effluent water quality therefore backwashing is necessary for conventional forms of bac filter 18 20 but backwashing will not only increase the operation steps but also directly affect the operating cost in this study to solve the possible blockage problem the filter column was selected to be layered and each layer was aerated separately to keep the bac particles in a semi fluidization fluctuation state it is speculated that the air bubbles in the wastewater will collide with the bac particles during the operation of the multi layer bac filter and the surface of the aging biofilm will fall off at the same time the accumulation of biological and non biological substances will not occur due to the increase of the gap between the carbon particles in addition the non suspended metabolites will gradually settle at the bottom of the filter and can be discharged through the sludge discharge port at the bottom therefore the design concept of the multi layer bac filter in this study is that backwashing is not required in this study the adsorption and biodegradation performance of the multi layer bac filter for low concentration organic pollutants were discussed phenolic compounds which are difficult to biodegrade are used as carbon sources for the growth and propagation of microorganisms and the deep denitrification of wastewater the reaction mechanism was analyzed from three aspects a the changes of effluent organic matter nh4 n and tn during the reaction process were analyzed b the changes in the pore size structure of the bac were researched c the distribution of the microbial community in the bac reactor was analyzed the adsorption capacity of bac would be exhausted sooner or later affecting the removal of pollutants under the premise of not adding any chemical agents the method of carbon change with the least amount of carbon was explored which effectively improved the utilization rate of bac at present the newly issued discharge standards for water pollutants in chemical industry db32 939 2020 in jiangsu province china is more strict on the discharge of wastewater by chemical enterprises producing chemical materials which requires chemical oxygen demand cod 50 mg l nh4 n 5 mg l and tn 15 mg l this research proved its feasibility for the application of advanced wastewater treatment and process upgrading and transformation in such chemical enterprises which provided reference technology for the implementation of practical projects 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the carbon material used in the experiment was coal made activated carbon with a diameter of 1 5 mm an iodine value of 1100 mg g and an average surface area of 1071 m2 g it was purchased from lvzhiyuan activated carbon co ltd the wastewater in this study was obtained from a chemical enterprise producing phenolic resin in jiangsu province it was the actual wastewater treated by aerobic activated sludge the main components of the wastewater were organic matter with chemical oxygen demand determined by potassium dichromate method codcr and dissolved organic carbon doc as the analytical indexes nh4 n tn phenol and the concentration of salt and chloride ions were high the water quality parameters of the wastewater were as follows codcr was 140 mg l doc was 53 mg l nh4 n was 2 44 mg l tn was 16 5 mg l ph was 8 68 phenol was 2 6 mg l salt content was 1100 mg l chloride ion was 232 mg l the inoculated sludge used for activated carbon was obtained from aerobic activated sludge of the same enterprise with a concentration of 2 g l 2 2 experimental setup and operation the experimental device was made of acrylic glass with an inner diameter of 8 cm a height of 45 cm an effective volume of 1 85 l and a filling rate of about 45 the specific structure of the device was shown in fig 1 in the reaction zone a filler layer was set every 4 cm from bottom to top and the height of each filler layer was 3 cm previous researches reported that the upward flow operation mode of the bac filter had a higher removal efficiency for organic matter in industrial wastewater than the downward flow 21 and it was easier to operate therefore considering comprehensively the upward flow water flow mode was adopted in the filter in this study considering the particularity of water quality to alleviate the adverse effects that may be brought to microorganisms intermittent inlet water was selected program run for 10 min pause for 10 min studies confirmed that intermittent flow did not significantly affect removal performance 22 aeration was set between each packing layer intermittent aeration program run for 2 h pause for 0 5 h each aeration pipe was controlled by the valve separately and the aeration flow rate was gradually reduced from bottom to top to maintain the dissolved oxygen do at 4 6 mg l a water intake was set between every two carbon layers for a total of six water intakes the inoculation method was to put the activated carbon into the activated sludge and make sufficient contact by aeration to make the microorganisms attached the sludge discharge port was arranged at the bottom of the filter the water temperature was controlled at 30 c 20 g bac was placed in each packing layer of the filter and the five layers were 100 g bac in total when the aeration was opened the effect of bubbles would make each layer of filler in a semi fluidized state which was not easy to block and could reduce the loss of head membrane hanging and acclimation should be started before filter start up at the stage of membrane hanging the inoculated activated carbon was put into the filter and synthetic wastewater was used as the influent synthetic wastewater was composed of glucose ammonium chloride potassium dihydrogen phosphate and some trace elements such as copper zinc manganese and so on the effluent water quality was measured regularly until it was stable indicating that the membrane hanging was successful 23 in the acclimation stage the actual wastewater was added to the synthetic wastewater and the dosage of the actual wastewater was gradually increased according to the ratio of 2 1 1 1 and 1 2 when the influent was all actual wastewater and the effluent was stable the acclimation ended 2 3 experimental arrangement 1 controlled experiment three experiment systems were established for comparison to confirm the advantages of the bac system in removing hardly biodegradable pollutants from low concentration phenolic chemical wastewater first adsorption and biodegradation experiment of activated carbon immobilized with bacteria 100 g of inoculated and acclimated bac was added to the filter and the influent flow rate was 125 ml h the influent procedure was provided in part 2 2 and sampled every 4 h second bacteria without activated carbon as a control experiment control bacteria microbial suspension was obtained from the acclimated bac column by the method described in lu s research 24 then the microbial suspension was added to autoclaved raw water and the operation was performed according to the same degree third activated carbon adsorption alone without bacteria as a control experiment control carbon 100 g gac was added to a sterile filter and the procedure was the same 2 bac experiment five sets of identical experimental equipment were prepared one group studied the long term wastewater treatment performance of bac and tested the change of effluent water quality the other group studied carbon replacement methods and calculated the minimum amount of carbon used details were provided in parts 3 4 and 3 6 the remaining three sets of experimental setups were investigated for backwashing details were provided in part 3 2 2 4 water quality analysis in this research routine water quality parameters such as codcr nh4 n tn and ph were determined according to the standard method 25 doc was determined by the total organic carbon analyzer toc l cph shimadzu japan after the filtration with a 0 45 Î¼m pore size filter membrane 2 5 pore size distribution analysis automatic surface area and porosity analyzer bet autosorb iq quantachrome instruments usa was used to determine the specific surface area and pore size distribution of activated carbon the samples were ground into powder and dried since the nitrogen adsorption method was a method with higher accuracy and better stability at present 26 nitrogen 77 k was used as an adsorbent to draw nitrogen adsorption isotherms and analyze the distribution of micropores and mesopores 2 6 microbial community analysis during the stable period microbial samples in bac filters were collected and stored at 80 c the microbial community composition was analyzed by high throughput sequencing technology based on 16s rrna gene sequence dna was extracted from the samples using a kit fast dna spin kit for soil m p u s primers 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 were selected for v3 v4 region gene amplification 27 after pcr amplification was completed the products were recovered using the axypreptm dna gel extraction kit axygen biosciences union city u s eluted with tris hcl buffer and determined by 2 agarose gel electrophoresis then pcr products were quantified with the quantifluor st blue fluorescence quantification system promega purified products were sequenced on the miseq pe300 platform of illumina company and then analyzed for microbial community diversity based on otu clustering results 3 results and discussion 3 1 treatment efficiency of bac filter for organic matter nh4 n and tn the changes in removal efficiency of organic matter nh4 n and tn in the three experimental systems are shown in fig 2 the curves of codcr and doc showed that activated carbon had a good adsorption effect on organic matter in low concentration chemical wastewater but the removal efficiency of organic matter in this wastewater was generally lower than 5 when bacteria degrade alone indicating that most of the remaining organic matter in the wastewater treated by the aerobic tank was difficult to biodegrade however the removal efficiency of codcr and doc by activated carbon immobilized with bacteria was about 80 at this stage through the above three groups of experiments two points were proved first the removal efficiency of organic matter by bac decreased slowly with time which was inconsistent with the behavior of removing organic matter by activated carbon alone indicating the occurrence of bioregeneration second it is feasible to use the bac system to treat the hardly biodegradable organic matter at present the removal mechanism of the hardly biodegradable organic matter can be explained as follows the hardly biodegradable organic matter molecules in the liquid phase are adsorbed to the micropores or biofilms of bac and some substances are then diffused from the pores to the inner surface of biofilms and then converted into biodegradable substances by extracellular microorganisms related to micropores 28 to adapt to the environment microorganisms can produce corresponding inducible enzymes these enzymes are involved in metabolic reactions to help microorganisms degrade organic matter and ensure the normal growth of cells in the metabolic process 24 in addition previous studies have shown that glucose easily induces the production of filamentous microorganisms 29 filamentous microorganisms might be generated in the filter due to the use of glucose feed during the initial membrane hanging stage filamentous microorganisms can decompose the benzene ring structure of the aromatic compounds 30 on the other hand microorganisms need enough time to degrade organic matter the contact time of organic matter with microorganisms is prolonged as it is adsorbed into the bac pores thus biologically inaccessible organic carbon is converted into biologically accessible organic carbon the curve of nh4 n is shown in fig 2b the removal efficiency of nh4 n in the activated carbon system was 0 while the removal efficiency of nh4 n in the microbial system and bac system which have similar removal behavior increased to stable over time this indicates that the removal of nh4 n in wastewater is not through the adsorption of activated carbon but depends on microbial degradation because of the presence of nitrifying bacteria in the bac system details were provided in part 3 5 it is speculated that the main removal mechanism of nh4 n is nitrification which is consistent with guo s reported results 31 however the curve change of tn was just the opposite the removal efficiency of tn in the microbial system was 0 while the removal efficiency of tn in the activated carbon system and bac system which have similar removal behavior gradually decreased with the extension of time this indicates that the removal of tn in wastewater mainly depends on activated carbon adsorption in the early stage of bac and microorganisms in this stage cannot achieve the purpose of nitrogen removal activated carbon can reduce tn by adsorbing dissolved organic nitrogen don 30 and no3 n 32 in the wastewater the bac system s removal of pollutants can be theoretically divided into three periods 1 adsorption dominated period a 0 40 days 2 transition from adsorption to biodegradation period b 40 65 days and 3 biodegradation dominated period c 65 90 days to determine the optimal hydraulic load that the bac filter can withstand the test was carried out in period a1 to increase the hydraulic load the water intake was in the order of 3 l d 1 5 days 4 l d 6 10 days 5 l d 11 15 days and 6 l d 16 18 days as shown in fig 3a when the water intake increased to 6 l d the removal efficiency of organic matter suddenly decreased from 69 29 to 42 86 and the h point appeared on the removal curve of codcr and doc when the water intake was restored to 5 l d again the organic matter removal efficiency also rose to 68 57 indicating that the optimal water intake of the bac filter was 5 l d the hydraulic load was 0 99 m3 m2 d and the hydraulic retention time was 4 8 h after the h point the bac filter was operated at a processing capacity of 5 l d the average removal efficiency of codcr decreased from 66 87 to 11 90 and the average removal efficiency of doc decreased from 67 19 to 11 83 when the bac filter was operated from period a to period c the removal efficiency of nh4 n was slightly lower at the beginning and then gradually stabilized at 40 60 the tn removal efficiency gradually decreased from 65 to 0 in the early stage and began to rise about 10 days later and finally stabilized at 20 30 in the early stage of adsorption the removal efficiency of organic matter could reach 60 90 which was also confirmed by the study of velten et al 33 the variation of codcr and doc curves was mainly because the organic matter was not only restricted by the adsorption capacity of activated carbon but also affected by the degradation capacity of microorganisms however the overall stability of the nh4 n curve was due to 1 it was not affected by the adsorption capacity of activated carbon and 2 the mass concentration of nh4 n in such wastewater was low 2 65 mg l which was not easy to be affected by hydraulic load in addition the tn removal efficiency decreased to 0 in the early stage probably because the adsorption of tn by bac reached saturation and there were no denitrifying microorganisms on the surface with the increase of running time the biofilm on the surface of activated carbon began to thicken forming a hypoxic zone and growing denitrifying bacteria denitrifying bacteria can convert no3 n and no2 n from activated carbon surface adsorption or microbial degradation into n2 therefore the tn removal curve indicated that denitrification occurred in the bac system and biological nitrogen removal was achieved the pollutant removal capacity of each part of the bac filter from bottom to top in different periods is shown in fig 3b in period a bac in the first layer had the strongest pollutant removal ability compared with other layers the removal efficiencies of organic matter nh4 n and tn in the first layer of bac were 42 12 38 79 and 11 81 respectively the first layer of bac played a dominant role in the operation of the whole filter followed by the second and third layers the removal efficiency of the top layer was low but it could also play a protective role since bac in the first layer was exposed to the highest concentration of pollutants its adsorption capacity was depleted first at the same time the biofilm on the bac surface grew thickest and covered the largest area making most of the surface pores disappear when the bac of the first layer fails the bac of other layers can still remove pollutants therefore to maximize the utilization of bac it is not necessary to replace all bacs with new ones but only part of them details were provided in part 3 4 3 2 backwashing when the removal efficiency of organic matter in the reactor effluent was significantly reduced backwashing experiments were performed to determine whether backwashing was necessary using codcr as the evaluation index backwashing was carried out when the removal efficiency of codcr dropped to 60 and 40 each packing layer of the reactor is provided with a stainless steel screen cover when the filler expands it will be intercepted by the net cover therefore there is no need to worry about the loss caused by the excessive expansion rate of the filler the maximum expansion rate of the packing in the reactor was 25 summary of relevant studies and engineering experience 34 35 bac filter column backwashing expansion rate of 25 30 has the best effect backwashing intensity should not only ensure that the aging biofilm on the bac and some contaminants are removed but also make the bac retain a certain amount of biomass for most bac filter columns with 1 2 m thickness the strength of air flushing is 10 18 l s m2 and that of water flushing is 6 15 l s m2 due to the low thickness of the filter column in this research a low flushing intensity was selected the flushing strength ensures that the expansion rate of the packing is close to 25 table 1 lists the different backwash schemes fig 4 illustrates the codcr removal efficiency of the bac within 96 h after backwashing when the removal efficiency of codcr dropped to 60 and 40 backwashing was performed according to schemes 1 and 2 the changing trend of codcr removal efficiency was largely consistent with that of the experimental group without backwashing however the removal efficiency of codcr in scheme 3 decreased significantly which was speculated to be due to the loss of biomass caused by excessive flushing it was experimentally proved that backwashing could not improve the removal efficiency of organic matter by bac the reduced removal efficiency of organic matter is not due to the blockage of the bac filter column but rather to the decrease of the bac adsorption capacity it also demonstrates that the reactor designed in this study will not cause the blockage problem therefore it is judged that the reactor design is efficient and no backwashing is required during operation 3 3 bac pore size distribution changes the bac pore size distribution with time and height was analyzed by measuring the upper middle and lower height samples in three periods it can also be seen from the change in pore size distribution that bac plays the largest role in the first layer as shown in table 2 compared with the surface characteristics of the original gac such as specific surface area micropore volume mesoporous volume etc all indicators of bac in the first layer decreased the most the change in the decreasing efficiency of bac s specific surface area micropore area and pore volume in different periods was similar to the change in pollutant removal efficiency the results indicated that the pore size distribution characteristics could also be used as a potential indicator to illustrate the adsorption performance and microbial activity in addition the area and volume of micropores pore size range 0 4 2 nm changed most significantly compared with mesoporous pore size range 2 50 nm the results indicated that the adsorption and biodegradation reactions mainly occurred in the microporous region it has been reported that the adsorption of activated carbon on phenol and other small molecules is concentrated in the micropores 36 37 resulting in the accumulation of substrates and nutrients needed for microbial growth in the micropores therefore it is speculated that the carbon material with a larger proportion of micropores is more conducive to the treatment of wastewater containing small molecules the changes in micropore volume with time and height were analyzed the pore volume decline rates in period a were 16 03 layer 1 12 20 layer 3 and 10 29 layer 5 respectively in period b they were 25 36 layer 1 22 25 layer 3 and 20 81 layer 5 respectively in period c they were 32 78 layer 1 27 27 layer 3 and 25 60 layer 5 respectively it showed that the decrease rates of micropore volume in the three periods decreased along the height and the micropore volume in the upper layer was larger than that in the lower layer consequently it can be inferred that the lower bac can be replaced with the upper bac if fails which can prolong the service time of the bac system and enhance the removal efficiency of organic matter 3 4 research for bac replacement in this research the effluent quality after advanced treatment of wastewater was aimed at meeting the discharge standards of water pollutants in chemical industry db32 939 2020 of jiangsu province china the advanced treatment of this kind of chemical wastewater took the organic matter as the main target so the carbon replacement experiment aimed to meet the cod 50 mg l in the standard in this experiment a small amount of powdered activated carbon pac was used to adsorb bac effluent to ensure that the effluent quality reached the standard the amount of pac depends on the concentration of organic pollutants in bac effluent therefore it is very important to determine the correct carbon replacement time of the bac filter as shown in fig 6a there was a turning point t in the trend line of codcr removal efficiency in period b and the slope of the trend line after the t point was greater than that before the t point this indicated that the removal efficiency of codcr decreased faster after the t point and the biodegradation was gradually occupying the dominant role therefore to reduce the amount of pac used in the later stage of the treatment process it was more appropriate to choose carbon replacement at the t point at the point of t the codcr removal efficiency was 42 85 i e the effluent codcr was 80 mg l the adsorption experiment of pac demonstrated that the codcr could be reduced to 38 mg l by adding 0 1 g l pac to the wastewater with 80 mg l codcr for 0 5 h this method possesses a low cost and meets the requirements of emission standards on the other hand the carbon replacement method has a great effect on the improvement of bac utilization the carbon replacement process of this investigation is shown in fig 5 the first bac layer was removed in which the adsorption capacity was greatly reduced and the second third fourth and fifth layers were moved down the new bac was added to the top thus forming a new five layer bac filter after carbon replacement the effluent codcr concentration decreased but it began to rise again 4 days later until it exceeded 80 mg l 8 days later fig 6b it was speculated that the initial decrease of codcr concentration was due to the addition of new bac which improved the adsorption capacity of the filter while the rapid increase of codcr concentration to the point of b might be because the biodegradation rate was much less than the adsorption rate the reason for the weakened microbial degradation efficiency is speculated to be two points first most of the organic matter was adsorbed and degraded by the first layer of bac before carbon replacement leaving less organic matter in the following layers the nutrients required for microbial metabolism were insufficient resulting in reduced biological activity or even death second there are some toxic substances in such chemical wastewater such as phenols and aldehydes long term exposure of microorganisms to these substances might lead to adverse effects on biological activities therefore the remaining layers of the old bac need to be supplemented with microorganisms after replacing the new bac to prove the hypothesis that the removal efficiency of codcr decreases rapidly due to the lack of microorganisms the investigation carried out microbial supplementation experiment on bac at different heights for 5 consecutive days this experiment supplemented microorganisms by adding activated sludge to be close to the actual engineering and easy to operate after microbial supplementation the concentration of effluent codcr decreased from 84 2 mg l point e to 56 5 mg l and then gradually increased and the increasing rate was slower than that before microbial supplementation 60 65 days fig 6b with the concentration of codcr below 80 mg l as the boundary the phase i was maintained for 8 days and the phase ii was maintained for 16 days indicating that it was necessary to supplement the filter with microorganisms after carbon replacement to determine the optimal dosage of microorganisms 2 ml of inoculated activated sludge concentration of 2 g l was added daily to the four layers of 2 1 3 2 4 3 and 5 4 from day 65 the change in the codcr removal efficiency of bac effluent in each layer was used to judge whether the microorganisms were sufficient as shown in table 3 the optimal activated sludge dosage for layer 2 1 layer 3 2 layer 4 3 and layer 5 4 were 16 mg 12 mg 12 mg and 8 mg respectively 3 5 microbial community analysis in the bac filter the first layer had the highest pollutant removal efficiency while the pollutant removal efficiency of the second to the fifth layer decreased gradually but there was little difference to determine the distribution of dominant bacteria in bac filters and the differences of microorganisms before and after carbon replacement first to third layers of bac were selected to determine microbial communities activated carbon inoculated sludge a0 was obtained from the activated sludge in the aerobic tank of the chemical plant and the wastewater of the experiment was the effluent of the same aerobic tank therefore bac and inoculated sludge had a certain degree of similarity in microbial composition according to the venn diagram analysis of species the otu number of inoculated sludge was 1291 and the otu numbers of bac in the first layer b1 second layer b2 and third layer b3 were 1449 1440 and 1361 respectively the common otu of a0 and b1 was 885 accounting for 68 55 of a0 the common otu of a0 and b2 was 804 accounting for 62 28 of a0 the common otu of a0 and b3 was 731 accounting for 56 62 of a0 it was found that the similarity between the microorganisms on the bac and the microorganisms in the a0 gradually decreased along the height direction presumably because the composition and concentration of pollutants in the wastewater exposed to each bac layer were different the microbial community distribution of the four samples at the phylum level is shown in fig 7 and those with relative abundance 0 01 were classified as others the main phyla of a0 at the phylum level were proteobacteria with a proportion of 30 75 followed by actinobacteriota 18 88 patescibacteria 11 76 and chloroflexi 9 18 after acclimation in a low nutrient concentration environment proteobacteria showed the most obvious changes proteobacteria in b1 b2 and b3 increased from 30 75 to about 50 this indicated that proteobacteria was the most abundant one in the bac filter similar studies have previously confirmed that proteobacteria is the dominant phyla in the bac system 38 39 although proteobacteria was the dominant phyla on both inoculated sludge and bac its relative abundance was markedly different this indicated that proteobacteria contained numerous microorganisms related to the degradation of complex organic matter and the increase of its abundance enhanced the removal ability of organic matter in the bac system proteobacteria also includes some nitrifying bacteria and nitrogen fixing bacteria which play an important role in removing organic carbon and nh4 n in wastewater 40 in this study the presence of nitrospirota in three bac samples demonstrated that nitrification occurred in the bac filter the abundance of nitrospirota in the b1 sample was higher than that of b2 and b3 which might be because the concentration of nh4 n in the influent water contacted by b1 was higher than that of the latter two however there was no significant difference in the abundance of nitrospirota which presumably was due to the low concentration of nh4 n in raw water 2 65 mg l the abundance of bacteroidota in the three bac samples was lower than a0 which was speculated to be because of the low concentration of organic matter that could be utilized by bacteroidota in the wastewater treated by an aerobic tank bacteroidetes bacteria belong to heterotrophic bacteria which can participate in the cycle of organic carbon and protein in wastewater 41 since the number of species of b1 at the genus level was 473 which was larger than that of b2 463 and b3 446 b1 had the most abundant species to further analyze the changes of bacterial species during the transition from high organic matter concentration to low organic matter concentration environment b1 and a0 were compared the relative distribution of the first 36 bacterial genera is shown in fig 8 when the organic matter concentration was 500 mg l the dominant bacteria of a0 were unclassified o micrococcales norank f norank o saccharimonadales and nakamurella pseudorhodoplanes mesorhizobium and pseudolabrys became the dominant species when the organic matter concentration was reduced to 140 mg l and most of the substances were difficult to degrade compared with a0 the relative abundance of at least 10 species in alphaproteobacteria was increased in b1 some researchers have demonstrated that alphaproteobacteria is competitive in low organic matter environment and can degrade complex organic compounds 42 43 consequently it is speculated that the existence of alphaproteobacteria is very important for the removal of low concentration of hardly biodegradable organic compounds other studies have also reported that alphaproteobacteria contributes to doc removal 44 in addition gammaproteobacteria contains a large number of denitrifying bacteria 45 such as pseudomonas which is a common bacterial genus in the denitrifying system and has a high tolerance after acclimation the relative abundance of most bacteria in gammaproteobacteria increased which explained the increased denitrification capacity of the bac system described in part 3 1 above the dominance of proteobacteria in the bac filter was further proved by the analysis of microbial genera there were nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria in the bac system and the removal efficiencies of nh4 n and tn existed simultaneously in part 3 1 which proved that nitrification and denitrifying occurred simultaneously in the same reactor this result was also confirmed in the treatment of livestock wastewater 46 the difference test of microbial communities at the phylum level on bac at the same height before and after carbon replacement is shown in fig 9 the first 15 phyla b1 and b2 1 had significant differences in 13 bacterial phyla p 0 05 fig 9a b2 and b3 2 had significant differences in 14 bacterial phyla p 0 05 fig 9b b3 and b4 3 had significant differences in 13 bacterial phyla p 0 001 fig 9c the results showed that the bacterial phyla on bac at the same height were significantly different before and after carbon replacement at the same time it could also explain the reason for the difference in organic matter removal ability before and after carbon replacement after carbon replacement the removal efficiency of organic matter by b2 1 was 35 71 which was lower than that of b1 41 12 period a the reasons why the removal efficiency cannot be restored to the previous best state may be first the adsorption capacity is different due to the different adsorption time second even if the concentration of organic nutrients in the environment is increased and microorganisms are supplemented the difference of microbial phylum between on bac at the same height before and after carbon replacement cannot be eliminated 3 6 statistical carbon usage assuming that the daily treatment water volume of chemical wastewater is 100 m3 the raw water is directly treated with gac and only 6 l of water can be treated with 100 g carbon to meet the standard requirements through calculation 100 m3 wastewater needs about 1 67 t of carbon and the annual carbon consumption needs 600 t calculated by 360 days a year which is a huge cost if pac is used to treat raw water the dosage needs 1 g l and the reaction can reach the discharge standard for 1 h it is calculated that the annual carbon consumption needs 36 t and the annual carbon consumption decreases by 94 compared with gac however using bac to treat wastewater the annual carbon consumption is less in this part different carbon consumption of three carbon replacement methods for bac are calculated table 4 3 when effluent cod 50 mg l all 100 g carbon is replaced 4 when effluent cod 80 mg l all 100 g carbon will be replaced and bac effluent with 50 mg l cod 80 mg l will be adsorbed by a small amount of pac 5 when effluent cod 80 mg l only 20 g of 100 g carbon is replaced the first layer and then 20 g carbon is replaced every 24 days the effluent of bac with 50 mg l cod 80 mg l is treated by pac the results show that the annual carbon consumption calculated by method 5 is the least which decreases by 98 40 and 73 31 compared with method 1 and method 2 respectively 4 conclusion in this research a multi layer bac filter was used to treat low concentration phenolic chemical wastewater in depth the results showed that the removal efficiencies of organic matter and tn were 75 85 and 20 30 respectively by both activated carbon adsorption and biodegradation however the removal of nh4 n only depended on biodegradation and the removal efficiency was about 45 to 55 the analysis of pollutant removal efficiency along the height of the filter indicated that the first layer played a major role in the bac filter so the first layer failed first replacing part of the old carbon could maximize the bac utilization after wastewater treatment specific surface area and total pore volume of bac decreased and micropore volume decreased the most compared with mesoporous volume indicating that adsorption and biodegradation reactions on bac mainly concentrated in the micropore region the lowest layer of activated carbon was replaced when the removal efficiency of pollutants by the bac filter decreased significantly meanwhile the whole filter column was moved down and new carbon was added to the upper layer the research revealed that this method of carbon replacement could effectively improve the removal efficiency of organic matter but it needed to meet the requirements of adding the appropriate amount of microorganisms to the old carbon while adding new carbon in addition this carbon replacement method could maximize the utilization of bac the minimum annual carbon consumption was not 10 t based on the wastewater treatment capacity of 100 m3 d high throughput sequencing results showed that the dominant genera in bac were pseudorhodoplanes mesorhizobium and pseudolabrys in the environment of low concentration of hardly biodegradable organic matter and all that belonged to proteobacteria the microbial phylum level analysis revealed that bacteria phylum on bac at the same height was significantly different before and after carbon replacement and this difference did not change with the increase of organic matter concentration and the addition of microorganisms declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

12647,after a series of biochemical processes the wastewater engendered by the production of phenolic resin is ultimately left with a majority of difficult degradation organic matter most of these organic compounds are harmful to the water environment and require further advanced treatment before discharge in this study the original simple biological activated carbon bac filter column device was improved the new multi layer bac filter does not require backwash after improvement the treatment efficiency of the multi layer bac filter was studied through long term operation and the variation of pollutants in the wastewater was analyzed the results indicated that the multi layer bac filter could effectively remove hardly biodegradable organic matter ammonium nitrogen nh4 n and total nitrogen tn and its mechanism was mainly that hardly biodegradable organic matter and tn were removed by adsorption and biodegradation while nh4 n was only removed by microbial degradation the pore size distribution characteristics on the bac surface were analyzed and it was found that the adsorption and biodegradation reactions mainly occurred in the microporous region the experiment on carbon replacement indicated that the service time of the bac system could be prolonged by choosing the correct time of carbon replacement and adding the appropriate amount of microorganisms based on high throughput sequencing it was found that the microbial communities on bac at the same height were significantly different before and after carbon replacement the results of this paper are of some relevance for the upgrading of advanced treatment processes for chemical wastewater in practical engineering keywords biological activated carbon chemical wastewater advanced treatment carbon replacement carbon usage data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the chemical wastewater engendered by the production of phenolic resin usually contains toxic substances such as phenol and aldehyde which lead to the poor biodegradability of the wastewater moreover these pollutants greatly impact the natural water environment and even at low concentrations they will have toxic effects on aquatic organisms 1 2 through the food chain these pollutants will eventually enter the human body leading to human diseases such as muscle twitching cancer nervous system disorders and even death 3 as the country pays more attention to the ecological environment the quality of wastewater discharged is more stringent the traditional biochemical treatment process as the basic unit of chemical wastewater treatment has limited removal of pollutants to further improve the quality of effluent water in depth treatment is needed common advanced treatment processes include coagulation 4 fenton oxidation 5 ozone oxidation 6 adsorption 7 etc among them activated carbon adsorption technology has a good treatment effect and simple operation however as time goes by the adsorption capacity of activated carbon decreases rapidly and reaches a saturation state to prevent the leakage of pollutants it is necessary to replace new activated carbon but this will lead to high economic costs and limited practical engineering applications to improve the utilization of activated carbon many experts have studied various regeneration technologies such as electrochemical regeneration 8 ozone oxidation regeneration 9 supercritical regeneration 10 etc however these methods have high costs and harsh operating conditions while bac technology is simple green and environmentally friendly this technology combines the dual functions of adsorption and biodegradation which is an effective and economically feasible means for advanced wastewater treatment bac is usually used in the form of filters and the fillers are mainly granular activated carbon gac gac not only has a rough surface and porous structure which can provide the best growth surface and fluid shear force protection for slow growing microorganisms 11 but also can alleviate the load impact of wastewater on microorganisms to a certain extent 12 therefore bac formed by using gac as a carrier to immobilize microorganisms is widely used in wastewater treatment the adsorption capacity of gac decreases with time and the biodegradation process can prolong the use time of activated carbon 13 although biofilm formation can take weeks biological activity begins in the early stages of biofilm formation 14 the mechanism of bac is to adsorb pollutants to the surface or pores and then degrades them by microorganisms which prolongs the residence time of pollutants in the filter to a certain extent the iodine value can be used as an indicator of bac performance in terms of organic matter removal in the initial stage of the filter which is dominated by adsorption however it is not suitable for evaluating the performance in the later stage when adsorption and biodegradation occur simultaneously 15 compared with the existing adsorption indexes the pore size distribution characteristics can be used as a potentially better indicator to characterize the adsorption performance and microbial activity 16 since activated carbon with microorganisms attached was used in this study biodegradation had occurred in the initial stage so pore size distribution was selected as the index to characterize the treatment performance of the bac system in the application of the bac filter backwashing is always a tricky problem with the extension of the filter running time the surface of the filter layer will accumulate mud balls formed by filter media particles suspended solids and viscous substances as well as aging fall off of biofilm these substances will reduce the gap between carbon particles make the filter layer clogged hinder the transmission of nutrition matrix and dissolved oxygen increase the head loss 17 and decrease the effluent water quality therefore backwashing is necessary for conventional forms of bac filter 18 20 but backwashing will not only increase the operation steps but also directly affect the operating cost in this study to solve the possible blockage problem the filter column was selected to be layered and each layer was aerated separately to keep the bac particles in a semi fluidization fluctuation state it is speculated that the air bubbles in the wastewater will collide with the bac particles during the operation of the multi layer bac filter and the surface of the aging biofilm will fall off at the same time the accumulation of biological and non biological substances will not occur due to the increase of the gap between the carbon particles in addition the non suspended metabolites will gradually settle at the bottom of the filter and can be discharged through the sludge discharge port at the bottom therefore the design concept of the multi layer bac filter in this study is that backwashing is not required in this study the adsorption and biodegradation performance of the multi layer bac filter for low concentration organic pollutants were discussed phenolic compounds which are difficult to biodegrade are used as carbon sources for the growth and propagation of microorganisms and the deep denitrification of wastewater the reaction mechanism was analyzed from three aspects a the changes of effluent organic matter nh4 n and tn during the reaction process were analyzed b the changes in the pore size structure of the bac were researched c the distribution of the microbial community in the bac reactor was analyzed the adsorption capacity of bac would be exhausted sooner or later affecting the removal of pollutants under the premise of not adding any chemical agents the method of carbon change with the least amount of carbon was explored which effectively improved the utilization rate of bac at present the newly issued discharge standards for water pollutants in chemical industry db32 939 2020 in jiangsu province china is more strict on the discharge of wastewater by chemical enterprises producing chemical materials which requires chemical oxygen demand cod 50 mg l nh4 n 5 mg l and tn 15 mg l this research proved its feasibility for the application of advanced wastewater treatment and process upgrading and transformation in such chemical enterprises which provided reference technology for the implementation of practical projects 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the carbon material used in the experiment was coal made activated carbon with a diameter of 1 5 mm an iodine value of 1100 mg g and an average surface area of 1071 m2 g it was purchased from lvzhiyuan activated carbon co ltd the wastewater in this study was obtained from a chemical enterprise producing phenolic resin in jiangsu province it was the actual wastewater treated by aerobic activated sludge the main components of the wastewater were organic matter with chemical oxygen demand determined by potassium dichromate method codcr and dissolved organic carbon doc as the analytical indexes nh4 n tn phenol and the concentration of salt and chloride ions were high the water quality parameters of the wastewater were as follows codcr was 140 mg l doc was 53 mg l nh4 n was 2 44 mg l tn was 16 5 mg l ph was 8 68 phenol was 2 6 mg l salt content was 1100 mg l chloride ion was 232 mg l the inoculated sludge used for activated carbon was obtained from aerobic activated sludge of the same enterprise with a concentration of 2 g l 2 2 experimental setup and operation the experimental device was made of acrylic glass with an inner diameter of 8 cm a height of 45 cm an effective volume of 1 85 l and a filling rate of about 45 the specific structure of the device was shown in fig 1 in the reaction zone a filler layer was set every 4 cm from bottom to top and the height of each filler layer was 3 cm previous researches reported that the upward flow operation mode of the bac filter had a higher removal efficiency for organic matter in industrial wastewater than the downward flow 21 and it was easier to operate therefore considering comprehensively the upward flow water flow mode was adopted in the filter in this study considering the particularity of water quality to alleviate the adverse effects that may be brought to microorganisms intermittent inlet water was selected program run for 10 min pause for 10 min studies confirmed that intermittent flow did not significantly affect removal performance 22 aeration was set between each packing layer intermittent aeration program run for 2 h pause for 0 5 h each aeration pipe was controlled by the valve separately and the aeration flow rate was gradually reduced from bottom to top to maintain the dissolved oxygen do at 4 6 mg l a water intake was set between every two carbon layers for a total of six water intakes the inoculation method was to put the activated carbon into the activated sludge and make sufficient contact by aeration to make the microorganisms attached the sludge discharge port was arranged at the bottom of the filter the water temperature was controlled at 30 c 20 g bac was placed in each packing layer of the filter and the five layers were 100 g bac in total when the aeration was opened the effect of bubbles would make each layer of filler in a semi fluidized state which was not easy to block and could reduce the loss of head membrane hanging and acclimation should be started before filter start up at the stage of membrane hanging the inoculated activated carbon was put into the filter and synthetic wastewater was used as the influent synthetic wastewater was composed of glucose ammonium chloride potassium dihydrogen phosphate and some trace elements such as copper zinc manganese and so on the effluent water quality was measured regularly until it was stable indicating that the membrane hanging was successful 23 in the acclimation stage the actual wastewater was added to the synthetic wastewater and the dosage of the actual wastewater was gradually increased according to the ratio of 2 1 1 1 and 1 2 when the influent was all actual wastewater and the effluent was stable the acclimation ended 2 3 experimental arrangement 1 controlled experiment three experiment systems were established for comparison to confirm the advantages of the bac system in removing hardly biodegradable pollutants from low concentration phenolic chemical wastewater first adsorption and biodegradation experiment of activated carbon immobilized with bacteria 100 g of inoculated and acclimated bac was added to the filter and the influent flow rate was 125 ml h the influent procedure was provided in part 2 2 and sampled every 4 h second bacteria without activated carbon as a control experiment control bacteria microbial suspension was obtained from the acclimated bac column by the method described in lu s research 24 then the microbial suspension was added to autoclaved raw water and the operation was performed according to the same degree third activated carbon adsorption alone without bacteria as a control experiment control carbon 100 g gac was added to a sterile filter and the procedure was the same 2 bac experiment five sets of identical experimental equipment were prepared one group studied the long term wastewater treatment performance of bac and tested the change of effluent water quality the other group studied carbon replacement methods and calculated the minimum amount of carbon used details were provided in parts 3 4 and 3 6 the remaining three sets of experimental setups were investigated for backwashing details were provided in part 3 2 2 4 water quality analysis in this research routine water quality parameters such as codcr nh4 n tn and ph were determined according to the standard method 25 doc was determined by the total organic carbon analyzer toc l cph shimadzu japan after the filtration with a 0 45 Î¼m pore size filter membrane 2 5 pore size distribution analysis automatic surface area and porosity analyzer bet autosorb iq quantachrome instruments usa was used to determine the specific surface area and pore size distribution of activated carbon the samples were ground into powder and dried since the nitrogen adsorption method was a method with higher accuracy and better stability at present 26 nitrogen 77 k was used as an adsorbent to draw nitrogen adsorption isotherms and analyze the distribution of micropores and mesopores 2 6 microbial community analysis during the stable period microbial samples in bac filters were collected and stored at 80 c the microbial community composition was analyzed by high throughput sequencing technology based on 16s rrna gene sequence dna was extracted from the samples using a kit fast dna spin kit for soil m p u s primers 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 were selected for v3 v4 region gene amplification 27 after pcr amplification was completed the products were recovered using the axypreptm dna gel extraction kit axygen biosciences union city u s eluted with tris hcl buffer and determined by 2 agarose gel electrophoresis then pcr products were quantified with the quantifluor st blue fluorescence quantification system promega purified products were sequenced on the miseq pe300 platform of illumina company and then analyzed for microbial community diversity based on otu clustering results 3 results and discussion 3 1 treatment efficiency of bac filter for organic matter nh4 n and tn the changes in removal efficiency of organic matter nh4 n and tn in the three experimental systems are shown in fig 2 the curves of codcr and doc showed that activated carbon had a good adsorption effect on organic matter in low concentration chemical wastewater but the removal efficiency of organic matter in this wastewater was generally lower than 5 when bacteria degrade alone indicating that most of the remaining organic matter in the wastewater treated by the aerobic tank was difficult to biodegrade however the removal efficiency of codcr and doc by activated carbon immobilized with bacteria was about 80 at this stage through the above three groups of experiments two points were proved first the removal efficiency of organic matter by bac decreased slowly with time which was inconsistent with the behavior of removing organic matter by activated carbon alone indicating the occurrence of bioregeneration second it is feasible to use the bac system to treat the hardly biodegradable organic matter at present the removal mechanism of the hardly biodegradable organic matter can be explained as follows the hardly biodegradable organic matter molecules in the liquid phase are adsorbed to the micropores or biofilms of bac and some substances are then diffused from the pores to the inner surface of biofilms and then converted into biodegradable substances by extracellular microorganisms related to micropores 28 to adapt to the environment microorganisms can produce corresponding inducible enzymes these enzymes are involved in metabolic reactions to help microorganisms degrade organic matter and ensure the normal growth of cells in the metabolic process 24 in addition previous studies have shown that glucose easily induces the production of filamentous microorganisms 29 filamentous microorganisms might be generated in the filter due to the use of glucose feed during the initial membrane hanging stage filamentous microorganisms can decompose the benzene ring structure of the aromatic compounds 30 on the other hand microorganisms need enough time to degrade organic matter the contact time of organic matter with microorganisms is prolonged as it is adsorbed into the bac pores thus biologically inaccessible organic carbon is converted into biologically accessible organic carbon the curve of nh4 n is shown in fig 2b the removal efficiency of nh4 n in the activated carbon system was 0 while the removal efficiency of nh4 n in the microbial system and bac system which have similar removal behavior increased to stable over time this indicates that the removal of nh4 n in wastewater is not through the adsorption of activated carbon but depends on microbial degradation because of the presence of nitrifying bacteria in the bac system details were provided in part 3 5 it is speculated that the main removal mechanism of nh4 n is nitrification which is consistent with guo s reported results 31 however the curve change of tn was just the opposite the removal efficiency of tn in the microbial system was 0 while the removal efficiency of tn in the activated carbon system and bac system which have similar removal behavior gradually decreased with the extension of time this indicates that the removal of tn in wastewater mainly depends on activated carbon adsorption in the early stage of bac and microorganisms in this stage cannot achieve the purpose of nitrogen removal activated carbon can reduce tn by adsorbing dissolved organic nitrogen don 30 and no3 n 32 in the wastewater the bac system s removal of pollutants can be theoretically divided into three periods 1 adsorption dominated period a 0 40 days 2 transition from adsorption to biodegradation period b 40 65 days and 3 biodegradation dominated period c 65 90 days to determine the optimal hydraulic load that the bac filter can withstand the test was carried out in period a1 to increase the hydraulic load the water intake was in the order of 3 l d 1 5 days 4 l d 6 10 days 5 l d 11 15 days and 6 l d 16 18 days as shown in fig 3a when the water intake increased to 6 l d the removal efficiency of organic matter suddenly decreased from 69 29 to 42 86 and the h point appeared on the removal curve of codcr and doc when the water intake was restored to 5 l d again the organic matter removal efficiency also rose to 68 57 indicating that the optimal water intake of the bac filter was 5 l d the hydraulic load was 0 99 m3 m2 d and the hydraulic retention time was 4 8 h after the h point the bac filter was operated at a processing capacity of 5 l d the average removal efficiency of codcr decreased from 66 87 to 11 90 and the average removal efficiency of doc decreased from 67 19 to 11 83 when the bac filter was operated from period a to period c the removal efficiency of nh4 n was slightly lower at the beginning and then gradually stabilized at 40 60 the tn removal efficiency gradually decreased from 65 to 0 in the early stage and began to rise about 10 days later and finally stabilized at 20 30 in the early stage of adsorption the removal efficiency of organic matter could reach 60 90 which was also confirmed by the study of velten et al 33 the variation of codcr and doc curves was mainly because the organic matter was not only restricted by the adsorption capacity of activated carbon but also affected by the degradation capacity of microorganisms however the overall stability of the nh4 n curve was due to 1 it was not affected by the adsorption capacity of activated carbon and 2 the mass concentration of nh4 n in such wastewater was low 2 65 mg l which was not easy to be affected by hydraulic load in addition the tn removal efficiency decreased to 0 in the early stage probably because the adsorption of tn by bac reached saturation and there were no denitrifying microorganisms on the surface with the increase of running time the biofilm on the surface of activated carbon began to thicken forming a hypoxic zone and growing denitrifying bacteria denitrifying bacteria can convert no3 n and no2 n from activated carbon surface adsorption or microbial degradation into n2 therefore the tn removal curve indicated that denitrification occurred in the bac system and biological nitrogen removal was achieved the pollutant removal capacity of each part of the bac filter from bottom to top in different periods is shown in fig 3b in period a bac in the first layer had the strongest pollutant removal ability compared with other layers the removal efficiencies of organic matter nh4 n and tn in the first layer of bac were 42 12 38 79 and 11 81 respectively the first layer of bac played a dominant role in the operation of the whole filter followed by the second and third layers the removal efficiency of the top layer was low but it could also play a protective role since bac in the first layer was exposed to the highest concentration of pollutants its adsorption capacity was depleted first at the same time the biofilm on the bac surface grew thickest and covered the largest area making most of the surface pores disappear when the bac of the first layer fails the bac of other layers can still remove pollutants therefore to maximize the utilization of bac it is not necessary to replace all bacs with new ones but only part of them details were provided in part 3 4 3 2 backwashing when the removal efficiency of organic matter in the reactor effluent was significantly reduced backwashing experiments were performed to determine whether backwashing was necessary using codcr as the evaluation index backwashing was carried out when the removal efficiency of codcr dropped to 60 and 40 each packing layer of the reactor is provided with a stainless steel screen cover when the filler expands it will be intercepted by the net cover therefore there is no need to worry about the loss caused by the excessive expansion rate of the filler the maximum expansion rate of the packing in the reactor was 25 summary of relevant studies and engineering experience 34 35 bac filter column backwashing expansion rate of 25 30 has the best effect backwashing intensity should not only ensure that the aging biofilm on the bac and some contaminants are removed but also make the bac retain a certain amount of biomass for most bac filter columns with 1 2 m thickness the strength of air flushing is 10 18 l s m2 and that of water flushing is 6 15 l s m2 due to the low thickness of the filter column in this research a low flushing intensity was selected the flushing strength ensures that the expansion rate of the packing is close to 25 table 1 lists the different backwash schemes fig 4 illustrates the codcr removal efficiency of the bac within 96 h after backwashing when the removal efficiency of codcr dropped to 60 and 40 backwashing was performed according to schemes 1 and 2 the changing trend of codcr removal efficiency was largely consistent with that of the experimental group without backwashing however the removal efficiency of codcr in scheme 3 decreased significantly which was speculated to be due to the loss of biomass caused by excessive flushing it was experimentally proved that backwashing could not improve the removal efficiency of organic matter by bac the reduced removal efficiency of organic matter is not due to the blockage of the bac filter column but rather to the decrease of the bac adsorption capacity it also demonstrates that the reactor designed in this study will not cause the blockage problem therefore it is judged that the reactor design is efficient and no backwashing is required during operation 3 3 bac pore size distribution changes the bac pore size distribution with time and height was analyzed by measuring the upper middle and lower height samples in three periods it can also be seen from the change in pore size distribution that bac plays the largest role in the first layer as shown in table 2 compared with the surface characteristics of the original gac such as specific surface area micropore volume mesoporous volume etc all indicators of bac in the first layer decreased the most the change in the decreasing efficiency of bac s specific surface area micropore area and pore volume in different periods was similar to the change in pollutant removal efficiency the results indicated that the pore size distribution characteristics could also be used as a potential indicator to illustrate the adsorption performance and microbial activity in addition the area and volume of micropores pore size range 0 4 2 nm changed most significantly compared with mesoporous pore size range 2 50 nm the results indicated that the adsorption and biodegradation reactions mainly occurred in the microporous region it has been reported that the adsorption of activated carbon on phenol and other small molecules is concentrated in the micropores 36 37 resulting in the accumulation of substrates and nutrients needed for microbial growth in the micropores therefore it is speculated that the carbon material with a larger proportion of micropores is more conducive to the treatment of wastewater containing small molecules the changes in micropore volume with time and height were analyzed the pore volume decline rates in period a were 16 03 layer 1 12 20 layer 3 and 10 29 layer 5 respectively in period b they were 25 36 layer 1 22 25 layer 3 and 20 81 layer 5 respectively in period c they were 32 78 layer 1 27 27 layer 3 and 25 60 layer 5 respectively it showed that the decrease rates of micropore volume in the three periods decreased along the height and the micropore volume in the upper layer was larger than that in the lower layer consequently it can be inferred that the lower bac can be replaced with the upper bac if fails which can prolong the service time of the bac system and enhance the removal efficiency of organic matter 3 4 research for bac replacement in this research the effluent quality after advanced treatment of wastewater was aimed at meeting the discharge standards of water pollutants in chemical industry db32 939 2020 of jiangsu province china the advanced treatment of this kind of chemical wastewater took the organic matter as the main target so the carbon replacement experiment aimed to meet the cod 50 mg l in the standard in this experiment a small amount of powdered activated carbon pac was used to adsorb bac effluent to ensure that the effluent quality reached the standard the amount of pac depends on the concentration of organic pollutants in bac effluent therefore it is very important to determine the correct carbon replacement time of the bac filter as shown in fig 6a there was a turning point t in the trend line of codcr removal efficiency in period b and the slope of the trend line after the t point was greater than that before the t point this indicated that the removal efficiency of codcr decreased faster after the t point and the biodegradation was gradually occupying the dominant role therefore to reduce the amount of pac used in the later stage of the treatment process it was more appropriate to choose carbon replacement at the t point at the point of t the codcr removal efficiency was 42 85 i e the effluent codcr was 80 mg l the adsorption experiment of pac demonstrated that the codcr could be reduced to 38 mg l by adding 0 1 g l pac to the wastewater with 80 mg l codcr for 0 5 h this method possesses a low cost and meets the requirements of emission standards on the other hand the carbon replacement method has a great effect on the improvement of bac utilization the carbon replacement process of this investigation is shown in fig 5 the first bac layer was removed in which the adsorption capacity was greatly reduced and the second third fourth and fifth layers were moved down the new bac was added to the top thus forming a new five layer bac filter after carbon replacement the effluent codcr concentration decreased but it began to rise again 4 days later until it exceeded 80 mg l 8 days later fig 6b it was speculated that the initial decrease of codcr concentration was due to the addition of new bac which improved the adsorption capacity of the filter while the rapid increase of codcr concentration to the point of b might be because the biodegradation rate was much less than the adsorption rate the reason for the weakened microbial degradation efficiency is speculated to be two points first most of the organic matter was adsorbed and degraded by the first layer of bac before carbon replacement leaving less organic matter in the following layers the nutrients required for microbial metabolism were insufficient resulting in reduced biological activity or even death second there are some toxic substances in such chemical wastewater such as phenols and aldehydes long term exposure of microorganisms to these substances might lead to adverse effects on biological activities therefore the remaining layers of the old bac need to be supplemented with microorganisms after replacing the new bac to prove the hypothesis that the removal efficiency of codcr decreases rapidly due to the lack of microorganisms the investigation carried out microbial supplementation experiment on bac at different heights for 5 consecutive days this experiment supplemented microorganisms by adding activated sludge to be close to the actual engineering and easy to operate after microbial supplementation the concentration of effluent codcr decreased from 84 2 mg l point e to 56 5 mg l and then gradually increased and the increasing rate was slower than that before microbial supplementation 60 65 days fig 6b with the concentration of codcr below 80 mg l as the boundary the phase i was maintained for 8 days and the phase ii was maintained for 16 days indicating that it was necessary to supplement the filter with microorganisms after carbon replacement to determine the optimal dosage of microorganisms 2 ml of inoculated activated sludge concentration of 2 g l was added daily to the four layers of 2 1 3 2 4 3 and 5 4 from day 65 the change in the codcr removal efficiency of bac effluent in each layer was used to judge whether the microorganisms were sufficient as shown in table 3 the optimal activated sludge dosage for layer 2 1 layer 3 2 layer 4 3 and layer 5 4 were 16 mg 12 mg 12 mg and 8 mg respectively 3 5 microbial community analysis in the bac filter the first layer had the highest pollutant removal efficiency while the pollutant removal efficiency of the second to the fifth layer decreased gradually but there was little difference to determine the distribution of dominant bacteria in bac filters and the differences of microorganisms before and after carbon replacement first to third layers of bac were selected to determine microbial communities activated carbon inoculated sludge a0 was obtained from the activated sludge in the aerobic tank of the chemical plant and the wastewater of the experiment was the effluent of the same aerobic tank therefore bac and inoculated sludge had a certain degree of similarity in microbial composition according to the venn diagram analysis of species the otu number of inoculated sludge was 1291 and the otu numbers of bac in the first layer b1 second layer b2 and third layer b3 were 1449 1440 and 1361 respectively the common otu of a0 and b1 was 885 accounting for 68 55 of a0 the common otu of a0 and b2 was 804 accounting for 62 28 of a0 the common otu of a0 and b3 was 731 accounting for 56 62 of a0 it was found that the similarity between the microorganisms on the bac and the microorganisms in the a0 gradually decreased along the height direction presumably because the composition and concentration of pollutants in the wastewater exposed to each bac layer were different the microbial community distribution of the four samples at the phylum level is shown in fig 7 and those with relative abundance 0 01 were classified as others the main phyla of a0 at the phylum level were proteobacteria with a proportion of 30 75 followed by actinobacteriota 18 88 patescibacteria 11 76 and chloroflexi 9 18 after acclimation in a low nutrient concentration environment proteobacteria showed the most obvious changes proteobacteria in b1 b2 and b3 increased from 30 75 to about 50 this indicated that proteobacteria was the most abundant one in the bac filter similar studies have previously confirmed that proteobacteria is the dominant phyla in the bac system 38 39 although proteobacteria was the dominant phyla on both inoculated sludge and bac its relative abundance was markedly different this indicated that proteobacteria contained numerous microorganisms related to the degradation of complex organic matter and the increase of its abundance enhanced the removal ability of organic matter in the bac system proteobacteria also includes some nitrifying bacteria and nitrogen fixing bacteria which play an important role in removing organic carbon and nh4 n in wastewater 40 in this study the presence of nitrospirota in three bac samples demonstrated that nitrification occurred in the bac filter the abundance of nitrospirota in the b1 sample was higher than that of b2 and b3 which might be because the concentration of nh4 n in the influent water contacted by b1 was higher than that of the latter two however there was no significant difference in the abundance of nitrospirota which presumably was due to the low concentration of nh4 n in raw water 2 65 mg l the abundance of bacteroidota in the three bac samples was lower than a0 which was speculated to be because of the low concentration of organic matter that could be utilized by bacteroidota in the wastewater treated by an aerobic tank bacteroidetes bacteria belong to heterotrophic bacteria which can participate in the cycle of organic carbon and protein in wastewater 41 since the number of species of b1 at the genus level was 473 which was larger than that of b2 463 and b3 446 b1 had the most abundant species to further analyze the changes of bacterial species during the transition from high organic matter concentration to low organic matter concentration environment b1 and a0 were compared the relative distribution of the first 36 bacterial genera is shown in fig 8 when the organic matter concentration was 500 mg l the dominant bacteria of a0 were unclassified o micrococcales norank f norank o saccharimonadales and nakamurella pseudorhodoplanes mesorhizobium and pseudolabrys became the dominant species when the organic matter concentration was reduced to 140 mg l and most of the substances were difficult to degrade compared with a0 the relative abundance of at least 10 species in alphaproteobacteria was increased in b1 some researchers have demonstrated that alphaproteobacteria is competitive in low organic matter environment and can degrade complex organic compounds 42 43 consequently it is speculated that the existence of alphaproteobacteria is very important for the removal of low concentration of hardly biodegradable organic compounds other studies have also reported that alphaproteobacteria contributes to doc removal 44 in addition gammaproteobacteria contains a large number of denitrifying bacteria 45 such as pseudomonas which is a common bacterial genus in the denitrifying system and has a high tolerance after acclimation the relative abundance of most bacteria in gammaproteobacteria increased which explained the increased denitrification capacity of the bac system described in part 3 1 above the dominance of proteobacteria in the bac filter was further proved by the analysis of microbial genera there were nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria in the bac system and the removal efficiencies of nh4 n and tn existed simultaneously in part 3 1 which proved that nitrification and denitrifying occurred simultaneously in the same reactor this result was also confirmed in the treatment of livestock wastewater 46 the difference test of microbial communities at the phylum level on bac at the same height before and after carbon replacement is shown in fig 9 the first 15 phyla b1 and b2 1 had significant differences in 13 bacterial phyla p 0 05 fig 9a b2 and b3 2 had significant differences in 14 bacterial phyla p 0 05 fig 9b b3 and b4 3 had significant differences in 13 bacterial phyla p 0 001 fig 9c the results showed that the bacterial phyla on bac at the same height were significantly different before and after carbon replacement at the same time it could also explain the reason for the difference in organic matter removal ability before and after carbon replacement after carbon replacement the removal efficiency of organic matter by b2 1 was 35 71 which was lower than that of b1 41 12 period a the reasons why the removal efficiency cannot be restored to the previous best state may be first the adsorption capacity is different due to the different adsorption time second even if the concentration of organic nutrients in the environment is increased and microorganisms are supplemented the difference of microbial phylum between on bac at the same height before and after carbon replacement cannot be eliminated 3 6 statistical carbon usage assuming that the daily treatment water volume of chemical wastewater is 100 m3 the raw water is directly treated with gac and only 6 l of water can be treated with 100 g carbon to meet the standard requirements through calculation 100 m3 wastewater needs about 1 67 t of carbon and the annual carbon consumption needs 600 t calculated by 360 days a year which is a huge cost if pac is used to treat raw water the dosage needs 1 g l and the reaction can reach the discharge standard for 1 h it is calculated that the annual carbon consumption needs 36 t and the annual carbon consumption decreases by 94 compared with gac however using bac to treat wastewater the annual carbon consumption is less in this part different carbon consumption of three carbon replacement methods for bac are calculated table 4 3 when effluent cod 50 mg l all 100 g carbon is replaced 4 when effluent cod 80 mg l all 100 g carbon will be replaced and bac effluent with 50 mg l cod 80 mg l will be adsorbed by a small amount of pac 5 when effluent cod 80 mg l only 20 g of 100 g carbon is replaced the first layer and then 20 g carbon is replaced every 24 days the effluent of bac with 50 mg l cod 80 mg l is treated by pac the results show that the annual carbon consumption calculated by method 5 is the least which decreases by 98 40 and 73 31 compared with method 1 and method 2 respectively 4 conclusion in this research a multi layer bac filter was used to treat low concentration phenolic chemical wastewater in depth the results showed that the removal efficiencies of organic matter and tn were 75 85 and 20 30 respectively by both activated carbon adsorption and biodegradation however the removal of nh4 n only depended on biodegradation and the removal efficiency was about 45 to 55 the analysis of pollutant removal efficiency along the height of the filter indicated that the first layer played a major role in the bac filter so the first layer failed first replacing part of the old carbon could maximize the bac utilization after wastewater treatment specific surface area and total pore volume of bac decreased and micropore volume decreased the most compared with mesoporous volume indicating that adsorption and biodegradation reactions on bac mainly concentrated in the micropore region the lowest layer of activated carbon was replaced when the removal efficiency of pollutants by the bac filter decreased significantly meanwhile the whole filter column was moved down and new carbon was added to the upper layer the research revealed that this method of carbon replacement could effectively improve the removal efficiency of organic matter but it needed to meet the requirements of adding the appropriate amount of microorganisms to the old carbon while adding new carbon in addition this carbon replacement method could maximize the utilization of bac the minimum annual carbon consumption was not 10 t based on the wastewater treatment capacity of 100 m3 d high throughput sequencing results showed that the dominant genera in bac were pseudorhodoplanes mesorhizobium and pseudolabrys in the environment of low concentration of hardly biodegradable organic matter and all that belonged to proteobacteria the microbial phylum level analysis revealed that bacteria phylum on bac at the same height was significantly different before and after carbon replacement and this difference did not change with the increase of organic matter concentration and the addition of microorganisms declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

12648,rural domestic sewage rds is one of the foremost obstacles to achieving several global sustainable development goals to identify and further drive future development in rds treatment bibliometric software vosviewer citespace and the bibliometrix package in r was used to analyze 512 relevant papers between 1991 and 2022 the results indicated an increasing trend in rds related publications with china demonstrating the fastest growth in publications and close collaborations with the us and canada the authors keyword co occurrence network analysis revealed that the current research directions in rds are efficient treatment technologies resource recovery based on source separation and ecological risks associated with rds constructed wetlands are the most widely used option for treating rds and can be combined with other treatment technologies in addition the source separation of rds and its resourceful use have attracted widespread interest however the process must consider the potential ecological risks of emerging contaminants ecs especially antibiotic residues future research directions are mainly focused on 1 establishing a comprehensive evaluation framework for rds treatment facilities 2 exploring in depth the technologies and strategies for source separation and resource utilisation of rds and 3 assessing the removal of ecs and related ecological risks overall this review will contribute to the identification of current research trends provide insight into rds treatment and resource recovery and further promote the development of

children s fund unicef in 2021 jointly report that 616 million people worldwide live in environments lacking access to sewage sanitation and 92 live in rural settlements 1 due to a lack of investment and research the coverage of wastewater treatment facilities in rural areas lags far behind that in urban areas 2 the direct discharge of untreated human excreta and domestic sewage can seriously affect surface and groundwater 3 4 leading to ecological degradation of the regional environment and poses health risks 5 in china only 13 34 of all rural domestic sewage rds is treated efficiently 6 for this reason rds treatment is a priority for improving rural habitats and a major challenge for achieving global sustainable development goals sdgs 7 8 compared to municipal domestic sewage rds has unique characteristics such as small size wide distribution large polluted area intermittent discharge and a large coefficient of variation in water quality and quantity 9 therefore unlike urban

biological ecological biological biological and ecological ecological 6 these technologies are widely used in treating rds but do not achieve effective resource recovery from sewage in recent years many researchers have proposed the concept of source separated rds treatment based on resource recovery that is the separation of sewage from its source grey water gw from kitchens laundry etc and black water bw from toilets 15 17 bw accounts for only 1 2 of the total rds but is the main source of nitrogen n and phosphorus p contributing 90 of the n and 80 of the p to the rds 18 gw accounts for 50 80 of the total rds and has a low level of contamination 19 bw separation avoids dilution by gw and facilitates the recovery of nutrients n and p and biogas ch4 20 21 separated and simply treated gw can be reused for irrigation and toilet flushing 22 23 existing research has demonstrated that source separation of bw and gw and treatment for recovery are more beneficial than treating a mixture of the two 24 25 the reason for this is that source separated bw with high contaminant concentrations is more beneficial for energy recovery as well as nutrient recovery from bio based fertiliser production gw with low pollutant concentrations is more conducive to water recovery for irrigation moreover source separated facilities for rds treatment are superior in terms of sewage reuse and life cycle impact 26 source separation based resource recovery from the rds is in line with the concept of sustainable development however many factors must be considered in the process of resource recovery from rds for instance the feasibility of the technology acceptability of recovered resources and potential ecological risks unfortunately emerging contaminants ecs such as hormones drug residues and microplastics mps have been widely detected in rds in recent years 27 28 the presence of these pollutants can affect the efficiency of rds treatment facilities 29 and hinder the utilisation of sewage resources 30 existing studies on the removal of ecs and their ecological risks are somewhat controversial studies have shown that wastewater containing novel pollutants antibiotics poses a reduced ecological risk to the surface water environment after treatment with cws 31 32 in contrast some studies have indicated limited efficacy in removing antibiotics from wastewater in wastewater treatment facilities which may have potential adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems 33 34 ecs that are not fully treated can flow into receiving waters or enter agricultural fields through irrigation and spread through the food chain to organisms at higher trophic levels thus posing a potential threat to regional ecology 35 therefore rds treatment technologies for the removal of conventional and emerging pollutants and resource based wastewater recovery processes require further in depth analyses most published reviews are limited to one specific rds treatment technology e g cw 36 multi soil layering systems 6 biogas engineering 37 and additional growth processes 38 while no review has been conducted to provide a comprehensive review of rds particularly the resource based recovery of rds and its potential ecological risk analysis therefore a systematic and comprehensive review covering all current research trends in rds is necessary bibliometric analysis has proven to be a useful tool for visually analysing a large amount of relevant published research data in a particular field providing accurate insight into the current state of research and future trends to guide contemporary research efforts 39 40 therefore this review begins with a bibliometric analysis of the annual growth of rds research publications the most influential countries institutions highly cited papers author keyword co occurrence networks thematic evolution analysis and the main research areas of all rds publications with the aim of providing a holistic overview this was followed by a detailed description and discussion of the identified hotspots at the end of this review current challenges and future perspectives of rds research are presented the aim of our work is to provide an objective and comprehensive review of research in the field of rds and to offer new perspectives for future research 2 bibliometric analysis 2 1 data collection and preprocessing literature on rds was obtained from the web of science wos core collection database the results were retrieved on 25 february 2022 using the search equations of ts rural or countryside or village and ts domestic sewage or domestic wastewater or household sewage or household wastewater or black water or blackwater or gray water or graywater or greywater or grey water or brown water the resultant original data were further filtered using document types articles and reviews and languages english after screening 512 raw records met the selection criteria for further analyses then full records and cited references of related publications were saved in the txt format including data on title authors affiliations abstract keywords citation count journals publication time document type and categories to improve bibliometric analysis it is necessary to recalculate synonymous and synonymous words in the co occurrence analysis of keywords keywords were pre processed according to the method described by zhu et al 41 the most relevant terms were selected manually to eliminate duplicates singular or plural forms synonyms and abbreviations and to determine keywords for the final analysis bibliometric analysis of the rds research was conducted using microsoft office excel 2016 the bibliometrix package r language citespace version 5 8 r3 and vosviewer version 1 6 18 leiden university netherlands the review analysis process is illustrated in fig 1 the dataset was explored using vosviewer software in which authors and research collaboration networks as well as co occurrence network maps of author keywords were constructed the bibliometrix package r language was used for global collaboration analysis and thematic evolution analysis citespace software was used for keyword burst detection analysis 2 2 primary evaluation of publications after the screening process the results indicated that the first publication on rds was published in 1991 a new energy efficient membrane bioreactor suitable for rural or sparsely populated areas has been developed and has shown considerable potential 42 as shown in fig 2a the number of publications on rds treatment has increased since 2005 over the past decade the number of articles published has increased from 14 in 2012 to 75 in 2021 the number of citations of these publications has also increased according to statistics research in this field has generated considerable interest in asian countries where the total number of published articles far exceeds that of other countries fig s1a in 1991 japan published its first academic paper in this field the usa has the second highest number of publications worldwide while india ranks third although china has the most research papers it started research in this field relatively late nearly 10 years later than developed countries such as the usa japan and the uk fig s1b in the 21st century china has started paying attention to the issue of rural environmental protection in 2005 2008 there was a nascent stage of rds treatment with 2 44 of all publications 2008 2015 was the initial development stage with 24 88 of articles after 2015 the rapid development stage in which the number of articles accounted for 72 68 fig s1b international cooperation in the field of rds has become increasingly close in recent years china was most involved in international cooperation which was the most intensive with 42 links among them china has a more extensive cooperation with the usa and canada fig 2b the top ten most cited academic papers in the field of rds are listed table s2 half of these were published prior to 2010 and 40 of the authors were affiliated with chinese universities more importantly half of the articles focused on cw technology with relevant articles appearing from 2003 to 2016 43 47 this demonstrates that cw is a popular choice among researchers interested in treating rds in addition the top ten most frequently cited papers also included studies on the effects of rds on groundwater and surface water 48 49 antibiotics in rds related to resistance genes 50 and the impact of rural greywater irrigation reuse on soil and plants 51 2 3 co occurrence analysis of keywords vosviewer was used to visualise the keyword co occurrence networks the co occurrence network of the author keywords at least two occurrences is shown in fig 3 domestic sewage was the keyword for the subject search therefore domestic sewage was the most frequently used keyword followed by constructed wetland keywords related to constructed wetlands include vertical flow and phragmites australis vertical flow is a form of constructed wetland whereas phragmites australis is commonly used in constructed wetlands 52 much of the research on rds has focused on treating rural sewage thus sewage treatment is an influential keyword technologies related to sewage treatment include constructed wetlands septic tank anaerobic digestion membrane reactor and vermifilter sewage treatment mainly involves the removal of nitrogen phosphorus heavy metals and pathogens author keywords were divided into seven categories fig 3 the first category was the red cluster which was composed of rural sewage spatial distribution principal component analysis and source apportionment the green cluster includes domestic sewage water quality nutrients groundwater quality nitrogen phosphorus and pathogens the red and green clusters focused mostly on the impact and evaluation of domestic sewage on surface water and groundwater quality and the spatial distribution and source apportionment of pollution sources the blue and yellow clusters mainly indicate research concentration on the source separation of domestic sewage and resource recovery for instance the keywords greywater water reuse blackwater and septic tank are in the yellow cluster and the keywords rds biogas source separation and nutrient recovery are in the blue cluster the fifth purple cluster consists of constructed wetlands nitrogen removal phosphorus removal nitrification and denitrification which indicates that this cluster is mainly concerned with research on cw for nitrogen and phosphorus removal as shown in fig s2 during the period 2010 2020 scholars focused on source separated rds treatment sustainable sanitation removal of ecs and evaluation of rds treatment technologies currently scholars are working on decentralized and sustainable sanitation based on source separation and evaluation of sewage treatment technologies in terms of economics the development and application of rds treatment technologies provide a basis for the future sustainability of rural ecosystems 2 4 thematic evolution analysis a thematic map which groups the author s keywords according to the relevance and development degree of the research fields was obtained using the bibliometrix package the thematic map was divided into four quadrants 1 motor themes 2 niche themes 3 emerging or declining themes and 4 basic themes 53 as shown in fig s3a the keywords water quality groundwater principal component analysis and groundwater quality are considered to be sporting themes these have high density and high centrality and are important and developed themes in the field in contrast greywater rural areas water reuse and irrigation were mainly related to greywater reuse nitrogen phosphorus nutrients and pathogens are mainly pollutants to be removed domestic sewage rural biogas and sanitation are mainly related to source separation for blackwater treatment constructed wetlands nitrogen removal denitrification and nitrification are mainly related to the removal of nitrogen from cws these directions can be considered basic themes with low density and high centrality which are important to the research field and require more research and analysis further research on these keywords may turn them into motor themes 54 rds microbial community removal efficiency and nutrient removal are mainly related to microbial removal mechanisms this research direction spans emerging and fading themes as well as basic themes suggesting that these themes are emerging the second quadrant is well developed but is not important for the focal field thematic evolution analysis has been used to identify quantify and visualise the thematic evolution of a specific research field in recent years 55 cws represent a more traditional in situ treatment technology for rds treatment and have been used until now in 2006 2010 water quality and sanitation in rural areas received increasing attention and in 2011 2015 the focus began to change to the reuse and irrigation of sewage after 2016 the analysis of surface and groundwater pollution and the removal mechanisms of pollutants mainly n including microbial communities became the focus fig s3b 2 5 keyword burst detection analysis identifying and detecting short term burst keywords enables the analysis of rapidly growing topics thereby increasing the understanding of research themes in recent years the top 20 keywords with the highest citation burst intensities are listed in table s3 the earliest cited keyword in the burst is activated sludge 1 31 which disappeared after 6 years of research the next most cited keyword is on site treatment 1993 2005 which was a focus for the longest time with 13 years in 2010 2015 only one sudden burst of keywords horizontal subsurface flow was related to cws after 2016 a sudden burst of the keywords agricultural reuse emerging pollutant and antibiotic resistance genes emerged this burst suggests that researchers are becoming increasingly concerned about the emergence of novel pollutants in rds reuse and the production of antibiotic resistance genes args 3 analysis of current advances and research hotspots according to scientific bibliometric analysis research hotspots on rds have focused on three main topics 1 major technology for rds treatment 2 source separation based resource recovery from rds and 3 ecological risk assessment of rds the following section provides a detailed discussion of these three aspects of rds 3 1 major technology for rural domestic sewage treatment through literature analysis the main treatment processes for rds include biological ecological and combined treatments biological ecological ecological ecological and biological biological fig 4 in a recent study 131 engineering cases of rds treatment were collated from 2000 to 2021 the combined treatment process reached 75 57 and biological and ecological treatment technology 72 72 was the dominant technology for treating rds 6 nevertheless among ecological treatment technologies cws are the most commonly used far exceeding the use of stabilisation ponds and soil infiltration systems the analysis of the authors keywords also showed the importance of cw fig 3 in addition mbr 56 vermifiltration 57 ad and sts 12 were also identified by the co occurrence network of author keywords fig 3 as playing key roles in rds the advantages and disadvantages of different sewage treatment processes as well as the main principles of pollutant removal are compared in table 1 the various rds treatment processes are described in the following order according to the number of occurrences of the author s keywords cws are one of the most frequently used techniques for rds treatment fig 3 and are nature based solutions this technology treats pollutants through the synergistic physical chemical and biological actions of substrates plants and microbes 58 59 cws offer the advantages of simple operation and maintenance and their low cost makes them widely used for decentralized rds treatment 60 61 according to the form of water distribution and flow utilised cws are divided into horizontal flow cws hf cws vertical subsurface flow cws vf cws surface flow cws sf cws and integrated flow cws if cws 62 among them vf cws refer to the wastewater flow from the top or bottom of the system along the vertical direction adjusting the saturation state of the substrate layer can cause the wetland to form an aerobic anoxic environment this is conducive to the growth and reproduction of microbes making the vf cws superior to hf cws for total nitrogen tn removal 63 therefore this field has relatively more publications and keywords appear more frequently fig 3 fig 5 illustrates the basic components classification and removal mechanisms of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus in the cws the contribution of plants to pollutant removal in cws varies considerably from a minimum of 0 5 to a maximum of 40 0 for nitrogen removal 64 wetland substrate sorption suffers from saturation problems therefore microbes attached to the substrate play an important role in the pollutant removal process however cws often suffer from poor nitrification caused by low dissolved oxygen concentrations and incomplete denitrification owing to insufficient carbon sources to address the insufficiency of dissolved oxygen measures such as artificial aeration tidal operation models and drop aeration using topography have been proposed cws using tidal flow operations have been shown to promote oxygen supply with re oxygenation capacities of up to 350 g m2 d which can effectively improve nitrogen removal 65 in view of the challenging problem of low carbon to nitrogen ratios researchers have worked on the development of novel wetland substrates with electron donor substrates being favoured to date fe based materials pyrite magnetite fe carbon substrates etc 66 sulphur based materials monomeric sulphur etc 67 biomass carbon materials agricultural biomass etc and synthetic carbon sources phbv starch pcl mixtures etc have been used 68 most importantly wetland sites have also been selected with adequate consideration of physical geography and the use of topographic drop aeration can reduce energy consumption in addition constructed ditch wetlands 69 and vegetated drainage ditches 70 have been developed for treating rds the best cod 91 59 and tn 50 40 removal efficiencies were achieved with a combination of ditch and constructed wetlands table s4 69 anaerobic treatment is a promising option for decentralized sewage treatment based on the concept of sustainable development sts are the most utilised facilities for the anaerobic treatment of domestic wastewater in rural areas because of the inadequacy of sewerage network systems and were originally designed to remove the settling of solids grease and other floatable solids 71 72 however the use of three compartment sts alone is not effective in removing contaminants and human associated pathogens and in preventing antibiotic resistance fig 4b 28 considerable research has focused on st renovations to enhance the treatment effectiveness of sts the main focus has been on the following aspects 1 modifying the structure of sts and the flow direction of the effluent to enhance ad 73 74 2 adding media layers to sts to enhance the removal of pollutants 75 3 combining sts with other treatment technologies 76 77 to develop innovative functional sts designing and optimizing novel sts to improve their treatment performance and life cycle is imperative to address the backwardness of wastewater treatment and achieve sustainable development in rural areas our group has developed a worm bed septic tank that solves the problem of secondary pollution caused by the process of emptying and transferring fecal sludge and also improves the efficiency of wastewater treatment biogas digesters are an important application of the anaerobic digestion process and another promising technology for treating rds as they enable the recovery of resources while treating wastewater 78 biogas projects are widely used in the rural areas of china and the government strongly promotes the establishment of biogas digesters 37 it can solve the energy shortage in rural areas and reduce environmental pollution which is conducive to sustainable development and has huge potential for development ch4 is a product of the anaerobic digestion process therefore improving heat and mass transfer efficiency maximising biogas production and effectively recovering it are the focus of current research 79 msl systems represent a new soil based technology that improves the inherent capacity of soil by improving its internal structure fig 4c msl systems have been developed for decentralized domestic wastewater treatment in rural areas 80 the msl system consists of soil mixing blocks and permeable layers that function as saturated anaerobic and unsaturated aerobic zones respectively the entire msl system acts as a micro soil ecosystem with excellent pollutant removal performance 81 furthermore msl can be supplemented with specific substances such as iron sawdust and charcoal which can significantly increase microbial activity and promote denitrification 80 msl promoted the removal of bod 5 and tp under continuous aeration but the tn removal performance was poor however after aeration was stopped the tn removal rate increased significantly 82 mbr is a widely used biological treatment technology in rural areas that combines membrane separation with the traditional activated sludge method as a highly efficient wastewater treatment technology 11 mbr have the advantages of strong impact load resistance effective pollutant reduction small footprint and low sludge production table 1 mbr are the four typical technologies in one of the first rural wastewater treatment demonstration areas in china wuxi city however the high operating costs and frequent maintenance membrane fouling of mbrs during rds treatment limit their widespread application 83 the combination of mbr and a2 o was even more efficient in removing nitrogen 75 5 and phosphorus 64 1 fig 4a with low sludge production and high shock resistance 11 vermifiltration is a process whereby earthworms break down large molecule pollutants into smaller molecules that can be used by microbes to promote further pollutant degradation earthworms also alter the diversity of the microbial community forming a synergistic symbiosis with microbes to facilitate contaminant removal 84 in addition the earthworm s shuttle foraging avoids clogging keeps the filter bed in a better aerobic oxygen state and contributes to nitrification 85 vermifiltration combines earthworm and microbial activities and is a promising approach for rds treatment because of its clogging resistance lack of odor and reusability of the effluent fig 4d which is cost effective and ecological 86 88 wang et al 85 established a new three stage vermifiltration system for treating rds which showed good removal of cod 81 3 nh4 n 98 and tp 98 4 the effluent tn was mainly in the form of nitrate therefore further enhancement of nitrate removal has become the focus of future research subsurface wastewater infiltration systems swiss are nature based approaches for wastewater treatment which achieve purification through a synergistic process of filtration and adsorption microbial degradation and plant uptake 13 89 swiss have the advantages of easy maintenance low operating costs and good removal performance swiss with the novel niimi process are highly efficient in removing pollutants from sewage and the effluent can be reused 90 however there are still shortcomings in the construction and parameter adjustment of swis in decentralized rural sewage treatment processes especially for nitrogen removal 13 therefore the role of plants in the system must be further explored in depth and the application parameters of swis must be further defined as ecological treatment alone or biological treatment alone does not achieve the expected results by combining the two they can complement each other and this is widely adopted in practice 6 cws in combination with other treatment systems for treating rds are popular worldwide owing to the reduction in wetland clogging and area requirements sts are the most common pre treatment systems in rural areas making sts cws a common rds treatment combination sts cws are followed by sedimentation tanks cws ponds cws ad cws biofilters cws and hybrid cws 36 the sts cws were very effective in the removal of total suspended solids tss cod and bod with average removal rates of 87 4 89 0 and 92 8 respectively but relatively low removal of tn 60 7 and tp 66 3 36 gunes et al 91 employed a combined three compartment sts and sf cw process to treat domestic sewage in a turkish village long term monitoring results showed that the combined process achieved average removal efficiencies of 86 92 56 and 43 for tss bod tn and tp respectively therefore this process must be further enhanced to remove nitrogen and phosphorus gao and hu 92 reported a full scale combined biological contact oxidisation hf cw for rds treatment in a cold region of china with annual average final effluent concentrations of 22 40 8 58 and 2 09 mg l of cod nh4 n and tp respectively the combined system provides a large amount of reclaimed water for crop irrigation and decreases the consumption of groundwater resources fig 4e munavalli et al 93 demonstrated that a decentralized wastewater treatment system i e anaerobic baffle reactor abr if cw achieves good removal efficiency for cod 70 90 and total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn 40 65 from domestic sewage our group designed a full scale rds treatment facility in luo yi village guizhou china using a combination of an anaerobic digester and a cw process to meet the secondary standard of the rural domestic wastewater treatment facility water pollutant discharge standard db52 1424 2019 fig 4f economic indicators construction investment costs o m costs land occupation and economic efficiency are frequently decisive in the choice of rds treatment technology in practical situations the per capita economic income in rural areas is much lower than in urban areas and economically disadvantaged rural areas cannot afford the construction operation and maintenance costs of wastewater treatment budgetary constraints make it difficult to provide financial support for the operation of sewage treatment facilities therefore decentralized rds treatment facilities should be cost efficient table 2 presents the economic indicators of different rds treatment technologies in terms of comparative construction investment costs operation and maintenance costs land occupation and effluent stability 94 95 mbr have the smallest land areas but have higher construction investment and operation and management costs mainly influenced by the cost of the membrane modules cw and land purification systems have low investment and operation and management costs but have a large land occupation st and biogas digesters have low construction investment and operation and management costs and do not have a large footprint but are limited in their ability to remove pollutants therefore the cost effectiveness of the rds treatment must be considered the economics of rds treatment facilities and local pollutant discharge standards have been fully integrated 96 97 more importantly rural residents are often not particularly motivated to treat wastewater and are mostly reluctant to pay additional fees for rds treatment to motivate rural residents to treat sewage it is also desirable to consider whether wastewater treatment can yield economic environmental and ecological benefits simultaneously operation and maintenance costs can also be minimised through appropriate management and technical operations 98 source separated wastewater treatment systems that separate urine faeces and gw where faeces and urine are recycled as fertiliser and gw is treated and then recycled as reclaimed water are considered promising wastewater treatment approaches 26 3 2 source separation based resource recovery from rural domestic sewage domestic sewage consists of bw i e human urine faeces and flushing water and gw i e daily washing laundry and kitchen water 99 bw accounts for only 1 2 of the total volume of domestic wastewater but it contains the main pollutants of domestic wastewater of these carbon nitrogen phosphorus and potassium account for 60 of the total and bw also has a high content of pathogenic bacteria which requires considerable subsequent treatment 100 gw accounts for 50 80 of the total rds and has a low level of contamination 19 bw separation can recover resources either through biogas produced by anaerobic digestion or via the extraction of nutrients however gw can be used for non potable purposes consequently source separation transforms the entire wastewater management system including its collection treatment and quantification 101 the introduction of bw gw separation in rural areas may be a promising approach that facilitates the reduction of organic matter nutrients and pathogen loads in receiving water bodies most importantly the wastewater can be converted into a resource water reclamation wastewater treatment and resource and energy recovery have become major tasks in rural areas 102 fig 6 depicts alternative options for source separation based resource recovery in rural areas compared with the current situation reference system the source separation of bw can reduce the energy consumption in the wastewater treatment process and recover renewable resources fig 6 sts are widely used for treating rural bw but do not achieve good resource recovery 103 ad is the most commonly used treatment technology for bw converting organic matter into energy rich methane 104 105 and producing organic fertilisers that are high in nitrogen and phosphorus this makes anaerobic treatment the most promising future treatment technology from a sustainable perspective the development of biogas digesters as an alternative to sts for treating domestic wastewater and manure sludge was developed in the 1980s biogas digesters are usually built close to individual houses as they can provide biogas for households while the resulting digestate is then applied to farmland as an organic fertiliser this system addresses the disposal of biodegradable waste and the shortage of rural energy in developing countries 106 china s rural energy sector is actively promoting biogas digesters at all levels and the number of household biogas digesters reached 30 077 million in 2020 107 adding other wastes e g kitchen waste to bw for co digestion can increase methane production in ad systems 108 urine an important component of bw is more likely to recover nutrients than bw as a result the separation of urine sources for resource recovery has received increased attention urine consists mainly of water 90 organic compounds and inorganic salts 109 in the context of a circular economy and limited resources the source separation of urine can reclaim water and nutrients reduce the nutrient loads of wastewater treatment plants minimise treatment costs and be used directly as a fertiliser replacing 20 25 of commercial fertilisers 110 source separated urine can be reduced in volume by evaporation drying or struvite precipitation to facilitate transport or can be used directly as a liquid fertiliser to rural farmland this protects natural water bodies from sewage pollution and improves sanitation conditions and reduces water consumption 111 and creating a closed wastewater resource nexus can further increase crop yields fig 6 gw accounts for a large proportion of total domestic wastewater and is low in pathogens and pollutants therefore its reuse is gaining increasing attention 112 gw reuse saves water and reduces water supply costs and centralized wastewater treatment loads ultimately providing sustainable water resources in certain rural areas households tend to separate bw and gw and reuse the latter for irrigation to provide an additional water source however health risks can be potentially associated with the use of untreated gw furthermore the negative effects of gw on soil and crops can be long lasting 113 gw must be treated before reuse the nature of the gw and the purpose of the reused water determine the extent of the required treatment in addition the choice of treatment system should consider the simplicity of operation and the cost of construction and maintenance 114 gw treatment methods include adsorption and filtration 22 biological methods e g mbr sbr and uasb and ecological treatment technologies e g cws ponds and soil treatment systems 115 116 a study by halalsheh et al 117 in rural jordan found that low water consumption in the countryside led to high concentrations of pollutants in the gw three different technologies st intermittent sand filtration st cw and uasb hybrid reactor were used to treat gw the results indicated that the use of the uasb hybrid reactor with its advantages of compactness and simplicity of operation was the most suitable treatment option for this particular area cws are also an important technology for the treatment and reuse of gw arden and ma 118 reviewed 13 studies and extracted 38 independent systematic datasets they found that cws as independent unit processes for gw treatment could not reliably meet microbial effluent standards a cw combined with a proper disinfection unit process for treating gw can provide an appropriate water source for non potable water reuse boano et al 116 reviewed and analysed 30 pilot cws and 15 full scale cws that treated and reused gw focusing on the relationship between their treatment performance and hydraulic operation parameters compared with conventional systems either urine source separation or blackwater source separation increases the nutrient recovery capacity and environmental benefits fig 6 several studies have demonstrated that treating unmixed and highly concentrated wastewater has higher resource and treatment efficiencies than treating highly diluted and mixed wastewater 111 119 zha et al 120 reported a state of the art wastewater treatment system in which bw was pre treated with an abr and then mixed with raw gw in this system cod reaches low concentrations in the effluent from the multi stair waterwheel driven rotating biological contactors and nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations are further reduced by cws the low construction and operation costs simple management and easy maintenance of the system ensure its applicability in rural areas paulo et al 112 adopted an evapotranspiration tank to treat source diverted bw from domestic sewage in brazil as well as the combined process of a grease trap sedimentation tank two cws to treat source separated gw from domestic sewage in brazil the experimental results indicate that the treatment process is ecological and low cost it also enables green area development improves the microclimate and allows the reuse of gw source separation of domestic wastewater facilitates the recovery of water and increases the efficiency of energy and nutrient removal from wastewater 25 ecological treatment technologies based on source separation are considered suitable for rural areas owing to their affordability and environmental friendliness this represents an effective approach for recovering nutrients from wastewater especially in economically underdeveloped areas 121 3 3 ecological risk assessment of rural domestic sewage domestic sewage is an enormous source of surface water pollution in rural areas of developing countries this is particularly problematic in china where large amounts of highly concentrated nutrients are discharged directly into receiving water bodies 122 a recent study used multivariate statistics combined with physicochemical and socioeconomic parameters to identify the sources of surface water pollution source apportionment according to absolute principal component score multiple linear regression showed that in addition to industrial wastewater rds accounted for the largest proportion of pollution 25 08 123 the discharge of rds exposes surface water and groundwater to various levels of pollutants the main source of nitrogen pollution in the surface water of the taihu lake region in china is not the nitrogen fertiliser applied to agricultural fields but the discharge of untreated urban domestic sewage and rural human and animal excreta directly into the water body 124 the same phenomenon has been identified in vietnam where surface rivers are heavily polluted mainly by domestic wastewater 3 nitrate pollution in groundwater is a concern to a certain extent for the discharge of effluent from rds systems 125 the discharge of domestic sewage may also be responsible for the local peaks in nitrate concentrations 4 in addition pathogens bacteria viruses protozoa helminths from rds can contaminate rivers fig 7 126 pathogens fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci in rds are mainly derived from human excreta 12 septic systems are widely used to treat domestic sewage from individual dwellings in rural areas but they are also a potential source of contaminants pathogens and args 28 the risks for river eutrophication and human health from septic system effluents may be greater than currently assumed 127 sts effluent discharge can also affect groundwater and pose a potential threat to areas that rely on groundwater infectious diseases and diarrhoea in children are closely linked to long term exposure to cryptosporidium from nearby sts 103 rural in situ sewage treatment facilities are primarily used to remove a large number of pollutants and pathogens and less attention has been paid to the removal of ecs in recent years pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps have been widely detected in rural water environments and have been linked to the use of various antibiotics drugs and cosmetics although ecs are typically present at ng l to Î¼g l levels their potential to adversely affect human and ecosystem health is concerning 12 128 further research is required to fully elucidate their environmental impacts directly discharged untreated sewage in rural areas is one of the main sources of ppcps 129 liu et al 130 showed that high concentrations of nonylphenols in surface water may be associated with the discharge of rds which has not been thoroughly investigated ecs such as ppcps steroid hormones and pesticides have been detected in rds treatment facilities in the usa china india sweden colombia and the czech republic 31 131 133 source apportionment has identified untreated domestic sewage as the main source of ppcps 134 several studies have shown that the environmental risk of these organics to surface water environments is reduced after treatment with cws and soil filters and toxicological assessments have found reduced risks to humans and aquatic organisms 32 however other studies have found that carbamazepine caffeine ofloxacin and dehydrated erythromycin near the outlet of wastewater treatment plants pose relatively high ecological risks to most aquatic species e g algae fish and plants 33 therefore strategies for the management and removal of ecs from rds require further research cws are used to treat conventional pollutants cod tn tp and pathogens 135 but have also been used to treat ecs such as antibiotics pharmaceuticals hormones and pesticides with good efficacy a recent study showed that cw systems are highly effective in removing steroid hormones 97 4 and biocides 92 4 with microbes substrates and plants being the main contributors to steroid hormone and biocide removal in cw systems 136 in vf cws the removal of 14 ppcps 81 97 7 microbial degradation 74 9 93 8 and ppcps adsorbed on the substrate 0 54 12 56 appeared to be the main removal mechanisms 31 in general cws are effective in removing certain drugs antibiotics and fungicides but the removal rate of specific ecs remains low for this reason many researchers are trying to enhance the removal of ecs in cws for example via the tidal flow operation model 137 in addition the mechanisms for the removal of ecs in cws are not well understood and further research is required antibiotics that are not utilised by the body are excreted in faeces and urine and antibiotic residues in sewage treatment can lead to the production of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and args 138 when faeces and urine are used as agricultural fertilisers or effluents are reused for irrigation they can lead to the release of arb and args into the natural and agricultural environment which can spread through the food chain fig 7 138 therefore the spread of arb and args is currently a matter of great public concern and is listed by the world health organization as a major global health challenge 139 unsatisfactory removal of args has been reported in some rds treatment systems which is related to the technique and process followed systems that use vegetation as a common feature in cws exhibit higher arg removal rates particularly sul genes plant roots promote microbial attachment and each plant root system can be considered a micr oaerobic anoxic biological treatment system that could further contribute to arg removal 50 however the mechanisms of args removal by cws plants should be further explored in the future in recent years mp nanoplastics nps have been frequently detected in rds owing to their small size large specific surface area and hydrophobicity mps tend to adsorb organic pollutants and can therefore carry toxic chemicals 140 mps are a potential source of toxic pollutants but can also act as a transport medium for other toxic pollutants after treatment in sewage treatment facilities a substantial proportion of mps are still released into natural water bodies with effluent posing a significant risk to aquatic organisms 27 previous research has found that mps nps can be taken up directly or indirectly by aquatic plants or animals and eventually enter the human body through the biological food chain fig 7 posing a potential risk to human health therefore reducing mps nps in aquatic environments is a top priority wetland systems are an important sink for mps nps and an eco friendly and sustainable way to retain them 141 but the presence of mps can affect microbes and plants in cw systems resulting in reduced pollutant removal 29 4 challenges and the road ahead based on a bibliometric analysis of the retrieved literature we further discuss the current status and challenges of rds research in recent years the ecological environment of rural areas has received widespread attention many rds treatment facilities have been established in rural chinese areas and progress has been made however the existing rds treatment facilities suffer from scattered locations varying levels of technology and weak supervision a recent study showed that many rurally built wastewater treatment facilities in china are idle because of technical and regulatory issues even simple equipment can suffer from system failures 11 the great uncertainty in rural areas often leads to design and operational failures of wastewater treatment facilities consequently limiting wastewater treatment and posing a potential threat to surface and groundwater 142 therefore there is an urgent need for a comprehensive assessment of the existing rds treatment facilities in addition rds treatment facilities should consider the practical situation and a shift from the wastewater treatment perspective to the resource recovery concept could increase the motivation of local residents bw and urine were separated at the source to improve nutrient recovery and the gw was treated appropriately for reuse however rds treatment based on source separation is still in the initial stages further exploration of the effective combination of front end wastewater separation and end product treatment is warranted most importantly ecs such as hormones pharmaceuticals and microplastics 27 28 still need to be considered during resource recovery and effluent reuse to avoid secondary contamination ecs have been widely detected in rds 143 and have attracted the attention of scientists and policymakers especially in sewage reuse processes considering the toxicity and potential adverse effects of ecs on the environment and humans it is necessary to minimise their release into wastewater especially when wastewater is used for agricultural irrigation 144 based on this literature review the most important directions for future research on rds should focus on the following areas 1 there is an urgent need to establish a comprehensive assessment system for rds treatment facilities such a system should combine economic benefits e g energy consumption analysis 145 ecological and environmental benefits and social benefits advanced algorithms such as artificial intelligence should be employed to screen for suitable rds treatment processes that fully consider local conditions 2 research and applications based on the separation of rds at the source as well as resource utilisation have received widespread attention in recent years 146 which is conducive to achieving the goal of carbon neutrality 147 however the impact of wastewater reuse on farmland ecosystems must be explored further to date research on this aspect has been insufficient 3 ecs e g antibiotics pharmaceuticals and mps are not effectively removed from existing treatment facilities in rural areas this leads to their accumulation in the aquatic environment which significantly impacts local aquatic ecosystems especially in areas where surface water and groundwater are used as drinking water sources therefore effective removal measures should be implemented in addition the long term ecotoxicity of these pollutants in rural surface waters and groundwater must be evaluated 5 conclusions rds is one of the primary barriers to achieving several global development goals and has received considerable attention in recent years this review provides a systematic and comprehensive understanding of the latest research trends and hotspots in the field of rds through bibliometric analysis the number of publications related to rds is currently increasing and china is the fastest growing country in terms of publications and closeness of collaboration with the us and canada the main research directions for rds are efficient treatment technologies resource recovery based on source separation and ecological risks associated with rds cw is the most widely used rds treatment technology and the separation of bw and gw and resource recovery are undoubtedly competitive alternatives that are gaining attention in rural areas however the presence of ecs is a major challenge in resource based sewage treatment for future research we should focus on the establishment of a comprehensive evaluation system for rds treatment facilities in depth research on technologies and strategies for source separation and resource utilisation of rds and ecological risk assessments of ecs and pathways for their removal declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

12648,rural domestic sewage rds is one of the foremost obstacles to achieving several global sustainable development goals to identify and further drive future development in rds treatment bibliometric software vosviewer citespace and the bibliometrix package in r was used to analyze 512 relevant papers between 1991 and 2022 the results indicated an increasing trend in rds related publications with china demonstrating the fastest growth in publications and close collaborations with the us and canada the authors keyword co occurrence network analysis revealed that the current research directions in rds are efficient treatment technologies resource recovery based on source separation and ecological risks associated with rds constructed wetlands are the most widely used option for treating rds and can be combined with other treatment technologies in addition the source separation of rds and its resourceful use have attracted widespread interest however the process must consider the potential ecological risks of emerging contaminants ecs especially antibiotic residues future research directions are mainly focused on 1 establishing a comprehensive evaluation framework for rds treatment facilities 2 exploring in depth the technologies and strategies for source separation and resource utilisation of rds and 3 assessing the removal of ecs and related

children s fund unicef in 2021 jointly report that 616 million people worldwide live in environments lacking access to sewage sanitation and 92 live in rural settlements 1 due to a lack of investment and research the coverage of wastewater treatment facilities in rural areas lags far behind that in urban areas 2 the direct discharge of untreated human excreta and domestic sewage can seriously affect surface and groundwater 3 4 leading to ecological degradation of the regional environment and poses health risks 5 in china only 13 34 of all rural domestic sewage rds is treated efficiently 6 for this reason rds treatment is a priority for improving rural habitats and a major challenge for achieving global sustainable development goals sdgs 7 8 compared to municipal domestic sewage rds has unique characteristics such as small size wide distribution large polluted area intermittent discharge and a large coefficient of variation in water quality and quantity 9 therefore unlike urban sewage treatment technologies rds treatment technologies are more diverse 10 the main treatment technologies currently available for rds include biological approaches e g anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o membrane bioreactor mbr anaerobic digestion ad and septic tank st 11 12 ecological approaches e g constructed wetland cw pond and soil infiltration systems 13 14 and combined treatment approaches e g biological ecological biological biological and ecological ecological 6 these technologies are widely used in treating rds but do not achieve effective resource recovery from sewage in recent years many researchers have proposed the concept of source separated rds treatment based on resource recovery that is the separation of sewage from its source grey water gw from kitchens laundry etc and black water bw from toilets 15 17 bw accounts for only 1 2 of the total rds but is the main source of nitrogen n and phosphorus p contributing 90 of the n and 80 of the p to the rds 18 gw accounts for 50 80 of the total rds and has a low level of contamination 19 bw separation avoids dilution by gw and facilitates the recovery of nutrients n and p and biogas ch4 20 21 separated and simply treated gw can be reused for irrigation and toilet flushing 22 23 existing research has demonstrated that source separation of bw and gw and treatment for recovery are more beneficial than treating a mixture of the two 24 25 the reason for this is that source separated bw with high contaminant concentrations is more beneficial for energy recovery as well as nutrient recovery from bio based fertiliser production gw with low pollutant concentrations is more conducive to water recovery for irrigation moreover source separated facilities for rds treatment are superior in terms of sewage reuse and life cycle impact 26 source separation based resource recovery from the rds is in line with the concept of sustainable development however many factors must be considered in the process of resource recovery from rds for instance the feasibility of the technology acceptability of recovered resources and potential ecological risks unfortunately emerging contaminants ecs such as hormones drug residues and microplastics mps have been widely detected in rds in recent years 27 28 the presence of these pollutants can affect the efficiency of rds treatment facilities 29 and hinder the utilisation of sewage resources 30 existing studies on the removal of ecs and their ecological risks are somewhat controversial studies have shown that wastewater containing novel pollutants antibiotics poses a reduced ecological risk to the surface water environment after treatment with cws 31 32 in contrast some studies have indicated limited efficacy in removing antibiotics from wastewater in wastewater treatment facilities which may have potential adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems 33 34 ecs that are not fully treated can flow into receiving waters or enter agricultural fields through irrigation and spread through the food chain to organisms at higher trophic levels thus posing a potential threat to regional ecology 35 therefore rds treatment technologies for the removal of conventional and emerging pollutants and resource based wastewater recovery processes require further in depth analyses most published reviews are limited to one specific rds treatment technology e g cw 36 multi soil layering systems 6 biogas engineering 37 and additional growth processes 38 while no review has been conducted to provide a comprehensive review of rds particularly the resource based recovery of rds and its potential ecological risk analysis therefore a systematic and comprehensive review covering all current research trends in rds is necessary bibliometric analysis has proven to be a useful tool for visually analysing a large amount of relevant published research data in a particular field providing accurate insight into the current state of research and future trends to guide contemporary research efforts 39 40 therefore this review begins with a bibliometric analysis of the annual growth of rds research publications the most influential countries institutions highly cited papers author keyword co occurrence networks thematic evolution analysis and the main research areas of all rds publications with the aim of providing a holistic overview this was followed by a detailed description and discussion of the identified hotspots at the end of this review current challenges and future perspectives of rds research are presented the aim of our work is to provide an objective and comprehensive review of research in the field of rds and to offer new perspectives for future research 2 bibliometric analysis 2 1 data collection and preprocessing literature on rds was obtained from the web of science wos core collection database the results were retrieved on 25 february 2022 using the search equations of ts rural or countryside or village and ts domestic sewage or domestic wastewater or household sewage or household wastewater or black water or blackwater or gray water or graywater or greywater or grey water or brown water the resultant original data were further filtered using document types articles and reviews and languages english after screening 512 raw records met the selection criteria for further analyses then full records and cited references of related publications were saved in the txt format including data on title authors affiliations abstract keywords citation count journals publication time document type and categories to improve bibliometric analysis it is necessary to recalculate synonymous and synonymous words in the co occurrence analysis of keywords keywords were pre processed according to the method described by zhu et al 41 the most relevant terms were selected manually to eliminate duplicates singular or plural forms synonyms and abbreviations and to determine keywords for the final analysis bibliometric analysis of the rds research was conducted using microsoft office excel 2016 the bibliometrix package r language citespace version 5 8 r3 and vosviewer version 1 6 18 leiden university netherlands the review analysis process is illustrated in fig 1 the dataset was explored using vosviewer software in which authors and research collaboration networks as well as co occurrence network maps of author keywords were constructed the bibliometrix package r language was used for global collaboration analysis and thematic evolution analysis citespace software was used for keyword burst detection analysis 2 2 primary evaluation of publications after the screening process the results indicated that the first publication on rds was published in 1991 a new energy efficient membrane bioreactor suitable for rural or sparsely populated areas has been developed and has shown considerable potential 42 as shown in fig 2a the number of publications on rds treatment has increased since 2005 over the past decade the number of articles published has increased from 14 in 2012 to 75 in 2021 the number of citations of these publications has also increased according to statistics research in this field has generated considerable interest in asian countries where the total number of published articles far exceeds that of other countries fig s1a in 1991 japan published its first academic paper in this field the usa has the second highest number of publications worldwide while india ranks third although china has the most research papers it started research in this field relatively late nearly 10 years later than developed countries such as the usa japan and the uk fig s1b in the 21st century china has started paying attention to the issue of rural environmental protection in 2005 2008 there was a nascent stage of rds treatment with 2 44 of all publications 2008 2015 was the initial development stage with 24 88 of articles after 2015 the rapid development stage in which the number of articles accounted for 72 68 fig s1b international cooperation in the field of rds has become increasingly close in recent years china was most involved in international cooperation which was the most intensive with 42 links among them china has a more extensive cooperation with the usa and canada fig 2b the top ten most cited academic papers in the field of rds are listed table s2 half of these were published prior to 2010 and 40 of the authors were affiliated with chinese universities more importantly half of the articles focused on cw technology with relevant articles appearing from 2003 to 2016 43 47 this demonstrates that cw is a popular choice among researchers interested in treating rds in addition the top ten most frequently cited papers also included studies on the effects of rds on groundwater and surface water 48 49 antibiotics in rds related to resistance genes 50 and the impact of rural greywater irrigation reuse on soil and plants 51 2 3 co occurrence analysis of keywords vosviewer was used to visualise the keyword co occurrence networks the co occurrence network of the author keywords at least two occurrences is shown in fig 3 domestic sewage was the keyword for the subject search therefore domestic sewage was the most frequently used keyword followed by constructed wetland keywords related to constructed wetlands include vertical flow and phragmites australis vertical flow is a form of constructed wetland whereas phragmites australis is commonly used in constructed wetlands 52 much of the research on rds has focused on treating rural sewage thus sewage treatment is an influential keyword technologies related to sewage treatment include constructed wetlands septic tank anaerobic digestion membrane reactor and vermifilter sewage treatment mainly involves the removal of nitrogen phosphorus heavy metals and pathogens author keywords were divided into seven categories fig 3 the first category was the red cluster which was composed of rural sewage spatial distribution principal component analysis and source apportionment the green cluster includes domestic sewage water quality nutrients groundwater quality nitrogen phosphorus and pathogens the red and green clusters focused mostly on the impact and evaluation of domestic sewage on surface water and groundwater quality and the spatial distribution and source apportionment of pollution sources the blue and yellow clusters mainly indicate research concentration on the source separation of domestic sewage and resource recovery for instance the keywords greywater water reuse blackwater and septic tank are in the yellow cluster and the keywords rds biogas source separation and nutrient recovery are in the blue cluster the fifth purple cluster consists of constructed wetlands nitrogen removal phosphorus removal nitrification and denitrification which indicates that this cluster is mainly concerned with research on cw for nitrogen and phosphorus removal as shown in fig s2 during the period 2010 2020 scholars focused on source separated rds treatment sustainable sanitation removal of ecs and evaluation of rds treatment technologies currently scholars are working on decentralized and sustainable sanitation based on source separation and evaluation of sewage treatment technologies in terms of economics the development and application of rds treatment technologies provide a basis for the future sustainability of rural ecosystems 2 4 thematic evolution analysis a thematic map which groups the author s keywords according to the relevance and development degree of the research fields was obtained using the bibliometrix package the thematic map was divided into four quadrants 1 motor themes 2 niche themes 3 emerging or declining themes and 4 basic themes 53 as shown in fig s3a the keywords water quality groundwater principal component analysis and groundwater quality are considered to be sporting themes these have high density and high centrality and are important and developed themes in the field in contrast greywater rural areas water reuse and irrigation were mainly related to greywater reuse nitrogen phosphorus nutrients and pathogens are mainly pollutants to be removed domestic sewage rural biogas and sanitation are mainly related to source separation for blackwater treatment constructed wetlands nitrogen removal denitrification and nitrification are mainly related to the removal of nitrogen from cws these directions can be considered basic themes with low density and high centrality which are important to the research field and require more research and analysis further research on these keywords may turn them into motor themes 54 rds microbial community removal efficiency and nutrient removal are mainly related to microbial removal mechanisms this research direction spans emerging and fading themes as well as basic themes suggesting that these themes are emerging the second quadrant is well developed but is not important for the focal field thematic evolution analysis has been used to identify quantify and visualise the thematic evolution of a specific research field in recent years 55 cws represent a more traditional in situ treatment technology for rds treatment and have been used until now in 2006 2010 water quality and sanitation in rural areas received increasing attention and in 2011 2015 the focus began to change to the reuse and irrigation of sewage after 2016 the analysis of surface and groundwater pollution and the removal mechanisms of pollutants mainly n including microbial communities became the focus fig s3b 2 5 keyword burst detection analysis identifying and detecting short term burst keywords enables the analysis of rapidly growing topics thereby increasing the understanding of research themes in recent years the top 20 keywords with the highest citation burst intensities are listed in table s3 the earliest cited keyword in the burst is activated sludge 1 31 which disappeared after 6 years of research the next most cited keyword is on site treatment 1993 2005 which was a focus for the longest time with 13 years in 2010 2015 only one sudden burst of keywords horizontal subsurface flow was related to cws after 2016 a sudden burst of the keywords agricultural reuse emerging pollutant and antibiotic resistance genes emerged this burst suggests that researchers are becoming increasingly concerned about the emergence of novel pollutants in rds reuse and the production of antibiotic resistance genes args 3 analysis of current advances and research hotspots according to scientific bibliometric analysis research hotspots on rds have focused on three main topics 1 major technology for rds treatment 2 source separation based resource recovery from rds and 3 ecological risk assessment of rds the following section provides a detailed discussion of these three aspects of rds 3 1 major technology for rural domestic sewage treatment through literature analysis the main treatment processes for rds include biological ecological and combined treatments biological ecological ecological ecological and biological biological fig 4 in a recent study 131 engineering cases of rds treatment were collated from 2000 to 2021 the combined treatment process reached 75 57 and biological and ecological treatment technology 72 72 was the dominant technology for treating rds 6 nevertheless among ecological treatment technologies cws are the most commonly used far exceeding the use of stabilisation ponds and soil infiltration systems the analysis of the authors keywords also showed the importance of cw fig 3 in addition mbr 56 vermifiltration 57 ad and sts 12 were also identified by the co occurrence network of author keywords fig 3 as playing key roles in rds the advantages and disadvantages of different sewage treatment processes as well as the main principles of pollutant removal are compared in table 1 the various rds treatment processes are described in the following order according to the number of occurrences of the author s keywords cws are one of the most frequently used techniques for rds treatment fig 3 and are nature based solutions this technology treats pollutants through the synergistic physical chemical and biological actions of substrates plants and microbes 58 59 cws offer the advantages of simple operation and maintenance and their low cost makes them widely used for decentralized rds treatment 60 61 according to the form of water distribution and flow utilised cws are divided into horizontal flow cws hf cws vertical subsurface flow cws vf cws surface flow cws sf cws and integrated flow cws if cws 62 among them vf cws refer to the wastewater flow from the top or bottom of the system along the vertical direction adjusting the saturation state of the substrate layer can cause the wetland to form an aerobic anoxic environment this is conducive to the growth and reproduction of microbes making the vf cws superior to hf cws for total nitrogen tn removal 63 therefore this field has relatively more publications and keywords appear more frequently fig 3 fig 5 illustrates the basic components classification and removal mechanisms of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus in the cws the contribution of plants to pollutant removal in cws varies considerably from a minimum of 0 5 to a maximum of 40 0 for nitrogen removal 64 wetland substrate sorption suffers from saturation problems therefore microbes attached to the substrate play an important role in the pollutant removal process however cws often suffer from poor nitrification caused by low dissolved oxygen concentrations and incomplete denitrification owing to insufficient carbon sources to address the insufficiency of dissolved oxygen measures such as artificial aeration tidal operation models and drop aeration using topography have been proposed cws using tidal flow operations have been shown to promote oxygen supply with re oxygenation capacities of up to 350 g m2 d which can effectively improve nitrogen removal 65 in view of the challenging problem of low carbon to nitrogen ratios researchers have worked on the development of novel wetland substrates with electron donor substrates being favoured to date fe based materials pyrite magnetite fe carbon substrates etc 66 sulphur based materials monomeric sulphur etc 67 biomass carbon materials agricultural biomass etc and synthetic carbon sources phbv starch pcl mixtures etc have been used 68 most importantly wetland sites have also been selected with adequate consideration of physical geography and the use of topographic drop aeration can reduce energy consumption in addition constructed ditch wetlands 69 and vegetated drainage ditches 70 have been developed for treating rds the best cod 91 59 and tn 50 40 removal efficiencies were achieved with a combination of ditch and constructed wetlands table s4 69 anaerobic treatment is a promising option for decentralized sewage treatment based on the concept of sustainable development sts are the most utilised facilities for the anaerobic treatment of domestic wastewater in rural areas because of the inadequacy of sewerage network systems and were originally designed to remove the settling of solids grease and other floatable solids 71 72 however the use of three compartment sts alone is not effective in removing contaminants and human associated pathogens and in preventing antibiotic resistance fig 4b 28 considerable research has focused on st renovations to enhance the treatment effectiveness of sts the main focus has been on the following aspects 1 modifying the structure of sts and the flow direction of the effluent to enhance ad 73 74 2 adding media layers to sts to enhance the removal of pollutants 75 3 combining sts with other treatment technologies 76 77 to develop innovative functional sts designing and optimizing novel sts to improve their treatment performance and life cycle is imperative to address the backwardness of wastewater treatment and achieve sustainable development in rural areas our group has developed a worm bed septic tank that solves the problem of secondary pollution caused by the process of emptying and transferring fecal sludge and also improves the efficiency of wastewater treatment biogas digesters are an important application of the anaerobic digestion process and another promising technology for treating rds as they enable the recovery of resources while treating wastewater 78 biogas projects are widely used in the rural areas of china and the government strongly promotes the establishment of biogas digesters 37 it can solve the energy shortage in rural areas and reduce environmental pollution which is conducive to sustainable development and has huge potential for development ch4 is a product of the anaerobic digestion process therefore improving heat and mass transfer efficiency maximising biogas production and effectively recovering it are the focus of current research 79 msl systems represent a new soil based technology that improves the inherent capacity of soil by improving its internal structure fig 4c msl systems have been developed for decentralized domestic wastewater treatment in rural areas 80 the msl system consists of soil mixing blocks and permeable layers that function as saturated anaerobic and unsaturated aerobic zones respectively the entire msl system acts as a micro soil ecosystem with excellent pollutant removal performance 81 furthermore msl can be supplemented with specific substances such as iron sawdust and charcoal which can significantly increase microbial activity and promote denitrification 80 msl promoted the removal of bod 5 and tp under continuous aeration but the tn removal performance was poor however after aeration was stopped the tn removal rate increased significantly 82 mbr is a widely used biological treatment technology in rural areas that combines membrane separation with the traditional activated sludge method as a highly efficient wastewater treatment technology 11 mbr have the advantages of strong impact load resistance effective pollutant reduction small footprint and low sludge production table 1 mbr are the four typical technologies in one of the first rural wastewater treatment demonstration areas in china wuxi city however the high operating costs and frequent maintenance membrane fouling of mbrs during rds treatment limit their widespread application 83 the combination of mbr and a2 o was even more efficient in removing nitrogen 75 5 and phosphorus 64 1 fig 4a with low sludge production and high shock resistance 11 vermifiltration is a process whereby earthworms break down large molecule pollutants into smaller molecules that can be used by microbes to promote further pollutant degradation earthworms also alter the diversity of the microbial community forming a synergistic symbiosis with microbes to facilitate contaminant removal 84 in addition the earthworm s shuttle foraging avoids clogging keeps the filter bed in a better aerobic oxygen state and contributes to nitrification 85 vermifiltration combines earthworm and microbial activities and is a promising approach for rds treatment because of its clogging resistance lack of odor and reusability of the effluent fig 4d which is cost effective and ecological 86 88 wang et al 85 established a new three stage vermifiltration system for treating rds which showed good removal of cod 81 3 nh4 n 98 and tp 98 4 the effluent tn was mainly in the form of nitrate therefore further enhancement of nitrate removal has become the focus of future research subsurface wastewater infiltration systems swiss are nature based approaches for wastewater treatment which achieve purification through a synergistic process of filtration and adsorption microbial degradation and plant uptake 13 89 swiss have the advantages of easy maintenance low operating costs and good removal performance swiss with the novel niimi process are highly efficient in removing pollutants from sewage and the effluent can be reused 90 however there are still shortcomings in the construction and parameter adjustment of swis in decentralized rural sewage treatment processes especially for nitrogen removal 13 therefore the role of plants in the system must be further explored in depth and the application parameters of swis must be further defined as ecological treatment alone or biological treatment alone does not achieve the expected results by combining the two they can complement each other and this is widely adopted in practice 6 cws in combination with other treatment systems for treating rds are popular worldwide owing to the reduction in wetland clogging and area requirements sts are the most common pre treatment systems in rural areas making sts cws a common rds treatment combination sts cws are followed by sedimentation tanks cws ponds cws ad cws biofilters cws and hybrid cws 36 the sts cws were very effective in the removal of total suspended solids tss cod and bod with average removal rates of 87 4 89 0 and 92 8 respectively but relatively low removal of tn 60 7 and tp 66 3 36 gunes et al 91 employed a combined three compartment sts and sf cw process to treat domestic sewage in a turkish village long term monitoring results showed that the combined process achieved average removal efficiencies of 86 92 56 and 43 for tss bod tn and tp respectively therefore this process must be further enhanced to remove nitrogen and phosphorus gao and hu 92 reported a full scale combined biological contact oxidisation hf cw for rds treatment in a cold region of china with annual average final effluent concentrations of 22 40 8 58 and 2 09 mg l of cod nh4 n and tp respectively the combined system provides a large amount of reclaimed water for crop irrigation and decreases the consumption of groundwater resources fig 4e munavalli et al 93 demonstrated that a decentralized wastewater treatment system i e anaerobic baffle reactor abr if cw achieves good removal efficiency for cod 70 90 and total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn 40 65 from domestic sewage our group designed a full scale rds treatment facility in luo yi village guizhou china using a combination of an anaerobic digester and a cw process to meet the secondary standard of the rural domestic wastewater treatment facility water pollutant discharge standard db52 1424 2019 fig 4f economic indicators construction investment costs o m costs land occupation and economic efficiency are frequently decisive in the choice of rds treatment technology in practical situations the per capita economic income in rural areas is much lower than in urban areas and economically disadvantaged rural areas cannot afford the construction operation and maintenance costs of wastewater treatment budgetary constraints make it difficult to provide financial support for the operation of sewage treatment facilities therefore decentralized rds treatment facilities should be cost efficient table 2 presents the economic indicators of different rds treatment technologies in terms of comparative construction investment costs operation and maintenance costs land occupation and effluent stability 94 95 mbr have the smallest land areas but have higher construction investment and operation and management costs mainly influenced by the cost of the membrane modules cw and land purification systems have low investment and operation and management costs but have a large land occupation st and biogas digesters have low construction investment and operation and management costs and do not have a large footprint but are limited in their ability to remove pollutants therefore the cost effectiveness of the rds treatment must be considered the economics of rds treatment facilities and local pollutant discharge standards have been fully integrated 96 97 more importantly rural residents are often not particularly motivated to treat wastewater and are mostly reluctant to pay additional fees for rds treatment to motivate rural residents to treat sewage it is also desirable to consider whether wastewater treatment can yield economic environmental and ecological benefits simultaneously operation and maintenance costs can also be minimised through appropriate management and technical operations 98 source separated wastewater treatment systems that separate urine faeces and gw where faeces and urine are recycled as fertiliser and gw is treated and then recycled as reclaimed water are considered promising wastewater treatment approaches 26 3 2 source separation based resource recovery from rural domestic sewage domestic sewage consists of bw i e human urine faeces and flushing water and gw i e daily washing laundry and kitchen water 99 bw accounts for only 1 2 of the total volume of domestic wastewater but it contains the main pollutants of domestic wastewater of these carbon nitrogen phosphorus and potassium account for 60 of the total and bw also has a high content of pathogenic bacteria which requires considerable subsequent treatment 100 gw accounts for 50 80 of the total rds and has a low level of contamination 19 bw separation can recover resources either through biogas produced by anaerobic digestion or via the extraction of nutrients however gw can be used for non potable purposes consequently source separation transforms the entire wastewater management system including its collection treatment and quantification 101 the introduction of bw gw separation in rural areas may be a promising approach that facilitates the reduction of organic matter nutrients and pathogen loads in receiving water bodies most importantly the wastewater can be converted into a resource water reclamation wastewater treatment and resource and energy recovery have become major tasks in rural areas 102 fig 6 depicts alternative options for source separation based resource recovery in rural areas compared with the current situation reference system the source separation of bw can reduce the energy consumption in the wastewater treatment process and recover renewable resources fig 6 sts are widely used for treating rural bw but do not achieve good resource recovery 103 ad is the most commonly used treatment technology for bw converting organic matter into energy rich methane 104 105 and producing organic fertilisers that are high in nitrogen and phosphorus this makes anaerobic treatment the most promising future treatment technology from a sustainable perspective the development of biogas digesters as an alternative to sts for treating domestic wastewater and manure sludge was developed in the 1980s biogas digesters are usually built close to individual houses as they can provide biogas for households while the resulting digestate is then applied to farmland as an organic fertiliser this system addresses the disposal of biodegradable waste and the shortage of rural energy in developing countries 106 china s rural energy sector is actively promoting biogas digesters at all levels and the number of household biogas digesters reached 30 077 million in 2020 107 adding other wastes e g kitchen waste to bw for co digestion can increase methane production in ad systems 108 urine an important component of bw is more likely to recover nutrients than bw as a result the separation of urine sources for resource recovery has received increased attention urine consists mainly of water 90 organic compounds and inorganic salts 109 in the context of a circular economy and limited resources the source separation of urine can reclaim water and nutrients reduce the nutrient loads of wastewater treatment plants minimise treatment costs and be used directly as a fertiliser replacing 20 25 of commercial fertilisers 110 source separated urine can be reduced in volume by evaporation drying or struvite precipitation to facilitate transport or can be used directly as a liquid fertiliser to rural farmland this protects natural water bodies from sewage pollution and improves sanitation conditions and reduces water consumption 111 and creating a closed wastewater resource nexus can further increase crop yields fig 6 gw accounts for a large proportion of total domestic wastewater and is low in pathogens and pollutants therefore its reuse is gaining increasing attention 112 gw reuse saves water and reduces water supply costs and centralized wastewater treatment loads ultimately providing sustainable water resources in certain rural areas households tend to separate bw and gw and reuse the latter for irrigation to provide an additional water source however health risks can be potentially associated with the use of untreated gw furthermore the negative effects of gw on soil and crops can be long lasting 113 gw must be treated before reuse the nature of the gw and the purpose of the reused water determine the extent of the required treatment in addition the choice of treatment system should consider the simplicity of operation and the cost of construction and maintenance 114 gw treatment methods include adsorption and filtration 22 biological methods e g mbr sbr and uasb and ecological treatment technologies e g cws ponds and soil treatment systems 115 116 a study by halalsheh et al 117 in rural jordan found that low water consumption in the countryside led to high concentrations of pollutants in the gw three different technologies st intermittent sand filtration st cw and uasb hybrid reactor were used to treat gw the results indicated that the use of the uasb hybrid reactor with its advantages of compactness and simplicity of operation was the most suitable treatment option for this particular area cws are also an important technology for the treatment and reuse of gw arden and ma 118 reviewed 13 studies and extracted 38 independent systematic datasets they found that cws as independent unit processes for gw treatment could not reliably meet microbial effluent standards a cw combined with a proper disinfection unit process for treating gw can provide an appropriate water source for non potable water reuse boano et al 116 reviewed and analysed 30 pilot cws and 15 full scale cws that treated and reused gw focusing on the relationship between their treatment performance and hydraulic operation parameters compared with conventional systems either urine source separation or blackwater source separation increases the nutrient recovery capacity and environmental benefits fig 6 several studies have demonstrated that treating unmixed and highly concentrated wastewater has higher resource and treatment efficiencies than treating highly diluted and mixed wastewater 111 119 zha et al 120 reported a state of the art wastewater treatment system in which bw was pre treated with an abr and then mixed with raw gw in this system cod reaches low concentrations in the effluent from the multi stair waterwheel driven rotating biological contactors and nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations are further reduced by cws the low construction and operation costs simple management and easy maintenance of the system ensure its applicability in rural areas paulo et al 112 adopted an evapotranspiration tank to treat source diverted bw from domestic sewage in brazil as well as the combined process of a grease trap sedimentation tank two cws to treat source separated gw from domestic sewage in brazil the experimental results indicate that the treatment process is ecological and low cost it also enables green area development improves the microclimate and allows the reuse of gw source separation of domestic wastewater facilitates the recovery of water and increases the efficiency of energy and nutrient removal from wastewater 25 ecological treatment technologies based on source separation are considered suitable for rural areas owing to their affordability and environmental friendliness this represents an effective approach for recovering nutrients from wastewater especially in economically underdeveloped areas 121 3 3 ecological risk assessment of rural domestic sewage domestic sewage is an enormous source of surface water pollution in rural areas of developing countries this is particularly problematic in china where large amounts of highly concentrated nutrients are discharged directly into receiving water bodies 122 a recent study used multivariate statistics combined with physicochemical and socioeconomic parameters to identify the sources of surface water pollution source apportionment according to absolute principal component score multiple linear regression showed that in addition to industrial wastewater rds accounted for the largest proportion of pollution 25 08 123 the discharge of rds exposes surface water and groundwater to various levels of pollutants the main source of nitrogen pollution in the surface water of the taihu lake region in china is not the nitrogen fertiliser applied to agricultural fields but the discharge of untreated urban domestic sewage and rural human and animal excreta directly into the water body 124 the same phenomenon has been identified in vietnam where surface rivers are heavily polluted mainly by domestic wastewater 3 nitrate pollution in groundwater is a concern to a certain extent for the discharge of effluent from rds systems 125 the discharge of domestic sewage may also be responsible for the local peaks in nitrate concentrations 4 in addition pathogens bacteria viruses protozoa helminths from rds can contaminate rivers fig 7 126 pathogens fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci in rds are mainly derived from human excreta 12 septic systems are widely used to treat domestic sewage from individual dwellings in rural areas but they are also a potential source of contaminants pathogens and args 28 the risks for river eutrophication and human health from septic system effluents may be greater than currently assumed 127 sts effluent discharge can also affect groundwater and pose a potential threat to areas that rely on groundwater infectious diseases and diarrhoea in children are closely linked to long term exposure to cryptosporidium from nearby sts 103 rural in situ sewage treatment facilities are primarily used to remove a large number of pollutants and pathogens and less attention has been paid to the removal of ecs in recent years pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps have been widely detected in rural water environments and have been linked to the use of various antibiotics drugs and cosmetics although ecs are typically present at ng l to Î¼g l levels their potential to adversely affect human and ecosystem health is concerning 12 128 further research is required to fully elucidate their environmental impacts directly discharged untreated sewage in rural areas is one of the main sources of ppcps 129 liu et al 130 showed that high concentrations of nonylphenols in surface water may be associated with the discharge of rds which has not been thoroughly investigated ecs such as ppcps steroid hormones and pesticides have been detected in rds treatment facilities in the usa china india sweden colombia and the czech republic 31 131 133 source apportionment has identified untreated domestic sewage as the main source of ppcps 134 several studies have shown that the environmental risk of these organics to surface water environments is reduced after treatment with cws and soil filters and toxicological assessments have found reduced risks to humans and aquatic organisms 32 however other studies have found that carbamazepine caffeine ofloxacin and dehydrated erythromycin near the outlet of wastewater treatment plants pose relatively high ecological risks to most aquatic species e g algae fish and plants 33 therefore strategies for the management and removal of ecs from rds require further research cws are used to treat conventional pollutants cod tn tp and pathogens 135 but have also been used to treat ecs such as antibiotics pharmaceuticals hormones and pesticides with good efficacy a recent study showed that cw systems are highly effective in removing steroid hormones 97 4 and biocides 92 4 with microbes substrates and plants being the main contributors to steroid hormone and biocide removal in cw systems 136 in vf cws the removal of 14 ppcps 81 97 7 microbial degradation 74 9 93 8 and ppcps adsorbed on the substrate 0 54 12 56 appeared to be the main removal mechanisms 31 in general cws are effective in removing certain drugs antibiotics and fungicides but the removal rate of specific ecs remains low for this reason many researchers are trying to enhance the removal of ecs in cws for example via the tidal flow operation model 137 in addition the mechanisms for the removal of ecs in cws are not well understood and further research is required antibiotics that are not utilised by the body are excreted in faeces and urine and antibiotic residues in sewage treatment can lead to the production of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and args 138 when faeces and urine are used as agricultural fertilisers or effluents are reused for irrigation they can lead to the release of arb and args into the natural and agricultural environment which can spread through the food chain fig 7 138 therefore the spread of arb and args is currently a matter of great public concern and is listed by the world health organization as a major global health challenge 139 unsatisfactory removal of args has been reported in some rds treatment systems which is related to the technique and process followed systems that use vegetation as a common feature in cws exhibit higher arg removal rates particularly sul genes plant roots promote microbial attachment and each plant root system can be considered a micr oaerobic anoxic biological treatment system that could further contribute to arg removal 50 however the mechanisms of args removal by cws plants should be further explored in the future in recent years mp nanoplastics nps have been frequently detected in rds owing to their small size large specific surface area and hydrophobicity mps tend to adsorb organic pollutants and can therefore carry toxic chemicals 140 mps are a potential source of toxic pollutants but can also act as a transport medium for other toxic pollutants after treatment in sewage treatment facilities a substantial proportion of mps are still released into natural water bodies with effluent posing a significant risk to aquatic organisms 27 previous research has found that mps nps can be taken up directly or indirectly by aquatic plants or animals and eventually enter the human body through the biological food chain fig 7 posing a potential risk to human health therefore reducing mps nps in aquatic environments is a top priority wetland systems are an important sink for mps nps and an eco friendly and sustainable way to retain them 141 but the presence of mps can affect microbes and plants in cw systems resulting in reduced pollutant removal 29 4 challenges and the road ahead based on a bibliometric analysis of the retrieved literature we further discuss the current status and challenges of rds research in recent years the ecological environment of rural areas has received widespread attention many rds treatment facilities have been established in rural chinese areas and progress has been made however the existing rds treatment facilities suffer from scattered locations varying levels of technology and weak supervision a recent study showed that many rurally built wastewater treatment facilities in china are idle because of technical and regulatory issues even simple equipment can suffer from system failures 11 the great uncertainty in rural areas often leads to design and operational failures of wastewater treatment facilities consequently limiting wastewater treatment and posing a potential threat to surface and groundwater 142 therefore there is an urgent need for a comprehensive assessment of the existing rds treatment facilities in addition rds treatment facilities should consider the practical situation and a shift from the wastewater treatment perspective to the resource recovery concept could increase the motivation of local residents bw and urine were separated at the source to improve nutrient recovery and the gw was treated appropriately for reuse however rds treatment based on source separation is still in the initial stages further exploration of the effective combination of front end wastewater separation and end product treatment is warranted most importantly ecs such as hormones pharmaceuticals and microplastics 27 28 still need to be considered during resource recovery and effluent reuse to avoid secondary contamination ecs have been widely detected in rds 143 and have attracted the attention of scientists and policymakers especially in sewage reuse processes considering the toxicity and potential adverse effects of ecs on the environment and humans it is necessary to minimise their release into wastewater especially when wastewater is used for agricultural irrigation 144 based on this literature review the most important directions for future research on rds should focus on the following areas 1 there is an urgent need to establish a comprehensive assessment system for rds treatment facilities such a system should combine economic benefits e g energy consumption analysis 145 ecological and environmental benefits and social benefits advanced algorithms such as artificial intelligence should be employed to screen for suitable rds treatment processes that fully consider local conditions 2 research and applications based on the separation of rds at the source as well as resource utilisation have received widespread attention in recent years 146 which is conducive to achieving the goal of carbon neutrality 147 however the impact of wastewater reuse on farmland ecosystems must be explored further to date research on this aspect has been insufficient 3 ecs e g antibiotics pharmaceuticals and mps are not effectively removed from existing treatment facilities in rural areas this leads to their accumulation in the aquatic environment which significantly impacts local aquatic ecosystems especially in areas where surface water and groundwater are used as drinking water sources therefore effective removal measures should be implemented in addition the long term ecotoxicity of these pollutants in rural surface waters and groundwater must be evaluated 5 conclusions rds is one of the primary barriers to achieving several global development goals and has received considerable attention in recent years this review provides a systematic and comprehensive understanding of the latest research trends and hotspots in the field of rds through bibliometric analysis the number of publications related to rds is currently increasing and china is the fastest growing country in terms of publications and closeness of collaboration with the us and canada the main research directions for rds are efficient treatment technologies resource recovery based on source separation and ecological risks associated with rds cw is the most widely used rds treatment technology and the separation of bw and gw and resource recovery are undoubtedly competitive alternatives that are gaining attention in rural areas however the presence of ecs is a major challenge in resource based sewage treatment for future research we should focus on the establishment of a comprehensive evaluation system for rds treatment facilities in depth research on technologies and strategies for source separation and resource

12649,in this study the impact of different sludge retention times srts on the wastewater treatment performance of an aerobic membrane bioreactor mbr was investigated using real textile industry wastewater for this purpose two laboratory scale membrane bioreactors were operated in parallel under the same conditions one of the systems was operated at an srt of 30 d and the other at srts of 20 d and 10 d respectively the total chemical oxygen demand cod color and soluble total nitrogen tn of the wastewater averaged 927 277 mg l 910 287 ptco and 39 10 mg l respectively cod removal efficiency remained above 90 in all the tested srts while the color removal efficiency was 55 and 60 at srts of 30 d and 20 d respectively it decreased to 50 at srt of 10 d in addition the impact of different srts on membrane filtration performance was studied with the reduction of srt to 10 d an increase was observed in specific resistance to filtration srf and supernatant filterability sf values while viscosity decreased due to lower suspended solid ss concentration according to gel permeation chromatography gpc analysis the molecular weights of organic substances in the permeate distributed over a wide spectrum as srt decreased also signals given by the low molecular weight organic compounds were higher keywords textile wastewater membrane bioreactor filtration characteristics sludge retention time water reuse data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction textile industries generate a huge amount of wastewater containing toxic pollutants such as dyes salts metals and surfactants 1 2 it has been reported that 0 06 0 40 m3 of water is consumed per kg of manufactured material in the textile industry 3 according to the world bank about 17 to 20 of industrial water pollution occurs during the wet processing stages of manufacturing 4 biological physical and chemical treatment methods are widely preferred in the treatment of textile wastewater 4 these conventional treatment options inevitably yield high amounts of sludge to be properly disposed of biological methods have several advantages over the others such as low cost and less sludge production 4 in particular membrane bioreactors mbrs provide opportunities such as less sludge production and high quality effluent compared to other treatment systems 5 one of the most decisive factors during the operation of mbr processes is the solid retention time srt both short and long srts provide different advantages in the operation operating an mbr at long srts 25 d 6 offers advantages such as higher performance due to higher suspended solid ss concentrations 7 and lower sludge production however long srts decrease the amount of active microorganisms in the sludge 8 and cause an increase in the oxygen requirement 9 short srts reduce oxygen and energy requirements 10 but increase the excess sludge amount which constitutes a significant portion of the operating cost 11 excess sludge generated in wastewater treatment plants may be used for energy generation 12 13 membrane fouling and membrane cleaning costs are also significant disadvantages for the mbrs 14 in terms of membrane filtration and fouling longer srts may provide better filterability while shorter srts result in faster membrane fouling profiles this may be due to the amounts of soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymeric substances eps production depending on the srt 9 it is known that the amount of smp increases as the srt decreases 15 16 however different results were reported about the relationship between eps generation and srt 17 in a study synthetic textile wastewater containing 2000 mg l cod 2000 mg l sulfate and 200 mg l dye was fed to sequential anaerobic and aerobic mbrs operated at different srts infinite 60 and 30 d the cod concentrations in the anaerobic and aerobic mbr permeates averaged 579 231 mg l and 58 19 mg l despite different srts in all the operational conditions 18 in another study the treatment performance of synthetic wastewater containing 3500 mg l cod and 100 mg reactive black 5 dye was investigated at srt and hrt values of 15 d and 36 h respectively in an aerobic mbr system equipped with a membrane module with 0 4 Î¼m pore diameter the cod and color removal efficiencies were reported as 94 8 and 72 9 respectively 19 you et al 2006 studied the treatment of kuagnin industrial park wastewater using an aerobic mbr equipped with a 0 4 Î¼m pore sized membrane they reported cod and color removal efficiencies as 79 and 54 respectively 14 in another study using fungi for treatment synthetic wastewater containing 2 g l toc and 100 mg l dye was fed to an mbr containing a membrane module with a pore diameter of 0 4 Î¼m in which 97 toc and 99 color removal efficiencies were obtained 20 ultrafiltration membrane uf is generally preferred as a pre treatment before nf 21 and or ro 22 processes during the recovery of treated textile wastewater in a pilot scale study using a submerged uf membrane 0 04 Î¼m pore size module the treatment of real textile industry wastewater containing 1411 mg l cod 49 2 mg l total nitrogen and 2447 ptco color was investigated two different srts infinite and 25 d were used and the average permeate cod tn and color concentrations were 37 mg l 10 5 mg l and 53 ptco respectively 23 there are many studies on textile wastewater treatment using anaerobic and or aerobic mbrs as reported above however synthetic textile wastewater was used in some of the studies 18 24 which may not exactly reflect the process performance for a real wastewater treatment in some of the studies real textile wastewater was treated using mbr processes at long srts 25 28 without focusing on the impact of srt on the performance filtration characteristics and energy requirement of the process hence to fill the gap in the literature this study aims to investigate and compare the treatment performance of a real textile industry wastewater at different srts 30 20 and 10 d in an aerobic mbr equipped with a hollow fiber uf membrane module with a pore diameter of 0 04 Î¼m membrane fouling trends and filtration performances under different srts were discussed also observed biomass yield air and energy requirements were calculated at different srts 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactors two laboratory scale submerged membrane bioreactor mbr systems with an active volume of 7 0 l were used fig s1 a feed tank was used to feed the systems with wastewater and the influent and permeate flow rates were adjusted using peristaltic pumps seko pr7 and longer pump bt600 2 j respectively zeeweed 500m 1m model pvdf hollow fiber membrane module with a pore diameter of 0 04 Î¼m was used in the systems and the membrane surface area was 0 23 m2 in both systems air with a flow rate of 3 l min was supplied to the system through a compressor hence air provided both for biological treatment and cake scouring on the membrane was 0 78 m3 air m2 membrane h transmembrane pressure tmp during filtration was monitored with a manometer placed in the permeate line 2 2 wastewater and biomass source the wastewater used in this study was obtained from a plant treating industrial zone wastewater in bursa turkey it is known that 64 companies supply wastewater to the plant with a total flow rate of 50 000 60 000 m3 d and 95 of the wastewater originates from textile industry 29 the characterization of the wastewater during the operating periods is given in table 1 which remained fairly constant throughout the study total cod color and soluble tn of the wastewater averaged 927 277 mg l and 910 287 ptco and 39 10 mg l respectively the wastewater characteristics were similar to the ones reported earlier by other studies in the literature conducted with wastewater from the same plant 29 the seed biomass 6 g vss l for the mbrs was also taken from the sludge recirculation line of the same wastewater treatment plant 2 3 operating conditions the two aerobic mbrs were operated in parallel one of them was operated for 256 days at an srt of 30 d and the other for 84 and 68 days at srts 20 and 10 d respectively the hrt was kept constant at 1 d in both mbrs operated at room temperature excess sludge was removed daily from both systems to keep the srts constant at the tested values the filtration process was run intermittently 5 min suction 1 min rest to reduce membrane fouling instantaneous or gross flux values were calculated as 1 23 1 20 and 1 14 lmh at srts of 30 d 20 d and 10 d respectively due to the intermittent operation of the systems the net flux values varied as given in table 2 in order to determine the treatment performances cod color alkalinity conductivity total nitrogen ammonium nitrogen ss and vss were measured in the influent supernatant the soluble part within the mbr and permeate of the mbrs in addition to determining the membrane filtration performance tmp specific resistance to filtration srf supernatant filterability sf and capillary suction time cst were regularly monitored measured smp and eps were also measured for the characterization of membrane foulants 2 4 critical flux one of the factors determining the filtration performance and fouling frequency in an mbr is the selected flux value generally mbrs are operated at subcritical fluxes with limited fouling 30 hence a critical flux test was conducted in the mbr operated at an srt of 30 d fig s3 in the test the mbr was operated at different fluxes for a total duration of 175 min the flux value was gradually increased from 1 25 to 35 lmh and the filtration duration at each flux was 20 min at each flux change filtration was interrupted for 5 min to improve the physical cleaning of the membrane surface and to remove the foulants from the previous filtration step 2 5 specific energy requirement the energy requirement for aerobic treatment is dominated by oxygen transfer during the aeration process the overall oxygen requirement of an aerobic system is calculated from the following equations 31 od theory q s 0 s e 4 32 q n ox 2 86 q n ox no 3 e 1 42 p x bio

dair density of air assumed 1 2 kg m3 the specific energy requirement for aeration is the aeration energy requirement per m3 of wastewater being treated and it is calculated based on the air flow rate requirement the specific energy requirement for aeration was calculated for each srt based on the equations provided above the energy requirement in an mbr may vary between 0 6 and 2 3 kwh m3 depending on the size of the plant and the selected treatment processes and operational conditions 32 in our short term critical flux experiment it was observed that the sustainable flux may be in the range of 20 30 lmh and the mbr may be successfully operated at 20 lmh with a maximum tmp of 0 3 bar the energy requirement for permeate pumping may be calculated based on the equation provided by 33 p

hach kits according to the manufacturer s instructions smp and eps samples were prepared according to the methods described by 35 36 respectively smp and eps were measured as carbohydrates 37 and protein 38 concentrations in the samples for srf analysis the sludge sample was filtered with a 0 45 Î¼m pore sized membrane using a dead end system under a pressure of 0 5 bar in the absence of mixing in the sf analysis the supernatant obtained by centrifugation of the sludge for 10 min was filtered through a membrane filter with a pore diameter of 0 22 Î¼m using a dead end filtration apparatus under constant pressure 0 5 bar and stirring 39 standard filter papers supplied by trion electronics and the trion capillary suction timer were used for cst measurements viscosity of sludge

the data analysis tool of excel 2019 microsoft corporation usa to statistically compare the values of the different parameters monitored during each srt the significant difference was set at 95 p 0 05 3 results and discussions 3 1 treatment performances in aerobic mbrs two aerobic mbrs were operated in parallel with real textile wastewater one of the mbr systems was operated for 256 days at an srt of 30 d no significant changes were observed in the influent composition except for total cod increasing up to 1660 mg l for very short durations around days 100 155 and 230 fig 1 organic matter removal performance was not affected by the cod surges experienced in this period and effluent cod averaged 77 20 mg l in permeate fig 1 corresponding to an average cod removal efficiency of around 91 at an srt of 30 d the average color in the permeate was decreased to 396 101 ptco corresponding to 55 color removal fig 2 in permeate the alkalinity decreased to an average of 512 59 mg caco3 l corresponding to approximately 38 alkalinity consumption during the treatment process the second aerobic mbr was operated in parallel again with textile wastewater initially at an srt of 20 d for 84 days mbr performance was not affected by the decrease of the srt and or the 10 increase in the influent soluble cod concentration the average cod was observed around 70 33 mg l in the permeate and the removal efficiency was 93 fig 1 color in the influent and permeate averaged 930 291 ptco and 356 83 ptco respectively corresponding to 60 color removal at this srt fig 2 during this period a slight increase in ph was observed while the alkalinity was measured as 501 38 mg caco3 l in the permeate corresponding to an average of 32 alkalinity consumption in the last period the srt was kept at 10 d and the mbr was operated for approximately 68 days while the influent composition remained essentially the same decreasing the srt to 10 d resulted in an average permeate cod of 90 28 mg l 90 removal efficiency fig 1 the average color which was 1091 331 ptco in wastewater decreased to 518 99 ptco in the permeate while the color removal efficiency was 55 and 60 at srts of 30 d and 20 d respectively it decreased to 50 at the srt of 10 d p 0 05 fig 2 the average alkalinity concentration in the permeate was 561 92 mg caco3 l and around 40 of the alkalinity was consumed at the srt of 10 d employing an srt in the range of 30 to 10 d for the treatment of textile wastewater with mbr revealed that the system was able to perform at high organic removal efficiencies above 90 at all times p 0 05 the overall organic removal performance in the mbr was a result of biological degradation the amount of the smp generated in the reactor and its size distribution which determines its rejection by the cake layer are affected by the systems srt the impact of the membrane and cake layer and the fate of smp in the system are further discussed in the following sections textile industry uses different types of dyes including reactive disperse acid basic azo and sulfur dyes in its processes dyes that are commonly used include azo dyes that are insoluble hence they are more easily separated others including direct reactive acid and basic dyes are known to be highly soluble hence conventional separation techniques are inefficient as reported in the literature biodegradation plays a limited part due to the persistent nature of textile dye chemicals and the main mechanism is often the adsorption of dye molecules onto biomass in the case of insoluble dyes 40 in this study color removal decreased to 50 as srt was decreased to 10 d from an average of 56 at srts of 30 d and 20 d consistent with the lower amount of biomass contribution retained in the bioreactor the contribution of the cake layer to color removal also decreased with decreasing srt to 10 d no appreciable changes were observed in the ph and conductivity during the whole operating periods testing srts of 10 d 20 d and 30 d these results resonate well with the reported literature for mbr treatment of textile wastewaters where similar trends were observed in terms of organics and color removal in their review jegatheesan et al 2016 summarized numerous findings from aerobic mbr treatment of textile wastewater where cod removal efficiencies ranged between 60 and 97 mostly around 90 regardless of srt color removal on the other hand ranged between 20 and 98 averaging around 50 41 in the study by yang et al 2020 a uf membrane was used to investigate the treatment of textile wastewater and they reported cod and color removal efficiencies as 91 and 80 respectively 42 in another study cod and color removal efficiencies from synthetic textile wastewater using an aerobic mbr at srt of 30 d were reported as 93 1 and 87 1 respectively 43 cinperi et al 2019 reported 70 and 62 cod and color removals from textile industry wastewater using a pilot scale mbr at infinite srt 28 in the current study although the srt value was reduced to 10 d the cod and color removal efficiencies remained above approximately 90 and 50 respectively fig 2 3 2 nitrification and phosphorus removal performances nitrogen content is expressed as total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and or total nitrogen tn in wastewater while ammonia nitrogen and organic nitrogen form tkn content total nitrogen tn includes nitrite and nitrate based nitrogen besides tkn 44 ammonium nitrite and nitrate in the wastewater were below 1 mg n l throughout the study table 1 in this case the nitrogen source of the wastewater was likely to be organic nitrogen soluble or dissolved organic nitrogen refers to the filtered organic nitrogen 45 the average soluble nitrogen concentration of wastewater was 39 10 31 8 and 41 13 mg n l at the srts of 30 d 20 d and 10 d respectively soluble nitrogen removal efficiencies averaged 14 22 and 12 at the srts of 30 d 20 d and 10 respectively p 0 05 as mentioned the highest tn removal efficiencies were achieved at the srt of 20 d similar to other parameters during the periods in which srt was 30 d and 10 d the average n no3 was measured as 37 13 mg l and 41 11 mg l in the permeate respectively however the average n no3 in the permeate was only 21 7 mg l at srt of 20 d ammonium in the permeate was around 1 mg n l at all the srts n no2 accumulation was observed on certain days of mbr operation for example at srt of 30 d during days 154 and 168 the permeate nitrite increased up to 30 mg n l likewise during operation at the srt of 20 d corresponding to the 39th and 60th days n no2 concentration increased around 32 mg n l these deteriorations were observed very shortly and the system quickly recovered back to the previous steady state values for the mbr operation at an srt of 10 d unlike srts of 30 d and 20 d nitrite accumulation was detected between 7 and 19 mg n l in the permeate during the first 35 days indicating a lower nitrification efficiency however in the following days the nitrification process performance eventually recovered eliminating nitrite accumulation in the permeate it is known that nitrification performance is enhanced at higher srts since this allows sufficient time to secure the slow growing nitrifiers in the system 46 badani et al 2005 reported 70 ammonium oxidation performance during real textile wastewater treatment in a pilot scale aerobic mbr 47 in another study cod and nh3 removal efficiencies of over 90 from domestic wastewater were reported at all the tested srts 5 10 20 and 40 d 48 in our study the average po4 p concentrations in influent averaged 2 5 0 8 2 5 0 9 and 2 8 1 1 mg l at srts of 30 20 and 10 d respectively in permeate po4 p averaged 1 6 0 7 1 6 0 8 and 1 9 1 mg l respectively with a corresponding removal efficiency of around 35 for all srts 3 3 impact of membrane and cake layer on treatment performance the cake layer is formed by the accumulation of microorganism and their residues organic substances and inorganic substances on the membrane surface during filtration in an mbr 49 and its amount is directly related with srt hrt 50 ss concentration 51 and filtration flux in addition the cake layer on the membrane surface can contribute positively to the degradation and or rejection of organic and inorganic substances 52 table 3 shows the removal efficiencies of the main parameters and the contribution of the membrane and or cake layer to them for total cod the removal efficiency was above 90 at all operated srts the contribution of membrane and cake layer to the color and cod removals decreased with decreasing srt which should be due to the reduced thickness of the cake layer depending on the ss concentration in the mbr the color removal within the mbr operated at an srt of 20 d was 31 compared to 21 23 at srts 30 and srt 10 d this may be due to the differences in the feed wastewater composition which could be more biodegradable during the operation of the mbr at the srt of 20 d despite the decrease in ss and vss concentrations in the reactor due to the srt decrease the treatment performances were very close at all the tested srts 3 4 impact of srt on membrane fouling and filtration performance the average ss and vss were 2849 296 mg l and 2276 192 mg l respectively during the first 147 days of the operation at the srt of 30 d in the following days ss and vss increased by an average of 43 and 50 respectively fig 3 this increase corresponds to the period when the total cod and color of the wastewater were increased compared with the srt of 30 d ss and vss decreased by approximately 19 and 26 respectively at the srt of 20 d fig 3 this decrease in ss and vss concentrations reached 35 and 34 respectively at srt of 10 d it was observed that the vss ss ratios ranged between 0 77 and 0 86 in the short term critical flux test an increase in tmp was observed at a flux of 30 lmh as a result the critical flux was decided to be between 20 and 30 lmh no fouling was observed in the mbr throughout the operation due to subcritical flux operation 1 5 lmh and tmp remained below 10 mbar throughout the study fig s2 srf provides information on sludge filterability and compaction capacity of the cake layer 53 in this study the average srf was 5 1014 1 73 1014 m kg 5 71 1014 1 07 1014 m kg and 8 34 1014 2 39 1014 m kg at srts of 30 20 and 10 d a significant increase in srf occurred especially at srt of 10 d this may be due to the increase in colloidal substances in the system due to the decreased srt and the pore blocking of the membrane with the colloidal organics in the study conducted with synthetic textile wastewater with sequential anaerobic and aerobic mbrs the averages of srf and cst were measured as 1 33 0 4 1014 m kg and 27 9 s at srts of infinite 60 d and 30 d in an aerobic mbr and it was reported that there was no correlation between srt and the srf and cst values 18 supernatant filterability is about the presence of substances that causes mainly pore blocking 39 it was observed that the srf increased by 1 7 times as the srt decreased from 30 d to 10 d no significant change was observed in the sf by decreasing the srt from 30 d to 10 d and it remained between 0 77 and 0 86 ml min the average viscosities of the sludge were 2 85 0 11 2 48 0 1 and 2 17 0 11 cp respectively at srts of 30 20 and 10 d as expected sludge viscosity increases at high ss concentrations in the mbr 54 during the first 127 days at an srt of 30 d svi and cst were 71 39 ml g and 20 2 s respectively fig 3 subsequently svi and cst increased to 257 ml g and 86 s respectively and both parameters showed a fluctuating pattern at an srt of 30 d svi and cst were measured as 100 44 ml g and 31 12 s respectively at an srt of 20 d by reducing the srt to 10 d in the mbr the svi increased from 76 19 ml g to 174 53 ml g in the last days of the period while the cst remained at 44 9 s during this period hence no exact correlation between svi and cst was observed in a study conducted for the treatment of chromium containing synthetic textile wastewater a dynamic membrane bioreactor was operated under intermittent aeration conditions at an srt of 60 d the mbr was constantly aerated and no chrome was added during the first two periods in these periods the srf was measured as 2 2 1012 m kg also it was reported that cst and svi values were not affected by the changes in operating conditions and were measured as 21 42 2 9 s and 90 32 ml g respectively throughout the study 55 the average smp in the supernatant ranged between 31 and 36 mg cod l at all the srts approximately 53 35 and 46 of the smp in the supernatant were rejected by the membrane and or cake layer at the srts of 30 20 and 10 d respectively eps averaged 33 3 31 4 and 41 7 mg cod g vss at the srts of 30 20 and 10 d respectively although eps production changed depending on the srt the content of eps in terms of carbohydrates and protein was not changed in the mbrs tightly bound eps was between 64 and 68 while loosely bound eps was between 36 and 32 in addition it was observed that the carbohydrate and protein contents of the produced smp and eps were close to each other even at different srts fig 4 while the carbohydrate content of smp in the supernatant ranged from 74 to 82 it decreased to approximately 67 73 in the permeate the highest protein content was detected in loosely bound eps it ranged from 65 to 70 at all the srts the carbohydrate and protein content of the tightly bound eps were 51 60 and 40 49 respectively for all srt values in a study without srt information the textile wastewater treatment performances and effect of hrts and powdered activated carbon pac addition were investigated in sequential anaerobic moving bed bioreactor anmbbr and aerobic mbr in the absence of pac addition the carbohydrate content of smps in the supernatant and permeate were 32 83 and 25 48 mg l while the protein content of smps was 4 1 and 3 7 mg l respectively the carbohydrate and protein contents of eps were reported as 7 16 and 1 17 mg g mlvss 27 and it was lower than those obtained in this study it has been reported that the amount of eps decreases as srt increases 17 56 in this study eps increased from 31 mg cod g vss to 41 mg cod g vss especially by reducing srt to 10 d gel permeation chromatography gpc was used to measure the molecular weight and presence of the organic substances in the wastewater and permeate fig 5 in gpc analyses four main peaks were observed in the wastewater corresponding to 30 10 2 6 and 0 3 kda molecular weights in the permeate only three peaks were observed corresponding to 20 3 and 0 57 kda at an srt of 30 d the peaks observed during the srt of 20 d correspond to approximately 21 2 8 1 and 0 47 kda also similar peaks were obtained at an srt of 10 d corresponding to 22 3 7 1 4 and 0 5 kda no peak corresponding to 1 kda was observed at the srt of 30 d there is a significant difference between the peak heights observed in gpc analyses depending on the srt in particular the peak signals corresponding to low molecular weight organic compounds decreased as srt decreased therefore the amount of low molecular weight smp may be higher at longer srts 3 5 impact of srt on observed yield and daily sludge waste in mbr the variations of the calculated specific energy requirement and yobs values concerning employed srts are plotted in fig 6 at constant hrt a high amount of sludge was retained in the bioreactor and low sludge yields yobs were attained at high srts conversely a lower amount of sludge was retained which results in a high sludge amount to be further handled at shorter srts in the study yobs values increased with decreasing srt as it was calculated as 0 125 0 192 and 0 314 mg ss mg cod at srts of 30 20 and 10 d respectively in a study investigating petrochemical wastewater treatment in aerobic mbr yobs values were reported as 0 614 0 165 g vss g cod 0 521 0 0864 g vss g cod and 0 441 0 0997 g vss g cod at srts of 10 20 and 30 d 57 in a study by castellanos et al 2021 nutrient removal for domestic wastewater was studied in the aerobic granular sludge system and the biomass yield coefficient y was reported as 0 48 g vss g cod 0 61 g vss g cod and 0 68 g vss g cod at srt of 30 d 20 d and 15 d 58 although the sludge amount to be handled increases at short srts it may be preferable if the excess sludge is used for energy generation as illustrated in fig 6 the generated sludge amount increased almost 2 5 times as srt decreased from 30 to 10 d it is well known that as the srt decreases the specific amount of methane generation during anaerobic digestion of the sludge increases significantly 59 bolzonella et al 60 reported that the specific biogas generation increased significantly from 0 07 m3 kg vssfed to 0 18 m3 kg vssfed as srt decreased from 35 to 8 d hence low srt may be preferred to generate energy from waste sludge without sacrificing the desired treatment performance 3 6 impact of srt on oxygen and energy requirement in mbr the specific energy requirement is expected to increase with srt as a result of higher biomass concentrations in the bioreactor sÃ¶zen et al 61 determined the specific energy requirement for an srt of 4 d was 0 25 kwh m3 whereas the same for an srt of 25 d was estimated between 0 45 and 0 52 kwh m3 it has been reported that the total energy requirement in aerobic mbr is between 0 6 and 1 2 kwh m3 of which approximately 30 40 for aeration 62 in our study the specific aeration energy requirement for biological oxidation only was estimated as 0 22 0 35 kwh m3 in the studied srt range the lowest srt of 10 d exerted the lowest energy requirement which was 37 and 31 lower than the srt of 30 d and 20 d respectively fig 6 linear relationships between srt and both specific energy requirement r2 0 90 and yobs r2 0 97 were observed as srt decreased from 30 d to 10 d sludge generation increased around 2 5 times and the energy requirement for aeration decreased by 37 hence considering the energy requirement for biological treatment shorter srt values can be chosen without sacrificing treatment performance especially if excess sludge is to be used for energy generation the specific energy for permeation was calculated as 0 0083 kwh m3 additional energy will also be required for course bubble air scouring if the membranes are located in a separate membrane tank energy requirement in this case will completely depend on the airflow rate which may be decided by membrane fouling propensities in a recent study the aeration requirement for physical cleaning by air scouring of a ceramic membrane used as flocculation assisted direct filtration was reported to be 0 082 kwh m3 63 hence total specific energy requirements including biological treatment air scouring of the membranes and permeation at srts of 30 20 and 10 d were estimated as 0 44 0 41 and 0 31 kwh m3 respectively 4 conclusion in the study the treatment of real textile wastewater was investigated in two aerobic mbrs operated under different srts conditions 10 d 20 d and 30 d the highest cod and color removal efficiencies were observed at srt 20 d the cod removal efficiency was over 90 at all operated srts the highest color removal efficiency of 60 was achieved at an srt of 20 d which was 8 and 17 higher than the values observed at srts of 30 and 10 d respectively in addition the highest removal efficiencies by the cake layer were observed at an srt of 30 d due to the low flux no serious fouling was observed in the mbrs however srf values were increased by reducing the srt to 10 d in conclusion this study asserts that aerobic mbr operated in the srt values down to 10 d which is practically more environmental friendly than mbr operation conventionally employing very long srts is a very effective and reliable treatment option for organic carbon removal from actual composite textile effluents while being able to provide a certain level of color removal also as srt decreased the waste sludge amount increased while the energy requirement for aeration decreased the increased sludge disposal costs due to the increased amount of waste sludge at short srts may be compensated by the increased methane production if the excess sludge is anaerobically digested declaration of competing interest

12649,in this study the impact of different sludge retention times srts on the wastewater treatment performance of an aerobic membrane bioreactor mbr was investigated using real textile industry wastewater for this purpose two laboratory scale membrane bioreactors were operated in parallel under the same conditions one of the systems was operated at an srt of 30 d and the other at srts of 20 d and 10 d respectively the total chemical oxygen demand cod color and soluble total nitrogen tn of the wastewater averaged 927 277 mg l 910 287 ptco and 39 10 mg l respectively cod removal efficiency remained above 90 in all the tested srts while the color removal efficiency was 55 and 60 at srts of 30 d and 20 d respectively it decreased to 50 at srt of 10 d in addition the impact of different srts on membrane filtration performance was studied with the reduction of srt to 10 d an increase was observed in specific resistance to filtration srf and supernatant filterability sf values while viscosity decreased due to lower suspended solid ss concentration according to gel permeation chromatography gpc analysis the molecular weights of organic substances in the permeate distributed over a wide spectrum as srt decreased also signals given by the low molecular weight organic compounds were higher keywords textile wastewater membrane bioreactor filtration characteristics sludge retention time water reuse data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction textile industries generate a huge amount of wastewater containing toxic pollutants such as dyes salts metals and surfactants 1 2 it has been reported that 0 06 0 40 m3 of water is consumed per kg of manufactured material in the textile industry 3 according to the world bank about 17 to 20 of industrial water pollution occurs during the wet processing stages of manufacturing 4 biological physical and chemical treatment methods are widely preferred in the treatment of textile wastewater 4 these conventional treatment options inevitably yield high amounts of sludge to be properly disposed of biological methods have several advantages over the others such as low cost and less sludge production 4 in particular membrane bioreactors mbrs provide opportunities such as less sludge production and high quality effluent compared to other treatment systems 5 one of the most decisive factors during the operation of mbr processes is the solid retention time srt both short and long srts provide different advantages in the operation operating an mbr at long srts 25 d 6 offers advantages such as higher performance due to higher suspended solid ss concentrations 7 and lower sludge production however long srts decrease the amount of active microorganisms in the sludge 8 and cause an increase in the oxygen requirement 9 short srts reduce oxygen and energy requirements 10 but increase the excess sludge amount which constitutes a significant portion of the operating cost 11 excess sludge generated in wastewater treatment plants may be used for energy generation 12 13 membrane fouling and membrane cleaning costs are also significant disadvantages for the mbrs 14 in terms of membrane filtration and fouling longer srts may provide better filterability while shorter srts result in faster membrane fouling profiles this may be due to the amounts of soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymeric substances eps production depending on the srt 9 it is known that the amount of smp increases as the srt decreases 15 16 however different results were reported about the relationship between eps generation and srt 17 in a study synthetic textile wastewater containing 2000 mg l cod 2000 mg l sulfate and 200 mg l dye was fed to sequential anaerobic and aerobic mbrs operated at different srts infinite 60 and 30 d the cod concentrations in the anaerobic and aerobic mbr permeates averaged 579 231 mg l and 58 19 mg l despite different srts in all the operational conditions 18 in another study the treatment performance of synthetic wastewater containing 3500 mg l cod and 100 mg reactive black 5 dye was investigated at srt and hrt values of 15 d and 36 h respectively in an aerobic mbr system equipped with a membrane module with 0 4 Î¼m pore diameter the cod and color removal efficiencies were reported as 94 8 and 72 9 respectively 19 you et al 2006 studied the treatment of kuagnin industrial park wastewater using an aerobic mbr equipped with a 0 4 Î¼m pore sized membrane they reported cod and color removal efficiencies as 79 and 54 respectively 14 in another study using fungi for treatment synthetic wastewater containing 2 g l toc and 100 mg l dye was fed to an mbr containing a membrane module with a pore diameter of 0 4 Î¼m in which 97 toc and 99 color removal efficiencies were obtained 20 ultrafiltration membrane uf is generally preferred as a pre treatment before nf 21 and or ro 22 processes during the recovery of treated textile wastewater in a pilot scale study using a submerged uf membrane 0 04 Î¼m pore size module the treatment of real textile industry wastewater containing 1411 mg l cod 49 2 mg l total nitrogen and 2447 ptco color was investigated two different srts infinite and 25 d were used and the average permeate cod tn and color concentrations were 37 mg l 10 5 mg l and 53 ptco respectively 23 there are many studies on textile wastewater treatment using anaerobic and or aerobic mbrs as reported above however synthetic textile wastewater was used in some of the studies 18 24 which may not exactly reflect the process performance for a real wastewater treatment in some of the studies real textile wastewater was treated using mbr processes at long srts 25 28 without focusing on the impact of srt on the performance filtration characteristics and energy requirement of the process hence to fill the gap in the literature this study aims to investigate and compare the treatment performance of a real textile industry wastewater at different srts 30 20 and 10 d in an aerobic mbr equipped with a hollow fiber uf membrane module with a pore diameter of 0 04 Î¼m membrane fouling trends and filtration performances under different srts were discussed also observed biomass yield air and energy requirements were calculated at different srts 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactors two laboratory scale submerged membrane bioreactor mbr systems with an active volume of 7 0 l were used fig s1 a feed tank was used to feed the systems with wastewater and the influent and permeate flow rates were adjusted using peristaltic pumps seko pr7 and longer pump bt600 2 j respectively zeeweed 500m 1m model pvdf hollow fiber membrane module with a pore diameter of 0 04 Î¼m was used in the systems and the membrane surface area was 0 23 m2 in both systems air with a flow rate of 3 l min was supplied to the system through a compressor hence air provided both for biological treatment and cake scouring on the membrane was 0 78 m3 air m2 membrane h transmembrane pressure tmp during filtration was monitored with a manometer placed in the permeate line 2 2 wastewater and biomass source the wastewater used in this study was obtained from a plant treating industrial zone wastewater in bursa turkey it is known that 64 companies supply wastewater to the plant with a total flow rate of 50 000 60 000 m3 d and 95 of the wastewater originates from textile industry 29 the characterization of the wastewater during the operating periods is given in table 1 which remained fairly constant throughout the study total cod color and soluble tn of the wastewater averaged 927 277 mg l and 910 287 ptco and 39 10 mg l respectively the wastewater characteristics were similar to the ones reported earlier by other studies in the literature conducted with wastewater from the same plant 29 the seed biomass 6 g vss l for the mbrs was also taken from the sludge recirculation line of the same wastewater treatment plant 2 3 operating conditions the two aerobic mbrs were operated in parallel one of them was operated for 256 days at an srt of 30 d and the other for 84 and 68 days at srts 20 and 10 d respectively the hrt was kept constant at 1 d in both mbrs operated at room temperature excess sludge was removed daily from both systems to keep the srts constant at the tested values the filtration process was run intermittently 5 min suction 1 min rest to reduce membrane fouling instantaneous or gross flux values were calculated as 1 23 1 20 and 1 14 lmh at srts of 30 d 20 d and 10 d respectively due to the intermittent operation of the systems the net flux values varied as given in table 2 in order to determine the treatment performances cod color alkalinity conductivity total nitrogen ammonium nitrogen ss and vss were measured in the influent supernatant the soluble part within the mbr and permeate of the mbrs in addition to determining the membrane filtration performance tmp specific resistance to filtration srf supernatant filterability sf and capillary suction time cst were regularly monitored measured smp and eps were also measured for the characterization of membrane foulants 2 4 critical flux one of the factors determining the filtration performance and fouling frequency in an mbr is the selected flux value generally mbrs are operated at subcritical fluxes with limited fouling 30 hence a critical flux test was conducted in the mbr operated at an srt of 30 d fig s3 in the test the mbr was operated at different fluxes for a total duration of 175 min the flux value was gradually increased from 1 25 to 35 lmh and the filtration duration at each flux was 20 min at each flux change filtration was interrupted for 5 min to improve the physical cleaning of the membrane surface and to remove the foulants from the previous filtration step 2 5 specific energy requirement the energy requirement for aerobic treatment is dominated by oxygen

dair density of air assumed 1 2 kg m3 the specific energy requirement for aeration is the aeration energy requirement per m3 of wastewater being treated and it is calculated based on the air flow rate requirement the specific energy requirement for aeration was calculated for each srt based on the equations provided above the energy requirement in an mbr may vary between 0 6 and 2 3 kwh m3 depending on the size of the plant and the selected treatment processes and operational conditions 32 in our short term critical flux experiment it was observed that the sustainable flux may be in the range of 20 30 lmh and the mbr may be successfully operated at 20 lmh with a maximum tmp of 0 3 bar the energy requirement for permeate pumping may be calculated based on the equation provided by 33 p

equipped with an as9 hc column was used for nitrate and nitrite measurements hach hq40d multimeter 190 was used for conductivity and ph measurements tn ammonium nitrogen and po4 p were measured using hach kits according to the manufacturer s instructions smp and eps samples were prepared according to the methods described by 35 36 respectively smp and eps were measured as carbohydrates 37 and protein 38 concentrations in the samples for srf analysis the sludge sample was filtered with a 0 45 Î¼m pore sized membrane using a dead end system under a pressure of 0 5 bar in the absence of mixing in the sf analysis the supernatant obtained by centrifugation of the sludge for 10 min was filtered through a membrane filter with a pore diameter of 0 22 Î¼m using a dead end filtration apparatus under constant pressure 0 5 bar and stirring 39 standard filter papers supplied by trion electronics and the trion capillary suction timer were used for cst measurements viscosity of sludge

the data analysis tool of excel 2019 microsoft corporation usa to statistically compare the values of the different parameters monitored during each srt the significant difference was set at 95 p 0 05 3 results and discussions 3 1 treatment performances in aerobic mbrs two aerobic mbrs were operated in parallel with real textile wastewater one of the mbr systems was operated for 256 days at an srt of 30 d no significant changes were observed in the influent composition except for total cod increasing up to 1660 mg l for very short durations around days 100 155 and 230 fig 1 organic matter removal performance was not affected by the cod surges experienced in this period and effluent cod averaged 77 20 mg l in permeate fig 1 corresponding to an average cod removal efficiency of around 91 at an srt of 30 d the average color in the permeate was decreased to 396 101 ptco corresponding to 55 color removal fig 2 in permeate the alkalinity decreased to an average of 512 59 mg caco3 l corresponding to approximately 38 alkalinity consumption during the treatment process the second aerobic mbr was operated in parallel again with textile wastewater initially at an srt of 20 d for 84 days mbr performance was not affected by the decrease of the srt and or the 10 increase in the influent soluble cod concentration the average cod was observed around 70 33 mg l in the permeate and the removal efficiency was 93 fig 1 color in the influent and permeate averaged 930 291 ptco and 356 83 ptco respectively corresponding to 60 color removal at this srt fig 2 during this period a slight increase in ph was observed while the alkalinity was measured as 501 38 mg caco3 l in the permeate corresponding to an average of 32 alkalinity consumption in the last period the srt was kept at 10 d and the mbr was operated for approximately 68 days while the influent composition remained essentially the same decreasing the srt to 10 d resulted in an average permeate cod of 90 28 mg l 90 removal efficiency fig 1 the average color which was 1091 331 ptco in wastewater decreased to 518 99 ptco in the permeate while the color removal efficiency was 55 and 60 at srts of 30 d and 20 d respectively it decreased to 50 at the srt of 10 d p 0 05 fig 2 the average alkalinity concentration in the permeate was 561 92 mg caco3 l and around 40 of the alkalinity was consumed at the srt of 10 d employing an srt in the range of 30 to 10 d for the treatment of textile wastewater with mbr revealed that the system was able to perform at high organic removal efficiencies above 90 at all times p 0 05 the overall organic removal performance in the mbr was a result of biological degradation the amount of the smp generated in the reactor and its size distribution which determines its rejection by the cake layer are affected by the systems srt the impact of the membrane and cake layer and the fate of smp in the system are further discussed in the following sections textile industry uses different types of dyes including reactive disperse acid basic azo and sulfur dyes in its processes dyes that are commonly used include azo dyes that are insoluble hence they are more easily separated others including direct reactive acid and basic dyes are known to be highly soluble hence conventional separation techniques are inefficient as reported in the literature biodegradation plays a limited part due to the persistent nature of textile dye chemicals and the main mechanism is often the adsorption of dye molecules onto biomass in the case of insoluble dyes 40 in this study color removal decreased to 50 as srt was decreased to 10 d from an average of 56 at srts of 30 d and 20 d consistent with the lower amount of biomass contribution retained in the bioreactor the contribution of the cake layer to color removal also decreased with decreasing srt to 10 d no appreciable changes were observed in the ph and conductivity during the whole operating periods testing srts of 10 d 20 d and 30 d these results resonate well with the reported literature for mbr treatment of textile wastewaters where similar trends were observed in terms of organics and color removal in their review jegatheesan et al 2016 summarized numerous findings from aerobic mbr treatment of textile wastewater where cod removal efficiencies ranged between 60 and 97 mostly around 90 regardless of srt color removal on the other hand ranged between 20 and 98 averaging around 50 41 in the study by yang et al 2020 a uf membrane was used to investigate the treatment of textile wastewater and they reported cod and color removal efficiencies as 91 and 80 respectively 42 in another study cod and color removal efficiencies from synthetic textile wastewater using an aerobic mbr at srt of 30 d were reported as 93 1 and 87 1 respectively 43 cinperi et al 2019 reported 70 and 62 cod and color removals from textile industry wastewater using a pilot scale mbr at infinite srt 28 in the current study although the srt value was reduced to 10 d the cod and color removal efficiencies remained above approximately 90 and 50 respectively fig 2 3 2 nitrification and phosphorus removal performances nitrogen content is expressed as total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and or total nitrogen tn in wastewater while ammonia nitrogen and organic nitrogen form tkn content total nitrogen tn includes nitrite and nitrate based nitrogen besides tkn 44 ammonium nitrite and nitrate in the wastewater were below 1 mg n l throughout the study table 1 in this case the nitrogen source of the wastewater was likely to be organic nitrogen soluble or dissolved organic nitrogen refers to the filtered organic nitrogen 45 the average soluble nitrogen concentration of wastewater was 39 10 31 8 and 41 13 mg n l at the srts of 30 d 20 d and 10 d respectively soluble nitrogen removal efficiencies averaged 14 22 and 12 at the srts of 30 d 20 d and 10 respectively p 0 05 as mentioned the highest tn removal efficiencies were achieved at the srt of 20 d similar to other parameters during the periods in which srt was 30 d and 10 d the average n no3 was measured as 37 13 mg l and 41 11 mg l in the permeate respectively however the average n no3 in the permeate was only 21 7 mg l at srt of 20 d ammonium in the permeate was around 1 mg n l at all the srts n no2 accumulation was observed on certain days of mbr operation for example at srt of 30 d during days 154 and 168 the permeate nitrite increased up to 30 mg n l likewise during operation at the srt of 20 d corresponding to the 39th and 60th days n no2 concentration increased around 32 mg n l these deteriorations were observed very shortly and the system quickly recovered back to the previous steady state values for the mbr operation at an srt of 10 d unlike srts of 30 d and 20 d nitrite accumulation was detected between 7 and 19 mg n l in the permeate during the first 35 days indicating a lower nitrification efficiency however in the following days the nitrification process performance eventually recovered eliminating nitrite accumulation in the permeate it is known that nitrification performance is enhanced at higher srts since this allows sufficient time to secure the slow growing nitrifiers in the system 46 badani et al 2005 reported 70 ammonium oxidation performance during real textile wastewater treatment in a pilot scale aerobic mbr 47 in another study cod and nh3 removal efficiencies of over 90 from domestic wastewater were reported at all the tested srts 5 10 20 and 40 d 48 in our study the average po4 p concentrations in influent averaged 2 5 0 8 2 5 0 9 and 2 8 1 1 mg l at srts of 30 20 and 10 d respectively in permeate po4 p averaged 1 6 0 7 1 6 0 8 and 1 9 1 mg l respectively with a corresponding removal efficiency of around 35 for all srts 3 3 impact of membrane and cake layer on treatment performance the cake layer is formed by the accumulation of microorganism and their residues organic substances and inorganic substances on the membrane surface during filtration in an mbr 49 and its amount is directly related with srt hrt 50 ss concentration 51 and filtration flux in addition the cake layer on the membrane surface can contribute positively to the degradation and or rejection of organic and inorganic substances 52 table 3 shows the removal efficiencies of the main parameters and the contribution of the membrane and or cake layer to them for total cod the removal efficiency was above 90 at all operated srts the contribution of membrane and cake layer to the color and cod removals decreased with decreasing srt which should be due to the reduced thickness of the cake layer depending on the ss concentration in the mbr the color removal within the mbr operated at an srt of 20 d was 31 compared to 21 23 at srts 30 and srt 10 d this may be due to the differences in the feed wastewater composition which could be more biodegradable during the operation of the mbr at the srt of 20 d despite the decrease in ss and vss concentrations in the reactor due to the srt decrease the treatment performances were very close at all the tested srts 3 4 impact of srt on membrane fouling and filtration performance the average ss and vss were 2849 296 mg l and 2276 192 mg l respectively during the first 147 days of the operation at the srt of 30 d in the following days ss and vss increased by an average of 43 and 50 respectively fig 3 this increase corresponds to the period when the total cod and color of the wastewater were increased compared with the srt of 30 d ss and vss decreased by approximately 19 and 26 respectively at the srt of 20 d fig 3 this decrease in ss and vss concentrations reached 35 and 34 respectively at srt of 10 d it was observed that the vss ss ratios ranged between 0 77 and 0 86 in the short term critical flux test an increase in tmp was observed at a flux of 30 lmh as a result the critical flux was decided to be between 20 and 30 lmh no fouling was observed in the mbr throughout the operation due to subcritical flux operation 1 5 lmh and tmp remained below 10 mbar throughout the study fig s2 srf provides information on sludge filterability and compaction capacity of the cake layer 53 in this study the average srf was 5 1014 1 73 1014 m kg 5 71 1014 1 07 1014 m kg and 8 34 1014 2 39 1014 m kg at srts of 30 20 and 10 d a significant increase in srf occurred especially at srt of 10 d this may be due to the increase in colloidal substances in the system due to the decreased srt and the pore blocking of the membrane with the colloidal organics in the study conducted with synthetic textile wastewater with sequential anaerobic and aerobic mbrs the averages of srf and cst were measured as 1 33 0 4 1014 m kg and 27 9 s at srts of infinite 60 d and 30 d in an aerobic mbr and it was reported that there was no correlation between srt and the srf and cst values 18 supernatant filterability is about the presence of substances that causes mainly pore blocking 39 it was observed that the srf increased by 1 7 times as the srt decreased from 30 d to 10 d no significant change was observed in the sf by decreasing the srt from 30 d to 10 d and it remained between 0 77 and 0 86 ml min the average viscosities of the sludge were 2 85 0 11 2 48 0 1 and 2 17 0 11 cp respectively at srts of 30 20 and 10 d as expected sludge viscosity increases at high ss concentrations in the mbr 54 during the first 127 days at an srt of 30 d svi and cst were 71 39 ml g and 20 2 s respectively fig 3 subsequently svi and cst increased to 257 ml g and 86 s respectively and both parameters showed a fluctuating pattern at an srt of 30 d svi and cst were measured as 100 44 ml g and 31 12 s respectively at an srt of 20 d by reducing the srt to 10 d in the mbr the svi increased from 76 19 ml g to 174 53 ml g in the last days of the period while the cst remained at 44 9 s during this period hence no exact correlation between svi and cst was observed in a study conducted for the treatment of chromium containing synthetic textile wastewater a dynamic membrane bioreactor was operated under intermittent aeration conditions at an srt of 60 d the mbr was constantly aerated and no chrome was added during the first two periods in these periods the srf was measured as 2 2 1012 m kg also it was reported that cst and svi values were not affected by the changes in operating conditions and were measured as 21 42 2 9 s and 90 32 ml g respectively throughout the study 55 the average smp in the supernatant ranged between 31 and 36 mg cod l at all the srts approximately 53 35 and 46 of the smp in the supernatant were rejected by the membrane and or cake layer at the srts of 30 20 and 10 d respectively eps averaged 33 3 31 4 and 41 7 mg cod g vss at the srts of 30 20 and 10 d respectively although eps production changed depending on the srt the content of eps in terms of carbohydrates and protein was not changed in the mbrs tightly bound eps was between 64 and 68 while loosely bound eps was between 36 and 32 in addition it was observed that the carbohydrate and protein contents of the produced smp and eps were close to each other even at different srts fig 4 while the carbohydrate content of smp in the supernatant ranged from 74 to 82 it decreased to approximately 67 73 in the permeate the highest protein content was detected in loosely bound eps it ranged from 65 to 70 at all the srts the carbohydrate and protein content of the tightly bound eps were 51 60 and 40 49 respectively for all srt values in a study without srt information the textile wastewater treatment performances and effect of hrts and powdered activated carbon pac addition were investigated in sequential anaerobic moving bed bioreactor anmbbr and aerobic mbr in the absence of pac addition the carbohydrate content of smps in the supernatant and permeate were 32 83 and 25 48 mg l while the protein content of smps was 4 1 and 3 7 mg l respectively the carbohydrate and protein contents of eps were reported as 7 16 and 1 17 mg g mlvss 27 and it was lower than those obtained in this study it has been reported that the amount of eps decreases as srt increases 17 56 in this study eps increased from 31 mg cod g vss to 41 mg cod g vss especially by reducing srt to 10 d gel permeation chromatography gpc was used to measure the molecular weight and presence of the organic substances in the wastewater and permeate fig 5 in gpc analyses four main peaks were observed in the wastewater corresponding to 30 10 2 6 and 0 3 kda molecular weights in the permeate only three peaks were observed corresponding to 20 3 and 0 57 kda at an srt of 30 d the peaks observed during the srt of 20 d correspond to approximately 21 2 8 1 and 0 47 kda also similar peaks were obtained at an srt of 10 d corresponding to 22 3 7 1 4 and 0 5 kda no peak corresponding to 1 kda was observed at the srt of 30 d there is a significant difference between the peak heights observed in gpc analyses depending on the srt in particular the peak signals corresponding to low molecular weight organic compounds decreased as srt decreased therefore the amount of low molecular weight smp may be higher at longer srts 3 5 impact of srt on observed yield and daily sludge waste in mbr the variations of the calculated specific energy requirement and yobs values concerning employed srts are plotted in fig 6 at constant hrt a high amount of sludge was retained in the bioreactor and low sludge yields yobs were attained at high srts conversely a lower amount of sludge was retained which results in a high sludge amount to be further handled at shorter srts in the study yobs values increased with decreasing srt as it was calculated as 0 125 0 192 and 0 314 mg ss mg cod at srts of 30 20 and 10 d respectively in a study investigating petrochemical wastewater treatment in aerobic mbr yobs values were reported as 0 614 0 165 g vss g cod 0 521 0 0864 g vss g cod and 0 441 0 0997 g vss g cod at srts of 10 20 and 30 d 57 in a study by castellanos et al 2021 nutrient removal for domestic wastewater was studied in the aerobic granular sludge system and the biomass yield coefficient y was reported as 0 48 g vss g cod 0 61 g vss g cod and 0 68 g vss g cod at srt of 30 d 20 d and 15 d 58 although the sludge amount to be handled increases at short srts it may be preferable if the excess sludge is used for energy generation as illustrated in fig 6 the generated sludge amount increased almost 2 5 times as srt decreased from 30 to 10 d it is well known that as the srt decreases the specific amount of methane generation during anaerobic digestion of the sludge increases significantly 59 bolzonella et al 60 reported that the specific biogas generation increased significantly from 0 07 m3 kg vssfed to 0 18 m3 kg vssfed as srt decreased from 35 to 8 d hence low srt may be preferred to generate energy from waste sludge without sacrificing the desired treatment performance 3 6 impact of srt on oxygen and energy requirement in mbr the specific energy requirement is expected to increase with srt as a result of higher biomass concentrations in the bioreactor sÃ¶zen et al 61 determined the specific energy requirement for an srt of 4 d was 0 25 kwh m3 whereas the same for an srt of 25 d was estimated between 0 45 and 0 52 kwh m3 it has been reported that the total energy requirement in aerobic mbr is between 0 6 and 1 2 kwh m3 of which approximately 30 40 for aeration 62 in our study the specific aeration energy requirement for biological oxidation only was estimated as 0 22 0 35 kwh m3 in the studied srt range the lowest srt of 10 d exerted the lowest energy requirement which was 37 and 31 lower than the srt of 30 d and 20 d respectively fig 6 linear relationships between srt and both specific energy requirement r2 0 90 and yobs r2 0 97 were observed as srt decreased from 30 d to 10 d sludge generation increased around 2 5 times and the energy requirement for aeration decreased by 37 hence considering the energy requirement for biological treatment shorter srt values can be chosen without sacrificing treatment performance especially if excess sludge is to be used for energy generation the specific energy for permeation was calculated as 0 0083 kwh m3 additional energy will also be required for course bubble air scouring if the membranes are located in a separate membrane tank energy requirement in this case will completely depend on the airflow rate which may be decided by membrane fouling propensities in a recent study the aeration requirement for physical cleaning by air scouring of a ceramic membrane used as flocculation assisted direct filtration was reported to be 0 082 kwh m3 63 hence total specific energy requirements including biological treatment air scouring of the membranes and permeation at srts of 30 20 and 10 d were estimated as 0 44 0 41 and 0 31 kwh m3 respectively 4 conclusion in the study the treatment of real textile wastewater was investigated in two aerobic mbrs operated under different srts conditions 10 d 20 d and 30 d the highest cod and color removal efficiencies were observed at srt 20 d the cod removal efficiency was over 90 at all operated srts the highest color removal efficiency of 60 was achieved at an srt of 20 d which was 8 and 17 higher than the values observed at srts of 30 and 10 d respectively in addition the highest removal efficiencies by the cake layer were observed at an srt of 30 d due to the low flux no serious fouling was observed in the mbrs however srf values were increased by reducing the srt to 10 d in conclusion this study asserts that aerobic mbr operated in the srt values down to 10 d which is practically more environmental friendly than mbr operation conventionally employing very long srts is a very effective and reliable treatment option for organic carbon removal from actual composite textile effluents while being able to provide a certain level of color removal also as srt decreased the waste sludge amount increased while the energy requirement for aeration decreased the increased sludge disposal costs due to the increased amount of waste sludge at short srts may be compensated by the increased methane production if the excess sludge is anaerobically digested declaration of competing interest
