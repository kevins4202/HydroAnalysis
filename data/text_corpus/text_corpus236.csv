1180,microplastics mps defined as smaller 5 mm plastic particles have received increasing attention due to their global occurrence and potential toxicity this study investigated the effects of environmental factors rainfall intensity 13 and 29 mm h and mp characteristics morphology fiber flake and film polymer type polypropylene pp polyethylene terephthalate pet and polystyrene ps and size 100 300 300 500 and 500 1000 μm on the vertical transport of mp in unsaturated soil conditions using lab scale column experiments additionally the occurrence and characteristics of mp detected in soil sediment total 13 samples and groundwater samples total 6 samples were explored in the field study laboratory scale column experiments revealed that heavy rainfall intensity 29 mm h increased the degree of mp vertical transport in unsaturated soil conditions and mp fibers showed the greatest vertical mobility among the various morphologies of mps assessed for the polymer type and size the lighter pp polymer or the larger size of mp 500 1000 μm showed higher mobility in the field study a statistical difference in mp abundance was observed depending on the population density and degree of urban development in both soil and groundwater samples comparing to the two different types of environmental media samples obtained from the same site there was a significant difference in the composition of polymer types present while statistically no difference in mp abundance was observed between the two media samples i e soil or sediment and groundwater in addition mp fibers and polyethylene pe were predominantly detected in our two study areas these results suggest that various types of mp can pass through the unsaturated zone by water infiltration even if it takes a long time to reach groundwater overall we found that the degree of vertical transport of the mps was highly sensitive to environmental conditions and mp characteristics graphical abstract unlabelled image

mm in size that originate from tiny plastic particles such as cosmetics or body products or from the fragmentation of large plastic items via physical chemical and biological processes have been recognized as emerging contaminants of global concern since the early 2000s barnes et al 2009 thompson et al 2004 microplastic contamination has been mainly founded on marine and terrestrial environments liu et al 2022 wong et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 information on the presence and distribution of mps in the environment and understanding their transport pathways are the first step to solve the mps contamination in natural environment however up to date studies have predominantly focused on their occurrence and fate in marine and surface water systems while comparatively fewer investigations have been conducted on the behavior and distribution of mps in soil and groundwater environments panno et al 2019 re 2019 samandra et al 2022 tumwet et al 2022 wu et al 2020 as sources of mp in soil contamination mps enter soil via plastic mulching wastewater sludge as fertilizer in agricultural fields runoff from roads urban areas landfills and atmospheric deposition hatinoğlu and sanin 2021 huang et al 2020 vithanage et al 2021 they can pass through the vadose zone and even move into groundwater via water infiltration and biogenic activities such as casts and burrows lwanga et al 2017 rillig et al 2017 yu et al 2019 in addition they can be easily adsorbed by organisms leading to bioaccumulation through food webs due to smaller mp particle size and poor biodegradability sewwandi et al 2023 yee et al 2021 more importantly they can act as carriers of other contaminants such as heavy metals e g copper and zinc human pathogens e g arcobacter cryaerophilus aeromonas salmonicida and vibrio navarrensis and organic pollutants e g dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane polychlorinated biphenyls because of their strong adsorption affinity atugoda et al 2021 adsorbed contaminants can be released into the soil during the disintegration of mps into smaller ones munoz et al 2022 a various range of mps abundance and their distribution were investigated in soil and groundwater fuller and gautam 2016 reported that 0 03 7 mp by weight in topsoil near roads and industrial areas and fiber type of mps were dominantly found in arable soils in shanghai and yunnan china with 78 mp particles kg and 18 760 mp particles kg respectively liu et al 2018 zhang and liu 2018 a maximum of 15 2 mp particles l was found in karst groundwater and 12 to 54 l in karst cave water balestra and bellopede 2022 panno et al 2019 in addition 0 7 mp particles m3 and 16 97 mp particles l were detected in groundwater germany and australia respectively mintenig et al 2019 samandra et al 2022 although increasing recent attention has been paid to mp contamination in soil and groundwater there is still lack of their detailed information on abundance and transport of mps in the various subsurface environments i e populated area or remote area andrady 2018 goeppert and goldscheider 2021 re 2019 wada 2016 ranjan et al 2023 shu et al 2023 previous researches on mp transport in subsurface systems have included lab scale experiments field investigation and the application of various mathematical models gao et al 2021 goeppert and goldscheider 2021 hou et al 2020 however most of them have focused on simulating mp transport under saturated groundwater systems and the information on their transport under unsaturated zone has been still less available given that mp deposited on the soil can pass through vadose zone and reaching to groundwater it is necessary to investigate their vertical transport from unsaturated soil to groundwater therefore this study hypothesizes that the abundance of mps in soil and groundwater systems is highly influenced by the characteristics of sampling locations including population density and degree of urbanization additionally the vertical transport of mps may be affected by both the characteristics of the mps themselves and their surrounding environment thus the objectives of this study were twofold firstly to investigate the vertical transport of mps in vadose zone according to various factors using the laboratory scale column experiments and simultaneously to assess the potential for vertical transport of mps in two different fields taking into account their population density and degree of urbanization for the unsaturated lab scale column studies given that the vertical transport of mps might be significantly affected the characteristics of mps and the influencing factors for the vertical transport of mps were classified into two categories i environmental factor such as rainfall intensity and ii mp characteristics shape fibers from pes and films from pe and polymer type polypropylene pp polyethylene terephthalate pet and polystyrene ps and size 100 300 300 500 and 500 1000 μm using fragmented pp additionally to gain more insight into their vertical transport we explored the abundance and characteristics of mps by collecting unsaturated soil or sediment and groundwater samples from two different land use type sites through the field investigation 2 material and methods 2 1 column experiments setup fragment shapes of pp 100 1000 μm purity 100 pet 100 1000 μm purity 100 and ps 100 1000 μm purity 100 were purchased from mj powder in south korea the mp fibers and film shapes of mps were prepared by cutting pes garments and pe stretch film 0 08 mm thickness using scissors and sieving mps with different sizes of mesh e g 100 300 500 and 1000 μm accordingly two different types of transparent pvc columns column type 1 and type 2 were used in accordance with the experimental purpose keller et al 2019 shaniv et al 2021 wu et al 2020 a column with an inner diameter id of 80 mm and height of 220 mm was used as column type 1 to assess the effect of rainfall intensity on the vertical transport of mps in unsaturated soil systems fig 1 a the bottom 1 cm of the column was filled with 0 75 1 00 mm glass beads to ensure uniform effluent discharge sand 1 18 2 00 mm was used as the soil medium and packed to a density of 1 36 g cm3 from the surface of the glass beads for the effect of rainfall intensity pp fragment shape 100 1000 μm was used with 2 7 g and introduced 1 cm below the top surface of the sand to prevent the mps from floating due to their light density then the pp mps were covered with sand 1 cm we confirmed the absence of mps in deionized di water based on the previous other study ranjan et al 2020 which was used to simulate rainfall the di water was distributed onto the soil surface through five teflon tubes 2 mm id using a multichannel peristaltic pump masterflex il usa at flow rates of 50 ml h or 110 ml h corresponding to rainfall intensities of 13 mm h and 29 mm h respectively these rainfall intensities were categorized as moderate and heavy respectively based on the reports of the united kingdom meteorological office ukmo 2007 and previous other studies llasat 2001 varikoden et al 2010 yakubu et al 2016 yang et al 2011 two electrical conductivity ec 5 volumetric water content sensors meter group wa usa were inserted into the middle of the column to verify the unsaturated soil conditions fig 1 a and fig s1 over the 14 day rainfall simulation period leaching water from the column type 1 was continuously collected and the number of mps present was quantified which was assumed to represent groundwater at the end of the rainfall simulation period 14 days 5 g of sand was vertically sampled from the column at regular intervals 3 6 cm starting from the 5th layer to the 1st layer as indicated by the red points in fig 1 a the collected sand samples 5 g were analyzed to determine the number of mps trapped at different depths within the column as illustrated in fig 1 a subsequently the subsampled sand was homogeneously mixed dried and stored in an air tight desiccator to prevent contamination prior to analysis the quantified mps in the subsampled sand correspond to the number of mps deposited in the targeted soil layer the effect of mp characteristics was assessed using a pvc column with 30 mm id and 165 mm height column type 2 as shown in fig 1 b to evaluate the impact of mp morphology on their vertical transport 0 3 g of each of three shapes of mps fiber flake and film each ranging from 300 to 500 μm in size were used thus totaling 0 9 g of mps after thorough mixing the 0 9 g of mps were introduced into the column type 2 at a depth of 1 cm from the top of the column following the methods described by o connor et al 2019 and zhang et al 2022 the remaining space of the column was packed with sand ranging in size from 1 18 to 2 00 mm which served as the column type 1 for the mps size effect on the vertical transport of mps 0 3 g each of pp with different size i e 100 300 300 500 and 500 1000 μm were used similarly to evaluate the effect of polymer type 0 3 g of each pet pp and ps mp particles total 0 9 g of the same size range 300 500 μm were applied in the same manner there may have been some variation in the initial number of mps introduced to each column experiment due to differences in their density despite using the same mass of mps however previous research found no significant correlation between initial mp concentration and maximum mp penetration depth o connor et al 2019 therefore it was assumed that the initial number of mps had minimal effect on the vertical transport of mps in this study experiments using the column type 2 were conducted to simulate steady state unsaturated flow conditions as described by brusseau et al 2007 and 2015 the column was oriented vertically first fully saturated with di water and then drained by removing the top cap after drainage was completed the column was recapped and subjected to a constant downward flow rate of 110 ml h using connected peristaltic pumps at both the inlet and outlet to maintain unsaturated soil condition throughout the entire reaction time fig 1 b the unsaturated soil conditions were visually confirmed all column experiments were performed for 14 days to ensure enough period of vertical movement and avoid any potential effects of different initial number of mps during the column type 2 experiments effluent was collected over 14 days and the quantity of mps in the effluent was measured to quantitatively compare the impact of each factor in the column type 2 experiments the number of mps present in the outflow solution was compared and the used sand in both column type 1 and type 2 experiments included 2 5 organic matter om and 2 31 total fe amount 2 2 study area and sampling soil sediment and groundwater samples were collected from two different sites in south korea ilsan and songjiho to investigate the effect of population density and degree of industrialization on the abundance of mps in soil and groundwater the samples were collected from areas with the same land use e g agriculture land use but with differing levels of urbanization ilsan an urban sit located near the capital city of seoul south korea with a population density of 6991 people km2 in contrast songjiho site located near the ocean belongs to a suburban area with a much lower population density of 41 people km2 the locations and sampling points for both sites are shown in fig 2 at ilsan site goyang si gyeonggi do three different soil samples n 3 named s 1 s 3 and two groundwater samples n 2 named gw 1 and gw 2 were collected in may and june 2020 respectively at the ilsan site 500 g of soil samples were collected from 10 cm below the soil surface using stainless steel shovel after skimming off solid impurities groundwater samples were obtained from agricultural bore wells that are used for irrigation with a sampling volume of 2 l this sample volume was chosen based on previous studies that used similar volumes panno et al 2019 samandra et al 2022 shu et al 2023 a sample volume of 2 l was considered enough to allow for accurate detection of mps in the groundwater samples detailed information on groundwater sampling wells was included in table s1 the well was purged by pumping for 5 min prior to sampling to remove standing water groundwater was sampled from an unconfined aquifer with different dept table s1 soil and groundwater samples were collected and stored in sterilized pe bottles that had been pre rinsed with mp free di water samandra et al 2022 at the songjiho lagoon site in goseong gun gangwon do four 2 l groundwater samples n 4 named gw 3 gw 6 were collected from groundwater wells near the lagoon using a low rate peristaltic pump in june 2021 and ten sediment samples inside the lagoon n 10 named s 4 s 13 considering groundwater flow direction were collected using an ekman birge grab sampler in august 2021 all samples obtained from the songjiho lagoon site were stored in glass or pe bottles and we confirmed that the use of pe bottles had a negligible effect on mp contamination compared to glass containers in this study table s2 in addition all sample container washed with mp free di water prior to use can effectively reduce contamination and handled as an ideal sampling and storage approach in previous studies for qa qc goeppert and goldscheider 2021 koelmans et al 2019 kosuth et al 2018 panno et al 2019 samandra et al 2022 shu et al 2023 talvitie et al 2015 and the chemical properties of soil sediment and groundwater were summarized in tables s3 s5 2 3 mp analyses and statistics for pretreatment of mp analyses the collected soil sediment samples 1 g for field study and 5 g for lab scale column studies were oven dried at 70 c for 24 h 100 ml of h2o2 34 5 h2o2 w w was then added to them and mixed at 200 rpm at 25 0 5 c for 24 h to remove the om tagg et al 2017 2020 after complete oxidation was visually confirmed all the samples were filtered polycarbonate pcfe filters 20 μm pore size and 47 mm diameter filters to remove all residues mp separation was performed using the density separation method developed by imhof et al 2012 the filtered soil samples were added to 100 ml of 5 136 m zncl2 1 6 g cm3 and stirred at 150 rpm for 10 min and held for 2 h in a 100 ml borosilicate glass cylinder to settle the supernatant was transferred to another fresh zncl2 solution and this process was repeated three times to collect all possible floating mps imhof et al 2012 the last supernatant was filtered after which the plastic like particles placed on the filter were stored in an air desiccator prior to analysis to simultaneously minimize air contamination and dry the samples the aqueous samples including groundwater samples 2 l collected from the field sites and the effluent samples from the column experiment were filtered using a 105 μm sieve on doing so we observed mps larger than 100 μm the filtered samples were mixed with 300 ml of di water and h2o2 solution 34 5 wt 1 1 ratio v v at 60 c for 24 h kang et al 2020 tagg et al 2017 a density separation step was not required because of low solid contents in groundwater samples the oxidized aqueous samples were then filtered again using the pcfe filters and stored prior to analysis after all purification processes were completed the number of mps captured was quantified by following the nile red plate method using a stereoscopic microscope discovery v8 carl zeiss oberkochen germany emitting uv light 365 nm in the dark as described by kang et al 2020 for qualitative analysis of the mps their characteristics were analyzed using a ft ir with a microscope in transmission mode spotlight 400 perkin elmer waltham ma usa for the ft ir analysis a stainless filter 47 mm diameter 10 μm pore size was used instead of pcfe filters to minimize background interference all particles placed on the stainless filters were scanned in mapping and transmission modes in the range of 675 4000 cm 1 at 8 cm 1 resolution for a total 16 scans the detected spectra were identified and compared with the spectra of plastic standards provided in the perkin elmer software library perkin elmer spectrum version 10 5 1 to assess their accuracy when the matching score was above 0 65 the particles were understood to be plastic particles the mann whitney u test which is suitable for analyzing non normally distributed data and small sample sizes was used for all statistical analyses to determine the significant difference between the results of each sample using excel 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 vertical transport of mps in unsaturated soil columns 3 1 1 effect of rainfall intensity the two different simulated rainfall intensities i e 13 and 29 mm h promoted mps vertical mobility and caused extensive distribution of mps in unsaturated soil columns fig 3 regardless of the rainfall intensities most of mps was remained in the top soil layer which is a 3 4 cm depth of soil in both conditions as shown in fig 3 rainfall intensity of 29 mm h which is the representative of heavy rain caused a wide distribution of mps in whole soil layer with 65 mps detected in the effluent however a large portion of the mps was concentrated till a depth of only 3 4 cm soil layer with the rainfall intensity of 13 mm h representing moderate rainfall and only 2 of mp particles were detected in the effluent the vertical mobility of mps through soil pores in unsaturated system can occur by infiltration resulting from rainfall this result suggests that both 13 mm h and 29 mm h of rainfall intensity were able to move mps up to 18 cm of soil depth for 14 operation days furthermore this means that vertical transport of mps by rainfall could cause the mps contamination in groundwater in addition the heavy rainfall intensity could accelerate the degree of mp transport by reducing the attraction force between the mps and the air water interface among the different interface i e air water and soil water interfaces of unsaturated soil systems the air water interface is believed to play a significant role in retaining mps in unsaturated soil flury and aramrak 2017 karnieli et al 2018 this is because the sorption of hydrophobic particles onto the air water interface is almost irreversible under unsaturated soil conditions due to capillary forces and their hydrophobicity ducker et al 1994 wan and tokunaga 2002 furthermore the flow of mps at the air water interface can occur when the interfacial tension of mps is reduced by increasing the degree of water saturation torkzaban et al 2010 tosco et al 2009 and reported that repeated wet dry cycling increased the depth of mp penetration owing to the expansion of the water film o connor et al 2019 however other studies have reported that the vertical mobility of mps initially increased with increasing rainfall intensity but then decreased resulting in a maximum migration depth of 4 cm at 5 mm d and 7 cm and 6 cm at 15 mm d and 25 mm d respectively zhang et al 2022 therefore while this study observed the wide distribution of mps with increasing rainfall intensity due to reduction in interfacial tension of mps the relationship between maximum migration depth and rainfall intensity may not always be consistent and requires further investigation 3 1 2 effect of mp characteristics morphology size and polymer type the impact of the three different mp properties morphology size and polymer type on the vertical transport of the mps in the unsaturated soil column was evaluated fig 4a c for the morphology we compared the difference in mp mobility among three different shape groups including fiber flake and film the fiber shape mps were detected to be the largest amount i e 15 mps l in the effluent solutions followed by the flake and film shape of mps with 12 mps l and no detection respectively fig 4 a this is consistent with the other research performed in soil box system zhang et al 2022 it is known that mp fibers can easily lose their orientation along the fluid flow direction owing to their physical characteristics which makes them readily mobile in soil this is true even for long mp fibers which overcoming their straining effect brewer et al 2020 keller et al 2020 for the effect of mp size we found that the smaller mp size 100 300 μm were less detected in the effluents while 6 times more mps with 500 1000 μm being detected fig 4 b this result is discordant with previous studies that reported that smaller sized mps showed higher mobility and were relatively predominant in soil and groundwater systems o connor et al 2019 rillig et al 2017 shaniv et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 regarding small sized mps gravity and buoyancy are considered to have negligible effects on their horizontal and vertical transport instead it is known that the interfacial tension that causes aggregation plays a significant role in these particles movement horton et al 2017a sharma et al 2008 the aggregation of mps which occur while traveling in unsaturated soil can be divided into two categories homogenous aggregation between mp and mp particles and heterogeneous aggregation between mps and non plastic particles such as soil yan et al 2021 considering that sand having little om and metal oxides was used as a porous medium in this study it is likely that homogenous aggregation may have predominantly occurred affecting the vertical transport of mps in homogenous aggregation it is known that larger mps have greater stability and less aggregative tendencies than smaller mps under the same water conditions because of their diminished surface area phillippe and schaumann 2014 song et al 2019 also relatively higher mps concentration i e number of mps for smaller size caused by same amounts 0 9 g of initial mps in our study might result in more aggregation effect therefore the larger mps are the higher mobility was observed in this study for other studies showing smaller size of mps having higher mobility than large size of mps they used intentionally prepared mps synthesized mps whereas this study used pure mps 100 purity the preparation process of mps such as mechanical cutting and artificial weathering can affect their physicochemical properties such as chemical composition crystallinity surface chemistry with increasing negative charge formation of carbonyl groups on their surface and sorption capacity liu et al 2019 mao et al 2020 therefore synthesized mps may exhibit the behavior of mp aggregation differently with that of pure mps leading to disparate results in terms of size effect while assessing the effects of polymer type on the vertical transport of mps pp ρ 0 855 0 945 g cm3 which is the lightest polymer used in this study was found to be predominant in the effluent showing abundance of 37 mps l as compared to 12 and 5 mps l for ps ρ 0 960 1 050 g cm3 and pet ρ 1 380 g cm3 respectively fig 4 c however o connor et al 2019 found that heavier pe mps exhibited deeper migration mobility than lighter pp mps which contracts with the findings of this study this discrepancy may be attributed to differences in the water flow rate used specifically it is possible that fast enough water flow rate can wash out the lighter mps by flowing water while slow water flow can allow them to float and remain in soil pores therefore this study suggests that heavy mps may have a higher tendency to remain in soil pores once they are deposited while the applied flow rate of water readily wash out the light mps 3 2 field evidence for mps in subsurface systems their abundance and characteristics we compared the abundance and type of mps in unsaturated soil or saturated sediment and groundwater samples from two different field sites i e ilsan and songjiho sites in fig 5 a statistically higher number of mps was detected in ilsan site for both soil and groundwater samples than from songjiho site p 0 05 at the ilsan site 14 23 mps g and 12 24 mps l were observed in soil and groundwater respectively and 1 14 mps g and 2 4 mps l for sediment and groundwater in songjiho site were detected respectively fig 5 a and b numbers of mps in ilsan groundwater samples was relatively high and similar that reported in other studies e g karst groundwater in illinois us 6 4 mps l as n 16 and unconfined groundwater in victoria australia 38 8 mps l as avg n 7 panno et al 2019 samandra et al 2022 considering that the ilsan site is a more developed urban area with a heavily dense population contamination ilsan area 6991 people km2 and songjiho area 40 54 people km2 and vigorous industrial activity than songjiho which is a mountainous region it may be home to relatively higher plastic similarly other studies also exhibit that the distribution of mps in both river water and sediment is highly affected by the land use types soltani et al 2022 huang et al 2021 more specifically soltani et al 2022 showed that statistically highest contamination of mp in river water and sediment samples 68 and 69 abundance respectively were observed in urban area following by industrial agricultural and natural area and higher mp contamination levels were found in commercial public recreational areas compared to those in natural areas of the west river in china huang et al 2021 the observation on total 10 samples of sediment throughout songjiho lagoon showed that the average mp concentration was 6 1 4 56 particle of g of dry sediment which is slightly high concentration compared to previous researches on river sediments the number of mp particles detected per 100 g of river sediment in iran four samples bonyadi et al 2022 southern england horton et al 2017b indonesia alam and rachmawati 2022 china peng et al 2017 south korea eo et al 2019 has been observed 0 8 2 82 66 1 59 3 03 0 8 and 1 97 0 06 respectively especially relatively high mp number was observed at site s4 and s8 which are inside of lagoon and s13 which are connected to ocean although this lagoon has been naturally conserved for a long time the decomposition of mps in sediment over time and which seems cause to increase their number in sediment zhang et al 2017 in groundwater near lagoon the mp concentration was reported to be 3 5 1 2 mps l and this number is relatively low compared to previous other studies balestra et al 2023 panno et al 2019 samandra et al 2022 in a comparison of mp abundance between soil and groundwater samples obtained from the same location there was no significant difference between the mp abundance in the two media i e soil and groundwater at both sites p 0 05 in ilsan 18 7 5 mps g in the soil and 18 8 4 mps l in the groundwater were detected and 6 1 4 6 mps g and 3 5 1 2 mps l were found in the sediment and groundwater samples obtained from songjiho respectively even though sediment samples showed the higher average concentration in songiho lagoon although it has been assumed that soil may function as a sink and not a path for mps because of the filtration process this result suggests that various mps can pass through the vadose zone reaching groundwater even after a long time amrutha and warrier 2020 viaroli et al 2022 with respect to the characteristics of mps detected pe was prevailingly found in soil and groundwater samples in ilsan site fig 6 a however pp was detected as the predominant polymer type and equal amounts of pe and ps were found in the songjiho groundwater samples while pe was mainly detected showing 60 in sediment in songjiho fig 6 b the pe polymers such as plastic bags and mulch vinyl are commonly used as films therefore the dominance of pe mps at both sites could possibly be attributed to vinyl mulching as both sides see intensive owing agricultural land use the type and feature of mps could determine their density and the form of fiber or filament are more buoyant and difficult to settle in water bonyadi et al 2022 with regards to mp morphology various forms of mps such as flake film and fiber form were detected in all samples figs 7 and 8 interestingly the abundance of mp shapes was ranked as fiber film flake in both soil and groundwater sample of ilsan site and fiber 49 flake 34 film 17 in sediment whereas fiber 58 flake 21 film 21 in groundwater of songjiho site fig 8 among them the mp fibers with 160 2263 μm size were the most predominantly observed in both media regardless of sampling location fig 8 a d the highest fiber form mp concentration in sediment was reported in other studies abidli et al 2017 also fiber and film mps showed their high mobility in other study zhang et al 2022 and this is consistent with our result from column experiments fig 4 a the abundance and migration of mps could be affected by population density rainfall and hydrodynamic characteristic in sites 4 conclusion this study systematically assessed the vertical transport of mps in unsaturated soil systems using lab scale column experiments and field studies by investigating mp abundance and their characteristics when taken from soil sediment and groundwater samples the lab scale study revealed that increasing rainfall intensity accelerated the degree of vertical transport of mps showing mp fibers and pp mps with the greatest vertical mobility among the assessed mps unlike in previous studies higher mobility of mps with corresponded with greater mp size in our study this was potentially due to the differences in types of porous media and mps used between our study and previous studies with the field studies there was an evident difference in the mp abundance in both soil and groundwater samples depending on the sampling location however little difference was observed between the two media samples at the same location regarding the mp characteristics found in the field studies mp fibers and pe mps were mainly detected in both soil and groundwater samples through both laboratory and field scale studies we found that the vertical transport of mps was highly affected by environmental conditions such as rainfall intensity and mp characteristics owing to their solid nature therefore the discrepancy between the results observed in this study and those of other studies should be addressed by conducting further studies under more complex and or blended conditions although this study used a relatively large grain size of sand to diminish the operation period soils containing naturally occurring metal oxides and om should be considered to better understand real world vertical transport distribution of mps in addition evaluation of a single mp characteristic alone may be limited in completely explaining mp transport hence understanding the combined effect of multiple factors and weathering fragmentation of mps is needed to understand mp transport in subsurface environments author statement saerom park study conceptualization and

sediment total 13 samples and groundwater samples total 6 samples were explored in the field study laboratory scale column experiments revealed that heavy rainfall intensity 29 mm h increased the

composition of polymer types present while statistically no difference in mp abundance was observed between the two media samples i e soil or sediment and groundwater in addition mp fibers and polyethylene pe were predominantly detected in our two study areas these results suggest that various types of mp can pass through the unsaturated zone by water infiltration even if it takes a long time to reach groundwater overall we found that the degree of vertical transport of the mps was highly sensitive to environmental conditions and mp characteristics graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords rainfall morphology size polymer type unsaturated soil groundwater data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microplastics mps which are particles smaller than 5 mm in size that originate from tiny plastic particles such as cosmetics or body products or from the fragmentation of large plastic items via physical chemical and biological processes have been recognized as emerging contaminants of global concern since the early 2000s barnes et al 2009 thompson et al 2004 microplastic contamination has been mainly founded on marine and terrestrial environments liu et al 2022 wong et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 information on the presence and distribution of mps in the environment and understanding their transport pathways are the first step to solve the mps contamination in natural environment however up to date studies have predominantly focused on their occurrence and fate in marine and surface water systems while comparatively fewer investigations have been conducted on the behavior and distribution of mps in soil and groundwater environments panno et al 2019 re 2019 samandra et al 2022 tumwet et al 2022 wu et al 2020 as sources of mp in soil contamination mps enter soil via plastic mulching wastewater sludge as fertilizer in agricultural fields runoff from roads urban areas landfills and atmospheric deposition hatinoğlu and sanin 2021 huang et al 2020 vithanage et al 2021 they can pass through the vadose zone and even move into groundwater via water infiltration and biogenic activities such as casts and burrows lwanga et al 2017 rillig et al 2017 yu et al 2019 in addition they can be easily adsorbed by organisms leading to bioaccumulation through food webs due to smaller mp particle size and poor biodegradability sewwandi et al 2023 yee et al 2021 more importantly they can act as carriers of other contaminants such as heavy metals e g copper and zinc human pathogens e g arcobacter cryaerophilus aeromonas salmonicida and vibrio navarrensis and organic pollutants e g dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane polychlorinated biphenyls because of their strong adsorption affinity atugoda et al 2021 adsorbed contaminants can be released into the soil during the disintegration of mps into smaller ones munoz et al 2022 a various range of mps abundance and their distribution were investigated in soil and groundwater fuller and gautam 2016 reported that 0 03 7 mp by weight in topsoil near roads and industrial areas and fiber type of mps were dominantly found in arable soils in shanghai and yunnan china with 78 mp particles kg and 18 760 mp particles kg respectively liu et al 2018 zhang and liu 2018 a maximum of 15 2 mp particles l was found in karst groundwater and 12 to 54 l in karst cave water balestra and bellopede 2022 panno et al 2019 in addition 0 7 mp particles m3 and 16 97 mp particles l were detected in groundwater germany and australia respectively mintenig et al 2019 samandra et al 2022 although increasing recent attention has been paid to mp contamination in soil and groundwater there is still lack of their detailed information on abundance and transport of mps in the various subsurface environments i e populated area or remote area andrady 2018 goeppert and goldscheider 2021 re 2019 wada 2016 ranjan et al 2023 shu et al 2023 previous researches on mp transport in subsurface systems have included lab scale experiments field investigation and the application of various mathematical models gao et al 2021 goeppert and goldscheider 2021 hou et al 2020 however most of them have focused on simulating mp transport under saturated groundwater systems and the information on their transport under unsaturated zone has been still less available given that mp deposited on the soil can pass through vadose zone and reaching to groundwater it is necessary to investigate their vertical transport from unsaturated soil to groundwater therefore this study hypothesizes that the abundance of mps in soil and groundwater systems is highly influenced by the characteristics of sampling locations including population density and degree of urbanization additionally the vertical transport of mps may be affected by both the characteristics of the mps themselves and their surrounding environment thus the objectives of this study were twofold firstly to investigate the vertical transport of mps in vadose zone according to various factors using the laboratory scale column experiments and simultaneously to assess the potential for vertical transport of mps in two different fields taking into account their population density and degree of urbanization for the unsaturated lab scale column studies given that the vertical transport of mps might be significantly affected the characteristics of mps and the influencing factors for the vertical transport of mps were classified into two categories i environmental factor such as rainfall intensity and ii mp characteristics shape fibers from pes and films from pe and polymer type polypropylene pp polyethylene terephthalate pet and polystyrene ps and size 100 300 300 500 and 500 1000 μm using fragmented pp additionally to gain more insight into their vertical transport we explored the abundance and characteristics of mps by collecting unsaturated soil or sediment and groundwater samples from two different land use type sites through the field investigation 2 material and methods 2 1 column experiments setup fragment shapes of pp 100 1000 μm purity 100 pet 100 1000 μm purity 100 and ps 100 1000 μm purity 100 were purchased from mj powder in south korea the mp fibers and film shapes of mps were prepared by cutting pes garments and pe stretch film 0 08 mm thickness using scissors and sieving mps with different sizes of mesh e g 100 300 500 and 1000 μm accordingly two different types of transparent pvc columns column type 1 and type 2 were used in accordance with the experimental purpose keller et al 2019 shaniv et al 2021 wu et al 2020 a column with an inner diameter id of 80 mm and height of 220 mm was used as column type 1 to assess the effect of rainfall intensity on the vertical transport of mps in unsaturated soil systems fig 1 a the bottom 1 cm of the column was filled with 0 75 1 00 mm glass beads to ensure uniform effluent discharge sand 1 18 2 00 mm was used as the soil medium and packed to a density of 1 36 g cm3 from the surface of the glass beads for the effect of rainfall intensity pp fragment shape 100 1000 μm was used with 2 7 g and introduced 1 cm below the top surface of the sand to prevent the mps from floating due to their light density then the pp mps were covered with sand 1 cm we confirmed the absence of mps in deionized di water based on the previous other study ranjan et al 2020 which was used to simulate rainfall the di water was distributed onto the soil surface through five teflon tubes 2 mm id using a multichannel peristaltic pump masterflex il usa at flow rates of 50 ml h or 110 ml h corresponding to rainfall intensities of 13 mm h and 29 mm h respectively these rainfall intensities were categorized as moderate and heavy respectively based on the reports of the united kingdom meteorological office ukmo 2007 and previous other studies llasat 2001 varikoden et al 2010 yakubu et al 2016 yang et al 2011 two electrical conductivity ec 5 volumetric water content sensors meter group wa usa were inserted into the middle of the column to verify the unsaturated soil conditions fig 1 a and fig s1 over the 14 day rainfall simulation period leaching water from the column type 1 was continuously collected and the number of mps present was quantified which was assumed to represent groundwater at the end of the rainfall simulation period 14 days 5 g of sand was vertically sampled from the column at regular intervals 3 6 cm starting from the 5th layer to the 1st layer as indicated by the red points in fig 1 a the collected sand samples 5 g were analyzed to determine the number of mps trapped at different depths within the column as illustrated in fig 1 a subsequently the subsampled sand was homogeneously mixed dried and stored in an air tight desiccator to prevent contamination prior to analysis the quantified mps in the subsampled sand correspond to the number of mps deposited in the targeted soil layer the effect of mp characteristics was assessed using a pvc column with 30 mm id and 165 mm height column type 2 as shown in fig 1 b to evaluate the impact of mp morphology on their vertical transport 0 3 g of each of three shapes of mps fiber flake and film each ranging from 300 to 500 μm in size were used thus totaling 0 9 g of mps after thorough mixing the 0 9 g of mps were introduced into the column type 2 at a depth of 1 cm from the top of the column following the methods described by o connor et al 2019 and zhang et al 2022 the remaining space of the column was packed with sand ranging in size from 1 18 to 2 00 mm which served as the column type 1 for the mps size effect on the vertical transport of mps 0 3 g each of pp with different size i e 100 300 300 500 and 500 1000 μm were used similarly to evaluate the effect of polymer type 0 3 g of each pet pp and ps mp particles total 0 9 g of the same size range 300 500 μm were applied in the same manner there may have been some variation in the initial number of mps introduced to each column experiment due to differences in their density despite using the same mass of mps however previous research found no significant correlation between initial mp concentration and maximum mp penetration depth o connor et al 2019 therefore it was assumed that the initial number of mps had minimal effect on the vertical transport of mps in this study experiments using the column type 2 were conducted to simulate steady state unsaturated flow conditions as described by brusseau et al 2007 and 2015 the column was oriented vertically first fully saturated with di water and then drained by removing the top cap after drainage was completed the column was recapped and subjected to a constant downward flow rate of 110 ml h using connected peristaltic pumps at both the inlet and outlet to maintain unsaturated soil condition throughout the entire reaction time fig 1 b the unsaturated soil conditions were visually confirmed all column experiments were performed for 14 days to ensure enough period of vertical movement and avoid any potential effects of different initial number of mps during the column type 2 experiments effluent was collected over 14 days and the quantity of mps in the effluent was measured to quantitatively compare the impact of each factor in the column type 2 experiments the number of mps present in the outflow solution was compared and the used sand in both column type 1 and type 2 experiments included 2 5 organic matter om and 2 31 total fe amount 2 2 study area and sampling soil sediment and groundwater samples were collected from two different sites in south korea ilsan and songjiho to investigate the effect of population density and degree of industrialization on the abundance of mps in soil and groundwater the samples were collected from areas with the same land use e g agriculture land use but with differing levels of urbanization ilsan an urban sit located near the capital city of seoul south korea with a population density of 6991 people km2 in contrast songjiho site located near the ocean belongs to a suburban area with a much lower population density of 41 people km2 the locations and sampling points for both sites are shown in fig 2 at ilsan site goyang si gyeonggi do three different soil samples n 3 named s 1 s 3 and two groundwater samples n 2 named gw 1 and gw 2 were collected in may and june 2020 respectively at the ilsan site 500 g of soil samples were collected from 10 cm below the soil surface using stainless steel shovel after skimming off solid impurities groundwater samples were obtained from agricultural bore wells that are used for irrigation with a sampling volume of 2 l this sample volume was chosen based on previous studies that used similar volumes panno et al 2019 samandra et al 2022 shu et al 2023 a sample volume of 2 l was considered enough to allow for accurate detection of mps in the groundwater samples detailed information on groundwater sampling wells was included in table s1 the well was purged by pumping for 5 min prior to sampling to remove standing water groundwater was sampled from an unconfined aquifer with different dept table s1 soil and groundwater samples were collected and stored in sterilized pe bottles that had been pre rinsed with mp free di water samandra et al 2022 at the songjiho lagoon site in goseong gun gangwon do four 2 l groundwater samples n 4 named gw 3 gw 6 were collected from groundwater wells near the lagoon using a low rate peristaltic pump in june 2021 and ten sediment samples inside the lagoon n 10 named s 4 s 13 considering groundwater flow direction were collected using an ekman birge grab sampler in august 2021 all samples obtained from the songjiho lagoon site were stored in glass or pe bottles and we confirmed that the use of pe bottles had a negligible effect on mp contamination compared to glass containers in this study table s2 in addition all sample container washed with mp free di water prior to use can effectively reduce contamination and handled as an ideal sampling and storage approach in previous studies for qa qc goeppert and goldscheider 2021 koelmans et al 2019 kosuth et al 2018 panno et al 2019 samandra et al 2022 shu et al 2023 talvitie et al 2015 and the chemical properties of soil sediment and groundwater were summarized in tables s3 s5 2 3 mp analyses and statistics for pretreatment of mp analyses the collected soil sediment samples 1 g for field study and 5 g for lab scale column studies were oven dried at 70 c for 24 h 100 ml of h2o2 34 5 h2o2 w w was then added to them and mixed at 200 rpm at 25 0 5 c for 24 h to remove the om tagg et al 2017 2020 after complete oxidation was visually confirmed all the samples were filtered polycarbonate pcfe filters 20 μm pore size and 47 mm diameter filters to remove all residues mp separation was performed using the density separation method developed by imhof et al 2012 the filtered soil samples were added to 100 ml of 5 136 m zncl2 1 6 g cm3 and stirred at 150 rpm for 10 min and held for 2 h in a 100 ml borosilicate glass cylinder to settle the supernatant was transferred to another fresh zncl2 solution and this process was repeated three times to collect all possible floating mps imhof et al 2012 the last supernatant was filtered after which the plastic like particles placed on the filter were stored in an air desiccator prior to analysis to simultaneously minimize air contamination and dry the samples the aqueous samples including groundwater samples 2 l collected from the field sites and the effluent samples from the column experiment were filtered using a 105 μm sieve on doing so we observed mps larger than 100 μm the filtered samples were mixed with 300 ml of di water and h2o2 solution 34 5 wt 1 1 ratio v v at 60 c for 24 h kang et al 2020 tagg et al 2017 a density separation step was not required because of low solid contents in groundwater samples the oxidized aqueous samples were then filtered again using the pcfe filters and stored prior to analysis after all purification processes were completed the number of mps captured was quantified by following the nile red plate method using a stereoscopic microscope discovery v8 carl zeiss oberkochen germany emitting uv light 365 nm in the dark as described by kang et al 2020 for qualitative analysis of the mps their characteristics were analyzed using a ft ir with a microscope in transmission mode spotlight 400 perkin elmer waltham ma usa for the ft ir analysis a stainless filter 47 mm diameter 10 μm pore size was used instead of pcfe filters to minimize background interference all particles placed on the stainless filters were scanned in mapping and transmission modes in the range of 675 4000 cm 1 at 8 cm 1 resolution for a total 16 scans the detected spectra were identified and compared with the spectra of plastic standards provided in the perkin elmer software library perkin elmer spectrum version 10 5 1 to assess their accuracy when the matching score was above 0 65 the particles were understood to be plastic particles the mann whitney u test which is suitable for analyzing non normally distributed data and small sample sizes was used for all statistical analyses to determine the significant difference between the results of each sample using excel 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 vertical transport of mps in unsaturated soil columns 3 1 1 effect of rainfall intensity the two different simulated rainfall intensities i e 13 and 29 mm h promoted mps vertical mobility and caused extensive distribution of mps in unsaturated soil columns fig 3 regardless of the rainfall intensities most of mps was remained in the top soil layer which is a 3 4 cm depth of soil in both conditions as shown in fig 3 rainfall intensity of 29 mm h which is the representative of heavy rain caused a wide distribution of mps in whole soil layer with 65 mps detected in the effluent however a large portion of the mps was concentrated till a depth of only 3 4 cm soil layer with the rainfall intensity of 13 mm h representing moderate rainfall and only 2 of mp particles were detected in the effluent the vertical mobility of mps through soil pores in unsaturated system can occur by infiltration resulting from rainfall this result suggests that both 13 mm h and 29 mm h of rainfall intensity were able to move mps up to 18 cm of soil depth for 14 operation days furthermore this means that vertical transport of mps by rainfall could cause the mps contamination in groundwater in addition the heavy rainfall intensity could accelerate the degree of mp transport by reducing the attraction force between the mps and the air water interface among the different interface i e air water and soil water interfaces of unsaturated soil systems the air water interface is believed to play a significant role in retaining mps in unsaturated soil flury and aramrak 2017 karnieli et al 2018 this is because the sorption of hydrophobic particles onto the air water interface is almost irreversible under unsaturated soil conditions due to capillary forces and their hydrophobicity ducker et al 1994 wan and tokunaga 2002 furthermore the flow of mps at the air water interface can occur when the interfacial tension of mps is reduced by increasing the degree of water saturation torkzaban et al 2010 tosco et al 2009 and reported that repeated wet dry cycling increased the depth of mp penetration owing to the expansion of the water film o connor et al 2019 however other studies have reported that the vertical mobility of mps initially increased with increasing rainfall intensity but then decreased resulting in a maximum migration depth of 4 cm at 5 mm d and 7 cm and 6 cm at 15 mm d and 25 mm d respectively zhang et al 2022 therefore while this study observed the wide distribution of mps with increasing rainfall intensity due to reduction in interfacial tension of mps the relationship between maximum migration depth and rainfall intensity may not always be consistent and requires further investigation 3 1 2 effect of mp characteristics morphology size and polymer type the impact of the three different mp properties morphology size and polymer type on the vertical transport of the mps in the unsaturated soil column was evaluated fig 4a c for the morphology we compared the difference in mp mobility among three different shape groups including fiber flake and film the fiber shape mps were detected to be the largest amount i e 15 mps l in the effluent solutions followed by the flake and film shape of mps with 12 mps l and no detection respectively fig 4 a this is consistent with the other research performed in soil box system zhang et al 2022 it is known that mp fibers can easily lose their orientation along the fluid flow direction owing to their physical characteristics which makes them readily mobile in soil this is true even for long mp fibers which overcoming their straining effect brewer et al 2020 keller et al 2020 for the effect of mp size we found that the smaller mp size 100 300 μm were less detected in the effluents while 6 times more mps with 500 1000 μm being detected fig 4 b this result is discordant with previous studies that reported that smaller sized mps showed higher mobility and were relatively predominant in soil and groundwater systems o connor et al 2019 rillig et al 2017 shaniv et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 regarding small sized mps gravity and buoyancy are considered to have negligible effects on their horizontal and vertical transport instead it is known that the interfacial tension that causes aggregation plays a significant role in these particles movement horton et al 2017a sharma et al 2008 the aggregation of mps which occur while traveling in unsaturated soil can be divided into two categories homogenous aggregation between mp and mp particles and heterogeneous aggregation between mps and non plastic particles such as soil yan et al 2021 considering that sand having little om and metal oxides was used as a porous medium in this study it is likely that homogenous aggregation may have predominantly occurred affecting the vertical transport of mps in homogenous aggregation it is known that larger mps have greater stability and less aggregative tendencies than smaller mps under the same water conditions because of their diminished surface area phillippe and schaumann 2014 song et al 2019 also relatively higher mps concentration i e number of mps for smaller size caused by same amounts 0 9 g of initial mps in our study might result in more aggregation effect therefore the larger mps are the higher mobility was observed in this study for other studies showing smaller size of mps having higher mobility than large size of mps they used intentionally prepared mps synthesized mps whereas this study used pure mps 100 purity the preparation process of mps such as mechanical cutting and artificial weathering can affect their physicochemical properties such as chemical composition crystallinity surface chemistry with increasing negative charge formation of carbonyl groups on their surface and sorption capacity liu et al 2019 mao et al 2020 therefore synthesized mps may exhibit the behavior of mp aggregation differently with that of pure mps leading to disparate results in terms of size effect while assessing the effects of polymer type on the vertical transport of mps pp ρ 0 855 0 945 g cm3 which is the lightest polymer used in this study was found to be predominant in the effluent showing abundance of 37 mps l as compared to 12 and 5 mps l for ps ρ 0 960 1 050 g cm3 and pet ρ 1 380 g cm3 respectively fig 4 c however o connor et al 2019 found that heavier pe mps exhibited deeper migration mobility than lighter pp mps which contracts with the findings of this study this discrepancy may be attributed to differences in the water flow rate used specifically it is possible that fast enough water flow rate can wash out the lighter mps by flowing water while slow water flow can allow them to float and remain in soil pores therefore this study suggests that heavy mps may have a higher tendency to remain in soil pores once they are deposited while the applied flow rate of water readily wash out the light mps 3 2 field evidence for mps in subsurface systems their abundance and characteristics we compared the abundance and type of mps in unsaturated soil or saturated sediment and groundwater samples from two different field sites i e ilsan and songjiho sites in fig 5 a statistically higher number of mps was detected in ilsan site for both soil and groundwater samples than from songjiho site p 0 05 at the ilsan site 14 23 mps g and 12 24 mps l were observed in soil and groundwater respectively and 1 14 mps g and 2 4 mps l for sediment and groundwater in songjiho site were detected respectively fig 5 a and b numbers of mps in ilsan groundwater samples was relatively high and similar that reported in other studies e g karst groundwater in illinois us 6 4 mps l as n 16 and unconfined groundwater in victoria australia 38 8 mps l as avg n 7 panno et al 2019 samandra et al 2022 considering that the ilsan site is a more developed urban area with a heavily dense population contamination ilsan area 6991 people km2 and songjiho area 40 54 people km2 and vigorous industrial activity than songjiho which is a mountainous region it may be home to relatively higher plastic similarly other studies also exhibit that the distribution of mps in both river water and sediment is highly affected by the land use types soltani et al 2022 huang et al 2021 more specifically soltani et al 2022 showed that statistically highest contamination of mp in river water and sediment samples 68 and 69 abundance respectively were observed in urban area following by industrial agricultural and natural area and higher mp contamination levels were found in commercial public recreational areas compared to those in natural areas of the west river in china huang et al 2021 the observation on total 10 samples of sediment throughout songjiho lagoon showed that the average mp concentration was 6 1 4 56 particle of g of dry sediment which is slightly high concentration compared to previous researches on river sediments the number of mp particles detected per 100 g of river sediment in iran four samples bonyadi et al 2022 southern england horton et al 2017b indonesia alam and rachmawati 2022 china peng et al 2017 south korea eo et al 2019 has been observed 0 8 2 82 66 1 59 3 03 0 8 and 1 97 0 06 respectively especially relatively high mp number was observed at site s4 and s8 which are inside of lagoon and s13 which are connected to ocean although this lagoon has been naturally conserved for a long time the decomposition of mps in sediment over time and which seems cause to increase their number in sediment zhang et al 2017 in groundwater near lagoon the mp concentration was reported to be 3 5 1 2 mps l and this number is relatively low compared to previous other studies balestra et al 2023 panno et al 2019 samandra et al 2022 in a comparison of mp abundance between soil and groundwater samples obtained from the same location there was no significant difference between the mp abundance in the two media i e soil and groundwater at both sites p 0 05 in ilsan 18 7 5 mps g in the soil and 18 8 4 mps l in the groundwater were detected and 6 1 4 6 mps g and 3 5 1 2 mps l were found in the sediment and groundwater samples obtained from songjiho respectively even though sediment samples showed the higher average concentration in songiho lagoon although it has been assumed that soil may function as a sink and not a path for mps because of the filtration process this result suggests that various mps can pass through the vadose zone reaching groundwater even after a long time amrutha and warrier 2020 viaroli et al 2022 with respect to the characteristics of mps detected pe was prevailingly found in soil and groundwater samples in ilsan site fig 6 a however pp was detected as the predominant polymer type and equal amounts of pe and ps were found in the songjiho groundwater samples while pe was mainly detected showing 60 in sediment in songjiho fig 6 b the pe polymers such as plastic bags and mulch vinyl are commonly used as films therefore the dominance of pe mps at both sites could possibly be attributed to vinyl mulching as both sides see intensive owing agricultural land use the type and feature of mps could determine their density and the form of fiber or filament are more buoyant and difficult to settle in water bonyadi et al 2022 with regards to mp morphology various forms of mps such as flake film and fiber form were detected in all samples figs 7 and 8 interestingly the abundance of mp shapes was ranked as fiber film flake in both soil and groundwater sample of ilsan site and fiber 49 flake 34 film 17 in sediment whereas fiber 58 flake 21 film 21 in groundwater of songjiho site fig 8 among them the mp fibers with 160 2263 μm size were the most predominantly observed in both media regardless of sampling location fig 8 a d the highest fiber form mp concentration in sediment was reported in other studies abidli et al 2017 also fiber and film mps showed their high mobility in other study zhang et al 2022 and this is consistent with our result from column experiments fig 4 a the abundance and migration of mps could be affected by population density rainfall and hydrodynamic characteristic in sites 4 conclusion this study systematically assessed the vertical transport of mps in unsaturated soil systems using lab scale column experiments and field studies by investigating mp abundance and their characteristics when taken from soil sediment and groundwater samples the lab scale study revealed that increasing rainfall intensity accelerated the degree of vertical transport of mps showing mp fibers and pp mps with the greatest vertical mobility among the assessed mps unlike in previous studies higher mobility of mps with corresponded with greater mp size in our study this was potentially due to the differences in types of porous media and mps used between our study and previous studies with the field studies there was an evident difference in the mp abundance in both soil and groundwater samples depending on the sampling location however little difference was observed between the two media samples at the same location regarding the mp characteristics found in the field studies mp fibers and pe mps were mainly detected in both soil and groundwater samples through both laboratory and field scale studies we found that the vertical transport of mps was highly affected by environmental conditions such as rainfall intensity and mp characteristics owing to their solid nature therefore the discrepancy between the results observed in this study and those of other studies should be addressed by conducting further studies under more complex and or blended conditions although this study used a relatively large grain size of sand to diminish the operation period soils containing naturally occurring metal oxides and om should be considered to better understand real world vertical transport distribution of mps in addition evaluation of a single mp characteristic alone may be limited in completely explaining mp transport hence understanding the combined effect of multiple factors and weathering fragmentation of mps is needed to understand mp transport in subsurface environments author statement saerom park study conceptualization and

1181,environmental pollution with persistent and mobile organic compounds pmoc from anthropogenic activities is an increasing cause for concern these compounds are readily leached to groundwater aquifers and are likely to resist degradation putting pressure on groundwater resources pesticides can form pmocs upon degradation in the environment the pmoc n n dimethylsulfamide dms was the most frequently detected pesticide metabolite in danish drinking water wells in 2020 although the pesticidal use of the last parent compound tolylfluanid ended in 2007 this study aimed to improve the understanding of the leaching of the pmoc dms from clayey tills by combining a review of compound properties sources and use comprehensive field observations and numerical flow and solute transport modeling the modeling explored the mechanisms of dms retention during vertical transport in clayey till and the fingerprint in the underlying aquifer the results were supported by detailed field observations at an agricultural site with strawberry production porewater samples were collected from clayey till to a depth of 12 m bgs by a custom designed installation method of suction cups groundwater sampling 249 samples was designed to provide vertical concentration profiles at various distances from the presumed sources the review of properties showed that the parent compounds and intermediates degrade quickly in topsoil releasing the highly persistent and mobile dms we tested the effect of fractures on transport with different hydraulic apertures and a scenario without fractures by numerical modeling the results showed that the presence of fractures can smooth the breakthrough curve below the clayey till leading to faster breakthrough lower maximum concentration and several decades of prolonged leaching in simulations with the largest aperture 20 μm the fracture matrix interaction is a possible explanation for the observed delay of leaching from clayey till the vertical concentration profiles in groundwater were used for identifying the sources at the field site and testing source strengths assigning one point source 200 μg l and two diffuse sources 40 50 μg l to the model produced vertical concentration profiles that compared well with observed field data in clayey till and the aquifer all results were integrated into a conceptual model for the environmental fate of pmocs in soil and groundwater the findings of this study imply that the presence of fractures in clayey till should be considered in conceptual site models since they can substantially prolong the leaching of pmocs to groundwater the integration of comprehensive field investigations and numerical modeling is key to understand the fate of pmocs in complex field systems with different source types together with widespread occurrences of pmocs in groundwater systems the results highlight the need for improved approval procedures for pesticides and biocides which considers their persistent and mobile metabolites keywords pesticide groundwater contamination fractured clay groundwater solute transport model data availability data will be made available on

related surface water systems pesticides have been used extensively worldwide since the 1950s mcknight et al 2015 riedo et al 2021 this has caused spreading of pesticides and their metabolites in the environment pesticide metabolites are frequently observed in groundwater globally åkesson et al 2015 baran et al 2022 bexfield et al 2021 reemtsma et al 2013 often surprisingly long after last application of parent compounds hintze 2020 kim et al 2022 riedo et al 2022 2021 sassine et al 2017 most of the pesticide metabolites that are found in groundwater have leached because of their high persistence and mobility hence they would often be classified as pmoc the pesticide biocide metabolite n n dimethylsulfamide dms is an example of a pmoc it is the most frequently detected pesticide compound in drinking water wells in denmark with a detection rate of 28 6 and 7 4 exceedances of the danish groundwater quality guideline value of 0 1 μg l baran et al 2022 thorling et al 2021 findings are also frequent in other countries such as germany dalkmann et al 2012 german federal state federal government working group on water 2019 herrmann and sur 2021 reemtsma et al 2013 schmidt and brauch 2008 seitz and winzenbacher 2017 at a european scale dms is the third most frequently detected so called non relevant metabolite in groundwater with 24 4 detections wfd cis 2021 despite the eu classification as a non relevant metabolite dms is still an important contaminant to consider aside from the inherent issue of a pmoc being so widespread in the environment there is a risk of dms forming the carcinogenic n nitrosodimethylamine ndma where drinking water processing involves ozonation schmidt and brauch 2008 one of the key challenges of addressing dms contamination in groundwater is to link occurrences to sources point sources are defined as sources of small areal extent but high concentration often caused by accidental spills in relation to handling of pesticides and spraying equipment or disposal of pesticides or their packaging in contrast diffuse sources of pesticide contamination can be characterized as large in areal extent but low in concentration they can originate from application to agricultural areas in accordance with regulation and therefore other means are needed restrictions legislation danish epa 2016 jørgensen et al 2016 kværner et al 2014 leu et al 2004 tuxen et al 2002 the source type is important for assessing options for remedial measures pollution originating from point sources may be remediated at the source whereas diffuse sources are too large in areal extent for efficient pollutant treatment danish epa 2016 leu et al 2004 reichenberger et al 2007 tuxen et al 2002 the key factor leading to a prolonged duration of pesticide metabolites in soil and groundwater is the retention in soil and the unsaturated zone and the presence of fractures according to hintze 2020 sorption is mainly caused by sediment bound organic carbon foc but also clay minerals can play a role for charged compounds indeed some pesticide compounds have been shown to remain long in topsoil riedo et al 2021 2022 however dms and similar pmocs have no significant sorption coefficient koc to explain the substantial retention time during leaching from topsoil and through the unsaturated zone to the aquifer the presence of fractures in clayey till can strongly affect the vertical transport of solutes fast transport occurs along preferential flow paths increasing the total water flow through the clay layer and decreasing the breakthrough time of e g pesticides applied at the soil surface harrar et al 2007 jørgensen et al 2004 2003 jørgensen and fredericia 1992 mosthaf et al 2021 rosenbom et al 2008 at the same time retention of solutes can occur by diffusion into the clay matrix which prolongs leaching time due to long term release by back diffusion chambon et al 2011 christiansen et al 2008 halloran and hunkeler 2020 parker et al 2008 since sorption and degradation by definition are expected to play a minor role for pollutants belonging to the group of pmoc it could be hypothesized that the distribution of pmocs over time in aquifers is governed largely by attenuation processes during vertical transport therefore to predict spatial distribution and retention time in the aquifer it is key to understand the processes during leaching this study aims to improve the understanding of pmoc fate in soil and groundwater systems this is pursued by 1 reviewing the properties and sources of a pmoc dms and its parent compounds 2 investigating the mechanisms of dms retention during vertical transport in clayey till through a combination of detailed field investigations and numerical solute transport modeling and 3 identifying sources of dms by combining model simulations and field data for groundwater the new level of understanding is synthesized into a conceptual model for different source types paying attention to geological and hydrogeological data 2 transport and fate of dms parent compounds and intermediates 2 1 parent compounds use and fate an extensive review of the use and properties of dms parent compounds and intermediates can be found in appendix s1 in the review we focused on agricultural application biocide use of tolylfluanid tof and dichlofluanid dcf in e g outdoor paint wood

historical agricultural context in denmark tof is of main importance databases indicate that dcf was only in pesticide use briefly during the 1960s 1970s albers et al 2022 we have not reviewed czf further since it was not in use at the field site considering the environmental fate of tof dcf and their degradation products reviewed in appendix s1 the mobility increases along the degradation chain as seen in the log kow values of 3 5 3 9 for the parent compounds 1 59 1 99 for the intermediates and 0 8 for dms european chemicals agency 2016a b this trend has been confirmed by experimental sorption coefficients albers et al 2023 appendix s1 regarding persistence there is ample evidence that tof and dcf hydrolyze quickly upon dissolution in water with a half life 2 h while the intermediates can undergo phototransformation or biotransformation in a matter of days albers et al 2022 cai et al 2021 koning et al 2021 dms degradation in soil and groundwater is most likely microbial and varies over depth with organic carbon content and redox conditions the half life is shortest in topsoil with values in the interval 41 140 d 20 c dalkmann et al 2012 63 494 d 10 c albers et al 2023 2022 and 1325 d european chemicals agency 2016a respectively deeper than 0 5 m below ground surface bgs slow degradation may occur at aerobic conditions in clayey till half life 653 2990 d while no degradation could be shown in anaerobic clayey till or sandy aquifer material albers et al 2023 2022 in summary parent compounds can be characterized as immobile and highly degradable and the intermediates as somewhat mobile and of moderate degradability in contrast dms is highly mobile and very persistent the environmental fate from tof to dms in a soil aquifer system is summarized in a conceptual illustration fig 2 2 2 is dms a pmoc vpvm substance while there is no strict definition for pmocs dms has been presented as such in literature reemtsma et al 2016 eu regulation provides criteria for the similar definition vpvm substances neumann and schliebner 2019 a chemical can be said to be very persistent vp if the degradation half life exceeds a specified value in surface water surface water sediment or soil appendix s2 the criterion for very mobile vm states that the lowest measured distribution coefficient between organic carbon and water must be below 3 0 in the ph range 4 9 for dms this value was below the detection limit in 5 soils tested the high mobility is confirmed by the low log kow of 0 8 and the kd value 0 1 l kg in all 10 tested soils hence dms fulfills the official requirements for vpvm substances and we suggest that dms is a good representative of a pmoc 3 study site description the study site is a groundwater catchment contaminated with the pmoc dms it is located in denmark fig 3 a in a temperate climate with a mean annual temperature of 9 c and 610 mm yr of annual precipitation dmi 2023 drinking water is abstracted from the limestone aquifer which is in hydraulic contact with an upper groundwater aquifer consisting of fine meltwater sand deposits these are in turn overlain by 10 12 m of a clayey till fig 3 b a glacial deposit formed during the last glaciation weichsel these tills are typically highly heterogeneous containing sand lenses and stringers and fractures in the upper part kessler et al 2012 studies of clayey till at five nearby sites in northern zealand indicate the presence of fractures in the area christiansen et al 2012 2008 damgaard et al 2013 danish epa 2022a mosthaf et al 2021 the overall groundwater flow direction in the sand aquifer and limestone is approximately w sw a small downwards directed vertical gradient of 0 003 between the two aquifers indicates that they are hydraulically connected the horizontal hydraulic gradient is constant in the study area with a value of 0 0021 the redox conditions are predominantly nitrate reducing appendix s4 dms impacts the abstraction wells of a waterworks delivering approx 130 000 m3 of water annually the dms concentration has been monitored since 2018 and is typically in the range of 0 5 1 2 μg l at the most affected well the origin of contamination is most likely a former strawberry production and agricultural contractor 1 4 km upgradient fig 3 c a brief site history and a screening of aerial photographs for strawberry fields can be found in appendix s5 based on several aerial photographs from 1970 to 1999 cultivation of strawberries is very likely in the fields outlined in fig 3 c 4 materials and methods 4 1 site investigations and laboratory work 4 1 1 boreholes and soil samples permanent wells were installed by means of auger drilling cable tool with bailer and dth down the hole in clay sand and limestone respectively soil samples were obtained for geological characterization for every 0 5 m selected samples from the sand aquifer were analyzed for grain size distribution section 4 1 2 4 1 2 hydrogeological characterization the site geology was assessed by characterization of soil samples from installation of the wells a hydraulic profiling tool hpt was used to obtain depth discrete high resolution estimates of the permeability in unconsolidated formations dutta et al 2021 mccall and christy 2020 this tool can identify the transition from clayey till to sand and the presence of sand lenses sand stringers in clay and low permeability zones in sand hydraulic conductivity was measured in the sand aquifer by slug tests slug test data were processed with the hvorslev model hvorslev 1951 in addition hydraulic conductivity was estimated by applying empirical formulas to the grain size distributions of sediment samples devlin 2015 grain size distribution was analyzed by sieving 0 063 mm at a commercial laboratory højvang 4 1 3 groundwater sampling over the course of 2 years 249 groundwater samples were collected by a direct push method from 1 m screens in the sand aquifer as described by mccall et al 2014 177 depth specific samples from 45 points permanent wells screened in the sand aquifer 33 samples from 10 wells and permanent wells screened in the limestone aquifer 39 samples from 8 wells the sampling points were mostly distributed in five transects perpendicular to the overall flow direction t½ t¾ t1 t1½ and t2 all samples were analyzed for dms selected samples were analyzed for additional pesticides and redox sensitive species 4 1 4 porewater sampling 45 porewater samples were obtained from suction cups installed vertically in the clayey till formation mehrtens et al 2020 porous stainless steel tubes were used prenart super steel soil water sampler from dmr pore size 0 05 μm a suction cup length of 20 cm was chosen rather than the usual 10 cm to shorten the sampling duration a suspension of quartz silt secures contact between the suction cup and the soil each suction cup was connected to a sampling vessel via a fluorinated ethylene propylene fep tube by applying vacuum to the sampling vessel soil porewater can be extracted from the formation even under unsaturated conditions the suction cups were installed at depths of approximately 3 5 9 and 11 m bgs clustered in seven cells of which six were in a former strawberry field fig 5 the seventh control cluster was placed downgradient of the former strawberry field the suction cups were installed to a depth of 5 m bgs using a direct push method the deepest suction cups at 9 and 11 m bgs were installed in custom designed boreholes where the sample vessel could be lowered into the borehole allowing for a maximum elevation difference of 5 m during porewater sampling 4 2 field parameters and chemical analyses dissolved oxygen temperature redox potential electrical conductivity and ph value were measured in the field during groundwater sampling groundwater samples and porewater samples were analyzed for pesticides and their degradation products including dms redox sensitive species nitrate nitrite ammonium and ammonia dissolved iron sulfate hydrogen sulfide methane and other water quality indicators calcium magnesium potassium sodium chloride hydrogen carbonate non volatile organic carbon at commercial laboratories using standard accredited methods als global eurofins agrolab pesticide analyses were conducted by lc ms ms with a detection limit of 0 01 μg l for dms 4 3 numerical flow and transport modeling numerical modeling was conducted to elucidate the governing processes for the transport of dms through clayey till and in the underlying aquifer and to test if how different realizations can reproduce concentrations downgradient of the source since degradation of the parent compounds to dms is expected to be rapid and take place in the upper soil only dms was included in the model dms was regarded as non reactive and hence degradation and sorption were not included the groundwater flow and transport model was built using the finite element method implemented in the software comsol multiphysics version 6 0 the modeling focused on two compartments simulating steady state groundwater flow and transient solute transport 1 vertically through fractured clayey till using a discrete fracture matrix model and 2 horizontally at the larger scale sand and limestone aquifers without fractures fig 4 compartment 1 generated concentration time series which were applied as a boundary condition in compartment 2 an initial input concentration of 100 μg l was used and the concentration level was later scaled according to field observations both compartments were simulated in a vertical 2d setup side view the assumption of steady state flow conditions is reasonable since a long time scale is considered the flow model is based on saturated darcy s law assuming close to saturated conditions in the clayey till and a minimal influence on transport of occasionally unsaturated conditions in the upper 1 m of the aquifer fracture flow and transport in the clayey till was accounted for by using a discrete fracture matrix model in compartment 1 the cubic law snow 1969 witherspoon et al 1980 was used to describe the flow in the fractures based on the hydraulic fracture aperture an advection dispersion equation without sorption and degradation was used to describe solute transport in both compartments the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor included effective molecular diffusion which allowed for diffusive exchange between the fractures and the clayey till matrix the underlying sets of equations for flow and transport in fractures and matrix are the same as described in mosthaf et al 2021 the model parameters are listed in table 1 since the model operates in 2d it does not account for transversal dilution the effect is not important for diffuse sources where the source width is large however for point sources with small source width the model would tend to overestimate the concentration although the effect would be minor at the center of the plume as the transversal dispersivity is small bjerg et al 2011 rosenberg et al 2023 4 3 1 compartment 1 vertical transport in clayey till the model for compartment 1 simulated vertical flow and transport in a vertical cross section of fractured clayey till from 1 m bgs to the interface with the aquifer 11 m below fig 4 the input function assumes a constant input concentration of 100 μg l during the pesticide application period 1967 1995 see appendix s5 a linear change over two years was implemented at the start and end of the input function this smooths the arrival of solute and reflects transport through the upper 1 m of soil the simulated pesticide application was followed by a period of 92 years with clean water infiltrating resulting in a total simulation time of 120 years the input function to compartment 1 is sketched in the upper right corner of fig 4 field data were evaluated and the input concentration was scaled accordingly for different sources a fracture spacing of 1 m was used since this is in the range of plausible spacings of connected fractures at the considered depth chambon et al 2011 danish epa 2022a only fully penetrating fractures contribute significantly to flow and affect transport harrison et al 1992 according to a review by chambon et al 2011 hydraulic apertures of clayey till fractures have been reported in the range of 1 160 μm fracture aperture ap typically decreases with depth due to increasing pressure and at 10 12 m bgs apertures larger than 20 μm are unlikely in clayey till danish epa 2022a a 10 μm aperture is the lower boundary for enhanced solute transport harrison et al 1992 but even at apertures of 15 μm the contribution from the fracture to total water flow is less than 30 with a matrix conductivity kmat of 5 10 9 m s and hydraulic gradient i 0 5 therefore fracture apertures in the range of 16 20 μm were tested in this study as well as a scenario with no fracture to facilitate a comparison between scenarios with different aperture or no fracture kmat was adjusted to produce a consistent total water flux of 120 mm yr estimated net infiltration rate appendix s6 with k values of 7 5 10 9 m s no fracture 5 2 10 9 m s ap 16 μm 4 1 10 9 m s ap 18 μm and 2 8 10 9 m s ap 20 μm the average solute concentration over time was evaluated at the bottom of the clayey till as sketched in the time series graph in the top center of fig 4 furthermore the average solute concentration in 20 cm thick horizontal slices was calculated at 2 1 5 1 9 0 and 10 7 m bgs for comparison with the porewater samples fig 4 top left 4 3 2 compartment 2 aquifer model compartment 2 simulated groundwater flow and solute transport in the aquifer 14 m of sand and upper 30 m of the limestone along a 550 m longitudinal section fig 4 cutting through one suspected point source and two diffuse sources the boundary conditions for the sides of the flow model were specified according to the observed hydraulic head dms entered the model domain of compartment 2 at selected intervals of the top boundary according to the output time series generated by model compartment 1 similarly to the model described by rosenberg et al 2023 this link between the model compartments is indicated with arrows in fig 4 applying the time series to different intervals of model compartment 2 and scaling the input allowed for simulating different source types table 1 the solute concentration was evaluated for the year 2021 in six vertical profiles corresponding to the time and location of field observations 5 results and discussion 5 1 pesticide sources and distribution 5 1 1 porewater in clayey till in porewater samples from clayey till at the former strawberry field cells 1 6 fig 5 dms was detected in all samples in concentrations below 0 5 μg l in the upper 5 m overall concentrations increased with depth in the three most affected cells the bottom concentration was respectively 8 2 μg l 13 μg l and 26 μg l cell 3 at 11 4 m bgs 12 0 m bgs and 10 7 m bgs in the reference cell outside the former strawberry field cell 7 concentrations down to a depth of 5 m bgs were lowest 0 01 0 021 μg l and did not exceed 1 μg l at 9 m bgs the presence of dms only in the lower till indicates the temporal state of the contaminant source application of the parent compound had ceased prior to 2021 and pesticides and metabolites in the upper till had been depleted meanwhile the lower till continued to hold a pool of dms which was leaching to the aquifer about 25 years after last application 5 1 2 groundwater dms was found in concentrations above the detection level in almost all groundwater samples fig 5 at the most upgradient point and at transect t½ the concentration was low in the range 0 01 0 9 μg l in a sample from the upper sand aquifer near the farm buildings dms was present along with several other pesticides and metabolites at a total concentration of 97 μg l dms at a concentration of 9 5 μg l north of the farm buildings higher concentrations of dms were found along a transect following the groundwater flow direction the highest dms concentration found in the investigation was 49 μg l along this line in transect t1 downgradient of the former strawberry field at transect t1½ dms concentrations exceeded 10 μg l in at least one sample in each sampling point except for the northernmost the concentrations dropped suddenly below 2 μg l at depths of around 22 25 m bgs at transect t2 the concentrations were lower mostly 1 5 μg l and the plume was positioned deeper in the sand aquifer no clear delineation at the bottom of the sandy aquifer the concentration of dms and sum of pesticides at transects t1 t1½ and t2 are shown in appendix s7 all results for dms in porewater as well as dms and other key pesticides are provided in appendix s8 5 1 3 possible sources of dms comparing the findings in porewater and groundwater with the site history it seems likely that dms originates in part from a pesticide mixing loading station near the farm buildings but mostly from horticultural application in the fields the former constitutes a point source whereas the latter is a diffuse source of pesticide contamination in addition a point source seems to be present in the field north of the buildings the presence of dms at high concentration in the lower clayey till and upper aquifer furthermore indicates that it is still being released implying that the transport mechanisms in clay still affect the duration in the aquifer also the wide distribution of dms at the study site shows that it has been transported far from the sources and hence the current release is not simply due to advective transport through unfractured clayey till 5 2 simulated dms transport in and below clayey till 5 2 1 vertical transport in clayey till the results of the numerical modeling of solute transport through clayey till fig 6 illustrated how the fracture aperture affects the distribution of dms and thereby the leaching rate with no fracture the flow was uniform across the entire clay column fig 6 right and only dispersion caused smoothing of the dms pulse with a short breakthrough peak of high concentration fig 6 left in contrast the presence of a fracture resulted in great differences between the flow rate in the fracture and the matrix leading to a concentration gradient when clean water passed quickly through the fracture while contamination was still present in the matrix the contamination propagated through a combination of downward matrix advection fracture advection and back diffusion from the matrix to the fracture presuming a constant net infiltration for all fracture setups the larger the fracture aperture the slower the downward matrix advection due to a smaller fraction of total water flow occurring in the matrix therefore larger fracture aperture led to smoothing of the breakthrough curve and prolonged release from the clayey till to the groundwater aquifer fig 6 left simulated porewater concentrations in clayey till were compared to observations fig 7 from the three most affected cells at the former strawberry field the concentrations were simulated for three different times t 30 yr t 54 yr and t 70 yr and scaled to 50 to better match observations this corresponds to a source strength of 50 μg l with a hydraulic fracture aperture of 20 μm the difference in vertical distribution at the three time steps was seen most clearly at t 30 yr the bulk of dms was in the upper part of the clayey till whereas the opposite was true at t 54 yr the distribution at t 70 yr was almost linear with 0 μg l dms at 5 1 m bgs and about 10 μg l at 10 7 m bgs without fractures the contamination would be nearly washed out at t 54 yr with only 5 2 μg l in the lower sample the effect of fractures could explain the observed delay in several cells overall comparing the concentration profiles at three time steps with the measurements indicated that the model setup was realistic and that the model can reproduce a situation where the bulk of contamination had moved past the upper clayey till but still present in the lower part furthermore it is interesting that an input concentration as high as 50 μg l produced a match with some observations applying an input concentration of 20 μg l led to vertical profiles which compared well with the lower observed concentrations from cells 2 and 6 not shown the variation of fracture aperture with i 120 mm yr showed that a value of 16 μm produced the best accordance with observed concentration profiles in porewater reflecting the exponentially increasing concentration with depth fig 7 therefore the output from this setup was used as input for the groundwater aquifer model compartment 2 5 2 2 vertical concentration profiles in groundwater the output from model compartment 1 was assigned to model compartment 2 in three different configurations to simulate contaminant plumes resulting from 1 a point source 2 a diffuse source and 3 a combination of all three sources as specified in table 1 and indicated in fig 8 a vertical concentration profiles in groundwater were extracted from the model fig 8 b d showing the dms concentration in m above mean sea level m amsl considering the concentration profiles from the point source and the diffuse source fig 8 b and c it was seen that the maximum concentration of the point source plume was higher than that of the diffuse source furthermore the point source plume covered a narrower depth interval than the diffuse source plume and the depth of the maximum concentration increased with the distance to the source in both cases these vertical concentration profiles in groundwater are in accordance with other results showing that vertical profiles provide valuable information about distance from the source the source type diffuse point and contaminant discharge danish epa 2013 rosenberg et al 2023 overall the simulated dms distribution compared well to the observations although it should be noted that the plume was not delimited over depth at transect t¾ the exception was at transect t1 100 m downgradient of the point source where the maximum concentration was underestimated by a factor of 5 to 6 however the comparison at transect t1 was improved by introducing a diffuse source at the eastern field and combining all three sources fig 8 d with this setup the simulated concentration showed good accordance with an observation either along the model section or in a neighboring point at t1 f167 and t1½ at t2 the accordance was good below 5 m amsl and the simulated maximum concentration also matched the observed but the depth of the maximum concentration was too great this disagreement may be an effect of geological heterogeneity the hpt profile of the meltwater sand deposits at t2 indicates low permeability at 1 m amsl and 1 m amsl not shown which coincides with the gap between two peaks of observed dms concentration it is possible that low permeability heterogeneities in the sand deposits at this depth splits the plume in two by diverting groundwater flow aside from the geology of the sand aquifer inaccuracy of the simulation could be caused by geological heterogeneity in the clayey till and spatial and temporal complexity in the actual application patterns 5 2 3 discussion of most sensitive parameters rosenberg et al 2023 tested the sensitivity of 12 input parameters in a similar model without fractures using a global sensitivity analysis method developed by morris 1991 the most sensitive input parameters were analyzed for their impact on the resulting concentration profiles thickness of the plume maximum concentration and depth of the maximum concentration the results showed that the net infiltration had a strong influence on both the maximum concentration and the depth of the plume center for the maximum concentration the thickness of the clay was furthermore critical as expected the source length was most relevant for the thickness of the plume the present study tested net infiltrations in clay model compartment 1 of 50 120 150 180 200 and 300 mm yr a net infiltration of around 120 mm yr produced the best accordance with the observed temporal state of leaching also this value was supported by a catchment scale hydrological model and estimations based on groundwater age dating data appendix s6 the same infiltration rate was applied at the top boundary of the aquifer model compartment 2 then the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer was calibrated within the range of measured values such that the maximum concentration of the eastern diffuse source plume matched the depth of maximum observed concentration at transect t2 of the critical input parameters the net infiltration to the aquifer is among the most difficult to estimate it is linked to the hydraulic conditions in the clayey till which include the vertical hydraulic conductivity hydraulic gradient and fracture data in combination with the horizontal hydraulic gradient and hydraulic conductivity in the aquifer the net infiltration determines the sinking of the plume with distance horizontal hydraulic gradient and hydraulic conductivity may be measured in the field if sufficient wells are available however the hydraulic conductivity can be subject to heterogeneity and can potentially vary by orders of magnitude in contrast net infiltration is constrained by the actual precipitation at the site in the present work this interdependence of parameters was resolved by obtaining the hydraulic gradient of the aquifer and expected range of hydraulic conductivity from drive point logs and slug tests respectively 5 3 conceptual model of source types of pmocs such as dms the effect of source type point source or diffuse source on the depth interval of a pmoc plume in the aquifer and the maximum concentration is conceptualized in fig 9 along with the retention in clayey till caused by the presence of fractures while the parent compound is in use a contamination diffuses from the fracture to the clay matrix during long term application the concentration in the clayey till will be relatively uniform over depth after last application b clean water will flow through the fracture this causes a concentration gradient between fracture and matrix and leads to back diffusion of the contaminant into the fracture concurrently advective transport will cause downward transport of contaminant mass in the matrix some time after last application depending on the thickness of the clay layer the concentration will be low in the upper clayey till but high in the bottom fig 9 top left panel the dimensions and strength of the source affects the configuration of the contaminant plume a typical diffuse source which has a long extent in the groundwater flow direction will result in a contaminant plume distributed over a wide depth interval fig 9 bottom such a source is generally characterized by a low source strength resulting in low maximum concentrations measured in groundwater the opposite is true for typical point sources caused by spill incidents or handling of pesticides in one place over several years fig 9 top for tof in fruit and berry cultivation the application rate is high compared to typical doses of other pesticides in strawberries the user manual for the product euparen multi containing tof recommends up to five annual applications of 1 5 kg ha of active substance amounting to a total of 7 5 kg ha yr years of fruiting in contrast the typical application rate for herbicides is 1 2 kg ha yr danish epa 2022c therefore the difference in concentration level is most likely greater for other pmocs when comparing contaminant plumes from point sources and diffuse source furthermore tof has a high molar conversion factor to dms of 25 60 compared to that of e g czf to dms of about 1 albers et al 2022 badawi et al 2023 6 implications and perspectives of results for pmocs such as dms 6 1 transport and fate of pmocs the review of sorption and degradation properties of dms and related compounds confirmed that dms is highly persistent and mobile and hence can be classified as a pmoc furthermore the contrasting properties of the parent compounds intermediates and metabolite as well as the existence of three steps in the degradation chain complicates the prediction of fate in the environment according to the current conceptual understanding and field observations the environmental fate of tof dmst and dms is fast degradation of tof in topsoil within a few days after application followed by sorption of dmst to organic carbon in topsoil dmst then degrades over the course of a few weeks to form dms due to the high mobility of dms it is immediately transported with porewater a small fraction of dms is most likely degraded in topsoil and likewise in the aerobic zone of the clayey till if present although the rate of degradation is much faster in topsoil than in aerobic clay a factor 4 25 the retention time would typically also be much shorter due to greater thickness of the clay layer after reaching the anaerobic zone significant degradation is unlikely this conceptual understanding of the environmental fate implies that tof and dmst will not reach groundwater and hence monitoring of dms in groundwater can safely exclude the parent compounds and intermediate metabolites this is confirmed by only detecting dms and not dmst in groundwater in field investigations based on porewater results dmst does not seem to constitute a pool in the subsurface for leaching of dms at a later time no detections above 0 01 μg l in 35 samples from 3 to 5 m bgs for pmocs generally the most important findings from this are 1 pmocs may occur in groundwater in concentrations exceeding guideline values even if parent compounds and any intermediates are characterized by low mobility and fast degradation 2 to understand the environmental fate of a pmoc sorption and degradation properties from parent compound to metabolite should be considered and 3 for very mobile compounds the delay from fracture matrix interactions in clayey till or possibly retention in thick unfractured low permeability clay is the main explanation for the continued leaching of a pmoc such as dms to groundwater systems 6 2 implications for pmoc contamination and field investigations in soil and groundwater 6 2 1 prolonged leaching of pmocs from clayey till back diffusion from thin clay layers in sand and from clay matrix to fractures has previously been observed for other contaminants such as chlorinated ethenes chambon et al 2011 christiansen et al 2008 damgaard et al 2013 parker et al 2008 pharmaceuticals nham et al 2016 and per and polyfluorinated alkyls pfas farhat et al 2022 hitzelberger et al 2022 based on the good accordance between our model and the observed data we propose that also for highly mobile contaminants such as pesticide metabolites and other pmocs back diffusion can result in prolonged leaching after last application this mechanism should be considered in conceptual models for sites with similar geological features 6 2 2 historical review and field investigations for pmocs it is difficult to link occurrences and sources of dms because 1 dms originates from several active constituents 2 tof and dcf have been used in diverse applications including paint wood protection and fruit and berry cultivation and 3 some applications are regulated in the eu as pesticides while others are under biocide regulation certain uses of biocides do not require recording of amounts sold in the present study these challenges were resolved by conducting a thorough review of the site history this included interviews review of former land use archive materials and aerial photos it is recommended to perform a historical review prior to site investigations to optimize the design of field campaigns and analytical programs porewater samples were employed to elucidate the temporal state of leaching from clayey till to aquifer by installing suction cups at a series of depths from 3 m bgs to 11 m bgs concentration profiles in the clayey till could be obtained it was observed that 1 leaching of dms from the clayey till was at the final stage in some areas of the former field and already passed in other areas 2 this agricultural area was a possible source for the contaminant plume and 3 the source strength matched dms occurrences in groundwater the configuration of the contaminant plume can provide information about the distance to the source and the source type as described in section 5 3 the former is useful in an investigation context where the aim is to locate sources of contamination the latter determining the source type is relevant for deciding remediation strategy and moreover the source type can have implications for the responsibility of remediation this is the case in danish regulation for point sources as opposed to diffuse sources danish epa 2022d 2016 in this study for instance a point source in the northern former strawberry field was identified by the geometry of the vertical concentration profiles determining the depth interval affected by contamination and the depth to maximum concentration require field methods capable of depth specific groundwater sampling at intervals of few meters and short screen lengths no greater than 1 m ideally shorter screens and higher resolution as described by rosenberg et al 2023 6 3 regulatory intervention for parent compounds of pmocs in their study of pesticides and pesticide metabolites at a national scale denmark kim et al 2022 found that responses in groundwater quality may be delayed for several decades after a regulatory intervention even for highly mobile compounds the same would be true for other pmocs furthermore they also found that response times may be further extended by retention of strongly sorbing parent compounds in the upper soil and gradual release of the metabolite s experiences with the herbicide metabolite 2 6 dichlorobenzamide bam confirm this similarly to dms bam can be characterized as a pmoc and was previously the most frequently detected pesticide metabolite in danish water supply wells 21 4 of sampled wells clausen et al 2007 in 2020 23 years after the ban of the parent compounds it was still detected in 16 4 of all drinking water wells jørgensen et al 2003 thorling et al 2021 in combination with the present study these experiences underline the importance of sufficient approval procedures for pesticides and other potential sources of pmocs topping et al 2020 and better monitoring programs mcginley et al 2023 currently pesticide metabolites are not sufficiently accounted for in approval procedures the approach in denmark is to test active constituents suspected of producing pmoc metabolites in monitored field application baran et al 2022 furthermore biocide application should be included in environmental permits and sales statistics to allow for later assessment of the application for instance use of the parent compounds of dms in outdoor paint and wood protection products have been shown to cause extensive soil and groundwater contamination with dms in urban areas albers et al 2023 differences in monitoring programs even for eu countries within the same legal framework also complicate the assessment of occurrence in the environment finally it is necessary to strengthen monitoring of biocides and their metabolites baran et al 2022 7 conclusion this study reviewed the properties of a pmoc dms and related compounds and conceptualized their environmental fate after application of a parent compound as a pesticide the parent compounds and intermediates most likely sorb to topsoil and undergo degradation there whereas dms has the potential of leaching to groundwater this is confirmed by detailed field observations at an agricultural site with strawberry production modeling of flow and solute transport and field observations showed that fracture matrix interactions can be a significant mechanism for prolonging the leaching time even for non sorbing chemicals this implies a longer delay between application stop and complete leaching from clayey till than anticipated porewater samples were particularly useful in documenting the pmoc distribution in clayey till as deep as 12 m bgs high resolution vertical concentration profiles proved helpful in locating sources and in combination with modeling estimating source strengths a conceptual model was built for two source types a point source and a diffuse source contamination from both source types may be retained in fractured clayey till and released slowly by back diffusion this insight is valuable since many pmoc sources are of historical origin the findings of this study accentuate the need to revise approval procedures of pesticides and biocides to 1 factor in the possible formation of persistent and mobile metabolites and 2 align biocide regulation with that of

1181,environmental pollution with persistent and mobile organic compounds pmoc from anthropogenic activities is an increasing cause for concern these compounds are readily leached to groundwater aquifers and are likely to resist degradation putting pressure on groundwater resources pesticides can form pmocs upon degradation in the environment the pmoc n n dimethylsulfamide dms was the most frequently detected pesticide metabolite in danish drinking water wells in 2020 although the pesticidal use of the last parent compound tolylfluanid ended in 2007 this study aimed to improve the understanding of the leaching of the pmoc dms from clayey tills by combining a review of compound properties sources and use comprehensive field observations and numerical flow and solute transport modeling the modeling explored the mechanisms of dms retention during vertical transport in clayey till and the fingerprint in the underlying aquifer the results were supported by detailed field observations at an agricultural site with strawberry production porewater samples were collected from clayey till to a depth of 12 m bgs by a custom designed installation method of suction cups groundwater sampling 249 samples was designed to provide vertical concentration profiles at various distances from the presumed sources the review of properties showed that the parent compounds and intermediates degrade quickly in topsoil releasing the highly persistent and mobile dms we tested the effect of fractures on transport with different hydraulic apertures and a scenario without fractures by numerical modeling the results showed that the presence of fractures can smooth the breakthrough curve below the clayey till leading to faster breakthrough lower maximum concentration and several decades of prolonged leaching in simulations with the largest aperture 20 μm the fracture matrix interaction is a possible explanation for the observed delay of leaching from clayey till the vertical concentration profiles in groundwater were used for identifying the sources at the field site and testing source strengths assigning one point source 200 μg l and two diffuse sources 40 50 μg l to the model produced vertical concentration profiles that compared well with observed field data in clayey till and the aquifer all results were integrated into a conceptual model for the environmental fate of pmocs in soil and groundwater the findings of this study imply that the presence of fractures in clayey till should be considered in conceptual site models since they can substantially prolong the leaching of pmocs to groundwater the integration of comprehensive field investigations and numerical modeling is key to understand the fate of pmocs in complex field systems with different source types together with widespread occurrences of pmocs in groundwater systems the results highlight the need for improved approval procedures for pesticides and biocides which considers their persistent and mobile metabolites keywords pesticide groundwater contamination fractured clay groundwater solute transport model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater resources are under pressure globally from anthropogenic contaminants many of which can be characterized as persistent and mobile organic compounds pmoc reemtsma et al 2016 this grouping is analogous to the european reach classification as very persistent and very mobile vpvm pertaining to consumer products cousins et al 2019 european commission 2023 scheringer et al 2022 the wide occurrence of pmocs in the environment is a cause for concern cousins et al 2019 dieter 2010 reemtsma et al 2016 for the environment and in particular groundwater resources and related surface water systems pesticides have been used extensively worldwide since the 1950s mcknight et al 2015 riedo et al 2021 this has caused spreading of pesticides and their metabolites in the environment pesticide metabolites are frequently observed in groundwater globally åkesson et al 2015 baran et al 2022 bexfield et al 2021 reemtsma et al 2013 often surprisingly long after last application of parent compounds hintze 2020 kim et al 2022 riedo et al 2022 2021 sassine et al 2017 most of the pesticide metabolites that are found in groundwater have leached because of their high persistence and mobility hence they would often be classified as pmoc the pesticide biocide metabolite n n dimethylsulfamide dms is an example of a pmoc it is the most frequently detected pesticide compound in drinking water wells in denmark with a detection rate of 28 6 and 7 4 exceedances of the danish groundwater quality guideline value of 0 1 μg l baran et al 2022 thorling et al 2021 findings are also frequent in other countries such as germany dalkmann et al 2012 german federal state federal government working group on water 2019 herrmann and sur 2021 reemtsma et al 2013 schmidt and brauch 2008 seitz and winzenbacher 2017 at a european scale dms is the third most frequently detected so called non relevant metabolite in groundwater with 24 4 detections wfd cis 2021 despite the eu classification as a non relevant metabolite dms is still an important contaminant to consider aside from the inherent issue of a pmoc being so widespread in the environment there is a risk of dms forming the carcinogenic n nitrosodimethylamine ndma where drinking water processing involves ozonation schmidt and brauch 2008 one of the key challenges of addressing dms contamination in groundwater is to link occurrences to sources point sources are defined as sources of small areal extent but high concentration often caused by accidental spills in relation to handling of pesticides and spraying equipment or disposal of pesticides or their packaging in contrast diffuse sources of pesticide contamination can be characterized as large in areal extent but low in concentration they can originate from application to agricultural areas in accordance with regulation and therefore other means are needed restrictions legislation danish epa 2016 jørgensen et al 2016 kværner et al 2014 leu et al 2004 tuxen et al 2002 the source type is important for assessing options for remedial measures pollution originating from point sources may be remediated at the source whereas diffuse sources are too large in areal extent for efficient pollutant treatment danish epa 2016 leu et al 2004 reichenberger et al 2007 tuxen et al 2002 the key factor leading to a prolonged duration of pesticide metabolites in soil and groundwater is the retention in soil and the unsaturated zone and the presence of fractures according to hintze 2020 sorption is mainly caused by sediment bound organic carbon foc but also clay minerals can play a role for charged compounds indeed some pesticide compounds have been shown to remain long in topsoil riedo et al 2021 2022 however dms and similar pmocs have no significant sorption coefficient koc to explain the substantial retention time during leaching from topsoil and through the unsaturated zone to the aquifer the presence of fractures in clayey till can strongly affect the vertical transport of solutes fast transport occurs along preferential flow paths increasing the total water flow through the clay layer and decreasing the breakthrough time of e g pesticides applied at the soil surface harrar et al 2007 jørgensen et al 2004 2003 jørgensen and fredericia 1992 mosthaf et al 2021 rosenbom et al 2008 at the same time retention of solutes can occur by diffusion into the clay matrix which prolongs leaching time due to long term release by back diffusion chambon et al 2011 christiansen et al 2008 halloran and hunkeler 2020 parker et al 2008 since sorption and degradation by definition are expected to play a minor role for pollutants belonging to the group of pmoc it could be hypothesized that the distribution of pmocs over time in aquifers is governed largely by attenuation processes during vertical transport therefore to predict spatial distribution and retention time in the aquifer it is key to understand the processes during leaching this study aims to improve the understanding of pmoc fate in soil and groundwater systems this is pursued by 1 reviewing the properties and sources of a pmoc dms and its parent compounds 2 investigating the mechanisms of dms retention during vertical transport in clayey till through a combination of detailed field investigations and numerical solute transport modeling and 3 identifying sources of dms by combining model simulations and field data for groundwater the new level of understanding is synthesized into a conceptual model for different source types paying attention to geological and hydrogeological data 2 transport and fate of dms parent compounds and intermediates 2 1 parent compounds use and fate an extensive review of the use and properties of dms parent compounds and intermediates can be found in appendix s1 in the review we focused on agricultural application biocide use of tolylfluanid tof and dichlofluanid dcf in e g outdoor paint wood preservatives and antifouling products has been described elsewhere albers et al 2022 de campos et al 2021 european chemicals agency 2016a b the compound n n dimethylsulfamide dms originates from two fungicides biocides tof and dcf and the fungicide cyazofamid czf fig 1 degradation of tof and dcf to dms occurs via the intermediate metabolites n n dimethyl n p tolylsulfamide dmst and n n dimethyl n phenylsulfamide dmsa respectively european chemicals agency 2016a b only recently it was discovered that czf can degrade directly to dms badawi et al 2023 while previous reports only include other metabolites efsa 2016 fao and who 2015 tof and dcf were formerly in use as agricultural fungicides for crops including fruit and vegetables across europe and elsewhere australian pesticides and veterinary medicines authority 2000 brewerton and gibbs 1968 česnik et al 2006 fao who 2022 gonzález et al 1997 heil et al 1991 herrmann and sur 2021 malathrakis 1989 orosová et al 2010 ticha et al 2007 walorczyk 2008 in the eu tof was approved for pesticide use until 2010 european commission 2010 czf has been used as an agricultural fungicide in potato cultivation in denmark since 2004 it is also in use in the rest of the eu and elsewhere australian pesticides and veterinary medicines authority 2015 footprint pesticide properties database 2023 lewis et al 2016 mitani et al 2003b wu et al 2018 xu et al 2017 for vegetables and other crops australian pesticides and veterinary medicines authority 2015 efsa 2016 mitani et al 2003a 2003b wiedmann 2009 wu et al 2018 xu et al 2017 in a historical agricultural context in denmark tof is of main importance databases indicate that dcf was only in pesticide use briefly during the 1960s 1970s albers et al 2022 we have not reviewed czf further since it was not in use at the field site considering the environmental fate of tof dcf and their degradation products reviewed in appendix s1 the mobility increases along the degradation chain as seen in the log kow values of 3 5 3 9 for the parent compounds 1 59 1 99 for the intermediates and 0 8 for dms european chemicals agency 2016a b this trend has been confirmed by experimental sorption coefficients albers et al 2023 appendix s1 regarding persistence there is ample evidence that tof and dcf hydrolyze quickly upon dissolution in water with a half life 2 h while the intermediates can undergo phototransformation or biotransformation in a matter of days albers et al 2022 cai et al 2021 koning et al 2021 dms degradation in soil and groundwater is most likely microbial and varies over depth with organic carbon content and redox conditions the half life is shortest in topsoil with values in the interval 41 140 d 20 c dalkmann et al 2012 63 494 d 10 c albers et al 2023 2022 and 1325 d european chemicals agency 2016a respectively deeper than 0 5 m below ground surface bgs slow degradation may occur at aerobic conditions in clayey till half life 653 2990 d while no degradation could be shown in anaerobic clayey till or sandy aquifer material albers et al 2023 2022 in summary parent compounds can be characterized as immobile and highly degradable and the intermediates as somewhat mobile and of moderate degradability in contrast dms is highly mobile and very persistent the environmental fate from tof to dms in a soil aquifer system is summarized in a conceptual illustration fig 2 2 2 is dms a pmoc vpvm substance while there is no strict definition for pmocs dms has been presented as such in literature reemtsma et al 2016 eu regulation provides criteria for the similar definition vpvm substances neumann and schliebner 2019 a chemical can be said to be very persistent vp if the degradation half life exceeds a specified value in surface water surface water sediment or soil appendix s2 the criterion for very mobile vm states that the lowest measured distribution coefficient between organic carbon and water must be below 3 0 in the ph range 4 9 for dms this value was below the detection limit in 5 soils tested the high mobility is confirmed by the low log kow of 0 8 and the kd value 0 1 l kg in all 10 tested soils hence dms fulfills the official requirements for vpvm substances and we suggest that dms is a good representative of a pmoc 3 study site description the study site is a groundwater catchment contaminated with the pmoc dms it is located in denmark fig 3 a in a temperate climate with a mean annual temperature of 9 c and 610 mm yr of annual precipitation dmi 2023 drinking water is abstracted from the limestone aquifer which is in hydraulic contact with an upper groundwater aquifer consisting of fine meltwater sand deposits these are in turn overlain by 10 12 m of a clayey till fig 3 b a glacial deposit formed during the last glaciation weichsel these tills are typically highly heterogeneous containing sand lenses and stringers and fractures in the upper part kessler et al 2012 studies of clayey till at five nearby sites in northern zealand indicate the presence of fractures in the area christiansen et al 2012 2008 damgaard et al 2013 danish epa 2022a mosthaf et al 2021 the overall groundwater flow direction in the sand aquifer and limestone is approximately w sw a small downwards directed vertical gradient of 0 003 between the two aquifers indicates that they are hydraulically connected the horizontal hydraulic gradient is constant in the study area with a value of 0 0021 the redox conditions are predominantly nitrate reducing appendix s4 dms impacts the abstraction wells of a waterworks delivering approx 130 000 m3 of water annually the dms concentration has been monitored since 2018 and is typically in the range of 0 5 1 2 μg l at the most affected well the origin of contamination is most likely a former strawberry production and agricultural contractor 1 4 km upgradient fig 3 c a brief site history and a screening of aerial photographs for strawberry fields can be found in appendix s5 based on several aerial photographs from 1970 to 1999 cultivation of strawberries is very likely in the fields outlined in fig 3 c 4 materials and methods 4 1 site investigations and laboratory work 4 1 1 boreholes and soil samples permanent wells were installed by means of auger drilling cable tool with bailer and dth down the hole in clay sand and limestone respectively soil samples were obtained for geological characterization for every 0 5 m selected samples from the sand aquifer were analyzed for grain size distribution section 4 1 2 4 1 2 hydrogeological characterization the site geology was assessed by characterization of soil samples from installation of the wells a hydraulic profiling tool hpt was used to obtain depth discrete high resolution estimates of the permeability in unconsolidated formations dutta et al 2021 mccall and christy 2020 this tool can identify the transition from clayey till to sand and the presence of sand lenses sand stringers in clay and low permeability zones in sand hydraulic conductivity was measured in the sand aquifer by slug tests slug test data were processed with the hvorslev model hvorslev 1951 in addition hydraulic conductivity was estimated by applying empirical formulas to the grain size distributions of sediment samples devlin 2015 grain size distribution was analyzed by sieving 0 063 mm at a commercial laboratory højvang 4 1 3 groundwater sampling over the course of 2 years 249 groundwater samples were collected by a direct push method from 1 m screens in the sand aquifer as described by mccall et al 2014 177 depth specific samples from 45 points permanent wells screened in the sand aquifer 33 samples from 10 wells and permanent wells screened in the limestone aquifer 39 samples from 8 wells the sampling points were mostly distributed in five transects perpendicular to the overall flow direction t½ t¾ t1 t1½ and t2 all samples were analyzed for dms selected samples were analyzed for additional pesticides and redox sensitive species 4 1 4 porewater sampling 45 porewater samples were obtained from suction cups installed vertically in the clayey till formation mehrtens et al 2020 porous stainless steel tubes were used prenart super steel soil water sampler from dmr pore size 0 05 μm a suction cup length of 20 cm was chosen rather than the usual 10 cm to shorten the sampling duration a suspension of quartz silt secures contact between the suction cup and the soil each suction cup was connected to a sampling vessel via a fluorinated ethylene propylene fep tube by applying vacuum to the sampling vessel soil porewater can be extracted from the formation even under unsaturated conditions the suction cups were installed at depths of approximately 3 5 9 and 11 m bgs clustered in seven cells of which six were in a former strawberry field fig 5 the seventh control cluster was placed downgradient of the former strawberry field the suction cups were installed to a depth of 5 m bgs using a direct push method the deepest suction cups at 9 and 11 m bgs were installed in custom designed boreholes where the sample vessel could be lowered into the borehole allowing for a maximum elevation difference of 5 m during porewater sampling 4 2 field parameters and chemical analyses dissolved oxygen temperature redox potential electrical conductivity and ph value were measured in the field during groundwater sampling groundwater samples and porewater samples were analyzed for pesticides and their degradation products including dms redox sensitive species nitrate nitrite ammonium and ammonia dissolved iron sulfate hydrogen sulfide methane and other water quality indicators calcium magnesium potassium sodium chloride hydrogen carbonate non volatile organic carbon at commercial laboratories using standard accredited methods als global eurofins agrolab pesticide analyses were conducted by lc ms ms with a detection limit of 0 01 μg l for dms 4 3 numerical flow and transport modeling numerical modeling was conducted to elucidate the governing processes for the transport of dms through clayey till and in the underlying aquifer and to test if how different realizations can reproduce concentrations downgradient of the source since degradation of the parent compounds to dms is expected to be rapid and take place in the upper soil only dms was included in the model dms was regarded as non reactive and hence degradation and sorption were not included the groundwater flow and transport model was built using the finite element method implemented in the software comsol multiphysics version 6 0 the modeling focused on two compartments simulating steady state groundwater flow and transient solute transport 1 vertically through fractured clayey till using a discrete fracture matrix model and 2 horizontally at the larger scale sand and limestone aquifers without fractures fig 4 compartment 1 generated concentration time series which were applied as a boundary condition in compartment 2 an initial input concentration of 100 μg l was used and the concentration level was later scaled according to field observations both compartments were simulated in a vertical 2d setup side view the assumption of steady state flow conditions is reasonable since a long time scale is considered the flow model is based on saturated darcy s law assuming close to saturated conditions in the clayey till and a minimal influence on transport of occasionally unsaturated conditions in the upper 1 m of the aquifer fracture flow and transport in the clayey till was accounted for by using a discrete fracture matrix model in compartment 1 the cubic law snow 1969 witherspoon et al 1980 was used to describe the flow in the fractures based on the hydraulic fracture aperture an advection dispersion equation without sorption and degradation was used to describe solute transport in both compartments the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor included effective molecular diffusion which allowed for diffusive exchange between the fractures and the clayey till matrix the underlying sets of equations for flow and transport in fractures and matrix are the same as described in mosthaf et al 2021 the model parameters are listed in table 1 since the model operates in 2d it does not account for transversal dilution the effect is not important for diffuse sources where the source width is large however for point sources with small source width the model would tend to overestimate the concentration although the effect would be minor at the center of the plume as the transversal dispersivity is small bjerg et al 2011 rosenberg et al 2023 4 3 1 compartment 1 vertical transport in clayey till the model for compartment 1 simulated vertical flow and transport in a vertical cross section of fractured clayey till from 1 m bgs to the interface with the aquifer 11 m below fig 4 the input function assumes a constant input concentration of 100 μg l during the pesticide application period 1967 1995 see appendix s5 a linear change over two years was implemented at the start and end of the input function this smooths the arrival of solute and reflects transport through the upper 1 m of soil the simulated pesticide application was followed by a period of 92 years with clean water infiltrating resulting in a total simulation time of 120 years the input function to compartment 1 is sketched in the upper right corner of fig 4 field data were evaluated and the input concentration was scaled accordingly for different sources a fracture spacing of 1 m was used since this is in the range of plausible spacings of connected fractures at the considered depth chambon et al 2011 danish epa 2022a only fully penetrating fractures contribute significantly to flow and affect transport harrison et al 1992 according to a review by chambon et al 2011 hydraulic apertures of clayey till fractures have been reported in the range of 1 160 μm fracture aperture ap typically decreases with depth due to increasing pressure and at 10 12 m bgs apertures larger than 20 μm are unlikely in clayey till danish epa 2022a a 10 μm aperture is the lower boundary for enhanced solute transport harrison et al 1992 but even at apertures of 15 μm the contribution from the fracture to total water flow is less than 30 with a matrix conductivity kmat of 5 10 9 m s and hydraulic gradient i 0 5 therefore fracture apertures in the range of 16 20 μm were tested in this study as well as a scenario with no fracture to facilitate a comparison between scenarios with different aperture or no fracture kmat was adjusted to produce a consistent total water flux of 120 mm yr estimated net infiltration rate appendix s6 with k values of 7 5 10 9 m s no fracture 5 2 10 9 m s ap 16 μm 4 1 10 9 m s ap 18 μm and 2 8 10 9 m s ap 20 μm the average solute concentration over time was evaluated at the bottom of the clayey till as sketched in the time series graph in the top center of fig 4 furthermore the average solute concentration in 20 cm thick horizontal slices was calculated at 2 1 5 1 9 0 and 10 7 m bgs for comparison with the porewater samples fig 4 top left 4 3 2 compartment 2 aquifer model compartment 2 simulated groundwater flow and solute transport in the aquifer 14 m of sand and upper 30 m of the limestone along a 550 m longitudinal section fig 4 cutting through one suspected point source and two diffuse sources the boundary conditions for the sides of the flow model were specified according to the observed hydraulic head dms entered the model domain of compartment 2 at selected intervals of the top boundary according to the output time series generated by model compartment 1 similarly to the model described by rosenberg et al 2023 this link between the model compartments is indicated with arrows in fig 4 applying the time series to different intervals of model compartment 2 and scaling the input allowed for simulating different source types table 1 the solute concentration was evaluated for the year 2021 in six vertical profiles corresponding to the time and location of field observations 5 results and discussion 5 1 pesticide sources and distribution 5 1 1 porewater in clayey till in porewater samples from clayey till at the former strawberry field cells 1 6 fig 5 dms was detected in all samples in concentrations below 0 5 μg l in the upper 5 m overall concentrations increased with depth in the three most affected cells the bottom concentration was respectively 8 2 μg l 13 μg l and 26 μg l cell 3 at 11 4 m bgs 12 0 m bgs and 10 7 m bgs in the reference cell outside the former strawberry field cell 7 concentrations down to a depth of 5 m bgs were lowest 0 01 0 021 μg l and did not exceed 1 μg l at 9 m bgs the presence of dms only in the lower till indicates the temporal state of the contaminant source application of the parent compound had ceased prior to 2021 and pesticides and metabolites in the upper till had been depleted meanwhile the lower till continued to hold a pool of dms which was leaching to the aquifer about 25 years after last application 5 1 2 groundwater dms was found in concentrations above the detection level in almost all groundwater samples fig 5 at the most upgradient point and at transect t½ the concentration was low in the range 0 01 0 9 μg l in a sample from the upper sand aquifer near the farm buildings dms was present along with several other pesticides and metabolites at a total concentration of 97 μg l dms at a concentration of 9 5 μg l north of the farm buildings higher concentrations of dms were found along a transect following the groundwater flow direction the highest dms concentration found in the investigation was 49 μg l along this line in transect t1 downgradient of the former strawberry field at transect t1½ dms concentrations exceeded 10 μg l in at least one sample in each sampling point except for the northernmost the concentrations dropped suddenly below 2 μg l at depths of around 22 25 m bgs at transect t2 the concentrations were lower mostly 1 5 μg l and the plume was positioned deeper in the sand aquifer no clear delineation at the bottom of the sandy aquifer the concentration of dms and sum of pesticides at transects t1 t1½ and t2 are shown in appendix s7 all results for dms in porewater as well as dms and other key pesticides are provided in appendix s8 5 1 3 possible sources of dms comparing the findings in porewater and groundwater with the site history it seems likely that dms originates in part from a pesticide mixing loading station near the farm buildings but mostly from horticultural application in the fields the former constitutes a point source whereas the latter is a diffuse source of pesticide contamination in addition a point source seems to be present in the field north of the buildings the presence of dms at high concentration in the lower clayey till and upper aquifer furthermore indicates that it is still being released implying that the transport mechanisms in clay still affect the duration in the aquifer also the wide distribution of dms at the study site shows that it has been transported far from the sources and hence the current release is not simply due to advective transport through unfractured clayey till 5 2 simulated dms transport in and below clayey till 5 2 1 vertical transport in clayey till the results of the numerical modeling of solute transport through clayey till fig 6 illustrated how the fracture aperture affects the distribution of dms and thereby the leaching rate with no fracture the flow was uniform across the entire clay column fig 6 right and only dispersion caused smoothing of the dms pulse with a short breakthrough peak of high concentration fig 6 left in contrast the presence of a fracture resulted in great differences between the flow rate in the fracture and the matrix leading to a concentration gradient when clean water passed quickly through the fracture while contamination was still present in the matrix the contamination propagated through a combination of downward matrix advection fracture advection and back diffusion from the matrix to the fracture presuming a constant net infiltration for all fracture setups the larger the fracture aperture the slower the downward matrix advection due to a smaller fraction of total water flow occurring in the matrix therefore larger fracture aperture led to smoothing of the breakthrough curve and prolonged release from the clayey till to the groundwater aquifer fig 6 left simulated porewater concentrations in clayey till were compared to observations fig 7 from the three most affected cells at the former strawberry field the concentrations were simulated for three different times t 30 yr t 54 yr and t 70 yr and scaled to 50 to better match observations this corresponds to a source strength of 50 μg l with a hydraulic fracture aperture of 20 μm the difference in vertical distribution at the three time steps was seen most clearly at t 30 yr the bulk of dms was in the upper part of the clayey till whereas the opposite was true at t 54 yr the distribution at t 70 yr was almost linear with 0 μg l dms at 5 1 m bgs and about 10 μg l at 10 7 m bgs without fractures the contamination would be nearly washed out at t 54 yr with only 5 2 μg l in the lower sample the effect of fractures could explain the observed delay in several cells overall comparing the concentration profiles at three time steps with the measurements indicated that the model setup was realistic and that the model can reproduce a situation where the bulk of contamination had moved past the upper clayey till but still present in the lower part furthermore it is interesting that an input concentration as high as 50 μg l produced a match with some observations applying an input concentration of 20 μg l led to vertical profiles which compared well with the lower observed concentrations from cells 2 and 6 not shown the variation of fracture aperture with i 120 mm yr showed that a value of 16 μm produced the best accordance with observed concentration profiles in porewater reflecting the exponentially increasing concentration with depth fig 7 therefore the output from this setup was used as input for the groundwater aquifer model compartment 2 5 2 2 vertical concentration profiles in groundwater the output from model compartment 1 was assigned to model compartment 2 in three different configurations to simulate contaminant plumes resulting from 1 a point source 2 a diffuse source and 3 a combination of all three sources as specified in table 1 and indicated in fig 8 a vertical concentration profiles in groundwater were extracted from the model fig 8 b d showing the dms concentration in m above mean sea level m amsl considering the concentration profiles from the point source and the diffuse source fig 8 b and c it was seen that the maximum concentration of the point source plume was higher than that of the diffuse source furthermore the point source plume covered a narrower depth interval than the diffuse source plume and the depth of the maximum concentration increased with the distance to the source in both cases these vertical concentration profiles in groundwater are in accordance with other results showing that vertical profiles provide valuable information about distance from the source the source type diffuse point and contaminant discharge danish epa 2013 rosenberg et al 2023 overall the simulated dms distribution compared well to the observations although it should be noted that the plume was not delimited over depth at transect t¾ the exception was at transect t1 100 m downgradient of the point source where the maximum concentration was underestimated by a factor of 5 to 6 however the comparison at transect t1 was improved by introducing a diffuse source at the eastern field and combining all three sources fig 8 d with this setup the simulated concentration showed good accordance with an observation either along the model section or in a neighboring point at t1 f167 and t1½ at t2 the accordance was good below 5 m amsl and the simulated maximum concentration also matched the observed but the depth of the maximum concentration was too great this disagreement may be an effect of geological heterogeneity the hpt profile of the meltwater sand deposits at t2 indicates low permeability at 1 m amsl and 1 m amsl not shown which coincides with the gap between two peaks of observed dms concentration it is possible that low permeability heterogeneities in the sand deposits at this depth splits the plume in two by diverting groundwater flow aside from the geology of the sand aquifer inaccuracy of the simulation could be caused by geological heterogeneity in the clayey till and spatial and temporal complexity in the actual application patterns 5 2 3 discussion of most sensitive parameters rosenberg et al 2023 tested the sensitivity of 12 input parameters in a similar model without fractures using a global sensitivity analysis method developed by morris 1991 the most sensitive input parameters were analyzed for their impact on the resulting concentration profiles thickness of the plume maximum concentration and depth of the maximum concentration the results showed that the net infiltration had a strong influence on both the maximum concentration and the depth of the plume center for the maximum concentration the thickness of the clay was furthermore critical as expected the source length was most relevant for the thickness of the plume the present study tested net infiltrations in clay model compartment 1 of 50 120 150 180 200 and 300 mm yr a net infiltration of around 120 mm yr produced the best accordance with the observed temporal state of leaching also this value was supported by a catchment scale hydrological model and estimations based on groundwater age dating data appendix s6 the same infiltration rate was applied at the top boundary of the aquifer model compartment 2 then the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer was calibrated within the range of measured values such that the maximum concentration of the eastern diffuse source plume matched the depth of maximum observed concentration at transect t2 of the critical input parameters the net infiltration to the aquifer is among the most difficult to estimate it is linked to the hydraulic conditions in the clayey till which include the vertical hydraulic conductivity hydraulic gradient and fracture data in combination with the horizontal hydraulic gradient and hydraulic conductivity in the aquifer the net infiltration determines the sinking of the plume with distance horizontal hydraulic gradient and hydraulic conductivity may be measured in the field if sufficient wells are available however the hydraulic conductivity can be subject to heterogeneity and can potentially vary by orders of magnitude in contrast net infiltration is constrained by the actual precipitation at the site in the present work this interdependence of parameters was resolved by obtaining the hydraulic gradient of the aquifer and expected range of hydraulic conductivity from drive point logs and slug tests respectively 5 3 conceptual model of source types of pmocs such as dms the effect of source type point source or diffuse source on the depth interval of a pmoc plume in the aquifer and the maximum concentration is conceptualized in fig 9 along with the retention in clayey till caused by the presence of fractures while the parent compound is in use a contamination diffuses from the fracture to the clay matrix during long term application the concentration in the clayey till will be relatively uniform over depth after last application b clean water will flow through the fracture this causes a concentration gradient between fracture and matrix and leads to back diffusion of the contaminant into the fracture concurrently advective transport will cause downward transport of contaminant mass in the matrix some time after last application depending on the thickness of the clay layer the concentration will be low in the upper clayey till but high in the bottom fig 9 top left panel the dimensions and strength of the source affects the configuration of the contaminant plume a typical diffuse source which has a long extent in the groundwater flow direction will result in a contaminant plume distributed over a wide depth interval fig 9 bottom such a source is generally characterized by a low source strength resulting in low maximum concentrations measured in groundwater the opposite is true for typical point sources caused by spill incidents or handling of pesticides in one place over several years fig 9 top for tof in fruit and berry cultivation the application rate is high compared to typical doses of other pesticides in strawberries the user manual for the product euparen multi containing tof recommends up to five annual applications of 1 5 kg ha of active substance amounting to a total of 7 5 kg ha yr years of fruiting in contrast the typical application rate for herbicides is 1 2 kg ha yr danish epa 2022c therefore the difference in concentration level is most likely greater for other pmocs when comparing contaminant plumes from point sources and diffuse source furthermore tof has a high molar conversion factor to dms of 25 60 compared to that of e g czf to dms of about 1 albers et al 2022 badawi et al 2023 6 implications and perspectives of results for pmocs such as dms 6 1 transport and fate of pmocs the review of sorption and degradation properties of dms and related compounds confirmed that dms is highly persistent and mobile and hence can be classified as a pmoc furthermore the contrasting properties of the parent compounds intermediates and metabolite as well as the existence of three steps in the degradation chain complicates the prediction of fate in the environment according to the current conceptual understanding and field observations the environmental fate of tof dmst and dms is fast degradation of tof in topsoil within a few days after application followed by sorption of dmst to organic carbon in topsoil dmst then degrades over the course of a few weeks to form dms due to the high mobility of dms it is immediately transported with porewater a small fraction of dms is most likely degraded in topsoil and likewise in the aerobic zone of the clayey till if present although the rate of degradation is much faster in topsoil than in aerobic clay a factor 4 25 the retention time would typically also be much shorter due to greater thickness of the clay layer after reaching the anaerobic zone significant degradation is unlikely this conceptual understanding of the environmental fate implies that tof and dmst will not reach groundwater and hence monitoring of dms in groundwater can safely exclude the parent compounds and intermediate metabolites this is confirmed by only detecting dms and not dmst in groundwater in field investigations based on porewater results dmst does not seem to constitute a pool in the subsurface for leaching of dms at a later time no detections above 0 01 μg l in 35 samples from 3 to 5 m bgs for pmocs generally the most important findings from this are 1 pmocs may occur in groundwater in concentrations exceeding guideline values even if parent compounds and any intermediates are characterized by low mobility and fast degradation 2 to understand the environmental fate of a pmoc sorption and degradation properties from parent compound to metabolite should be considered and 3 for very mobile compounds the delay from fracture matrix interactions in clayey till or possibly retention in thick unfractured low permeability clay is the main explanation for the continued leaching of a pmoc such as dms to groundwater systems 6 2 implications for pmoc contamination and field investigations in soil and groundwater 6 2 1 prolonged leaching of pmocs from clayey till back diffusion from thin clay layers in sand and from clay matrix to fractures has previously been observed for other contaminants such as chlorinated ethenes chambon et al 2011 christiansen et al 2008 damgaard et al 2013 parker et al 2008 pharmaceuticals nham et al 2016 and per and polyfluorinated alkyls pfas farhat et al 2022 hitzelberger et al 2022 based on the good accordance between our model and the observed data we propose that also for highly mobile contaminants such as pesticide metabolites and other pmocs back diffusion can result in prolonged leaching after last application this mechanism should be considered in conceptual models for sites with similar geological features 6 2 2 historical review and field investigations for pmocs it is difficult to link occurrences and sources of dms because 1 dms originates from several active constituents 2 tof and dcf have been used in diverse applications including paint wood protection and fruit and berry cultivation and 3 some applications are regulated in the eu as pesticides while others are under biocide regulation certain uses of biocides do not require recording of amounts sold in the present study these challenges were resolved by conducting a thorough review of the site history this included interviews review of former land use archive materials and aerial photos it is recommended to perform a historical review prior to site investigations to optimize the design of field campaigns and analytical programs porewater samples were employed to elucidate the temporal state of leaching from clayey till to aquifer by installing suction cups at a series of depths from 3 m bgs to 11 m bgs concentration profiles in the clayey till could be obtained it was observed that 1 leaching of dms from the clayey till was at the final stage in some areas of the former field and already passed in other areas 2 this agricultural area was a possible source for the contaminant plume and 3 the source strength matched dms occurrences in groundwater the configuration of the contaminant plume can provide information about the distance to the source and the source type as described in section 5 3 the former is useful in an investigation context where the aim is to locate sources of contamination the latter determining the source type is relevant for deciding remediation strategy and moreover the source type can have implications for the responsibility of remediation this is the case in danish regulation for point sources as opposed to diffuse sources danish epa 2022d 2016 in this study for instance a point source in the northern former strawberry field was identified by the geometry of the vertical concentration profiles determining the depth interval affected by contamination and the depth to maximum concentration require field methods capable of depth specific groundwater sampling at intervals of few meters and short screen lengths no greater than 1 m ideally shorter screens and higher resolution as described by rosenberg et al 2023 6 3 regulatory intervention for parent compounds of pmocs in their study of pesticides and pesticide metabolites at a national scale denmark kim et al 2022 found that responses in groundwater quality may be delayed for several decades after a regulatory intervention even for highly mobile compounds the same would be true for other pmocs furthermore they also found that response times may be further extended by retention of strongly sorbing parent compounds in the upper soil and gradual release of the metabolite s experiences with the herbicide metabolite 2 6 dichlorobenzamide bam confirm this similarly to dms bam can be characterized as a pmoc and was previously the most frequently detected pesticide metabolite in danish water supply wells 21 4 of sampled wells clausen et al 2007 in 2020 23 years after the ban of the parent compounds it was still detected in 16 4 of all drinking water wells jørgensen et al 2003 thorling et al 2021 in combination with the present study these experiences underline the importance of sufficient approval procedures for pesticides and other potential sources of pmocs topping et al 2020 and better monitoring programs mcginley et al 2023 currently pesticide metabolites are not sufficiently accounted for in approval procedures the approach in denmark is to test active constituents suspected of producing pmoc metabolites in monitored field application baran et al 2022 furthermore biocide application should be included in environmental permits and sales statistics to allow for later assessment of the application for instance use of the parent compounds of dms in outdoor paint and wood protection products have been shown to cause extensive soil and groundwater contamination with dms in urban areas albers et al 2023 differences in monitoring programs even for eu countries within the same legal framework also complicate the assessment of occurrence in the environment finally it is necessary to strengthen monitoring of biocides and their metabolites baran et al 2022 7 conclusion this study reviewed the properties of a pmoc dms and related compounds and conceptualized their environmental fate after application of a parent compound as a pesticide the parent compounds and intermediates most likely sorb to topsoil and undergo degradation there whereas dms has the potential of leaching to groundwater this is confirmed by detailed field observations at an agricultural site with strawberry production modeling of flow and solute transport and field observations showed that fracture matrix interactions can be a significant mechanism for prolonging the leaching time even for non sorbing chemicals this implies a longer delay between application stop and complete leaching from clayey till than anticipated porewater samples were particularly useful in documenting the pmoc distribution in clayey till as deep as 12 m bgs high resolution vertical concentration profiles proved helpful in locating sources and in combination with modeling estimating source strengths a conceptual model was built for two source types a point source and a diffuse source contamination from both source types may be retained in fractured clayey till and released slowly by back diffusion this insight is valuable since many pmoc sources are of historical origin the findings of this study accentuate the need to revise approval procedures of pesticides and biocides to 1 factor in the possible formation of persistent and mobile metabolites and 2 align biocide regulation with that of

1182,we propose a novel method to measure the specific capillary associated interfacial area a wn between non wetting and wetting fluids by applying kinetic interface sensitive kis tracers under steady state two phase co flow conditions seven column experiments were conducted with a column filled with glass beads diameter d50 170 μm serving as the solid grain network of a porous granular material the experiments were performed for two flow scenarios i e five experiments were performed for drainage conditions increasing non wetting saturation and two experiments for imbibition conditions increasing wetting saturation to obtain different saturation levels in the column and consequently different capillarity induced interfacial areas between the fluids the experiments were performed for different fractional flow ratios i e the ratio between injection rate of the wetting phase and total injection rate the concentrations of the kis tracer reaction by product were recorded at each saturation level and the corresponding interfacial area was calculated as a result of the fractional flow condition a wide range of wetting phase saturation is created 0 3 s w 0 8 the measured a wn increases with decreasing wetting phase saturation for the range 0 55 s w 0 8 and then is followed by a drop in wetting phase saturation of 0 3 s w 0 55 a good fit for our calculated a wn is

the fluid fluid wetting non wetting interfacial area in porous media is of critical importance to multiple disciplines since it plays an important role for understanding multiphase flow processes such as mass transfer across the fluid fluid interface hassanizadeh and gray 1990 reeves and celia 1996 several engineering applications can benefit from the quantification of the interfacial area such as enhanced oil recovery using co2 sugai et al 2014 where a higher interfacial area increases the swelling of oil induced by the dissolved co2 therefore leading to a higher mobilization of residual oil further advantages are seen in improving the characterization of nonaqueous phase liquid plumes napls in contaminated aquifers annable et al 1998 and the assessment of vadose zone characteristics for the quantification of recharge processes tatomir et al 2016 2018 niemi et al 2017 brusseau 2018 it is important when addressing the fluid fluid interfacial area to first distinguish between the film area covering the grains and the capillary interfacial area associated with the bulk volume of the liquid phase araújo and brusseau 2019 referred to it as menisci kibbey and chen 2012 define the combination of those two areas film area capillary associated interfacial area as the total interfacial area another term mentioned in the literature is the effective interfacial area which represents the tracer s hydro dynamically accessible interfacial area i e the effective area which ranges between total and capillary area brusseau et al 2007 previously reported tracer methods e g karkare and fort 1996 saripalli et al 1997 schaefer et al 2000 kibbey and chen 2012 showed difficulties to distinguish between total interfacial area effective interfacial area capillary associated interfacial area and film area the reasons are attributed to the difficulty to assess to which area the tracer has access to saripalli et al 1997 and also because each measurement technique has certain sensitivity to experimental artifacts that are in some cases unrecognizable kibbey and chen 2012 several laboratory techniques were developed to measure and quantify the interfacial area some used tracers such as the interfacial partitioning tracer test iptt saripalli et al 1997 schaefer et al 2000 faisal anwar et al 2000 jain et al 2003 zhong et al 2016 gas adsorption chemical reaction gacr lyu et al 2017 kinetic interface sensitive tracers test kis tt tatomir et al 2018 and others used optical approaches such as microfluidic experiments cheng et al 2004 chen et al 2007 karadimitriou et al 2014 and x ray computed micro tomography cmt culligan et al 2004 brusseau et al 2007 iptt is based on the application of two tracers a reactive and non reactive tracer the basic principle of the method is to compare the retardation of the reactive tracer with the breakthrough curve of the non reactive tracer to calculate the interfacial area the iptt method is shown to be able to determine the effective interfacial area which implies that the hydrodynamically accessible area is being measured a combination of the capillary associated interface and the film interface kibbey and chen 2012 kim et al 1997 and saripalli et al 1997 performed their experiments on both sand and glass beads in a column experiments both experiments were performed for unsaturated static conditions saripalli et al 1997 used a napl water system while kim et al 1997 used an air water system schaefer et al 2000 and faisal anwar et al 2000 used a column that consists of multiple separable rings in order to create different degrees of saturation and capillary pressure inside the column they both showed that the effective interfacial area increases linearly with a decrease in the wetting saturation jain et al 2003 and zhong et al 2016 performed their experiments in steady state two phase co flow conditions in which both napl and water were injected simultaneously jain et al 2003 studied the impact of wettability and the associated thin film on the total interfacial area in principle jain et al 2003 showed that although a high influence of the film area on the measured effective interfacial area of a water wet system can be observed no such behavior can be observed in an oil wet system zhong et al 2016 introduced their steady state method as an alternative to the standard iptt approach to provide measurement of interfacial area over a wider range of wetting saturations all iptt methods showed that the measured interfacial area increases linearly with the decrease in the wetting saturation an indication that the measured area is the effective interfacial area unlike iptt which employs conservative and reactive tracers injected simultaneously the reactive tracer methods such as kis and gacr rely on the injection of a single reactive tracer lyu et al 2017 applied the gacr method used in chemical engineering to quantify the gas liquid interfacial area on two types of porous media glass beads and natural sand the gacr method provides a measure of the total interfacial area similar to the results obtained by iptt similarly to the gacr method determining the interfacial area with kis tracers relies on the reaction and mass transfer at the interface between the two fluids the kinetic interface sensitive kis tracers method was first developed by tatomir et al 2018 based on the identified chemical compounds synthesized by schaffer et al 2013 the kis tracer method was implemented in a column experiment in a primary drainage process it is based on measuring the by products of the kis tracer hydrolysis reaction at the fluid fluid interface unlike other tracer methods the drainage kis tt is aimed at measuring the mobile a wn to the authors knowledge the only tracer viable method to measure mobile a wn is the kis tt tatomir et al 2018 one constraint however is that the water volume produced at the outlet during the drainage process is limited which means that the tracer breakthrough curve is derived only from a limited number of measurement points another way to measure fifa can be done by using imaging techniques such as micromodels and cmt cheng et al 2004 culligan et al 2004 chen et al 2007 brusseau et al 2007 karadimitriou et al 2014 chen et al 2007 investigated the relationship between saturation capillary pressure interfacial area for drainage and imbibition processes in a two dimensional micromodel more recently karadimitriou et al 2014 performed a study on a transparent elongated polydimethylsiloxane pdms micromodel for transient conditions with high temporal and spatial resolutions in their study they showed the influence of the capillary number on the interfacial area for dynamic conditions a lower resolution imaging technique is x ray computed micro tomography cmt which can distinguish between capillary associated interface and total interface dalla et al 2002 culligan et al 2004 2005 schnaar and brusseau 2005 2006 brusseau et al 2007 however it falls short to provide the resolution for the detection of the film area kibbey and chen 2012 the advantage of imaging techniques is that they provide a clear distinction between total and a wn but they are only applicable on a laboratory scale and cannot be easily upscaled to a field application the literature provided kim et al 1997 brusseau et al 2006 chen et al 2007 kibbey and chen 2012 points out that quantifying the fluid fluid interfacial area using tracer tests is a challenge because it is not possible to determine what type of interface is actually being measured e g capillary associated interface film area total interfacial area etc this is mainly due to two reasons first the different types of tracers can measure different types of areas based on their working mechanism e g iptt is based on retardation while kis tt and gacr are based on mass transfer second each method was applied for different conditions e g two phase flow residual non wetting saturation separable rings column which results in different magnitudes of measured area kibbey and chen 2012 despite the promising results in the previous work by tatomir et al 2018 the kis tt was only applied in dynamic conditions i e two phase displacement processes in a pore scale numerical study gao et al 2021 showed that the drainage kis tt method measures specifically the mobile part of a wn which is relevant for the displacement front one limitation of the kis tt was the limited number of measurement points acquired during the drainage process leading to difficulty in matching the breakthrough curve tatomir et al 2018 in kis tt showed in a well controlled experiment the predicted interfacial area has a variation range of 25 of the mean as an alternative to the kis tt method we propose a new application of the kis tracer in steady state two phase flow conditions named kis sst in contrast to the traditional iptt methods applied in steady state conditions that measures the total interfacial area including the capillary associated and film associated interfaces the new kis sst method proposed in this study allows the measurement of the capillary associated interfacial area applied together with the iptt one could selectively distinguish between the capillary associated interfacial area and the total interfacial area the objective of this study is to propose a new method for measuring the a wn by applying the kis tracer in steady state conditions a steady state two phase co flow condition will allow the creation of a wider range of wetting saturations the steady state application of the tracer will also allow for continuous sampling of the tracer that reduces uncertainties associated with the measurement the effect of primary drainage and primary imbibition is also investigated we also used a known polynomial analytical model for the assessment of a wn to fit the experimental results furthermore we aim to compare the obtained results for specific ifa with other published data mainly based on interfacial partitioning tracer test iptt and computed micro tomography cmt 2 application of kis tracer for steady state two phase flow 2 1 theoretical background of the kinetic interface sensitive kis tracers a chemically stable compound phenyl naphthalene 2 sulfonate was synthesized as a kis tracer based on three prerequisites being a chemically active at the functional groups phenyl by hydrolysis b detectable at low concentrations by fluorescence naphthalene sulfonate and c chemically stable at high temperature georeservoir conditions naphthalene sulfonate schaffer et al 2013 the principle of a kis tracer is that a non polar organic chemical is dissolved in the non wetting phase and injected into the two phase fluid system the tracer hydrolysis at the interface between the two immiscible fluids is given in eq 1 according to schaffer et al 2013 the by product of the hydrolysis reaction depends on the interfacial area between the two fluids and the reaction time the kis tracer is non polar i e it is highly soluble in an organic fluid following the hydrolysis at the fluid fluid interface the reaction by products an acid and an alcohol dissolve in the water phase without back partitioning into the organic fluid schaffer et al 2013 as shown in fig 1 unlabelled image several assumptions are made to be able to interpret the experiment schaffer et al 2013 1 the hydrolysis reacted tracer instantaneously diffuses into the water phase because of the high aqueous diffusion coefficient 2 the reaction can be simplified to a zero order reaction kinetics 3 the adsorption process of the kis tracer onto the fluid fluid interface follows a langmuir isotherm a more detailed analysis of underlying physico chemical processes influencing diffusion adsorption reaction and mass transfer on the fluid fluid interface are presented by schaffer et al 2013 gao et al 2021 expressed the zero order hydrolysis reaction to calculate the fluid fluid interfacial area using the following equation 2 a wn m nw w r c nw w t reaction where r c nw w μg s 1 m 2 is the reaction rate at the fluid fluid interface per unit time m nw w μg is the mass of the hydrolyzed by product in the wetting phase and t reaction is the reaction time sec by dividing eq 2 with the bulk volume of porous media this volume is assumed to be larger than the representative element volume rev the specific capillary associated fluid fluid interfacial area can be expressed as 3 a wn c ss r c nw w t reaction where c ss g m 3 is the concentration of the 2 nsa at steady state the concept is explained in detail in section 2 2 a wn 1 m is the specific capillary associated interfacial area between the immiscible fluids inside an rev t reaction sec is the total reaction time i e time required to displace the bulk of water from the column since the reaction rate is at steady state conditions a function of time and magnitude of the interface between the two fluids the interface remains unaltered and therefore only the reaction time has to be recorded for the determination of the specific interfacial area the calculation of the reaction time is further discussed in section 2 3 2 2 steady state application in column experiments the concept of a simultaneous two phase co flow for steady state condition is based on the principle model where each phase fills its own fraction of the porous medium blunt 2017 which implies that the phases occupying the pore space at steady state form a static inter connected pathway network in this sense the non wetting phase occupies the larger pores while the wetting phase generally occupies the smaller pores and develops a wetting fluid film surrounding the grains as shown in fig 2a blunt 2017 experimental observations in both unconsolidated sand and micromodels showed that immiscible steady state two phase flow creates distinct and unchanged flow pathways temporally and spatially observations in micromodels showed that an increase in the saturation of one of the phases would lead to an increase in the number of channels pathways occupied by the same fluid and a decrease of the number the pathways of the other fluid blunt 2017 several authors pointed out that once steady state flow is achieved and the pathway established this pathway remains spatially and temporally stable and can be characterized by a stable interface chatenever and calhoun jr 1952 lenormand et al 1983 datta et al 2014 reynolds et al 2017 in our study we quantify the stable interfacial area by analyzing the reacted by product 2 nsa of the tracer at the outlet of the column eq 1 the 2 nsa is water soluble and uv detectable and therefore can be used to quantify the a wn as shown in fig 2c in a steady state two phase flow we consider both fluid phases as being mobile except for the existing film of wetting phase directly covering the grains richards 1931 based on fig 2b three distinct regions of fluids can be seen 1 the mobile wetting phase in the smaller pores cyan color 2 the mobile non wetting phase in the larger pores yellow color and 3 the immobile film area of the wetting phase covering the grains shown in dashed line in fig 2c we are interested in the identification of those areas where the reaction occurs i e those areas constitute the capillary associated fluid fluid interfacial area between the mobile wetting phase and mobile non wetting phase awn and the area between the immobile film area of wetting and the non wetting phase as shown in fig 2c the film area might not exist in case the porous media was first saturated with the non wetting phase i e primary imbibition with the saturation starting at s nw 100 as shown in fig 2d the proposed kis sst method is a reactive tracer method i e it relies on the detection of the reaction byproduct 2 nsa at the column outlet fig 2c shows two possible reaction areas capillary interface and film area but only one type of area is detectable by the reactive tracer because only the mobile water can transport the 2 nsa constituent to the outlet therefore the 2 nsa concentration does not measure the film area but the a wn this distinguishes the presented method from other methods such as the iptt where the measurement of the retardation of a surfactant at the interface experiences retardation at both types of interfaces for that reason iptt measures an effective or total fluid fluid interfacial area formed by fractions of both the capillary associated and the film area kibbey and chen 2012 while the kis tracer by product only sees the capillary interfaces 2 3 calculation of the reaction time roy et al 2020 introduced a derivation to calculate the seepage velocity of the phases for two phase flow we followed the derivation of the seepage velocity to further calculate the reaction time defined here as the time wetting and non wetting phases are in contact inside the column i e the travel time required for the wetting phase to travel from the inlet of the column to the outlet we consider the bulk volume of our column to be vb and the pore volume to be vp then the effective porosity can be defined as follows 4 φ v p v b 5 v b a l where a m2 is the cross sectional area of the column and l m is the length of the column with a uniformity coefficient of d60 d10 1 23 the glass beads used in the experiment as porous medium can assumed as homogeneous so that we can define an effective cross sectional area a e as follows 6 a e φ a a constant total flow rate is maintained throughout the experiment composed of two volumetric rates q w and q nw for the wetting and non wetting phase respectively they relate to each other as follows 7 q t q w q nw the column pore volume is composed by the wetting and non wetting phases and the saturation of each phase is the ratio of its volume related to the total pore volume 8 v p v w v nw 9 s w v w v p 10 s nw v nw v p dividing eq 8 by the length of the column we arrive at the equation 11 a e a w a nw a w and a n represent the cross sectional areas occupied by wetting and non wetting fluid respectively since glass beads can be considered as a uniform homogeneous medium an average of a w and a n at any cross section through the porous medium perpendicular to the flow direction will be similar roy et al 2020 therefore 12 a w s w a e then we can define the seepage velocity for the wetting phase which transports the dissolved reaction by product 2 nsa as 13 v w q w a w with the seepage velocity quantified the seepage time i e the reaction time can then be derived from eqs 6 12 and 13 and calculated as follows 14 t reaction φ a s w l q w the calculated reaction time is then used in eq 3 to calculate the a wn 2 4 fitting experimental data hassanizadeh and gray 1990 derived a thermodynamic mathematical model to account for the interfacial forces during two phase flow namely the interfaces between wetting and nonwetting fluids wetting fluid and solid and nonwetting fluid and solid in their work they proposed a constitutive relationship that relates capillary pressure saturation and specific interfacial area pc sw awn later joekar niasar et al 2008 showed that the constitutive relationship can be formulated as a second order polynomial 15 a wn s w p c a 00

mean square error is achieved 3 materials and methods 3 1 materials well characterized glass beads are used as the column filling material for steady state two phase co flow experiments the glass beads have a mean diameter of ca 170 μm and the physical properties of the column fill are provided in table 1 a microscopic image of the grains and the grain size distributions obtained by digital image analysis and mercury intrusion porosimetry performed on the glass beads are shown in the supporting information similar material was used in our previous study tatomir et al 2020 two fluids are used for all experiments water as the wetting phase and n octane as the non wetting phase two peristaltic pumps are used one for water and one for n octane with a t junction connecting them at the inlet of the column the stainless steel column used for the experiments measures 30 cm in length and has a diameter of 3 cm the large size is intended to minimize the impact of capillary end effect that could be caused by the steady state two phase flow both ends of the column are sealed with tight stainless steel flanges using six screws each flange is equipped with a stainless steel porous disc to prevent the loss of glass beads and ensure an even distribution of fluids at the front of the column an even distribution of fluids helps to reduce the impact of intermittent flow caused by alternating wetting and non wetting fluids all other tubing connections junctions and valves are manufactured of peek material polyether ether ketone which has no known tendency for chemical reaction with the fluids employed for all experiments two immiscible fluids are used extra pure deionized water as the wetting phase and n octane thermo scientific acros cas 111 65 9 as the non wetting phase their properties are listed in table 2 all experiments are prepared with an initial kis tracer concentration higher than 1 g l i e with kis tracer concentrations of 1 g l 1 3 g l 1 7 g l and 2 g l respective kis concentration and reaction rate for all experiments can be found in appendix 2 the concentration of both the tracer and the by product were measured using a fluorescence spectrometer cary eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer 3 2 experimental procedure a schematic representation of the experimental setup is provided in fig 3 seven kis tracer tests are conducted for steady state simultaneous two phase co flow conditions i e the two fluids water and n octane are pumped simultaneously into the column to achieve the two phase flow an overview of the experiments performed is provided in table 3 more details of the collected data are provided in appendix 1 the column was filled for each experiment with dry clean glass beads followed by 30 min of co2 flushing to eliminate gas entrapment afterwards deionized water was flushed through the column for 24 h until a constant background intensity in the fluorescence spectrometer is reached to ensure that the filled glass beads are clean a constant total flow rate of 1 ml min was kept for each of the experiments and different fractional flows ratios of wetting injection rate total injection rate of the phases injected were used to modify the saturation two types of experiments were performed drainage increasing non wetting saturation and imbibition increasing wetting phase saturation depending on the fluid initially presented inside the column for drainage the column filled with glass beads was initially fully saturated with water while for imbibition it was fully saturated with n octane for both experiments drainage and imbibition water and n octane were utilized for saturation and recirculated for 24 h in a graduated cylinder of known volume the porosity was then measured gravimetrically by recording the volume of the remaining water in the graduated cylinder the packed and saturated column is used for the steady state experiments at different water n octane flow rate ratios both water and n octane are injected from the bottom of the column concurrently until a steady state condition is reached for drainage a simultaneous injection started with water n octane flow rate ratio of 9 1 i e 0 9 ml min water rate and 0 1 ml min n octane rate when steady state flow conditions are reached water samples are being collected periodically and their respective concentration is recorded then the flow rate ratio of water n octane is dropped again until a new steady state is reached in order to reduce the flow rate ratio the water rate is reduced and the n octane rate is increased while maintaining a total of 1 ml min fluid flux rate a total of six pore volumes are injected for a period of 8 h until steady state is achieved a steady state is achieved by considering two thresholds a change in saturation 2 and change in concentration of 0 5 μg l for the reaction by product 2 nsa the threshold used is similar to the one used in experiments reported by zhong et al 2016 in the supporting information fig si 1 we show the temporal evolution of the concentration and saturation reflecting the change from the transient period into the steady state for both concentration and saturation in a drainage condition for imbibition experiments similar procedure is used but the simultaneous injection begins with 0 8 ml min n octane and 0 2 ml min water the effluent of water and n octane is collected in a 100 ml graduated cylinder until steady state is reached afterwards the samples are collected more frequently in 10 ml cylinders the volumes of each fraction collected are recorded with an accuracy of 0 2 ml and the volume of fluids injected is also recorded with an accuracy of 0 2 ml the volume and collection time of each step is also recorded in order to determine the flow rate accuracy then the content of each cylinder water and n octane is separated and water is placed in a micro cuvette for measuring the 2 nsa concentration with the fluorescence spectrometer finally the 2 nsa concentration is measured by converting intensity units into concentration μg l using a pre calibrated curve 3 3 data analysis the saturations of both phases inside the column for every experimental step are calculated by a mass balance equation as shown below 18 s w s nw 1 since the pore volume is known and the volumes of produced and injected phases are recorded for each step and considering that the column is initially water saturated the non wetting phase saturation inside the column can be calculated as follows 19 s nw v nwi cum v nwp cum v p v nwi cum v nwp cum represent the cumulative injected subscript i non wetting phase and cumulative produced subscript p non wetting phase therefore the difference between these values represents the volume of the non wetting phase trapped inside the column for verification the s nw is compared to the non wetting phase saturation measured using the wetting phase volumes injected and produced with eq 20 20 s nw v wp cum v wi cum v p where v wp cum v wi cum represent the cumulative produced wetting phase and the cumulative injected wetting phase in eq 20 the difference between v wp cum and v wi cum gives the trapped non wetting phase the saturation values obtained using eqs 19 and 20 are identical with a relative error range of 0 5 appendix 1 provides a table of the deviation between the wetting phase saturation calculated by eqs 19 and 20 4 results 4 1 fractional flows of water n octane with dissolved kis tracer seven experiments in total were performed for steady state conditions five of them were performed for drainage conditions and two for imbibition conditions for drainage experiments 1 5 we start with a fully water saturated column with a water flow rate of 1 ml min then the co flow simultaneous injection was initiated by decreasing the water flow rate from 1 ml min periodically to 0 8 ml min 0 6 ml min 0 4 ml min and 0 1 ml min accompanied by an increase in n octane rate 0 2 ml min 0 4 ml min 0 6 ml min and 0 9 ml min to maintain a total flow rate of 1 ml min for imbibition experiments 6 7 the sequence of the experimental steps is as follows the experiments started with a column fully saturated with n octane non wetting phase and then the fractional flow is changed periodically the change in fractional flow induces a change in saturation such that a water saturation range of 0 3 0 8 is being created a linear relationship can be observed between water saturation and fractional flow for all experiments drainage and imbibition performed on glass beads as shown in the best fitted regression line of fig 4 the imbibition experiments appear to show a steeper saturation fractional flow relationship and therefore lower saturation can be achieved these findings are similar to the data previously reported by zhong et al 2016 for both glass beads and sand in their study zhong et al 2016 showed that similar trends are obtained for glass beads d50 1 16 mm and sand d50 0 35 a small deviation of the data from the fitted line is observed and can be related to two main factors 1 changes caused by the packing process as the column is repacked for each experiment resulting in new configurations of the porous medium each time 2 alternatively such small deviations can be caused by the inherent pulsation of the pumps however none of these issues impacted the general slope of the curve nor the saturation reported in appendix 2 furthermore a relation between fractional flow and relative permeability is established and provided in the supporting information based on na et al 2011 study resulting in a rmse of 0 002 due to the pump s pressure fluctuations hoffmeier et al 2014 it was not possible to maintain a stable and constant 1 ml min flowrate during the experiments therefore ranges of flow rates between 0 94 ml min and 1 2 ml min are recorded in appendix 2 4 2 capillary associated interfacial area vs water saturation the calculated specific capillary associated interfacial area using eq 3 from the seven experiments showed good repeatability that is evident in the small deviation of saturation and concentration reported in appendix 2 for a global flow rate of 1 ml min in all experiments the water saturation showed a deviation of a maximum 1 between the samples collected at the same step similarly the concentration measured each step had a deviation of 0 45 μg l furthermore no significant differences are observed between the vertical and horizontal column orientation the experiments were conducted using a reaction rate rc 0 006 0 008 0 009 and 0 012 μg m 2 s 1 corresponding to kis concentration of 1 1 3 1 7 and 2 g l 1 respectively the concentration at steady state css was measured between 2 μg l to 20 μg l across all experiments reported in appendix 2 a wn as a function of water saturation a wn s w obtained using the kis sst tracer are presented in fig 5 the areas calculated from drainage experiments experiments 1 5 for 0 55 s w 0 8 show a continuous increase in area because water is being drained until a water saturation of s w 0 55 is achieved followed by a slight dip in area for 0 4 s w 0 55 moreover the imbibition experiments experiments 6 and 7 provided measurements at the saturation range of 0 3 s w 0 4 the areas measured from imbibition experiments showed a continuous drop for 0 3 s w 0 4 these results are consistent with earlier findings for capillary associated air water interfacial area using cmt method performed by culligan et al 2004 2005 and brusseau et al 2007 or decane water interfacial area in micromodels presented by cheng et al 2004 this is also consistent with prior numerical measurement of a wn employing the thermodynamic model shown by grant and gerhard 2007 and the constitutive relationship between p c s w ifa interfacial area provided by porter et al 2010 our findings showed that the peak of the a wn occurs at wetting saturation of s w 0 55 this finding is consistent with the experimental findings using x ray cmt measurement of brusseau et al 2006 2007 where their data showed highest a wn for a saturation range of 0 4 s w 0 5 nonetheless prior findings by culligan et al 2004 2005 using cmt showed the highest a wn to be in the wetting saturation range of 0 2 s w 0 35 furthermore the results obtained using pore network models performed by reeves and celia 1996 and dalla et al 2002 showed a peak in a wn in the range of 0 2 s w 0 3 the best fitted curves for the measured a wn using the polynomial of eq 16 are shown in fig 5 best fit was achieved by adjusting the following parameters s wr a 0 a 1 a 2 a 3 and calculating the least mean square error rmse a rmse of 0 165 and 0 07 was found for the envelope fitting curves respectively appendix 3 provides the parameters used for both curves and their respective rmse where data from experiments 2 and 5 were used as fitting data for the minimum and maximum curves respectively best fit was achieved for water saturations of s w 0 55 and s w 0 4 for minimum and maximum enveloping curves respectively these findings and the shapes of those curves are consistent with pore network model results provided by joekar niasar et al 2008 4 3 interfacial area measured by kis sst compared to x ray cmt fluid fluid interfacial area determined using x ray computed micro tomography cmt from previous studies are shown in fig 6 fig 6a shows a comparison between our findings and the results of culligan et al 2004 in which cmt was implemented on soda lime glass bead porous material average diameter 0 86 mm a wn measured using kis tracer shows a similarly shaped curve to that of the cmt where the a wn starts to increase with decreasing wetting saturation until a maximum value is reached followed by a drop when the wetting saturation approaches s w 0 the main difference between the mentioned method and our new approach is that our approach shows the maximum interfacial area at 0 4 s w 0 5 rather than 0 25 s w 0 35 as reported by culligan et al 2004 in fig 6b our results are compared with those of a cmt experiment presented by brusseau et al 2006 2007 where vinton soil average grain diameter of 0 234 mm was used to measure both capillary and total interfacial area in an air water system the results presented by brusseau et al 2006 2007 showed that the maximum a wn falls in a range of 0 4 s w 0 5 similar to the results obtained by our kis tracer method the total interfacial area on the other hand presented by both culligan et al 2004 and brusseau et al 2006 2007 shows a linear shaped curve shown in fig 6 meaning that the interfacial area increases with decreasing wetting saturation until the intersection with the interfacial area axis the point of intersection of the linear curve with the interfacial area axis at s w 0 is close to the total surface area of the grain interpreted as a combination of the film area surrounding the grains and the a wn saripalli et al 1997 brusseau et al 2006 2007 4 4 analysis of drainage and imbibition using kis sst and a comparison to kis tt in fig 7a we present the averaged values of primary drainage and primary imbibition experiments using kis sst along with their respective error ranges and best fitted curves we also include the pi and pd experiments carried out by culligan et al 2005 using cmt while culligan et al 2005 identified slightly higher interfacial areas during the drainage process than during the imbibition process in an air water system it was more difficult to observe these differences in an oil water system our results as shown in fig 7a indicate a similar behavior where the pd and pi experiments fall within the same range between the maximum and minimum values these findings demonstrate the challenges of measuring the differences in capillary associated interfacial area between pi and pd additionally to better understand the impact of film area we conducted pi experiments with zero wetting phase saturation this means that the column was initially filled 100 with non wetting phase jain et al 2003 also conducted a similar study on modified oil wet glass beads and found that the measured interfacial area exhibits anomalous behavior during the drainage of decane the wetting phase being decane this is attributed to the absence of wetting phase film area jain et al 2003 suggests that the tracer did not see the decane film or that the film area has been washed out on the other hand our study found that both pi and pd fall within the same range even in the absence of film area suggesting that the tracer is unaffected by the film surrounding the glass beads fig 7a fig 7b shows a comparison between the results of kis tt performed by tatomir et al 2020 and the kis sst presented in this study both using the same glass beads the measurement using kis tt method shows a lower mobile capillary interfacial area for both maximum and minimum curves this was expected given that the capillary interface measured with kis tt are related the front measured during dynamic conditions on the other hand kis sst measures the total capillary interface mobile immobile gao et al 2021 a summary of these comparisons is provided separately in appendix 4 allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the comparison between these two methods 5 discussion tracer methods such as iptt cannot distinguish between different types of measured interfacial areas because of the inability to recognize which type of interface the tracer has access to i e the tracer has access to both a wn and film area the presented kis sst unlike other tracer methods measures the a wn and not the total or effective interfacial area the lack of impact from the film area on the kis tracer technique is attributed to 1 the by product of the reaction at the film interface is not carried out of the column and cannot be detected although the hydrolysis reaction does occur between tracer and the film area the reaction by product remains trapped inside the immobile film 2 even though the film area has a large interface with the non wetting phase the diffusion of 2 nsa from the film area into the mobile bulk water is very small due to its small contact area few nanometers between bulk water and the film area fig 2 one possible discrepancy between the presented method and the interfacial area measurements reported in literature can be explained by the impact of the hysteresis of the drainage imbibition cycles it has been reported that the hysteresis of the drainage imbibition cycles affects the values of a wn this impact has been shown both in pore scale modeling studies and cmt experiments zhong et al 2016 culligan et al 2004 and porter et al 2010 employed the cmt method and found that the measured a wn values for glass beads were lower for imbibition cycles compared to those for drainage conditions i e the capillary interface configuration between the wetting nonwetting phases is different for imbibition and drainage conditions such behavior is not observed in our experiments the measured a wn for both imbibition and drainage had no significant differences fig 5 because the drainage and imbibition experiments are performed separately unlike drainage imbibition hysteresis cycles reported in literature here the drainage experiments are performed in a glass bead filled column with 100 water saturation similarly the imbibition experiments are performed in a glass bead filled column but 100 n octane saturated therefore the configuration of the capillary interface did not undergo any changes expected in a hysteresis cycle another potential issue is the distribution of the fluids attained with the proposed kis sst method applied in co flow conditions which may be different than the distributions obtained with other methods for instance the standard iptt approaches rely on creating a residual saturation of either the non wetting or the wetting phase with the tracers being introduced in the single phase flow therefore in the kis sst method questions arise on how does the interface configuration look like and how stable are these when both phases flow concurrently inside the column would there be a flow discontinuity that would limit the distribution of the phases such an issue was investigated by culligan et al 2005 who used x ray cmt high resolution 3d images to characterize a simultaneous two phase flow they did not observe any fluid discontinuity for an oil water system they also showed that fluid distribution and interfacial area remained unchanged indicating that the distribution of fluids inside the column is consistent with those realized with standard methods gravitational instabilities were reported by jain et al 2003 caused by the difference in densities between water and decane with the injection from the bottom of the column such instabilities can lead to a higher water saturation at the same level of fractional flow jain et al 2003 in order to tackle this issue we performed all the experiments with the column in vertical orientation except for a single experiment experiment 3 with the column oriented horizontally to check for differences in fractional flow and saturation relation no noticeable differences were observed among the injection schemes so that we can exclude instability problems during the experiment 6 summary and conclusions in this study a novel method to measure the capillary associated interfacial area in steady state two phase co flow conditions using the kinetic interface sensitive tracer is developed and presented to demonstrate the method s viability over a wide range of wetting saturations a series of column two phase flow experiments are conducted the kis sst method relies on measuring the acid by product of the hydrolysis reaction at the fluid fluid interface as a quantitative proxy for the capillary associated interfacial area when the fluids are in steady state condition the results obtained by the kis sst method showed that the a wn s w relationships have a similar profile to the ones obtained by the cmt method as shown in fig 6 i e a wn increases as the s w decreases until reaching a maximum and then the interfacial area starts decreasing for saturations below s w 0 55 this despite that the a wn values obtained using kis sst cannot be directly compared to the other methods reported in the literature as the measured a wn is influenced by many factors besides the measurement method such as grain size distribution pore space geometry texture grain surface roughness the fluids applied wettability and chemical composition besides we demonstrated the reliability of the method by performing multiple experiments under different flow conditions primary imbibition and primary drainage and different flow directions column vertically and horizontally positioned the results obtained from those conditions showed similar trends and the values obtained were in the same range furthermore the a wn s w relationship determined with the kis sst method is fitted using a polynomial model previously used in several studies e g joekar niasar et al 2008 tatomir et al 2018 the polynomial model is fitted to the experimental data by finding the minimum rmse which was found to be 0 16 and 0 07 kis sst method can be used in conjunction with the kis tt applied in dynamic conditions tatomir et al 2018 which measures the mobile part of the a wn this allows one to develop a good understanding of the mobile and non mobile size of ifa an advantage of the kis sst method over drainage kis tt is that there is no limitation in the number of measurements because the method allows for continuous sampling for each flow fraction at the outlet of the column continuous sampling will reduce errors that might be caused by impurities in the sampling vial by eliminating outliers by simply collecting more samples further investigations are being carried out to create a wider range of experimental data and improve the efficiency of the experimental setup one prospect is to apply the steady state co flow kis tracer method to other types of porous materials e g different sands or even core samples and to observe the impact of grain structure and material heterogeneity another application of the kis tracer in two phase co flow is to investigate the variation of a wn as a function of saturation change in the column da wn ds w a critical information for modeling and simulating multi phase flow in porous media in practice the kis sst could be used as a complementary method for the standard iptt methods credit authorship contribution statement h abdullah conceptualization methodology investigation validation

1182,we propose a novel method to measure the specific capillary associated interfacial area a wn between non wetting and wetting fluids by applying kinetic interface sensitive kis tracers under steady state two phase co flow conditions seven column experiments were conducted with a column filled with glass beads diameter d50 170 μm serving as the solid grain network of a porous granular material the experiments were performed for two flow scenarios i e five experiments were performed for drainage conditions increasing non wetting saturation and two experiments for imbibition conditions increasing wetting saturation to obtain different saturation levels in the column and consequently different capillarity induced interfacial areas between the fluids the experiments were performed for different fractional flow ratios i e the ratio between injection rate of the wetting phase and total injection rate the concentrations of the kis tracer reaction by product were recorded at each saturation level and the corresponding interfacial area was calculated as a result of the fractional flow condition a wide range of wetting phase saturation is created 0 3 s w 0 8 the measured a wn increases with decreasing wetting phase saturation for the range 0 55 s w 0 8 and then is followed by a drop in wetting phase saturation of 0 3 s w 0 55 a good fit for our calculated a wn is obtained rmse 0 16 using a polynomial model additionally the results of the proposed method are compared to published experimental data and the method s main advantages and limitations are discussed

the fluid fluid wetting non wetting interfacial area in porous media is of critical importance to multiple disciplines since it plays an important role for understanding multiphase flow processes such as mass transfer across the fluid fluid interface hassanizadeh and gray 1990 reeves and celia 1996 several engineering applications can benefit from the quantification of the interfacial area such as enhanced oil recovery using co2 sugai et al 2014 where a higher interfacial area increases the swelling of oil induced by the dissolved co2 therefore leading to a higher mobilization of residual oil further advantages are seen in improving the characterization of nonaqueous phase liquid plumes napls in contaminated aquifers annable et al 1998 and the assessment of vadose zone characteristics for the quantification of recharge processes tatomir et al 2016 2018 niemi et al 2017 brusseau 2018 it is important when addressing the fluid fluid interfacial area to first distinguish between the film area covering the grains and the capillary interfacial area associated with the bulk volume of the liquid phase araújo and brusseau 2019 referred to it as menisci kibbey and chen 2012 define the combination of those two areas film area capillary associated interfacial area as the total interfacial area another term mentioned in the literature is the effective interfacial area which represents the tracer s hydro dynamically accessible interfacial area i e the effective area which ranges between total and capillary area brusseau et al 2007 previously reported tracer methods e g karkare and fort 1996 saripalli et al 1997 schaefer et al 2000 kibbey and chen 2012 showed difficulties to distinguish between total interfacial area effective interfacial area capillary associated interfacial area and film area the reasons are attributed to the difficulty to assess to which area the tracer has access to saripalli et al 1997 and also because each measurement technique has certain sensitivity to experimental artifacts that are in some cases unrecognizable kibbey and chen 2012 several laboratory techniques were developed to measure and quantify the interfacial area some used tracers such as the interfacial partitioning tracer test iptt saripalli et al 1997 schaefer et al 2000 faisal anwar et al 2000 jain et al 2003 zhong et al 2016 gas adsorption chemical reaction gacr lyu et al 2017 kinetic interface sensitive tracers test kis tt tatomir et al 2018 and others used optical approaches such as microfluidic experiments cheng et al 2004 chen et al 2007 karadimitriou et al 2014 and x ray computed micro tomography cmt culligan et al 2004 brusseau et al 2007 iptt is based on the application of two tracers a reactive and non reactive tracer the basic principle of the method is to compare the retardation of the reactive tracer with the breakthrough curve of the non reactive tracer to calculate the interfacial area the iptt method is shown to be able to determine the effective interfacial area which implies that the hydrodynamically accessible area is being measured a combination of the capillary associated interface and the film interface kibbey and chen 2012 kim et al 1997 and saripalli et al 1997 performed their experiments on both sand and glass beads in a column experiments both experiments were performed for unsaturated static conditions saripalli et al 1997 used a napl water system while kim et al 1997 used an air water system schaefer et al 2000 and faisal anwar et al 2000 used a column that consists of multiple separable rings in order to create different degrees of saturation and capillary pressure inside the column they both showed that the effective interfacial area increases linearly with a decrease in the wetting saturation jain et al 2003 and zhong et al 2016 performed their experiments in steady state two phase co flow conditions in which both napl and water were injected simultaneously jain et al 2003 studied the impact of wettability and the associated thin film on the total interfacial area in principle jain et al 2003 showed that although a high influence of the film area on the measured effective interfacial area of a water wet system can be observed no such behavior can be observed in an oil wet system zhong et al 2016 introduced their steady state method as an alternative to the standard iptt approach to provide measurement of interfacial area over a wider range of wetting saturations all iptt methods showed that the measured interfacial area increases linearly with the decrease in the wetting saturation an indication that the measured area is the effective interfacial area unlike iptt which employs conservative and reactive tracers injected simultaneously the reactive tracer methods such as kis and gacr rely on the injection of a single reactive tracer lyu et al 2017 applied the gacr method used in chemical engineering to quantify the gas liquid interfacial area on two types of porous media glass beads and natural sand the gacr method provides a measure of the total interfacial area similar to the results obtained by iptt similarly to the gacr method determining the interfacial area with kis tracers relies on the reaction and mass transfer at the interface between the two fluids the kinetic interface sensitive kis tracers method was first developed by tatomir et al 2018 based on the identified chemical compounds synthesized by schaffer et al 2013 the kis tracer method was implemented in a column experiment in a primary drainage process it is based on measuring the by products of the kis tracer hydrolysis reaction at the fluid fluid interface unlike other tracer methods the drainage kis tt is aimed at measuring the mobile a wn to the authors knowledge the only tracer viable method to measure mobile a wn is the kis tt tatomir et al 2018 one constraint however is that the water volume produced at the outlet during the drainage process is limited which means that the tracer breakthrough curve is derived only from a limited number of measurement points another way to measure fifa can be done by using imaging techniques such as micromodels and cmt cheng et al 2004 culligan et al 2004 chen et al 2007 brusseau et al 2007 karadimitriou et al 2014 chen et al 2007 investigated the relationship between saturation capillary pressure interfacial area for drainage and imbibition processes in a two dimensional micromodel more recently karadimitriou et al 2014 performed a study on a transparent elongated polydimethylsiloxane pdms micromodel for transient conditions with high temporal and spatial resolutions in their study they showed the influence of the capillary number on the interfacial area for dynamic conditions a lower resolution imaging technique is x ray computed micro tomography cmt which can distinguish between capillary associated interface and total interface dalla et al 2002 culligan et al 2004 2005 schnaar and brusseau 2005 2006 brusseau et al 2007 however it falls short to provide the resolution for the detection of the film area kibbey and chen 2012 the advantage of imaging techniques is that they provide a clear distinction between total and a wn but they are only applicable on a laboratory scale and cannot be easily upscaled to a field application the literature provided kim et al 1997 brusseau et al 2006 chen et al 2007 kibbey and chen 2012 points out that quantifying the fluid fluid interfacial area using tracer tests is a challenge because it is not possible to determine what type of interface is actually being measured e g capillary associated interface film area total interfacial area etc this is mainly due to two reasons first the different types of tracers can measure different types of areas based on their working mechanism e g iptt is based on retardation while kis tt and gacr are based on mass transfer second each method was applied for different conditions e g two phase flow residual non wetting saturation separable rings column which results in different magnitudes of measured area kibbey and chen 2012 despite the promising results in the previous work by tatomir et al 2018 the kis tt was only applied in dynamic conditions i e two phase displacement processes in a pore scale numerical study gao et al 2021 showed that the drainage kis tt method measures specifically the mobile part of a wn which is relevant for the displacement front one limitation of the kis tt was the limited number of measurement points acquired during the drainage process leading to difficulty in matching the breakthrough curve tatomir et al 2018 in kis tt showed in a well controlled experiment the predicted interfacial area has a variation range of 25 of the mean as an alternative to the kis tt method we propose a new application of the kis tracer in steady state two phase flow conditions named kis sst in contrast to the traditional iptt methods applied in steady state conditions that measures the total interfacial area including the capillary associated and film associated interfaces the new kis sst method proposed in this study allows the measurement of the capillary associated interfacial area applied together with the iptt one could selectively distinguish between the capillary associated interfacial area and the total interfacial area the objective of this study is to propose a new method for measuring the a wn by applying the kis tracer in steady state conditions a steady state two phase co flow condition will allow the creation of a wider range of wetting saturations the steady state application of the tracer will also allow for continuous sampling of the tracer that reduces uncertainties associated with the measurement the effect of primary drainage and primary imbibition is also investigated we also used a known polynomial analytical model for the assessment of a wn to fit the experimental results furthermore we aim to compare the obtained results for specific ifa with other published data mainly based on interfacial partitioning tracer test iptt and computed micro tomography cmt 2 application of kis tracer for steady state two phase flow 2 1 theoretical background of the kinetic interface sensitive kis tracers a chemically stable compound phenyl naphthalene 2 sulfonate was synthesized as a kis tracer based on three prerequisites being a chemically active at the functional groups phenyl by hydrolysis b detectable at low concentrations by fluorescence naphthalene sulfonate and c chemically stable at high temperature georeservoir conditions naphthalene sulfonate schaffer et al 2013 the principle of a kis tracer is that a non polar organic chemical is dissolved in the non wetting phase and injected into the two phase fluid system the tracer hydrolysis at the interface between the two immiscible fluids is given in eq 1 according to schaffer et al 2013 the by product of the hydrolysis reaction depends on the interfacial area between the two fluids and the reaction time the kis tracer is non polar i e it is highly soluble in an organic fluid following the hydrolysis at the fluid fluid interface the reaction by products an acid and an alcohol dissolve in the water phase without back partitioning into the organic fluid schaffer et al 2013 as shown in fig 1 unlabelled image several assumptions are made to be able to interpret the experiment schaffer et al 2013 1 the hydrolysis reacted tracer instantaneously diffuses into the water phase because of the high aqueous diffusion coefficient 2 the reaction can be simplified to a zero order reaction kinetics 3 the adsorption process of the kis tracer onto the fluid fluid interface follows a langmuir isotherm a more detailed analysis of underlying physico chemical processes influencing diffusion adsorption reaction and mass transfer on the fluid fluid interface are presented by schaffer et al 2013 gao et al 2021 expressed the zero order hydrolysis reaction to calculate the fluid fluid interfacial area using the following equation 2 a wn m nw w r c nw w t reaction where r c nw w μg s 1 m 2 is the reaction rate at the fluid fluid interface per unit time m nw w μg is the mass of the hydrolyzed by product in the wetting phase and t reaction is the reaction time sec by dividing eq 2 with the bulk volume of porous media this volume is assumed to be larger than the representative element volume rev the specific capillary associated fluid fluid interfacial area can be expressed as 3 a wn c ss r c nw w t reaction where c ss g m 3 is the concentration of the 2 nsa at steady state the concept is explained in detail in section 2 2 a wn 1 m is the specific capillary associated interfacial area between the immiscible fluids inside an rev t reaction sec is the total reaction time i e time required to displace the bulk of water from the column since the reaction rate is at steady state conditions a function of time and magnitude of the interface between the two fluids the interface remains unaltered and therefore only the reaction time has to be recorded for the determination of the specific interfacial area the calculation of the reaction time is further discussed in section 2 3 2 2 steady state application in column experiments the concept of a simultaneous two phase co flow for steady state condition is based on the principle model where each phase fills its own fraction of the porous medium blunt 2017 which implies that the phases occupying the pore space at steady state form a static inter connected pathway network in this sense the non wetting phase occupies the larger pores while the wetting phase generally occupies the smaller pores and develops a wetting fluid film surrounding the grains as shown in fig 2a blunt 2017 experimental observations in both unconsolidated sand and micromodels showed that immiscible steady state two phase flow creates distinct and unchanged flow pathways temporally and spatially observations in micromodels showed that an increase in the saturation of one of the phases would lead to an increase in the number of channels pathways occupied by the same fluid and a decrease of the number the pathways of the other fluid blunt 2017 several authors pointed out that once steady state flow is achieved and the pathway established this pathway remains spatially and temporally stable and can be characterized by a stable interface chatenever and calhoun jr 1952 lenormand et al 1983 datta et al 2014 reynolds et al 2017 in our study we quantify the stable interfacial area by analyzing the reacted by product 2 nsa of the tracer at the outlet of the column eq 1 the 2 nsa is water soluble and uv detectable and therefore can be used to quantify the a wn as shown in fig 2c in a steady state two phase flow we consider both fluid phases as being mobile except for the existing film of wetting phase directly covering the grains richards 1931 based on fig 2b three distinct regions of fluids can be seen 1 the mobile wetting phase in the smaller pores cyan color 2 the mobile non wetting phase in the larger pores yellow color and 3 the immobile film area of the wetting phase covering the grains shown in dashed line in fig 2c we are interested in the identification of those areas where the reaction occurs i e those areas constitute the capillary associated fluid fluid interfacial area between the mobile wetting phase and mobile non wetting phase awn and the area between the immobile film area of wetting and the non wetting phase as shown in fig 2c the film area might not exist in case the porous media was first saturated with the non wetting phase i e primary imbibition with the saturation starting at s nw 100 as shown in fig 2d the proposed kis sst method is a reactive tracer method i e it relies on the detection of the reaction byproduct 2 nsa at the column outlet fig 2c shows two possible reaction areas capillary interface and film area but only one type of area is detectable by the reactive tracer because only the mobile water can transport the 2 nsa constituent to the outlet therefore the 2 nsa concentration does not measure the film area but the a wn this distinguishes the presented method from other methods such as the iptt where the measurement of the retardation of a surfactant at the interface experiences retardation at both types of interfaces for that reason iptt measures an effective or total fluid fluid interfacial area formed by fractions of both the capillary associated and the film area kibbey and chen 2012 while the kis tracer by product only sees the capillary interfaces 2 3 calculation of the reaction time roy et al 2020 introduced a derivation to calculate the seepage velocity of the phases for two phase flow we followed the derivation of the seepage velocity to further calculate the reaction time defined here as the time wetting and non wetting phases are in contact inside the column i e the travel time required for the wetting phase to travel from the inlet of the column to the outlet we consider the bulk volume of our column to be vb and the pore volume to be vp then the effective porosity can be defined as follows 4 φ v p v b 5 v b a l where a m2 is the cross sectional area of the column and l m is the length of the column with a uniformity coefficient of d60 d10 1 23 the glass beads used in the experiment as porous medium can assumed as homogeneous so that we can define an effective cross sectional area a e as follows 6 a e φ a a constant total flow rate is maintained throughout the experiment composed of two volumetric rates q w and q nw for the wetting and non wetting phase respectively they relate to each other as follows 7 q t q w q nw the column pore volume is composed by the wetting and non wetting phases and the saturation of each phase is the ratio of its volume related to the total pore volume 8 v p v w v nw 9 s w v w v p 10 s nw v nw v p dividing eq 8 by the length of the column we arrive at the equation 11 a e a w a nw a w and a n represent the cross sectional areas occupied by wetting and non wetting fluid respectively since glass beads can be considered as a uniform homogeneous medium an average of a w and a n at any cross section through the porous medium perpendicular to the flow direction will be similar roy et al 2020 therefore 12 a w s w a e then we can define the seepage velocity for the wetting phase which transports the dissolved reaction by product 2 nsa as 13 v w q w a w with the seepage velocity quantified the seepage time i e the reaction time can then be derived from eqs 6 12 and 13 and calculated as follows 14 t reaction φ a s w l q w the calculated reaction time is then used in eq 3 to calculate the a wn 2 4 fitting experimental data hassanizadeh and gray 1990 derived a thermodynamic mathematical model to account for the interfacial forces during two phase flow namely the interfaces between wetting and nonwetting fluids wetting fluid and solid and nonwetting fluid and solid in their work they proposed a constitutive relationship that relates capillary pressure saturation and specific interfacial area pc sw awn later joekar niasar et al 2008 showed that the constitutive relationship can be formulated as a second order polynomial 15 a wn s w p c a 00 a 10 s w a 01 p c a 11 s w p c a 20 s w 2 a 02 p c 2 to avoid non physical capillary pressure values joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2012 expressed the capillary associated interfacial area between two immiscible fluid phases by the following polynomial e g tatomir et al 2013 16 a wn s w p c a 0 s w a 1 1 s w a 2 p c max p c a 3 s w is the wetting saturation p c is the capillary pressure and a0 a1 a2 and a3 are the polynomial fitting parameters the brooks corey relationship can be used to calculate capillary pressure given in the following equation brooks et al 1964 17 p c p e s w s wr 1 s wr 1 λ where p e pa is the porous medium entry pressure s wr is the residual water saturation eq 3 was used to calculate a wn then the polynomial given in eq 16 was used to find the best fitting curve through the experimental data points the best fitting curve was selected by calculating the minimum root mean square error rmse using s wr a 0 a 1 a 2 a 3 as fitting parameters until the minimum root mean square error is achieved 3 materials and methods 3 1 materials well characterized glass beads are used as the column filling material for steady state two phase co flow experiments the glass beads have a mean diameter of ca 170 μm and the physical properties of the column fill are provided in table 1 a microscopic image of the grains and the grain size distributions obtained by digital image analysis and mercury intrusion porosimetry performed on the glass beads are shown in the supporting information similar material was used in our previous study tatomir et al 2020 two fluids are used for all experiments water as the wetting phase and n octane as the non wetting phase two peristaltic pumps are used one for water and one for n octane with a t junction connecting them at the inlet of the column the stainless steel column used for the experiments measures 30 cm in length and has a diameter of 3 cm the large size is intended to minimize the impact of capillary end effect that could be caused by the steady state two phase flow both ends of the column are sealed with tight stainless steel flanges using six screws each flange is equipped with a stainless steel porous disc to prevent the loss of glass beads and ensure an even distribution of fluids at the front of the column an even distribution of fluids helps to reduce the impact of intermittent flow caused by alternating wetting and non wetting fluids all other tubing connections junctions and valves are manufactured of peek material polyether ether ketone which has no known tendency for chemical reaction with the fluids employed for all experiments two immiscible fluids are used extra pure deionized water as the wetting phase and n octane thermo scientific acros cas 111 65 9 as the non wetting phase their properties are listed in table 2 all experiments are prepared with an initial kis tracer concentration higher than 1 g l i e with kis tracer concentrations of 1 g l 1 3 g l 1 7 g l and 2 g l respective kis concentration and reaction rate for all experiments can be found in appendix 2 the concentration of both the tracer and the by product were measured using a fluorescence spectrometer cary eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer 3 2 experimental procedure a schematic representation of the experimental setup is provided in fig 3 seven kis tracer tests are conducted for steady state simultaneous two phase co flow conditions i e the two fluids water and n octane are pumped simultaneously into the column to achieve the two phase flow an overview of the experiments performed is provided in table 3 more details of the collected data are provided in appendix 1 the column was filled for each experiment with dry clean glass beads followed by 30 min of co2 flushing to eliminate gas entrapment afterwards deionized water was flushed through the column for 24 h until a constant background intensity in the fluorescence spectrometer is reached to ensure that the filled glass beads are clean a constant total flow rate of 1 ml min was kept for each of the experiments and different fractional flows ratios of wetting injection rate total injection rate of the phases injected were used to modify the saturation two types of experiments were performed drainage increasing non wetting saturation and imbibition increasing wetting phase saturation depending on the fluid initially presented inside the column for drainage the column filled with glass beads was initially fully saturated with water while for imbibition it was fully saturated with n octane for both experiments drainage and imbibition water and n octane were utilized for saturation and recirculated for 24 h in a graduated cylinder of known volume the porosity was then measured gravimetrically by recording the volume of the remaining water in the graduated cylinder the packed and saturated column is used for the steady state experiments at different water n octane flow rate ratios both water and n octane are injected from the bottom of the column concurrently until a steady state condition is reached for drainage a simultaneous injection started with water n octane flow rate ratio of 9 1 i e 0 9 ml min water rate and 0 1 ml min n octane rate when steady state flow conditions are reached water samples are being collected periodically and their respective concentration is recorded then the flow rate ratio of water n octane is dropped again until a new steady state is reached in order to reduce the flow rate ratio the water rate is reduced and the n octane rate is increased while maintaining a total of 1 ml min fluid flux rate a total of six pore volumes are injected for a period of 8 h until steady state is achieved a steady state is achieved by considering two thresholds a change in saturation 2 and change in concentration of 0 5 μg l for the reaction by product 2 nsa the threshold used is similar to the one used in experiments reported by zhong et al 2016 in the supporting information fig si 1 we show the temporal evolution of the concentration and saturation reflecting the change from the transient period into the steady state for both concentration and saturation in a drainage condition for imbibition experiments similar procedure is used but the simultaneous injection begins with 0 8 ml min n octane and 0 2 ml min water the effluent of water and n octane is collected in a 100 ml graduated cylinder until steady state is reached afterwards the samples are collected more frequently in 10 ml cylinders the volumes of each fraction collected are recorded with an accuracy of 0 2 ml and the volume of fluids injected is also recorded with an accuracy of 0 2 ml the volume and collection time of each step is also recorded in order to determine the flow rate accuracy then the content of each cylinder water and n octane is separated and water is placed in a micro cuvette for measuring the 2 nsa concentration with the fluorescence spectrometer finally the 2 nsa concentration is measured by converting intensity units into concentration μg l using a pre calibrated curve 3 3 data analysis the saturations of both phases inside the column for every experimental step are calculated by a mass balance equation as shown below 18 s w s nw 1 since the pore volume is known and the volumes of produced and injected phases are recorded for each step and considering that the column is initially water saturated the non wetting phase saturation inside the column can be calculated as follows 19 s nw v nwi cum v nwp cum v p v nwi cum v nwp cum represent the cumulative injected subscript i non wetting phase and cumulative produced subscript p non wetting phase therefore the difference between these values represents the volume of the non wetting phase trapped inside the column for verification the s nw is compared to the non wetting phase saturation measured using the wetting phase volumes injected and produced with eq 20 20 s nw v wp cum v wi cum v p where v wp cum v wi cum represent the cumulative produced wetting phase and the cumulative injected wetting phase in eq 20 the difference between v wp cum and v wi cum gives the trapped non wetting phase the saturation values obtained using eqs 19 and 20 are identical with a relative error range of 0 5 appendix 1 provides a table of the deviation between the wetting phase saturation calculated by eqs 19 and 20 4 results 4 1 fractional flows of water n octane with dissolved kis tracer seven experiments in total were performed for steady state conditions five of them were performed for drainage conditions and two for imbibition conditions for drainage experiments 1 5 we start with a fully water saturated column with a water flow rate of 1 ml min then the co flow simultaneous injection was initiated by decreasing the water flow rate from 1 ml min periodically to 0 8 ml min 0 6 ml min 0 4 ml min and 0 1 ml min accompanied by an increase in n octane rate 0 2 ml min 0 4 ml min 0 6 ml min and 0 9 ml min to maintain a total flow rate of 1 ml min for imbibition experiments 6 7 the sequence of the experimental steps is as follows the experiments started with a column fully saturated with n octane non wetting phase and then the fractional flow is changed periodically the change in fractional flow induces a change in saturation such that a water saturation range of 0 3 0 8 is being created a linear relationship can be observed between water saturation and fractional flow for all experiments drainage and imbibition performed on glass beads as shown in the best fitted regression line of fig 4 the imbibition experiments appear to show a steeper saturation fractional flow relationship and therefore lower saturation can be achieved these findings are similar to the data previously reported by zhong et al 2016 for both glass beads and sand in their study zhong et al 2016 showed that similar trends are obtained for glass beads d50 1 16 mm and sand d50 0 35 a small deviation of the data from the fitted line is observed and can be related to two main factors 1 changes caused by the packing process as the column is repacked for each experiment resulting in new configurations of the porous medium each time 2 alternatively such small deviations can be caused by the inherent pulsation of the pumps however none of these issues impacted the general slope of the curve nor the saturation reported in appendix 2 furthermore a relation between fractional flow and relative permeability is established and provided in the supporting information based on na et al 2011 study resulting in a rmse of 0 002 due to the pump s pressure fluctuations hoffmeier et al 2014 it was not possible to maintain a stable and constant 1 ml min flowrate during the experiments therefore ranges of flow rates between 0 94 ml min and 1 2 ml min are recorded in appendix 2 4 2 capillary associated interfacial area vs water saturation the calculated specific capillary associated interfacial area using eq 3 from the seven experiments showed good repeatability that is evident in the small deviation of saturation and concentration reported in appendix 2 for a global flow rate of 1 ml min in all experiments the water saturation showed a deviation of a maximum 1 between the samples collected at the same step similarly the concentration measured each step had a deviation of 0 45 μg l furthermore no significant differences are observed between the vertical and horizontal column orientation the experiments were conducted using a reaction rate rc 0 006 0 008 0 009 and 0 012 μg m 2 s 1 corresponding to kis concentration of 1 1 3 1 7 and 2 g l 1 respectively the concentration at steady state css was measured between 2 μg l to 20 μg l across all experiments reported in appendix 2 a wn as a function of water saturation a wn s w obtained using the kis sst tracer are presented in fig 5 the areas calculated from drainage experiments experiments 1 5 for 0 55 s w 0 8 show a continuous increase in area because water is being drained until a water saturation of s w 0 55 is achieved followed by a slight dip in area for 0 4 s w 0 55 moreover the imbibition experiments experiments 6 and 7 provided measurements at the saturation range of 0 3 s w 0 4 the areas measured from imbibition experiments showed a continuous drop for 0 3 s w 0 4 these results are consistent with earlier findings for capillary associated air water interfacial area using cmt method performed by culligan et al 2004 2005 and brusseau et al 2007 or decane water interfacial area in micromodels presented by cheng et al 2004 this is also consistent with prior numerical measurement of a wn employing the thermodynamic model shown by grant and gerhard 2007 and the constitutive relationship between p c s w ifa interfacial area provided by porter et al 2010 our findings showed that the peak of the a wn occurs at wetting saturation of s w 0 55 this finding is consistent with the experimental findings using x ray cmt measurement of brusseau et al 2006 2007 where their data showed highest a wn for a saturation range of 0 4 s w 0 5 nonetheless prior findings by culligan et al 2004 2005 using cmt showed the highest a wn to be in the wetting saturation range of 0 2 s w 0 35 furthermore the results obtained using pore network models performed by reeves and celia 1996 and dalla et al 2002 showed a peak in a wn in the range of 0 2 s w 0 3 the best fitted curves for the measured a wn using the polynomial of eq 16 are shown in fig 5 best fit was achieved by adjusting the following parameters s wr a 0 a 1 a 2 a 3 and calculating the least mean square error rmse a rmse of 0 165 and 0 07 was found for the envelope fitting curves respectively appendix 3 provides the parameters used for both curves and their respective rmse where data from experiments 2 and 5 were used as fitting data for the minimum and maximum curves respectively best fit was achieved for water saturations of s w 0 55 and s w 0 4 for minimum and maximum enveloping curves respectively these findings and the shapes of those curves are consistent with pore network model results provided by joekar niasar et al 2008 4 3 interfacial area measured by kis sst compared to x ray cmt fluid fluid interfacial area determined using x ray computed micro tomography cmt from previous studies are shown in fig 6 fig 6a shows a comparison between our findings and the results of culligan et al 2004 in which cmt was implemented on soda lime glass bead porous material average diameter 0 86 mm a wn measured using kis tracer shows a similarly shaped curve to that of the cmt where the a wn starts to increase with decreasing wetting saturation until a maximum value is reached followed by a drop when the wetting saturation approaches s w 0 the main difference between the mentioned method and our new approach is that our approach shows the maximum interfacial area at 0 4 s w 0 5 rather than 0 25 s w 0 35 as reported by culligan et al 2004 in fig 6b our results are compared with those of a cmt experiment presented by brusseau et al 2006 2007 where vinton soil average grain diameter of 0 234 mm was used to measure both capillary and total interfacial area in an air water system the results presented by brusseau et al 2006 2007 showed that the maximum a wn falls in a range of 0 4 s w 0 5 similar to the results obtained by our kis tracer method the total interfacial area on the other hand presented by both culligan et al 2004 and brusseau et al 2006 2007 shows a linear shaped curve shown in fig 6 meaning that the interfacial area increases with decreasing wetting saturation until the intersection with the interfacial area axis the point of intersection of the linear curve with the interfacial area axis at s w 0 is close to the total surface area of the grain interpreted as a combination of the film area surrounding the grains and the a wn saripalli et al 1997 brusseau et al 2006 2007 4 4 analysis of drainage and imbibition using kis sst and a comparison to kis tt in fig 7a we present the averaged values of primary drainage and primary imbibition experiments using kis sst along with their respective error ranges and best fitted curves we also include the pi and pd experiments carried out by culligan et al 2005 using cmt while culligan et al 2005 identified slightly higher interfacial areas during the drainage process than during the imbibition process in an air water system it was more difficult to observe these differences in an oil water system our results as shown in fig 7a indicate a similar behavior where the pd and pi experiments fall within the same range between the maximum and minimum values these findings demonstrate the challenges of measuring the differences in capillary associated interfacial area between pi and pd additionally to better understand the impact of film area we conducted pi experiments with zero wetting phase saturation this means that the column was initially filled 100 with non wetting phase jain et al 2003 also conducted a similar study on modified oil wet glass beads and found that the measured interfacial area exhibits anomalous behavior during the drainage of decane the wetting phase being decane this is attributed to the absence of wetting phase film area jain et al 2003 suggests that the tracer did not see the decane film or that the film area has been washed out on the other hand our study found that both pi and pd fall within the same range even in the absence of film area suggesting that the tracer is unaffected by the film surrounding the glass beads fig 7a fig 7b shows a comparison between the results of kis tt performed by tatomir et al 2020 and the kis sst presented in this study both using the same glass beads the measurement using kis tt method shows a lower mobile capillary interfacial area for both maximum and minimum curves this was expected given that the capillary interface measured with kis tt are related the front measured during dynamic conditions on the other hand kis sst measures the total capillary interface mobile immobile gao et al 2021 a summary of these comparisons is provided separately in appendix 4 allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the comparison between these two methods 5 discussion tracer methods such as iptt cannot distinguish between different types of measured interfacial areas because of the inability to recognize which type of interface the tracer has access to i e the tracer has access to both a wn and film area the presented kis sst unlike other tracer methods measures the a wn and not the total or effective interfacial area the lack of impact from the film area on the kis tracer technique is attributed to 1 the by product of the reaction at the film interface is not carried out of the column and cannot be detected although the hydrolysis reaction does occur between tracer and the film area the reaction by product remains trapped inside the immobile film 2 even though the film area has a large interface with the non wetting phase the diffusion of 2 nsa from the film area into the mobile bulk water is very small due to its small contact area few nanometers between bulk water and the film area fig 2 one possible discrepancy between the presented method and the interfacial area measurements reported in literature can be explained by the impact of the hysteresis of the drainage imbibition cycles it has been reported that the hysteresis of the drainage imbibition cycles affects the values of a wn this impact has been shown both in pore scale modeling studies and cmt experiments zhong et al 2016 culligan et al 2004 and porter et al 2010 employed the cmt method and found that the measured a wn values for glass beads were lower for imbibition cycles compared to those for drainage conditions i e the capillary interface configuration between the wetting nonwetting phases is different for imbibition and drainage conditions such behavior is not observed in our experiments the measured a wn for both imbibition and drainage had no significant differences fig 5 because the drainage and imbibition experiments are performed separately unlike drainage imbibition hysteresis cycles reported in literature here the drainage experiments are performed in a glass bead filled column with 100 water saturation similarly the imbibition experiments are performed in a glass bead filled column but 100 n octane saturated therefore the configuration of the capillary interface did not undergo any changes expected in a hysteresis cycle another potential issue is the distribution of the fluids attained with the proposed kis sst method applied in co flow conditions which may be different than the distributions obtained with other methods for instance the standard iptt approaches rely on creating a residual saturation of either the non wetting or the wetting phase with the tracers being introduced in the single phase flow therefore in the kis sst method questions arise on how does the interface configuration look like and how stable are these when both phases flow concurrently inside the column would there be a flow discontinuity that would limit the distribution of the phases such an issue was investigated by culligan et al 2005 who used x ray cmt high resolution 3d images to characterize a simultaneous two phase flow they did not observe any fluid discontinuity for an oil water system they also showed that fluid distribution and interfacial area remained unchanged indicating that the distribution of fluids inside the column is consistent with those realized with standard methods gravitational instabilities were reported by jain et al 2003 caused by the difference in densities between water and decane with the injection from the bottom of the column such instabilities can lead to a higher water saturation at the same level of fractional flow jain et al 2003 in order to tackle this issue we performed all the experiments with the column in vertical orientation except for a single experiment experiment 3 with the column oriented horizontally to check for differences in fractional flow and saturation relation no noticeable differences were observed among the injection schemes so that we can exclude instability problems during the experiment 6 summary and conclusions in this study a novel method to measure the capillary associated interfacial area in steady state two phase co flow conditions using the kinetic interface sensitive tracer is developed and presented to demonstrate the method s viability over a wide range of wetting saturations a series of column two phase flow experiments are conducted the kis sst method relies on measuring the acid by product of the hydrolysis reaction at the fluid fluid interface as a quantitative proxy for the capillary associated interfacial area when the fluids are in steady state condition the results obtained by the kis sst method showed that the a wn s w relationships have a similar profile to the ones obtained by the cmt method as shown in fig 6 i e a wn increases as the s w decreases until reaching a maximum and then the interfacial area starts decreasing for saturations below s w 0 55 this despite that the a wn values obtained using kis sst cannot be directly compared to the other methods reported in the literature as the measured a wn is influenced by many factors besides the measurement method such as grain size distribution pore space geometry texture grain surface roughness the fluids applied wettability and chemical composition besides we demonstrated the reliability of the method by performing multiple experiments under different flow conditions primary imbibition and primary drainage and different flow directions column vertically and horizontally positioned the results obtained from those conditions showed similar trends and the values obtained were in the same range furthermore the a wn s w relationship determined with the kis sst method is fitted using a polynomial model previously used in several studies e g joekar niasar et al 2008 tatomir et al 2018 the polynomial model is fitted to the experimental data by finding the minimum rmse which was found to be 0 16 and 0 07 kis sst method can be used in conjunction with the kis tt applied in dynamic conditions tatomir et al 2018 which measures the mobile part of the a wn this allows one to develop a good understanding of the mobile and non mobile size of ifa an advantage of the kis sst method over drainage kis tt is that there is no limitation in the number of measurements because the method allows for continuous sampling for each flow fraction at the outlet of the column continuous sampling will reduce errors that might be caused by impurities in the sampling vial by eliminating outliers by simply collecting more samples further investigations are being carried out to create a wider range of experimental data and improve the efficiency of the experimental setup one prospect is to apply the steady state co flow kis tracer method to other types of porous materials e g different sands or even core samples and to observe the impact of grain structure and material heterogeneity another application of the kis tracer in two phase co flow is to investigate the variation of a wn as a function of saturation change in the column da wn ds w a critical information for modeling and simulating multi phase flow in porous media in practice the kis sst could be used as a complementary method for the standard iptt methods credit authorship contribution statement h abdullah conceptualization methodology investigation validation

water colour and chemical oxygen demand cod chen et al 2011 various materials such as textiles plastics leather food and cosmetics are using different azo dyes khandare et al 2011 dyes have a carcinogenic toxic mutagenic effect hussain et al 2018 hussein and scholz 2017 also reduce aesthetic values and are hazardous to health and aquatic life hussain et al 2018 various technologies are applied to handle these bio recalcitrant compounds such as coagulation fluctuation and advanced oxidation process hussein and scholz 2017 adsorption and ozone treatment tee et al 2015 besides high efficiencies these processes have disadvantages like higher cost the complex process may cause the formation of byproducts hussein and scholz 2017 production of a large amount of sludge tee et al 2015 therefore selecting alternative processes and techniques with operation easiness less cost and less maintenance requirement is essential wu et al 2015 the combination of green nano biochar composites

between the substrate and pollutants is usually described by internal and external diffusion as well as adsorption and pollutants are eliminated from the water the pollutants organic or inorganic adsorbed by the substrate are further undergone decomposition by the microorganisms and plant absorption and then removed by the substrate wang et al 2020a the different operating conditions that effects cw performance were assessed on basis of percentage removal the percent removal was calculated as follows 1 removal efficiency c in c out c in 100 where cout and cin outflow and inflow

coefficient r was utilized and significant correlations were accepted at a 95 confidence level 3 result and discussions 3 1 ftir analysis the ftir scrutinizes the functional groups on the adsorbent surfaces as well as their engrossment in the dye molecules adsorption and hence composites stability can be evaluated by the deviations in the absorbance intensities khan et al 2019 the ftir spectra of biochar zno bc mgo bc mno2 bc and cuo bc showed that the intensity of peak at 3300 3500 cm 1 from the stretching vibration of the hydroxyl groups oh in hemicellulose or cellulose decreased which proposed the hemicellulose decomposition or oh removal which is already proved in many studies chen et al 2019 khan et al 2019 the presence of the symmetric stretching of ch3 and ch2 at vibration 2920 2930 cm 1 bands and 1600 cm 1 as aromatic co ring stretching causes basicity alkalinity of biochar which could be accountable for ph increase fig 5 the zno bc ftir spectrum illustrated a band of zno absorption was observed in the range of 494 500 cm 1 the data is analogous to the outcomes attained from other research as shown by wang et al 2020b the rest of the peaks have been found similar to native biochar the ftir spectra of mgo bc fig 5 b the bands at 617 and 703 cm 1 are due to the mgo stretching vibrations and results were also related to other data noreen et al 2020b shen et al 2019 the cuo bc ftir spectrum illustrated a band of cuo vibration was observed at the range of 611 and 497 cm 1 li et al 2020 the mno2 bc ftir spectrum illustrated a band of mno vibration was observed at the range of 518 cm 1 feng et al 2021 after loading of mno2 the absorption bands of c o c c as well as ch weakened sequentially furthermore proving the bc aromaticity weakening meanwhile mno peaks gradually enhanced after dye interaction with bands adsorption intensity decreased due to the interaction with these anions dye functional groups in all these nanoparticles the band intensity decrease shifting the appearance of the bands in the loaded adsorbent and designating the adsorption of dyes on the adsorbent there was a prominent change in the oh peaks in both dyes after loading with dye fig 5a 3 2 sem analysis the bare bc sem image fig 5a e without any nanoparticles loading displayed a plate resembling morphology with wrinkled plates which were amalgamated together to provide an improved adsorption surface for adsorption of organic contaminants such as dyes the morphology of prepared zno bc has diverse shapes like spherical and hexagonal and it might be attributed due to the metal reducing capacity of the leaves extract effect the biochar porous nature provided more chances for loading spaces for zno nps although some of the pores of biochar were occupied by the zno nps the sample still exhibited porous nature with a relatively larger pore volume already reported by other researchers kamaraj et al 2020 layer homogeneous sheeted mgo bc were detected in sem analysis fig 5a b which was the surface morphology for the corncob biochars at relatively higher temperatures the macro porous structure was distributed on the sheets which was similarly observed on the corncob biochars formed at 550 c after mgo coating it was detected that cubic and hexagonal mgo were well coated on the biochar surface related to other works shen et al 2019 there was variation in pore space between cuo bc and bc due to the impregnation with the metallic nanoparticles there was more aggregation of the cuo nanoparticles that led to more micro porous openings in the cuo bc which caused improvement in the adsorption potential of cuo bc in comparison with the bc matched results with other researcher imran et al 2021 the surface was covered with nano mno2 which formed numerous porous structures the mno2 nano spheres were grown on the biochar that greatly increase the surface area zhou et al 2017 it increased the surface area and active site of nano adsorbent which increased contaminants adsorption efficiency fig 5a the results showed the changes in the surface and structural characteristics of the green nanoparticles samples before and after the treatment of dyes fig 5b 3 3 charge on nano adsorbent the point of zero charges phpzc is a noteworthy factor for the identification of the binding active site nature on nano adsorbent the ph value of the adsorbent which becomes neutral is recognized as a point of zero charges that elucidates the adsorbent electro kinetic nature the ph affects the charge of the surface due to the presence of positive h and negative oh ions the surface charge is considered by the point of zero charges pzc which is helpful for mechanism determination for nano adsorbents of the cationic character ph phpzc while for anionic character ph phpzc the nano adsorbent is desirable that boosts the anion adsorption noreen et al 2020a the phpzc of d cuo bc b mgo bc c zno bc a mno2 bc n bc was observed to be 8 8 8 7 8 7 8 6 and 8 5 respectively fig 6 shows the phpzc of nanocomposites so the ph below the phpzc gives a positive charge on the nano adsorbent surface which is favorable for the removal of anionic dyes contaminates due to the electrostatic forces between the opposite charges zheng et al 2020 so the d nanocomposite has a higher positive charge because of the presence of a higher phpzc value that gives a clear indication for the higher attraction for reactive golden yellow merl yellow 145 dye and so on 3 4 substratum profile this study was accomplished for the determination of the reactive golden yellow merl yellow 145 dye adsorption by using cws comprised of cornstalk biochar system or its biochar nanocomposites as a substratum that was analyzed after the dye application 3 5 ph effect the ph is a significant parameter in the uptake of nutrients from aqueous solutions as it depends upon the adsorbent surface charge degree of ionization and adsorbate speciation in the aqueous media a general experiment for the effect of ph on constructed wetland was observed by ranging the ph from 2 4 6 8 10 and 12 the final ph was ranged in all ph was 6 0 7 9 after the 24 h shown in the graph which is drawn between the final ph and initial ph fig 7a shows the effect of different ph on the constructed wetland with the different substrates which is effective for both plants and microorganisms while the control without our substrate was less effective for other systems but still maintain in the range 5 8 5 due to plant and the microorganisms the enhancement in ph in cws can be elucidated by high phpzc in a b c d and n and biochar s highly alkaline nature and its composites as it contributed due to ash content that is already shown in graphs moreover the ph variation can also be attributed by elevation in concentrations of the hydroxyls carbonates ammonia bicarbonates and other ions by bio digestion of the organic matter om gupta et al 2016 for the determination of the ph effect with time on wetland at 100 mg l of dye concentration we take the effluent of ph 7 5 with hrt of 10 week effluent ph was checked each week at the fixed time 8 00 am there was a minor increase or decrease in ph the initial dye ph was 7 5 after passing the dye based wastewater from cws beds ph enhanced up to 6 weak slightly then decreased respectively the observed ph among all the cws was within the recommended range 6 0 ph 8 5 which is essential for the existence of many treatment microorganisms fig 7b shows the effect of hrt on ph at a fixed concentration of dye a modest ph 4 ph 12 is effective for the cws stability an extreme value of ph affects plant growth and microbial community diversity li et al 2018 the ph was found statistically significant f 153 4 p 0 05 between all wetland systems which might be attributed to different phpzc the alkaline biochar displayed astonishingly higher acidity neutralizing capability than the control biochar with a strong positive ion exchange capability for the h and a higher content of the ash components comprising positive ions that can generate dissolved alkalinity chen et al 2021 mosley et al 2015 this advantage makes biochar and biochar based nanocomposites an attractive adsorbent that can lower the acidity and effectively adsorb dye 3 6 total suspended solids tss the treatment system consists of lemongrass and biochar as well as its composites which has removed a higher percentage of tss as compared to the control wetland with the only plant a total of about 95 of tss was eliminated by the biochar planted system after the 10th week of exposure compared to the only planted system control which achieved 80 33 of tss removal after the 10th week of exposure this outcome proved that biochar itself can help with the reduction of suspended solids ts in effluent through the different substrates by the filtration process but that the presence of lemongrass speeds up tss removal with the help of its root system tss removal

medium based on biochar and biochar nanocomposites furthermore when it came to tss elimination the biochar nanocomposite based cws performed considerably better than the biochar based cws with low porosity gravel media and a physical filtering process suspended particles may be filtered and contained in the cws allowing for improved solids removal karathanasis et al 2003 the plant roots act as a physical filter and provide the appropriate organic matter that acts as a bio sorbent and contributed to particulate matter removal nawaz et al 2020 the matrix of cws based biochar and its nanocomposites settled with time passage about 50 to 78 decrease in the tss was observed in the effluent that was collected by the cws planted with phragmites australis and typha latifolia aided with soil microbes saba et al 2015 flow conditions reduced turbulence in the open water layer between the sediment and roots suspended particles may be successfully eliminated from the water column by

bicarbonate carbonate phosphate sulfate nitrate magnesium calcium natural particles sodium and different particles a precise dissolve particle level in the water is significant for the life of amphibians tds has been analyzed using the tds meter the initial concentration of dye was 100 mg l and effluent tds was 900 mg l during the initial stage wetland effluents indicated low removal efficiency the wetland with biochar and its composites indicated a higher reduction than the wetland control without biochar later cws gave a higher performance than the start but still the wetland with biochar showed a higher reduction percentage it gives a maximum of 64 tds removal efficiency with d while others gave lower results compared to it tds by in order of cuo bc 64 44 mgo bc 60 00 zno

without biochar systems revealed significant differences f 19 49 p 0 05 in comparison between the wetlands based on biochar and its nano composites biochar nanocomposites based wetland perform significantly as compared to wetlands based on biochar this increase might be because tds in the dye effluent is in the ionic state there was an increase in the tds of effluents as a comparison to influents in the case of control native bc and a which might be due to synthetic dyes presence while in d b and c it decreases might be due to higher positive character the increase in the tds value can be explained by the fact that when dye passed through cws media they are highly ionized saba et al 2015 with time the removal efficiency increases due to the higher hrt and provided higher time for contact with the substrate in the tenth week their removal efficiency increases to its maximum point one of the key absorption methods by plants in cws is nutrient removal which facilitates tds removal by absorbing nutrients in the influents tds removal in cw is greater owing to the presence of plants i e plant roots having the potential to function as filters when they develop enabling reduction of dissolved solids combined with plant nutrition intake tds removal efficiency decrease significantly as the trial run progresses this is most likely due to tds which can block soil pores and it is also possible that this is related to a clogging problem caused by the continued use of wetland systems das et al 2019 3 8 conductivity ec the conductivity ec is typically known as an ion carrying species indicator and that corresponds to ec values that may be applied as an indicator for water quality challenges any sudden enhancement in the ec values indicates that there is a dissolved ions source in the wetland based filter hussein and scholz 2018 there was a slight increase in the ec but in the 10th week there was a decrease in the value indicating the higher removal efficiency with the higher hrt but overall results obtained have shown low removal efficiency the ec decrease in the end might be associated with nutrient uptake by plants and the physicochemical and biological binding of dye molecules to the roots as well as soil particles nawaz et al 2020 ec in order of cuo bc 68 mgo bc 60 zno bc 44 mno2 bc 32 bc 20 control 8 with maximum hrt at 10th weeks fig 8

wetland show significant differences with other wetlands slightly f 3 811 p 0 05 the lack of any effect of biochar at the start on the conductivity is not a surprising fact since the high ec of the dye wastewaters might mask it the condition occurred in another case where vf mesocosms encumbered with both scw and septage approving that the biochar addition did not significantly affect outflow conductivity de rozari et al 2015 3 9 colour removal azo dyes structures are complex and nitrogen and carbon contents are not biologically readily available for microorganisms hence for dyes biodegradation supplemental nitrogen and carbon are a requirement colour is the main challenging factor regarding textile effluent based wastewater a significant reduction in colour was also detected in the biochar and its nanocomposites based cws the colour removal efficiency was increased with increasing hrt 56 to 95 5 colour removal efficiency was observed in different wetlands with hrt of 12 60 days with the highest colour removal noted in the biochar system assisted with cuo bc colour removal efficiency in order of cuo bc 95 52 mgo bc 92 88 zno bc 88 08 mno2 bc 84 08 bc 77 92 control 56 4 at the maximum hrt of 60 days for 2 months after 48 days there was a significant increase in removal efficiency but there was a significant increase in the longer hrt up to 48 days fig 8 i shows the effect of hrt on the removal efficiency of dye at a fixed concentration of dye the longer the hrt higher will be the colour removal efficiency can be explained by more aerobic conditions that give a higher rate of removal of pollutants and higher hrt gives higher time for maximum performance the biochar and its nanocomposite adsorption capacity depends on the surface activities because the specific surface area is available for the interaction between the solute and the surface that is required for the solute saba et al 2015 water depth and hrt are the two main factors that controlled the cws performance the results designated that all cws effectively lowered anionic dye the biochar based wetlands performed statistically significantly f 18 44 p 0 05 better compared to the control cws without biochar for the removal of dye from wastewater in comparison the wetlands based on biochar nano composites did not perform significantly statistically only wetland d and wetland b performed significantly p 0 05 as compared to other wetlands the extremely porous biochar has a large surface area which provides anoxic conditions for the production of microbial biofilms and might be one of the causes of the significant decreases in the wetland with biochar as compared to the control wetland cayuela et al 2013 important features of biochar included larger porosity numerous holes of varying sizes hydrophobicity and organic leaching may make it more appropriate for microbial contamination removal than sand or gravel batch experiments have shown that biochar is an effective adsorbent for the pollutant in solutions particularly through the elimination pathways of electrostatic attraction complexation ion ligand exchange p binding interactions and precipitation

release and oxygen to oxygenate the media and creation of aerated microaerobic based degradation zones within the bed davies et al 2005 biochar substrates promoted the development of functional microorganisms and performed as efficient biofilm transporters hence indirectly promoting organic pollutant breakdown lu and chen 2018 this was due mostly to biochar enabling adsorption and biodegradation mahmood et al 2015 3 10 dissolve oxygen do organics can be eradicated by adsorption chemical oxidation reduction hydrolysis filtering microbial degradation and other methods from

weeks fig 8 j shows the effect of hrt on do at a fixed concentration of dye this type of increment is also observed before this type of significant increase in the do might be because of the oxygen released by roots in the root zone area because the roots of a plant play a significant part in the soil matrix de aggregation which results in the more aeration sehar et al 2015 the comparison of wetlands with and without biochar systems revealed significant differences f 9 650 p 0 05 in comparison between the wetlands based on biochar and its nano composites wetlands based on biochar nano composites performed significantly as compared to biochar based wetland n more precisely the do amount was low during the initial sampling 3 3 mg l at 0 h however vfcws treatment improved do content in all wetlands in other research same results were obtained vegetation enhanced the do up to 5 87 mg l whereas biochar augmentation enhanced it more up to 7 31 mg l the do increase might be attributed due to cws nature which provides enough contact time and aeration for organic matter om reduction hussain et al 2018 the do diversities not only affected microbial activity community structure but also signified roles in respiration and photosynthesis liu et al 2016 3 11 chemical oxygen demand cod this research was performed for the determination of degradation adsorption of reactive golden yellow merl yellow 145 dye based wastewater by using cws comprising biochar and its nanocomposites as substratum the cod of the influents was 756 mg l which was significantly reduced to lower ranges in the case of biochar as well as its nanocomposites a noteworthy cod reduction was observed in the cws systems with the time passage the control system without biochar showed less cod removal 75 this can be explained by the low substrate conversion ayyappan et al 2018 the systems that consisted of biological based treatments like cws contact time hrt is a significant operational parameter because of the lower hrt higher organic loading which resulting in the reduction of the reactor volume that is required for an anticipated performance another fact is higher hrt usually produced better outcomes as it provides enough contact time for the reaction yadav et al 2012 cod removal efficiency in order of cuo bc 93 25 mgo bc 90 07 zno bc 88 22 mno2 bc 83 73 bc 80 82 control 75 at the maximum hrt fig 8 k l shows the effect of hrt on removal efficiency cod at a fixed concentration of dye aerobic micro locations in rhizomes and roots could be attributed to cod removal because aerobic micro locations are existing in the rhizomes and roots vicinity which has the highest adsorption capacity attained with the activated carbon 37 88 mg 1g followed by the composite media 22 99 mg 1g and zeolite 2 35 mg 1 g saba et al 2015 these results designated that hrt was a critical factor of the cod removal in the cws because an elongated hrt safeguarded the stable elimination of the organic matter through the physical and chemical absorption and subsequent microbial degradation sato et al 2011 biochar was shown to have an essential role in cod reduction via adsorption due to its extremely porous structure which allowed additional sites for microbial growth huang et al 2013 biochar has the potential to minimize the water soluble percentage of contaminants while also storing organic substances in the pores of the carbon the immobilization of the bioavailable portion of organic pollutants can be attributed to the reduction in dye content of the substrate treated with biochar because of its hydrophobic nature and micropores biochar has the potential to absorb and retain pollutants cao et al 2021 the results designated that all cws effectively lowered organic matter the biochar based wetlands performed statistically significantly f 20 72 p 0 05 better compared to the control cws without biochar for removal of the parameters cod in comparison the wetlands based on green metal oxides coated biochar nano composites performed statistically significantly p 0 05 better compared to simple biochar based wetland but significant differences were not detected between green metal oxides coated biochar nanocomposites based wetlands statistically some of the hypothesized combination methods for the elimination of cod include interactions between molecules and biochar through bonds direct molecular biochar electrostatic attraction repulsion and intermolecular hydrogen bonding in addition to adsorption other mechanisms that reduce cod include precipitation oxidation and anaerobic digestion gupta et al 2016 4 removal kinetics the rate of reaction of a constituent in a reactor that is its transformation is studied in reaction kinetics production or consumption the reaction rate in the first order reaction is directly proportional to the reagent concentration the reaction rate of the second order reaction is proportional to the square of the reagent concentration the reaction rate in zero order reactions is independent of the reagent concentration the rate of change of the reagent concentration c is constant under these conditions this comment assumes that the reaction takes place in a batch reactor with no reagent addition or withdrawal during the reaction period in the case of a vanishing reagent in the reactor for example through decomposition mechanisms a minus sign in the term on the right hand side of the equation indicates constituent removal whereas a plus sign indicates constituent production in a zero order reaction the coefficient k represents the concentration that was removed or converted per unit of time von sperling et al 2020 first order reactions occur when the rate of the reaction is proportional to the concentration of the reagent as a result the rate of change of the reagent concentration c in a batch reactor is proportional to the reagent concentration at a given time when we have a high concentration we have a high value of removed concentration for a given time period but the concentration does not affect the removal efficiency throughout this period von sperling et al 2020 it was used to forecast pollution concentrations at varying reaction times the data were subjected to kinetics models eqs 2 4 in zero order the graph was plotted between c in c out and t the slope represents the k0 rate constant in the first order the graph was plotted between ln c out c in and t the slope represents the k1 rate constant for the first order while for second order the graph was plotted between 1 c out and t the slope represents the k2 rate constant for the second order the obtained results are shown in the table the value of k0 k1 and k2 are shown in the table their value reveals the removal of reactive golden yellow merl yellow 145 by using cuo bc d mgo bc b zno bc c mno2 bc a bc n and control 4 1 colour removal kinetic for colour removal kinetics indicated that it followed the second order kinetic because of the higher value of r2 that was present as cuo bc 0 9806 mgo bc 0 9734 zno bc 0 9549 mno2 bc 0 9607 bc 0 9764 control 0 9719 that are shown in table 2a fig 9 shows the trend of the different kinetic models of colour moreover the plot of observed cobs and estimated cest concentrations confirmed that the value of second order observed cobs and estimated cest concentrations were closed as compared to zero and first order s2 the kinetic analysis of three azo dyes was accomplished in other studies the regression coefficient and rate constant values corresponded to the decolorization of azo dye the ar18 cr and ao7 decolorizations were pseudo second order kinetic models with a higher correlation coefficient r2 0 9 oon et al 2020 the study of reactive black 5 diazo dye and co substrate degradation was demonstrated in the sequential batched reactor that also fitted to the second order kinetic model ong et al 2012 the second order reaction kinetics model was more sensitive to the reactant reactant connection this might be related to the complicated character of the wastewater and the formation of numerous compounds throughout the degradation process each chemical has a distinct link although it is not primarily a linear relationship wang et al 2019 the response rates derived from the second order reaction were also compared for the various cws the higher response rate suggests that cw took longer to remove colour than other cws the reaction rate figures suggest that colour was eliminated faster if the wastewater was treated with a lower reaction rate which might translate to a lower operational cost moersidik et al 2020 4 2 cod removal kinetic cod removal kinetics indicated that it followed the first order kinetic because of the higher value of r2 that was present as cuo bc 0 996 mgo bc 0 9746 zno bc 0 942 mno2 bc 0 9121 bc 0 8843 control 0 8887 that are shown in table 2b moreover the plot of observed cobs and estimated cest concentrations confirmed that the value of first order observed cobs and estimated cest concentrations were closed as compared to zero and second order s3 in other literature the r2 value for cod was 0 9800 for the first order thus the kinetic studies indicated that the reduction of cod in the textile effluent followed the first order kinetic model sivakumar et al 2014 fig 9 shows the trend of the different kinetic models of cod the first order decay model is based on the assumption that cod elimination rates are linearly proportional to cod concentration assuming that removal effectiveness does not change concerning cod load removal rates rise linearly with cod concentration the model also assumes that the substrate concentration is significantly less than the half saturation constant ks the concentration supporting 50 of the maximum rate of uptake that the system is well mixed that there are no significant influences from water losses or gains and that the system is dependent on only one reactant messer et al 2017 higher coefficient of correlation 0 9 values for the observed and anticipated models of the efficiency loss models resulted in better statistical results however the reduced removal effectiveness of the cws might be attributed to fewer plants contributing to pollution removal the porous activated carbon with the highest surface area and the do consumption produced an anoxic environment for the formation of microbial biofilms which might explain the considerable reduction in pollutant levels in the cws kumar and singh 2021 5 correlation between water quality parameters within cws the reciprocal association between two variables is referred to as correlation a direct connection arises when an upsurge or decline in the value of one parameter corresponds to an upsurge or decline in the other value the correlation is considered to be positive when a rise in one parameter produces an upsurge in the other and negative when an increase in one parameter produces a reduction in the other the correlation coefficient r ranges from 1 to 1 the correlation between the parameters is classified as strong when it is between 0 8 and 1 0 moderate when it is between 0 5 and 0 8 and weak when it is between 0 0 and 0 5 it is frequently used to develop relationships between various water parameters that can determine the probable source of solutes and the mechanisms involved in controlling water s hydrochemistry varol and davraz 2015 a correlation r value of one or close to one indicates a significant positive link whereas r values close to 0 indicate no relationship rehman et al 2018 the correlation matrix for water quality physicochemical characteristics was established table 3 the colour and cod were strongly positively correlated with total dissolved solids electrical conductivity and total suspended solids while strongly negative relation with dissolved oxygen do was a strong strong negative relation with all parameters but weakly with ph negatively connection with do since organic matter is partially oxidized by do whereas nutrients promote eutrophication of water resulting in a rise in organic matter which leads to an increase in oxygen demand tds and ec strongly positively correlated with total suspended solid and with each other ph was weakly correlated with all the other parameters tds and negative ions are examples of inorganic materials that naturally correspond with ec the high association between ec and tds suggests that ec is responsible for salt dissolution and the inorganic pollution load in water singh et al 2020 the rest of the correlations are provided in supplementary data form table s1 6 possible mechanism of constructed wetland biochar might directly boost the efficiency of cws in the treatment of wastewater biochar has a significant surface area which aids in the absorption of different contaminants chen et al 2021 meanwhile biochar may also improve pollution removal indirectly by altering the properties of the substrate microorganisms and plant growth in cws biochar offers significant benefits in space for microbes to adhere and create biofilm and hence improves biological pollution removal biochar has the potential to absorb contaminants in addition to compounds for plant growth which prolong the contact period between plant roots and wastewater because of its enormous surface area and negative charge biochar has the potential to adsorb toxicants strong intermolecular bonds hydrogen bonding and electrostatic attraction were identified as the primary causes of considerable pollutant adsorption on biochar khurshid et al 2021 zhuang et al 2022 biochar adsorption capability altered with the types of feedstock pollutant types and concentrations and improved by modification with alkali acid metal ions hassan et al 2020 nanoparticle based biochar nanocomposites showed higher effectiveness than the native bare biochar an organic pollutant might be eradicated from wastewater via hydrolysis filtration adsorption microbial degradation chemical reduction etc in the cws vymazal and březinová 2015 these impurities adsorbed by biochar mainly by the mechanisms of hydrogen bonding hydrophobic effects electrostatic attraction aromatic π donor and cationic π acceptor conjugation and fill up of pores more significantly biochar contains catalytic properties and redox reactive that enable it to receive or give electrons enhance conduction of electron and fabricate ros acceleration of abiotic breakdown of adsorbed organic pollutants deng et al 2021 the general mechanisms involved on biochar substrates in cws are summarily illustrated in the fig 10 along with phpzc of nanocomposites 7 biomass growth studies plant growth in cws had numerous properties in treatment processes that have made them an essential design module the lemon grass presented a positive growth in the presence of biochar deprived of any noticeable nutrient deficiency or toxicity symptoms after five months the height of the plant ranged from about 35 cm to 60 cm rhizome and root growth are described to be the 30 total growth of the plant with a maximum depth below ground of about 5 10 cm fig s4 illustrated different cws units had varied biomass growth and a noteworthy effect was detected concerning biochar and its nanocomposite addition for plant growth 8 future perspectives the toxicity assessment of effluent water and plant foliage needs further investigation long term effect of adsorbent further needs attention understanding the link between functioning bacterial communities and pollution removal systems requires insight into interaction effects 9 conclusion the present study has demonstrated the effectiveness of cornstalk agricultural waste biochar and its composite coated with green metal oxide as a substratum in the cws for the removal of reactive golden yellow merl yellow 145 dye the wetland treatment process is typically difficult to understand due to the various physical chemical and biological processes involved as well as fluctuations in real time wastewater the following are the primary conclusions reached during the study dye removal was observed in the cw systems in order of cuo bc mgo bc zno bc mno2 bc bc control and planted with lemongrass as well as for different

first order kinetic because of the higher value of r2 0 9 the biochar based wetlands performed statistically significantly p 0 05 better compared to the control cws without biochar for removal of the parameters a significant growth of plants were also detected by measure of leaves number and plant height these results propose the usage of agricultural left over as part of a cws substratum can offer enhanced textile dyes removal with minimum maintenance requirements ease of operation and good pollution removal efficiency cost effective engineered wetland technology can assist to alleviate

green metal oxide resulting in copper oxide biochar zinc oxide biochar magnesium oxide biochar manganese oxide biochar biochar for removal of dyes combined with the constructed wetland cw biochar

water colour and chemical oxygen demand cod chen et al 2011 various materials such as textiles plastics leather food and cosmetics are using different azo dyes khandare et al 2011 dyes have a carcinogenic toxic mutagenic effect hussain et al 2018 hussein and scholz 2017 also reduce aesthetic values and are hazardous to health and aquatic life hussain et al 2018 various technologies are applied to handle these bio recalcitrant compounds such as coagulation fluctuation and advanced oxidation process hussein and scholz 2017 adsorption and ozone treatment tee et al 2015 besides high efficiencies these processes have disadvantages like higher cost the complex process may cause the formation of byproducts hussein and scholz 2017 production of a large amount of sludge tee et al 2015 therefore selecting alternative processes and techniques with operation easiness less cost and less maintenance requirement is essential wu et al 2015 the combination of green nano biochar composites with constructed wetlands is investigated as an alternative for the degradation of bio recalcitrant pollutants constructed wetlands cw are natural green systems that use biological physical and chemical routes to treat wastewater and improve its quality the mechanism of removal of the organic contaminant in cw involves sedimentation volatilization sorption biological degradation photochemical oxidation phytovolatilization plant uptake and phytoaccumulations chen et al 2011 it can be efficiently used to treat a variety of wastewater including organic nutrients suspended solids and heavy metal while their construction and maintenance cost is comparatively low due to their practical self sufficiency berberidou et al 2017 cws are differently classified on different bases on the hydrology of wetlands there are subsurface flow cws and free water surface cws furthermore ssf cws are further two types horizontal flow cws hf cws and vertical flow cws vf cws mahmood et al 2013 a combination of various wetlands systems is hybrid cws enhanced cws are also a type with escalated removal operations abedi and mojiri 2019 wu et al 2015 the substratum is a key constituent in cws due to its absorbance behavior of pollutants plant development encouragement provide reactive substances for contaminant processing and serve as a site for biofilm attachment as a result of their diverse features such as pore quantity specific surface area and element composition different substrate in cws can perform dramatically different in terms of pollution elimination therefore appropriate substrates selection is critical in biofilm based cw systems deng et al 2021 biochar is a black carbon obtained from carbon abundant biomass by degradation thermally under limited oxygen from a different process like pyrolysis biochar usage is increased due to the fertility enhancement of soil production of bioenergy and remediation benefits inyang et al 2016 with increasing pyrolysis temperature biochar with larger pore size and specific surface area and higher number of π π bonds but lower surface polarity will be produced deng et al 2021 in recent research cornstalk biochar combined with cuo zno mgo and mno2 for enhancement of surface area and positive character for anionic dye adsorption green nano biochar composites are harmless noncorrosive cheap thermally and chemically stable therefore nano biochar composites are one of the good choices for dye removal cws are green and inexpensive and low energy engineering science so we combined both systems best sides

were contained in plastic buckets with a height of 37 cm and outer width of 25 cm lemongrass was planted in each system and watered for about two and a half months before the synthetic dye wastewater application lemongrass is a commonly used wetland herb that grows in various areas of pakistan and is easily found in the university of agriculture faisalabad three individual plants were then acclimated to the six systems the vertical flow system with batch fed with a hydraulic retention time of 24 h for a duration of 10 14 weeks the systems were fed with the dye influent of 100 mg l and effluent was contained in separate beakers in this experiment the temperature range was 30 2 c in batch mode the water depth was kept at 2 cm above the substrate height and the wastewater was swiftly filled in each bed and then entirely emptied every corresponding hrt respectively in a batch flow system each parameter value for a week was determined by taking the average of the 7 different samples

between the substrate and pollutants is usually described by internal and external diffusion as well as adsorption and pollutants are eliminated from the water the pollutants organic or inorganic adsorbed by the substrate are further undergone decomposition by the microorganisms and plant absorption and then removed by the substrate wang et al 2020a the different operating conditions that effects cw performance were assessed on basis of percentage removal the percent removal was calculated as follows 1 removal efficiency c in c out c in 100 where cout and cin outflow and inflow concentrations respectively mg l abdelhakeem et al 2016 2 5 removal kinetics the kinetic modeling analysis was used to assess the pollutant removal influencing variables in the cws the speciation kinetic analysis of multipollutant aids in determining reaction patterns kumar and singh 2021 once the efficiency of cw based treatments has been validated by optimal operating conditions kinetic studies of dye were carried out zero first and second order models were used for simulating the behaviors of the pollutants in constructed wetland cws pérez et al 2014 the main purpose of the removal kinetic based analysis is the determination a model that best fits dye removal in the cws system 2 5 1 kinetic zero model the best optimum operating conditions found in statistical analysis were used

coefficient r was utilized and significant correlations were accepted at a 95 confidence level 3 result and discussions 3 1 ftir analysis the ftir scrutinizes the functional groups on the adsorbent surfaces as well as their engrossment in the dye molecules adsorption and hence composites stability can be evaluated by the deviations in the absorbance intensities khan et al 2019 the ftir spectra of biochar zno bc mgo bc mno2 bc and cuo bc showed that the intensity of peak at 3300 3500 cm 1 from the stretching vibration of the hydroxyl groups oh in hemicellulose or cellulose decreased which proposed the hemicellulose decomposition or oh removal which is already proved in many studies chen et al 2019 khan et al 2019 the presence of the symmetric stretching of ch3 and ch2 at vibration 2920 2930 cm 1 bands and 1600 cm 1 as aromatic co ring stretching causes basicity alkalinity of biochar which could be accountable for ph increase fig 5 the zno bc ftir spectrum illustrated a band of zno absorption was observed in the range of 494 500 cm 1 the data is analogous to the outcomes attained from other research as shown by wang et al 2020b the rest of the peaks have been found similar to native biochar the ftir spectra of mgo bc fig 5 b the bands at 617 and 703 cm 1 are due to the mgo stretching vibrations and results were also related to other data noreen et al 2020b shen et al 2019 the cuo bc ftir spectrum illustrated a band of cuo vibration was observed at the range of 611 and 497 cm 1 li et al 2020 the mno2 bc ftir spectrum illustrated a band of mno vibration was observed at the range of 518 cm 1 feng et al 2021 after loading of mno2 the absorption bands of c o c c as well as ch weakened sequentially furthermore proving the bc aromaticity weakening meanwhile mno peaks gradually enhanced after dye interaction with bands adsorption intensity decreased due to the interaction with these anions dye functional groups in all these nanoparticles the band intensity decrease shifting the appearance of the bands in the loaded adsorbent and designating the adsorption of dyes on the adsorbent there was a prominent change in the oh peaks in both dyes after loading with dye fig 5a 3 2 sem analysis the bare bc sem image fig 5a e without any nanoparticles loading displayed a plate resembling morphology with wrinkled plates which were amalgamated together to provide an improved adsorption surface for adsorption of organic contaminants such as dyes the morphology of prepared zno bc has diverse shapes like spherical and hexagonal and it might be attributed due to the metal reducing capacity of the leaves extract effect the biochar porous nature provided more chances for loading spaces for zno nps although some of the pores of biochar were occupied by the zno nps the sample still exhibited porous nature with a relatively larger pore volume already reported by other researchers kamaraj et al 2020 layer homogeneous sheeted mgo bc were detected in sem analysis fig 5a b which was the surface morphology for the corncob biochars at relatively higher temperatures the macro porous structure was distributed on the sheets which was similarly observed on the corncob biochars formed at 550 c after mgo coating it was detected that cubic and hexagonal mgo were well coated on the biochar surface related to other works shen et al 2019 there was variation in pore space between cuo bc and bc due to the impregnation with the metallic nanoparticles there was more aggregation of the cuo nanoparticles that led to more micro porous openings in the cuo bc which caused improvement in the adsorption potential of cuo bc in comparison with the bc matched results with other researcher imran et al 2021 the surface was covered with nano mno2 which formed numerous porous structures the mno2 nano spheres were grown on the biochar that greatly increase the surface area zhou et al 2017 it increased the surface area and active site of nano adsorbent which increased contaminants adsorption efficiency fig 5a the results showed the changes in the surface and structural characteristics of the green nanoparticles samples before and after the treatment of dyes fig 5b 3 3 charge on nano adsorbent the point of zero charges phpzc is a noteworthy factor for the identification of the binding active site nature on nano adsorbent the ph value of the adsorbent which becomes neutral is recognized as a point of zero charges that elucidates the adsorbent electro kinetic nature the ph affects the charge of the surface due to the presence of positive h and negative oh ions the surface charge is considered by the point of zero charges pzc which is helpful for mechanism determination for nano adsorbents of the cationic character ph phpzc while for anionic character ph phpzc the nano adsorbent is desirable that boosts the anion adsorption noreen et al 2020a the phpzc of d cuo bc b mgo bc c zno bc a mno2 bc n bc was observed to be 8 8 8 7 8 7 8 6 and 8 5 respectively fig 6 shows the phpzc of nanocomposites so the ph below the phpzc gives a positive charge on the nano adsorbent surface which is favorable for the removal of anionic dyes contaminates due to the electrostatic forces between the opposite charges zheng et al 2020 so the d nanocomposite has a higher positive charge because of the presence of a higher phpzc value that gives a clear indication for the higher attraction for reactive golden yellow merl yellow 145 dye and so on 3 4 substratum profile this study was accomplished for the determination of the reactive golden yellow merl yellow 145 dye adsorption by using cws comprised of cornstalk biochar system or its biochar nanocomposites as a substratum that was analyzed after the dye application 3 5 ph effect the ph is a significant parameter in the uptake of nutrients from aqueous solutions as it depends upon the adsorbent surface charge degree of ionization and adsorbate speciation in the aqueous media a general experiment for the effect of ph on constructed wetland was observed by ranging the ph from 2 4 6 8 10 and 12 the final ph was ranged in all ph was 6 0 7 9 after the 24 h shown in the graph which is drawn between the final ph and initial ph fig 7a shows the effect of different ph on the constructed wetland with the different substrates which is effective for both plants and microorganisms while the control without our substrate was less effective for other systems but still maintain in the range 5 8 5 due to plant and the microorganisms the enhancement in ph in cws can be elucidated by high phpzc in a b c d and n and biochar s highly alkaline nature and its composites as it contributed due to ash content that is already shown in graphs moreover the ph variation can also be attributed by elevation in concentrations of the hydroxyls carbonates ammonia bicarbonates and other ions by bio digestion of the organic matter om gupta et al 2016 for the determination of the ph effect with time on wetland at 100 mg l of dye concentration we take the effluent of ph 7 5 with hrt of 10 week effluent ph was checked each week at the fixed time 8 00 am there was a minor increase or decrease in ph the initial dye ph was 7 5 after passing the dye based wastewater from cws beds ph enhanced up to 6 weak slightly then decreased respectively the observed ph among all the cws was within the recommended range 6 0 ph 8 5 which is essential for the existence of many treatment microorganisms fig 7b shows the effect of hrt on ph at a fixed concentration of dye a modest ph 4 ph 12 is effective for the cws stability an extreme value of ph affects plant growth and microbial community diversity li et al 2018 the ph was found statistically significant f 153 4 p 0 05 between all wetland systems which might be attributed to different phpzc the alkaline biochar displayed astonishingly higher acidity neutralizing capability than the control biochar with a strong positive ion exchange capability for the h and a higher content of the ash components comprising positive ions that can generate dissolved alkalinity chen et al 2021 mosley et al 2015 this advantage makes biochar and biochar based nanocomposites an attractive adsorbent that can lower the acidity and effectively adsorb dye 3 6 total suspended solids tss the treatment system consists of lemongrass and biochar as well as its composites which has removed a higher percentage of tss as compared to the control wetland with the only plant a total of about 95 of tss was eliminated by the biochar planted system after the 10th week of exposure compared to the only planted system control which achieved 80 33 of tss removal after the 10th week of exposure this outcome proved that biochar itself can help with the reduction of suspended solids ts in effluent through the different substrates by the filtration process but that the presence of lemongrass speeds up tss removal with the help of its root system tss removal

concentration of dye the comparison of wetlands with and without biochar systems revealed significant differences f 270 2 p 0 05 indicating that biochar based media providing effective filtration of the tss and influenced to the complementary treatment of the organic portion of the tss because of sedimentation and filtration the outcomes also revealed significant differences p 0 05 between the medium based on biochar and biochar nanocomposites furthermore when it came to tss elimination the biochar nanocomposite based cws performed considerably better than the biochar based cws with low porosity gravel media and a physical filtering process suspended particles may be filtered and contained in the cws allowing for improved solids removal karathanasis et al 2003 the plant roots act as a physical filter and provide the appropriate organic matter that acts as a bio sorbent and contributed to particulate matter removal nawaz et al 2020 the matrix of cws based biochar and its nanocomposites settled with time passage about 50 to 78 decrease in the tss was observed in the effluent that was collected by the cws planted with phragmites australis and typha latifolia aided with soil microbes saba et al 2015 flow conditions reduced turbulence in the open water layer between the sediment and roots suspended particles may be successfully eliminated from the water column by sedimentation bi et al 2019 3 7 total dissolved solids tds total dissolved solids tds is the extent of the dissolved material amount in the water these materials can be incorporated chloride bicarbonate carbonate phosphate sulfate nitrate magnesium calcium natural particles sodium and different particles a precise dissolve particle level in the water is significant for the life of amphibians tds has been analyzed using the tds meter the initial concentration of dye was 100 mg l and effluent tds was 900 mg l during the initial stage wetland effluents indicated low removal efficiency the wetland with biochar and its composites indicated a higher reduction than the wetland control without biochar later cws gave a higher performance than the start but still the wetland with biochar showed a higher reduction percentage it gives a maximum of 64 tds removal efficiency with d while others gave lower results compared to it tds by in order of cuo bc 64 44 mgo bc 60 00 zno

without biochar systems revealed significant differences f 19 49 p 0 05 in comparison between the wetlands based on biochar and its nano composites biochar nanocomposites based wetland perform significantly as compared to wetlands based on biochar this increase might be because tds in the dye effluent is in the ionic state there was an increase in the tds of effluents as a comparison to influents in the case of control native bc and a which might be due to synthetic dyes presence while in d b and c it decreases might be due to higher positive character the increase in the tds value can be explained by the fact that when dye passed through cws media they are highly ionized saba et al 2015 with time the removal efficiency increases due to the higher hrt and provided higher time for contact with the substrate in the tenth week their removal efficiency increases to its maximum point one of the key absorption methods by plants in cws is nutrient removal which facilitates tds removal by absorbing nutrients in the influents tds removal in cw is greater owing to the presence of plants i e plant roots having the potential to function as filters when they develop enabling reduction of dissolved solids combined with plant nutrition intake tds removal efficiency decrease significantly as the trial run progresses this is most likely due to tds which can block soil pores and it is also possible that this is related to a clogging problem caused by the continued use of wetland systems das et al 2019 3 8 conductivity ec the conductivity ec is typically known as an ion carrying species indicator and that corresponds to ec values that may be applied as an indicator for water quality challenges any sudden enhancement in the ec values indicates that there is a dissolved ions source in the wetland based filter hussein and scholz 2018 there was a slight increase in the ec but in the 10th week there was a decrease in the value indicating the higher removal efficiency with the higher hrt but overall results obtained have shown low removal efficiency the ec decrease in the end might be associated with nutrient uptake by plants and the physicochemical and biological binding of dye molecules to the roots as well as soil particles nawaz et al 2020 ec in order of cuo bc 68 mgo bc 60 zno bc 44 mno2 bc 32 bc 20 control 8 with maximum hrt at 10th weeks fig 8

wetland show significant differences with other wetlands slightly f 3 811 p 0 05 the lack of any effect of biochar at the start on the conductivity is not a surprising fact since the high ec of the dye wastewaters might mask it the condition occurred in another case where vf mesocosms encumbered with both scw and septage approving that the biochar addition did not significantly affect outflow conductivity de rozari et al 2015 3 9 colour removal azo dyes structures are complex and nitrogen and carbon contents are not biologically readily available for microorganisms hence for dyes biodegradation supplemental nitrogen and carbon are a requirement colour is the main challenging factor regarding textile effluent based wastewater a significant reduction in colour was also detected in the biochar and its nanocomposites based cws the colour removal efficiency was increased with increasing hrt 56 to 95 5 colour removal efficiency was observed in different wetlands with hrt of 12 60 days with the highest colour removal noted in the biochar system assisted with cuo bc colour removal efficiency in order of cuo bc 95 52 mgo bc 92 88 zno bc 88 08 mno2 bc 84 08 bc 77 92 control 56 4 at the maximum hrt of 60 days for 2 months after 48 days there was a significant increase in removal efficiency but there was a significant increase in the longer hrt up to 48 days fig 8 i shows the effect of hrt on the removal efficiency of dye at a fixed concentration of dye the longer the hrt higher will be the colour removal efficiency can be explained by more aerobic conditions that give a higher rate of removal of pollutants and higher hrt gives higher time for maximum performance the biochar and its nanocomposite adsorption capacity depends on the surface activities because the specific surface area is available for the interaction between the solute and the surface that is required for the solute saba et al 2015 water depth and hrt are the two main factors that controlled the cws performance the results designated that all cws effectively lowered anionic dye the biochar based wetlands performed statistically significantly f 18 44 p 0 05 better compared to the control cws without biochar for the removal of dye from wastewater in comparison the wetlands based on biochar nano composites did not perform significantly statistically only wetland d and wetland b performed significantly p 0 05 as compared to other wetlands the extremely porous biochar has a large surface area which provides anoxic conditions for the production of microbial biofilms and might be one of the causes of the significant decreases in the wetland with biochar as compared to the control wetland cayuela et al 2013 important features of biochar included larger porosity numerous holes of varying sizes hydrophobicity and organic leaching may make it more appropriate for microbial contamination removal than sand or gravel batch experiments have shown that biochar is an effective adsorbent for the pollutant in solutions particularly through the elimination pathways of electrostatic attraction complexation ion ligand exchange p binding interactions and precipitation

release and oxygen to oxygenate the media and creation of aerated microaerobic based degradation zones within the bed davies et al 2005 biochar substrates promoted the development of functional microorganisms and performed as efficient biofilm transporters hence indirectly promoting organic pollutant breakdown lu and chen 2018 this was due mostly to biochar enabling adsorption and biodegradation mahmood et al 2015 3 10 dissolve oxygen do organics can be eradicated by adsorption chemical oxidation reduction hydrolysis filtering microbial degradation and other methods from

weeks fig 8 j shows the effect of hrt on do at a fixed concentration of dye this type of increment is also observed before this type of significant increase in the do might be because of the oxygen released by roots in the root zone area because the roots of a plant play a significant part in the soil matrix de aggregation which results in the more aeration sehar et al 2015 the comparison of wetlands with and without biochar systems revealed significant differences f 9 650 p 0 05 in comparison between the wetlands based on biochar and its nano composites wetlands based on biochar nano composites performed significantly as compared to biochar based wetland n more precisely the do amount was low during the initial sampling 3 3 mg l at 0 h however vfcws treatment improved do content in all wetlands in other research same results were obtained vegetation enhanced the do up to 5 87 mg l whereas biochar augmentation enhanced it more up to 7 31 mg l the do increase might be attributed due to cws nature which provides enough contact time and aeration for organic matter om reduction hussain et al 2018 the do diversities not only affected microbial activity community structure but also signified roles in respiration and photosynthesis liu et al 2016 3 11 chemical oxygen demand cod this research was performed for the determination of degradation adsorption of reactive golden yellow merl yellow 145 dye based wastewater by using cws comprising biochar and its nanocomposites as substratum the cod of the influents was 756 mg l which was significantly reduced to lower ranges in the case of biochar as well as its nanocomposites a noteworthy cod reduction was observed in the cws systems with the time passage the control system without biochar showed less cod removal 75 this can be explained by the low substrate conversion ayyappan et al 2018 the systems that consisted of biological based treatments like cws contact time hrt is a significant operational parameter because of the lower hrt higher organic loading which resulting in the reduction of the reactor volume that is required for an anticipated performance another fact is higher hrt usually produced better outcomes as it provides enough contact time for the reaction yadav et al 2012 cod removal efficiency in order of cuo bc 93 25 mgo bc 90 07 zno bc 88 22 mno2 bc 83 73 bc 80 82 control 75 at the maximum hrt fig 8 k l shows the effect of hrt on removal efficiency cod at a fixed concentration of dye aerobic micro locations in rhizomes and roots could be attributed to cod removal because aerobic micro locations are existing in the rhizomes and roots vicinity which has the highest adsorption capacity attained with the activated carbon 37 88 mg 1g followed by the composite media 22 99 mg 1g and zeolite 2 35 mg 1 g saba et al 2015 these results designated that hrt was a critical factor of the cod removal in the cws because an elongated hrt safeguarded the stable elimination of the organic matter through the physical and chemical absorption and subsequent microbial degradation sato et al 2011 biochar was shown to have an essential role in cod reduction via adsorption due to its extremely porous structure which allowed additional sites for microbial growth huang et al 2013 biochar has the potential to minimize the water soluble percentage of contaminants while also storing organic substances in the pores of the carbon the immobilization of the bioavailable portion of organic pollutants can be attributed to the reduction in dye content of the substrate treated with biochar because of its hydrophobic nature and micropores biochar has the potential to absorb and retain pollutants cao et al 2021 the results designated that all cws effectively lowered organic matter the biochar based wetlands performed statistically significantly f 20 72 p 0 05 better compared to the control cws without biochar for removal of the parameters cod in comparison the wetlands based on green metal oxides coated biochar nano composites performed statistically significantly p 0 05 better compared to simple biochar based wetland but significant differences were not detected between green metal oxides coated biochar nanocomposites based wetlands statistically some of the hypothesized combination methods for the elimination of cod include interactions between molecules and biochar through bonds direct molecular biochar electrostatic attraction repulsion and intermolecular hydrogen bonding in addition to adsorption other mechanisms that reduce cod include precipitation oxidation and anaerobic digestion gupta et al 2016 4 removal kinetics the rate of reaction of a constituent in a reactor that is its transformation is studied in reaction kinetics production or consumption the reaction rate in the first order reaction is directly proportional to the reagent concentration the reaction rate of the second order reaction is proportional to the square of the reagent concentration the reaction rate in zero order reactions is independent of the reagent concentration the rate of change of the reagent concentration c is constant under these conditions this comment assumes that the reaction takes place in a batch reactor with no reagent addition or withdrawal during the reaction period in the case of a vanishing reagent in the reactor for example through decomposition mechanisms a minus sign in the term on the right hand side of the equation indicates constituent removal whereas a plus sign indicates constituent production in a zero order reaction the coefficient k represents the concentration that was removed or converted per unit of time von sperling et al 2020 first order reactions occur when the rate of the reaction is proportional to the concentration of the reagent as a result the rate of change of the reagent concentration c in a batch reactor is proportional to the reagent concentration at a given time when we have a high concentration we have a high value of removed concentration for a given time period but the concentration does not affect the removal efficiency throughout this period von sperling et al 2020 it was used to forecast pollution concentrations at varying reaction times the data were subjected to kinetics models eqs 2 4 in zero order the graph was plotted between c in c out and t the slope represents the k0 rate constant in the first order the graph was plotted between ln c out c in and t the slope represents the k1 rate constant for the first order while for second order the graph was plotted between 1 c out and t the slope represents the k2 rate constant for the second order the obtained results are shown in the table the value of k0 k1 and k2 are shown in the table their value reveals the removal of reactive golden yellow merl yellow 145 by using cuo bc d mgo bc b zno bc c mno2 bc a bc n and control 4 1 colour removal kinetic for colour removal kinetics indicated that it followed the second order kinetic because of the higher value of r2 that was present as cuo bc 0 9806 mgo bc 0 9734 zno bc 0 9549 mno2 bc 0 9607 bc 0 9764 control 0 9719 that are shown in table 2a fig 9 shows the trend of the different kinetic models of colour moreover the plot of observed cobs and estimated cest concentrations confirmed that the value of second order observed cobs and estimated cest concentrations were closed as compared to zero and first order s2 the kinetic analysis of three azo dyes was accomplished in other studies the regression coefficient and rate constant values corresponded to the decolorization of azo dye the ar18 cr and ao7 decolorizations were pseudo second order kinetic models with a higher correlation coefficient r2 0 9 oon et al 2020 the study of reactive black 5 diazo dye and co substrate degradation was demonstrated in the sequential batched reactor that also fitted to the second order kinetic model ong et al 2012 the second order reaction kinetics model was more sensitive to the reactant reactant connection this might be related to the complicated character of the wastewater and the formation of numerous compounds throughout the degradation process each chemical has a distinct link although it is not primarily a linear relationship wang et al 2019 the response rates derived from the second order reaction were also compared for the various cws the higher response rate suggests that cw took longer to remove colour than other cws the reaction rate figures suggest that colour was eliminated faster if the wastewater was treated with a lower reaction rate which might translate to a lower operational cost moersidik et al 2020 4 2 cod removal kinetic cod removal kinetics indicated that it followed the first order kinetic because of the higher value of r2 that was present as cuo bc 0 996 mgo bc 0 9746 zno bc 0 942 mno2 bc 0 9121 bc 0 8843 control 0 8887 that are shown in table 2b moreover the plot of observed cobs and estimated cest concentrations confirmed that the value of first order observed cobs and estimated cest concentrations were closed as compared to zero and second order s3 in other literature the r2 value for cod was 0 9800 for the first order thus the kinetic studies indicated that the reduction of cod in the textile effluent followed the first order kinetic model sivakumar et al 2014 fig 9 shows the trend of the different kinetic models of cod the first order decay model is based on the assumption that cod elimination rates are linearly proportional to cod concentration assuming that removal effectiveness does not change concerning cod load removal rates rise linearly with cod concentration the model also assumes that the substrate concentration is significantly less than the half saturation constant ks the concentration supporting 50 of the maximum rate of uptake that the system is well mixed that there are no significant influences from water losses or gains and that the system is dependent on only one reactant messer et al 2017 higher coefficient of correlation 0 9 values for the observed and anticipated models of the efficiency loss models resulted in better statistical results however the reduced removal effectiveness of the cws might be attributed to fewer plants contributing to pollution removal the porous activated carbon with the highest surface area and the do consumption produced an anoxic environment for the formation of microbial biofilms which might explain the considerable reduction in pollutant levels in the cws kumar and singh 2021 5 correlation between water quality parameters within cws the reciprocal association between two variables is referred to as correlation a direct connection arises when an upsurge or decline in the value of one parameter corresponds to an upsurge or decline in the other value the correlation is considered to be positive when a rise in one parameter produces an upsurge in the other and negative when an increase in one parameter produces a reduction in the other the correlation coefficient r ranges from 1 to 1 the correlation between the parameters is classified as strong when it is between 0 8 and 1 0 moderate when it is between 0 5 and 0 8 and weak when it is between 0 0 and 0 5 it is frequently used to develop relationships between various water parameters that can determine the probable source of solutes and the mechanisms involved in controlling water s hydrochemistry varol and davraz 2015 a correlation r value of one or close to one indicates a significant positive link whereas r values close to 0 indicate no relationship rehman et al 2018 the correlation matrix for water quality physicochemical characteristics was established table 3 the colour and cod were strongly positively correlated with total dissolved solids electrical conductivity and total suspended solids while strongly negative relation with dissolved oxygen do was a strong strong negative relation with all parameters but weakly with ph negatively connection with do since organic matter is partially oxidized by do whereas nutrients promote eutrophication of water resulting in a rise in organic matter which leads to an increase in oxygen demand tds and ec strongly positively correlated with total suspended solid and with each other ph was weakly correlated with all the other parameters tds and negative ions are examples of inorganic materials that naturally correspond with ec the high association between ec and tds suggests that ec is responsible for salt dissolution and the inorganic pollution load in water singh et al 2020 the rest of the correlations are provided in supplementary data form table s1 6 possible mechanism of constructed wetland biochar might directly boost the efficiency of cws in the treatment of wastewater biochar has a significant surface area which aids in the absorption of different contaminants chen et al 2021 meanwhile biochar may also improve pollution removal indirectly by altering the properties of the substrate microorganisms and plant growth in cws biochar offers significant benefits in space for microbes to adhere and create biofilm and hence improves biological pollution removal biochar has the potential to absorb contaminants in addition to compounds for plant growth which prolong the contact period between plant roots and wastewater because of its enormous surface area and negative charge biochar has the potential to adsorb toxicants strong intermolecular bonds hydrogen bonding and electrostatic attraction were identified as the primary causes of considerable pollutant adsorption on biochar khurshid et al 2021 zhuang et al 2022 biochar adsorption capability altered with the types of feedstock pollutant types and concentrations and improved by modification with alkali acid metal ions hassan et al 2020 nanoparticle based biochar nanocomposites showed higher effectiveness than the native bare biochar an organic pollutant might be eradicated from wastewater via hydrolysis filtration adsorption microbial degradation chemical reduction etc in the cws vymazal and březinová 2015 these impurities adsorbed by biochar mainly by the mechanisms of hydrogen bonding hydrophobic effects electrostatic attraction aromatic π donor and cationic π acceptor conjugation and fill up of pores more significantly biochar contains catalytic properties and redox reactive that enable it to receive or give electrons enhance conduction of electron and fabricate ros acceleration of abiotic breakdown of adsorbed organic pollutants deng et al 2021 the general mechanisms involved on biochar substrates in cws are summarily illustrated in the fig 10 along with phpzc of nanocomposites 7 biomass growth studies plant growth in cws had numerous properties in treatment processes that have made them an essential design module the lemon grass presented a positive growth in the presence of biochar deprived of any noticeable nutrient deficiency or toxicity symptoms after five months the height of the plant ranged from about 35 cm to 60 cm rhizome and root growth are described to be the 30 total growth of the plant with a maximum depth below ground of about 5 10 cm fig s4 illustrated different cws units had varied biomass growth and a noteworthy effect was detected concerning biochar and its nanocomposite addition for plant growth 8 future perspectives the toxicity assessment of effluent water and plant foliage needs further investigation long term effect of adsorbent further needs attention understanding the link between functioning bacterial communities and pollution removal systems requires insight into interaction effects 9 conclusion the present study has demonstrated the effectiveness of cornstalk agricultural waste biochar and its composite coated with green metal oxide as a substratum in the cws for the removal of reactive golden yellow merl yellow 145 dye the wetland treatment process is typically difficult to understand due to the various physical chemical and biological processes involved as well as fluctuations in real time wastewater the following are the primary conclusions reached during the study dye removal was observed in the cw systems in order of cuo bc mgo bc zno bc mno2 bc bc control and planted with lemongrass as well as for different

first order kinetic because of the higher value of r2 0 9 the biochar based wetlands performed statistically significantly p 0 05 better compared to the control cws without biochar for removal of the parameters a significant growth of plants were also detected by measure of leaves number and plant height these results propose the usage of agricultural left over as part of a cws substratum can offer enhanced textile dyes removal with minimum maintenance requirements ease of operation and good pollution removal efficiency cost effective engineered wetland technology can assist to alleviate

1184,microplastics mp i e particles measuring less than 5 mm in size are considered emerging pollutants the ubiquity of mp is causing great concern among environmental and public health agencies anthropogenic activities are responsible for the extensive dispersal of mp in nature adverse effects on living organisms interactions with other contaminants occurring in the environment and the lack of effective degradation removal techniques are significant issues related to mp most mp found in nature are fibrous fmp fmp originate from textile products mainly synthetic fibers e g polyester synthetic fibers are intensively used to produce countless goods due to beneficial characteristics such as high mechanical resistance and economic feasibility fmp are ubiquitous on the planet and impart lasting adverse effects on biodiversity data on the consequences of long term exposure to these pollutants are scarce in the literature in addition few studies address the main types of synthetic microfibers released from textiles their occurrence adverse effects on organisms and remediation strategies this review discusses the relevant topics about fmp and alerts the dangers to the planet furthermore future perspectives and technological highlights for the fmp mitigation degradation are presented graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microplastics environment pollution textile fibers microplastic pollution textile industry data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction plastics are synthetic polymeric materials having high molar mass since their emergence in the early 20th century their versatility superior performance and low production costs have contributed to their continued growth and broad adoption andrady and neal 2009 barrows et al 2018 salvador cesa et al 2017 these materials are applied in many segments of modern society including domestic mobility textile biomedical agricultural and others andrady and neal 2009 among the main commercial applications is the production of staple fibers and microfilaments for manufacturing textile yarns which are then used in knitting fabrics woven fabrics household items garments or technical textiles applications e g automotive airbags bullet proof vest diapers artificial turf vehicle seat belts artificial implants tyre cords and others deng et al 2020 sait et al 2021 salvador cesa et al 2017 during the processing of synthetic fibers humans determine fibers fineness and length based on the characteristics and mechanical properties that the finished product needs to present varshney et al 2011 for these individual fibers to present suitable characteristics for the spinning process their thickness must be of micrometric dimensions fiori and brown 1951 neckář and vyšanská 2012 the textile spinning process consists of manufacturing yarns for weaving and sewing threads both yarns and threads need to be resistant flexible thin structures and at the same time present adequate elongation resilience and elasticity to be intertwined or sewn to make these characteristics possible fibers natural or manufactured due to their high fineness micrometric are the most suitable materials for clustering twisting and forming yarns and threads in this form the resulting yarn will be malleable pleasing to the touch and consequently suitable for application in the manufacture of delicate and flexible fabrics with nice draping neckář and vyšanská 2012 varshney et al 2011 conventional textile fibers for clothing have a diameter between 7 and 20 μm and in certain cases can reach up to 70 μm for heavy duty applications such as carpets milwich 2010 the fashion and clothing industry arouse great interest in increasingly fine fibers and yarns because fineness is a characteristic that is directly related to the quality of fabrics such as wearability visual appearance physical comfort and proper handling de oliveira et al 2021b fiori and brown 1951 neckář and vyšanská 2012 varshney et al 2011 to meet this demand the synthetic yarn industry has enabled the production of increasingly fine fibers and filaments reaching diameters as small as 5 μm and termed microfibers mfs milwich 2010 synthetic filaments as fine as those used in the textile industry mainly in the form of staple fibers are continuously released from textile products e g yarns fabrics nonwovens whenever they are subjected to mechanical forces such as when they are washed kawecki and nowack 2019 zhang et al 2021a for these reasons it is common to detect fibrous residues in industrial discharges from industrial laundries dyeing processes finishing and domestic washing cai et al 2020 deng et al 2020 although wastewater is the principal source of fibrous microplastics fmp deng et al 2020 their occurrence is also common in soil zhang and liu 2018 and the atmosphere batool et al 2022 in those cases fmp originate from spinning process residues clothing residues weaving dust prata 2018 weathering and fragmentation of geotextiles and agro textiles bai et al 2022 zhang and liu 2018 land disposal of household textiles or improper disposal detachment of synthetic mfs from textile structures results gives rise to free microplastics mp de oliveira et al 2021b in this context numerous studies have reported how mp can endanger the lives of humans and threaten ecosystems due to their occurrence in the atmosphere soil and water senathirajah et al 2021 mp in water bodies for example are ingested by animals which in turn end up in the human body via the food chain carbery et al 2018 many laboratory analyses have reported the occurrence of mp in natural and commercial foods and beverages senathirajah et al 2021 mp have also been detected from autopsies and in human waste one of the most critical factors regarding the persistence of mp in the environment is their high resistance to degradation this characteristic combined with the mismanagement of plastic waste favors the accumulation of mp in the environment barrows et al 2018 furthermore mp may have some adsorption capacity and serve as a support for pollutants present in the environment fred ahmadu et al 2020 numerous researchers have reported the appearance of mp containing toxic chemicals and microbiological agents capable of causing illness and even death of organisms fred ahmadu et al 2020 senathirajah et al 2021 mp are often recognized as a cocktail of contaminants due to their combination with pesticides pharmaceuticals heavy metals and other emerging pollutants in water soil and air fred ahmadu et al 2020 júnior et al 2022 in a study by senathirajah et al 2021 based on data extraction from fifty nine publications the average mass of mp particles between 0 and 1 mm was estimated subsequently considering various exposure routes the authors derived the global average rate of microplastic ingestion they showed that humans ingest an average of 0 1 to 5 g of mp weekly equivalent to 11 845 to 193 200 mp per year with drinking water being the most significant source regarding hazards of mfs derived from textiles there is an aggravating factor the functionalization of textile products with chemical additives some additives can exacerbate the damage to organisms via ingestion and or hinder the degradation of mp in the environment de oliveira et al 2021b sait et al 2021 textile products commonly contain many additives which are incorporated during manufacture such as lubricants flame retardants antimicrobial products halogenated compounds plasticizing agents formaldehyde based substances synthetic dyes and pigments and stabilizers among others de oliveira et al 2021b de oliveira et al 2021a immich et al 2021 zambrano et al 2021 analyzed the biodegradation of cotton fibers treated with different additives present in textile sludge for 102 days they reported that untreated fibers showed 70 degradation while fibers containing fabric softener degraded much faster around 90 and fibers with a durable press finishing degraded at about 63 lykaki et al 2021 observed a substantial reduction in the biodegradation of viscose fibers treated with antimicrobial products the authors reported a 10 degradation for fibers with antimicrobial treatment compared to 70 degradation for untreated fibers kept in biological sludge for 60 days according to the synthetic fiber market size share trends analysis report the global synthetic fibers market was valued at us 59 95 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compound annual rate cagr of 6 6 between 2021 and 2028 according to the report the polyester textile fiber segment led the market in 2020 accounting for more than 48 of the global revenue of synthetic fiber producers the segment is estimated to expand even faster from 2021 to 2028 due to the growing demand for polyesters the growth trends of the synthetic polymers segment have aroused concern regarding the imminent accumulation of mp in the environment for these reasons numerous research groups have sought to study the dynamics and impacts of mp in different ecosystems and outline strategies for remediation and mitigation of the release of these wastes into the environment currently literature reviews offer broad approaches regarding the release of mp into the environment in this review the main objective was to address the release of fmp specifically from textile processes and products this review opens with current data and concepts on plastics and microplastics next the release of fmp originating from textile products and processes is highlighted in addition the review discusses the main emission sites of synthetic textile mfs their occurrence in different ecosystems impacts remediation techniques research gaps and future perspectives 2 plastics and microplastics plastic is a macromolecular material of high molar weight resulting from polymerization reactions of organic monomers almost always derived from by products of the petrochemical industry due to their unique characteristics and properties these materials have become irreplaceable in many applications in modern society andrady and neal 2009 however plastics are sometimes managed irresponsibly according to barrows et al 2018 estimates of plastic waste generation are still often based on mesoplastics 5 mm to 2 5 cm and macroplastics 2 5 cm to 1 m because of their ease of detection larger particles are visible to the naked eye and cause a greater sense of urgency and discomfort however when discarded in the environment plastics are subject to natural weathering including the effects of rain solar radiation and microorganisms that promote a series of attacks on the microstructure of these materials singh and sharma 2008 from this point plastics break down into small pieces that progressively comminute creating an emerging and significant environmental problem de oliveira et al 2021b deng et al 2020 although there is no consensus on a minimum acceptable size for a plastic to be considered a microplastic such particles are mentioned in the literature as measuring between 0 1 and 5000 μm in size hartmann et al 2019 thompson et al 2004 since 1970 with the first report on the detection of plastics in the atlantic ocean carpenter and smith 1972 the occurrence of plastics in different ecosystems has been widely documented according to geyer et al 2017 from the 1950s to mid 2017 it is estimated that 8 3 billion tons of plastics were produced according to plastics the facts plasticseurope 2019 368 million tons of plastic were produced in 2019 also according to the report the production of specific polymer types worldwide was estimated at 29 8 polyethylene pe 19 4 polypropylene pp 10 polyvinyl chloride pvc 7 9 polyurethane pur 7 9 polyethylene terephthalate pet 6 2 polystyrene ps and 18 8 other plastics according to barrows et al 2018 more than 9 million tons of textile fibers are produced annually with about 60 of this volume being synthetic mfs of which polyester pet nylon polyamide pa and acrylic polyacrylonitrile pan are the principal fibers applied mp can be classified as primary or secondary primary mp are those already manufactured in dimensions smaller than 5 mm while secondary mp are plastics with less than 5 mm derived from the fragmentation of a larger plastic piece due to degradation processes cole et al 2011 primary mp are in the market not only as fibers but also as microparticles microcapsules microspheres and nanocrystals these particles are applied to products with a technological appeal such as personal hygiene products already banned in europe and america boucher and friot 2017 however it is estimated that 91 of the mp in marine environments are mfs sait et al 2021 in this case the fibers originate from industrial textile waste domestic wash water synthetic fishing nets and mooring ropes from marine platforms among others sait et al 2021 mp are transported in the environment in different ways in many cases their dispersal in nature is quite rapid and extensive reaching even remote glacial areas obbard 2018 fig 1 outlines how plastics and microplastics are dispersed in the environment following their release or disposal 3 fibrous microplastics originating from textiles the diversity of fibrous materials makes it challenging to measure mfs emitted by the industry especially from companies that manufacture different products fibers in the textile industry can be classified as natural or manufactured fibers natural fibers can be of plant origin e g cotton or animal origin e g wool and present a low risk of pollution regarding manufactured fibers there is diversity regarding the monomer used and its origin viscose or lyocell as well as other fibers obtained from regenerated natural polymers cannot be considered fmp therefore only synthetic fibers are considered mp pollutants fig 2 illustrates the molecular structures of the main synthetic polymers used in the manufacture of textile mfs this section presents the principal polluting synthetic fibers from the textile industry 3 1 polyester fibers polyesters are synthetic polymers widely used in the manufacture of textile products for example applications in clothing home textiles and technical textiles the polyesters most used in textile production are semi aromatic for example pet polyethylene terephthalate these polymers are more persistent in the environment when discarded due to their low biodegradability the high strength of polyesters is due to the low flexibility of the chain high crystallinity rigidity and stability provided by the aromatic rings tokiwa et al 2009 under specific conditions pet can be biodegraded for example in the presence of the bacterium ideonella sakaiensis shosuke et al 2016 however it should be noted that the presence of such microorganisms in nature is unusual based on this it concluded that the biodegradation of pet in nature is quite limited therefore it is expected that most of these plastics when discarded persist for long periods in the environment as polyesters are the most used polymers in textile production attempts to make possible the use of aliphatic polyesters in manufacturing fibers and yarns is valid as they are a biodegradable synthetic alternative among the polyesters with this potential are pla polylactic acid phb polyhydroxybutyrate ppl poly l lysine pcl polycaprolactone pbs polybutylene succinate pes polyethylene succinate pva polyvinyl alcohol and peg polyethylene glycol tokiwa et al 2009 wilkes and aristilde 2017 under certain conditions all these polyesters can be hydrolyzed and digested by certain enzymes capable of cleaving ester bonds and hydroxyl clusters wilkes and aristilde 2017 3 2 polyamide fibers polyamides pas are another important class of polymers in the textile industry in the form of mfs pas are widely used in blends with natural protein fibers or with cotton generally for clothing applications especially underwear and swimwear although the amide bonds in the structure make these polymers more susceptible to hydrolysis gewert et al 2015 their biodegradation remains slow depending on the type of nylon and environmental conditions hashimoto et al 2002 and yamano et al 2019 observed that nylon 4 is more biodegradable in soils and oceans 70 mass loss in 6 weeks when compared to nylon 6 one of the most used in manufacture of textile mfs 3 3 polyolefin fibers microplastics from polluting polymers such as polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp have the highest occurrence in coastal regions originating from fishing materials and packaging due to their low density polyolefin mp are generally found floating and or in suspension in water rather than in seafloor sediments andrady 2017 the environmental degradation of these polymers occurs mainly through photo oxidation which gives rise to carbonyl carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups in the polymer molecule subsequently chain scissions and consequent reduction in molecular weight occur rabek 1995 the slow degradation of polyolefins makes them brittle up until complete degradation to powder form lambert and wagner 2016 due to the low density of these polymers most of the particles float on the water and are readily carried to the sand by currents once in the soil where the mechanical tensions temperature and photo oxidative conditions are greater these particles undergo accelerated degradation and sometimes return to the waters in comminuted pieces mp and or nanoplastics nps for this reason some researchers have suggested that these polymers can contribute to more severe microplastic pollution of coastal regions song et al 2017 3 4 acrylic fibers acrylic fibers are polyacrylonitrile polymers another plastic material commonly used in textile production acrylic fibers are often applied to winter clothing and home textiles like polyester and polyamide acrylic fibers are common in mp waste one of the principal occurrences of this type of microplastic is in the air whether in indoor environments such as bedrooms and textile industries or the atmosphere of urban environments in manufacturing regions kacprzak and tijing 2022 liu et al 2019a 3 5 polyurethane fibers polyurethane pur is another polymer widely used in textile manufacturing generally applied under the lycra brand synthetic pur filaments are fundamental in fabrics and garments that require high elasticity and nice draping although pur is considered susceptible to microbial attacks hydrolysis and enzymatic cleavages in its ester bonds the appropriate natural conditions for this are limited 4 sources of fibrous microplastics in the textile industry the release of mp into the environment occurs at all stages of a product s life cycle that is during production transport use recycling and disposal boucher and friot 2017 it is estimated that 1 8 to 5 0 million tons of mp per year can reach the environment worldwide of this total up to 48 can reach the oceans according to the international union for conservation of nature iucn 2017 this estimate does not include mp derived from the decomposition of bulk plastic waste at sea thus making the report even more concerning investigating the origins of mp emissions and the paths by which these particles enter environmental compartments are crucial for tracking and understanding their distribution in the biosphere cai et al 2020 vandermeersch et al 2015 the oceans are the largest reservoir of microplastics however the primary sources of these wastes are land activities such as industrial processes agriculture littering and municipal waste landfills cai et al 2020 cleaning natural environments polluted by mp is practically impossible therefore establishing an efficient waste control and management system that monitors the sources of mp emissions is considered an effective pollution mitigation measure based on this perspective there has been a growing interest in mapping sources of mp pollution as a monitoring strategy recent studies indicate that most mp found in marine environments estuaries and other intertidal connections are mainly mfs lourenço et al 2017 mohamed nor and obbard 2014 sadri and thompson 2014 sait et al 2021 given that textile products are composed of fibers and mfs these materials and their manufacturing processes can be considered emission sources of mp deng et al 2020 although textile products release fibers during use and domestic washing any comparison between the content of fmp emitted in industrial effluents versus domestic effluents is challenging as few reports provide such data in the textile industries yarn and fabric ennoblement treatments such as cleaning bleaching dyeing finishing and wet treatments for customization in jeanswear generate large quantities of wastewater loaded with chemical contaminants and solid residues e g fibers and mfs although wastewater treatment plants wwtps can remove most microplastic fibrils from the tailings water and retain them in activated sludge the system is not completely effective freeman et al 2020 mason et al 2016 murphy et al 2016 the mp contained in the sludge still pose a risk of environmental pollution since the sludge can be applied in agricultural fields as a soil amendment and fertilizer bayo et al 2016 sludge can be treated differently between municipal facilities i e non standardization of treatments does not guarantee uniformity in sedimentation and filtration processes carr et al 2016 ziajahromi et al 2017 numerous studies have quantified the number of mfs released from household washes however non standardized methods and metrics have made it difficult to use these data for reliable statistical analysis henry et al 2019 salvador cesa et al 2017 according to de falco et al 2018b five kilograms of polyester fabric can release more than 6 million mfs after a homemade wash browne and co authors observed that a single polyester garment could lose more than 1900 mfs per wash browne et al 2011 hartline et al 2016 studied the weight loss of nylon shell and polyester fleece from jackets or sweaters following domestic washing they reported between 0 and 2 g of weight loss compared to the unwashed garment fabric structure influences the extent of release of mfs during washing as reported by carney almroth et al 2018 napper and thompson 2016 reported that a hybrid household wash of synthetic and natural textiles could on average release about 140 000 to 170 000 fibers for every 6 kg of product washed hernandez et al 2017 showed that polyester fabrics lost 75 more fibers when washed with detergent liquid or powder than without detergent according to the authors the same behavior can be observed for polypropylene fabrics other studies have evaluated washing machine models system temperature and the use of fabric softeners among other parameters although there are no absolute values on the release of fmp from textiles many factors clearly the release of mfs in textile washing kawecki and nowack 2019 fig 3 shows fmp released from washing textile products mp can also be released into the atmosphere closed weaving spinning and confection environments are places where floating fibrils are common due to the high speeds of textile machines the fibers produced are always accompanied by finer fibrous dust that is easy to inhale sometimes the floating fibrils are captured by exhaust systems and released to the external environment prata 2018 secondary mp are released from textiles exposed to the weather in locations where they are applied or discarded such emissions occur from the use of fishing and aquaculture equipment sanitary products geotextiles and agro textiles according to andrady 2011 almost all fishing activities use synthetic materials based on nylon and polyolefin lines threads and nets it is estimated that since the 1980s more than 18 000 such objects have been removed from marine fishing environments concerning sanitary products the disposal of non woven textile products present in wet wipes diapers and cleaning flannels among others results in mf release to water le hyaric et al 2009 reported that about 70 of objects trapped in sewage filters in a french city were synthetic textiles for sanitary use the extent of sewage treatment in europe is not equivalent in most countries such as brazil which is a populous country where less than 50 of its sewage is treated ministério do desenvolvimento regional 2020 5 occurrence of fibrous microplastics in different ecosystems during the coronavirus pandemic the extensive use of masks and personal protective equipment ppe has triggered an increase in fmp pollution de sousa 2021 ray et al 2022 unfortunately the single use products decontamination ppe and masks is not feasible since most of these materials are based on nonwovens which are structures of low mechanical and washing resistance therefore they deform easily not allowing safe reuse in addition the high cost of disinfection can make those products commercially disadvantageous disposable textile materials became quite evident during the pandemic and caused concern for environmental agencies revising the estimate that in 2030 the amount of plastic waste in the world would double de oliveira et al 2021b unfortunately following the coronavirus pandemic the estimated doubling of plastic waste in nature will occur before 2030 pollution of different ecosystems by fmp is evident in recent publications investigation of fmp in marine ecosystems is most prevalent due to irreversible consequences to aquatic organisms nakao et al 2021 the aquatic ecosystem receives fmp from all environments terrestrial and atmospheric chaudhry and sachdeva 2021 rain wind and inadequate disposal near shorelines of rivers seas lakes contribute to the deposition of fmp in aquatic ecosystems de sousa 2021 the use of polymeric materials in agriculture fishing nets and the dearth of processes for treating these pollutants result in the increase of fmp in marines ecosystem and the soil li et al 2016 the presence of fmp in the marine environment result in diverse effects 1 fmp can cause entanglement of organisms 2 deposition on the seafloor and 3 be a proliferator of non native and in some cases pathogenic microorganisms to other locations chaudhry and sachdeva 2021 li et al 2016 the principal cause of entanglement in the aquatic environment is retention by abandoned fishing nets li et al 2016 fmp deposition on the seafloor limits gaseous transfers cole et al 2011 algae microorganisms and non native invertebrate proliferation in a given location may be a consequence of the transmission of these organisms by fmp since ocean currents and winds can carry fmp over long distances in addition marine animals can be a vehicle for non native species by ingesting or aggregating these pollutants in their bodies salvador cesa et al 2017 zettler et al 2013 ingestion of fmp by organisms is due to visual confusion with food sources ingestion of fmp by marine animals can cause numerous irreversible problems such as 1 reduced reproduction capacity 2 poor digestion including blockage 3 damage to the immune system 4 low fitness and 5 problems in the absorption of nutrients carbery et al 2018 unfortunately fmp presence in aquatic organisms is recurrent due to the enormous input of these pollutants into water synthetic microfibers such as pet pa and acrylonitrile were found in wild populations of crabs carcinus aestuarii piarulli et al 2019 fig 4 shows synthetic fibers extracted from the crab gastrointestinal tract ps ingestion translocation and accumulation by mussels mytilus edulis have been investigated browne et al 2008 mp ingested by mussels accumulated in the intestine from which they were transferred to the circulatory system within three days furthermore the mp remained within the mussels for more than 48 days browne and coworkers concluded that particles of smaller size were more abundant than larger particles which increased the potential for accumulation in mussel tissues fish are widely reported in the literature as regarding fmp consumption rochman et al 2015 the presence of fmp pa pan pe and pet in the digestive tract of fish platichthys flesus and osmerus eperlanus was reported mcgoran et al 2017 platichthys flesus 75 had more plastic fibers in the intestine than osmerus eperlanus 20 benthic fish species acanthopagrus australis mugil cephalus and gerres subfasciatus were also used to quantify ingested debris synthetic and natural fibers polymers fragments halstead et al 2018 debris quantification showed the presence of fibers in most of the analyzed materials 83 prevalent fibers were acrylic polyester and rayon a semi synthetic fiber however the number of natural fibers found was of concern as these materials cause damage to marine organisms upon ingestion polypropylene fiber intake effects on langoustine growth and nutrition were evaluated for eight months welden and cowie 2016 reduction of body mass blood proteins and stored lipids were some of the harmful effects observed zooplankton species can also ingest fibers and mp detritus which is a critical concern since they are at a lower trophic level in the food chain desforges et al 2015 the consumption of these organisms by others at higher trophic levels requires attention to long term adverse effects numerous studies are currently investigating the presence of mp in seafood carbery et al 2018 plastic debris and textile fibers have been found in fish and shellfish marketed for human consumption rochman et al 2015 however health hazards from the ingestion of mp contaminated aquatic animals by humans have not been adequately investigated in the terrestrial environment mp from textile washing make up a significant portion of mp contaminants in the soil salvador cesa et al 2017 it is reported that mp in agricultural land exceed the total accumulated load of mp on the ocean surface nizzetto et al 2016 exposure of animals fundamental for soil maintenance to plastic microfibers can cause an ecosystem imbalance earthworms lumbricus terrestris exposure to polyester microfibers for 35 days demonstrated transcriptional responses related to the general stress and evidence of change in casting behavior prendergast miller et al 2019 a system based on earthworm aporrectodea rosea and ryegrass lolium perenne was proposed to evaluate the effects caused by the presence of plastic biodegradable polylactic acid conventional high density polyethylene hdpe and fmp on clothing on soil animals and plants boots et al 2019 the presence of plastic debris caused a reduced ryegrass seed germination percentage which was even lower when fibers were present earthworm biomass in soil was significantly reduced in the presence of contaminants causing problems to the digestive tract the results showed that mp also influence soil ph and macroaggregate stability and formation in addition mp may interfere with soil microbiota which is essential for plant development furthermore fmp application in agriculture i e encapsulated fertilizers and pesticides raises questions about harmful effects on humans as fmp accumulate in plant tissues azeem et al 2021 khalid et al 2020 li et al 2020 yin et al 2021 ingestion of contaminated plants by humans can cause serious health problems triggering the appearance of diseases in the future carbery et al 2018 the coronavirus pandemic has caused an increase of fmp in nature especially in the air de la torre et al 2022 li et al 2022 mohana et al 2023 the occurrence of fmp in air can trigger a series of respiratory problems and diseases related to inhalation particularly in susceptible individuals masud et al 2023 shi et al 2022 it is estimated that human lungs can be exposed to a range of 26 to 130 airborne microplastic particles per day prata 2018 fmp inhalation can in addition to causing diseases interact with other pollutants in the air and cause more severe damage to the individual piarulli et al 2019 if fmp inhalation occurs this debris can be challenging to remove from the respiratory system due to its morphology structure cox et al 2019 currently there is little research related to the impacts and occurrence of fmp in air however the daily use of masks has generated discussions about inhalation and fmp dissemination in the atmosphere thus evaluating the consequences of fmp exposure in outdoor and indoor environments with and without circulation the fmp release rate from textile products and the influence of morphology and composition on inhalation of synthetic fibers has been a hot topic in research in general the presence of microplastics in the environment triggers numerous harmful impacts such as 1 interactions with other persistent pollutants that can harm the maintenance and diversity of soil microbiota 2 changes in water retention capacity and soil structure 3 decreased photosynthesis efficiency and consequently plant growth 4 impact on nutrient bioavailability 5 influence on biogeochemical cycles liu et al 2017 xiang et al 2022 wan et al 2019 analyzed the effects of mp from plastic films of different sizes at relevant environmental concentrations on water evaporation and desiccation cracking in two clayey soils the presence of mp mixed with soil significantly increased the evaporation rate of water from the soil creating channels for water movement the effect was more pronounced in soils treated with 2 mm plastics than 5 and 10 mm plastics desiccation cracking was observed on the soil surface treated with 5 and 10 mm plastics therefore mp contamination in the environment can alter the water cycle in soils aggravating water scarcity zhang et al 2017 investigated the toxic effects of microplastics on the marine microalgae skeletonema costatum using a growth inhibition test the inhibition of microalgae growth was noticeable in the presence of microplastic mpvc average diameter 1 μm the maximum growth inhibition rate was 39 7 after 96 h of exposure a high concentration 50 mg l 1 of mpvc had adverse effects on microalgae photosynthesis as chlorophyll content and photosynthetic efficiency decreased ingestion of microplastics by organisms can promote oxidative stress and increase neurotoxicity also the ingestion of plastic by animals at lower trophic levels can trigger an imbalance in fauna and consequently in the quality of human food desforges et al 2015 therefore the presence of microplastics in nature is associated with several adverse effects elucidation of all impacts on ecological health is still preliminary and requires more in depth studies to unravel the short and long term consequences to ecosystems 6 remediation strategies for fibrous microplastics environmental contamination by fmp is an emerging threat to biodiversity and the ecosystem s balance li et al 2016 wang et al 2020b fmp remediation must be implemented in water and soil worldwide however existing remediation strategies need improvement these processes must be investigated more carefully regarding their effectiveness in treating fmp although bio technological approaches present excellent results in controlled environments patrício silva 2021 these technologies must be applied to actual industrial and water treatment plants there are numerous approaches to removing mitigating and degrading mp the main processes are filtration electro coagulation microbial degradation magnetic extraction membrane separation photocatalysis and enzyme based degradation wang et al 2020a which are discussed in the following sections 6 1 physical techniques periyasamy and tehrani bagha 2022 report that mechanical finishing such as calendaring shearing sueding and singeing can temporarily help to reduce the release of fibrils from fabrics the calendaring process compacts the fabrics by passing them between two rollers with pressure temperature and time control the result of calendaring is a more compact shiny fabric structure with tighter pores which theoretically reduces the mobility of the surface fibers reducing their early detachment the shearing process consists of deliberately lifting the fibrils from the surface of the fabrics then cutting the fibers close to the surface first the fabric generally woven fabrics is passed through a brushing roller that lifts the mfs then the material passes through rollers containing blades millimetrically positioned on the surface of the fabric to perform the cut the effect of this finishing makes the fabric feel better prevents the appearance of pilling and consequently can reduce the release of fibrils the sueding process aims to make the fabric feel smoother and more pleasant industrially the fabric is passed between rotating rollers coated with abrasive sandpaper the controlled abrasion of the sandpaper on the fabric surface depending on the contact pressure can remove the fibrils giving a softer touch and consequently delaying the release of fibrils from the structure singeing is a process that aims to remove the surface fibers of fabrics with fire in this process woven is exposed to direct flames or heated plates the result is a glossy material with a pleasant touch and no mfs periyasamy and tehrani bagha 2022 however all physical methods of removing fibrils during the manufacturing process are temporary and these finishes only withstand a few washes cai et al 2020 hossain et al 2021 therefore physical finishing methods for fabrics and yarns do not guarantee a substantial reduction in the release of fmp it is known that mfs released from textiles undergo progressive degradation in nature that leads these materials to smaller particle sizes which are mp and or nps with this physical techniques for the removal of mp in effluents are more effective techniques when it comes to the treatment of domestic and industrial wastewater in this context the same techniques that are used for removing mp in general can also be adapted for removing fmp yang and coworkers evaluated the treatment process at a water recovery plant in china for the removal efficiency of mp yang et al 2019 approximately 12 03 items per liter of mp were detected in the tributary after treatment microplastic concentrations were reduced by more than 95 and 0 59 items per liter of mp were detected in reclaimed water eighteen types of polymers of ten colors were identified among these particles pet ps and pp corresponded to more than 70 of the mp detected furthermore fmp were the dominant form detected with an average size of 1110 72 μm gies and coworkers evaluated the percentage of mp retention in a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp in canada gies et al 2018 about 1 76 trillion 1 28 trillion 0 36 trillion and 0 03 trillion mp enter the treatment plant annually deposit in the primary sludge in the secondary sludge and are released into the receiving environment respectively that is the retention of mp in the wwtp can reach approximately 99 zhang et al 2021a 2021b evaluated concentration variation and mp removal performance in a leachate treatment system with pretreatment biotreatment and advanced treatment approximately 58 33 of mp were removed during the leachate treatment process ultrafiltration showed the highest efficiency in removing mp the removal performance of fmp in the treatment was determined by particle properties size shape polymer type liu et al 2019a 2019b investigated the transport and fate of mp at a municipal wastewater treatment plant in china based on the conventional activated sludge process the unit was the number of mp per litter n l 1 the abundance of mp in the effluent decreased from 79 9 n l 1 to 28 4 n l 1 with a removal percentage of 64 4 the removed microplastics were transferred and stored mainly in the sludge furthermore the mp in the sludge after the dehydration process had an average size of 222 6 μm fibers and fragments were the primary particles found in the effluent samples tang and coworkers proposed the application of magnetic carbon nanotubes m cnts to remove mp from aqueous systems tang et al 2021 m cnts were effectively adsorbed onto pe pet and pa moreover magnetic biochar with porosity and graphitization pgmb was fabricated to remove metals from mp ye et al 2020 6 2 chemical techniques textile processes also offer the alternative of chemical finishes to reduce or delay the shedding of microfibers from substrates however the available treatments are based on encapsulating the yarns in the fabrics by covering the textile structures with resins and polymers although these treatments are more effective and some are permanent compared to physical finishes zambrano et al 2021 most treatments only withstand a few wash cycles and can alter the feel hydrophilicity color smell and draping of fabrics available finishes are based on a series of chemical products which include coatings with silicone resins polymethylmethacrylate pmma and pur among others which can reduce the release of fibrils fmp studies have shown that acrylic resins exhibit good resistance to pilling in virtually all types of fibrous composition pet pp pe pas pan and all types of fabric maior et al 2008 periyasamy and tehrani bagha 2022 the coating of textiles with these polymers promotes the film formation on the substrate s surface protecting it from the effects of abrasion zambrano et al 2021 some studies have investigated the attenuating effect of these finishes on the release of mfs de falco et al 2019 de falco et al 2018a maior et al 2008 however studies are scarce and there is no measure of the durability of finishes in some cases the detachment of mfs containing adhered resins is observed which can further aggravate pollution by fmp fmp undergo environmental weathering processes when exposed to sunlight mechanical degradation hydrolysis etc sait et al 2021 however the degradation process changes when fmp contain additional chemical substances for example fmp pet pa and pan were exposed to uv light in fresh and seawater for ten months pet and pa showed significant fragmentation and surface changes after exposure and pa exhibited chemical changes however pan did not undergo photodegradation sait et al 2021 in terms of removing fmp from domestic and industrial wastewater there are some alternative chemical treatments used for mp removal that can be adapted for the textile industry effective processes at drinking water treatment plants are essential to provide quality potable water different processes for removal of mp were evaluated in an advanced drinking water treatment plant adwtp removal efficiency via conventional treatment processes coagulation flocculation sedimentation and sand filtration was about 58 9 70 5 coagulation sedimentation steps predominate in mp removal primarily as fibers ozonation integrated with granular activated carbon gac filtration increased about 17 2 22 2 wang et al 2020b zhou et al 2022b studied the photocatalytic degradation of pet fiber based microplastics pet fmp using a heterogeneous catalyst based on srilankite tio2 crystalline transition phase combined with bi2o3 bismuth oxide they synthesized the z scheme bi2o3 n tio2 heterojunction by solvothermal reaction followed by calcination in the study a medium containing pet fmp and bi2o3 n tio2 was exposed to specific uv radiation for 48 h under different ph conditions the authors reported that the best results were observed at alkaline ph ph 9 since the alkaline condition is naturally hydrolytic for pet therefore polymeric degradation can be accelerated by the presence of bi2o3 n tio2 in the medium achieving satisfactory results in the removal of mfs in another study zhou et al 2022a investigated the photodegradation of pet fmp from the exposure of a medium containing pt nanoparticles decorated n doped tio2 nanoflowers which the authors present as pt n tio2 before radiation exposure the method emphasizes the importance of a hydrothermal pre treatment 180 c 12 h of pet fmp to initiate surface degradation points that originate a morphology with a rough appearance after radiation exposure the authors report a loss of up to 29 in mass which is about 8 times greater than the degraded mass of pet fmp without pre treatment removal of mp ps and pe using coagulation by polyaluminium chloride pac and ferric chloride was investigated zhou et al 2021 mp removal efficiency using pac was better than that for ferric chloride furthermore in the coagulation process hydrolysis products played a fundamental role mp removal efficiency under alkaline conditions was higher than under acidic conditions also stirring speed improved removal efficiency mp interactions with pollutants present in the environment are another crucial factor remediation processes can have negative consequences if mfs are bound with certain debris generating new compounds that are more harmful to living organisms ariza tarazona and coworkers reported the photocatalysis application to degrade hdpe microplastics extracted from a facial scrub ariza tarazona et al 2019 photocatalysis was mediated using two n tio2 based semiconductors obtained via different synthesis methods the first semiconductor was obtained by a green process from the extrapallial fluid of fresh blue mussels which demonstrated excellent capacity for photocatalytic degradation in solid and aqueous environments the second photocatalyst was obtained from a conventional sol gel synthesis and showed good removal efficiency in aqueous media sturm and coworkers reported using alkyltrichlorosilanes with different linear and branched alkyl groups for the attachment of mp pe and pp mixtures and the formation of larger agglomerates sturm et al 2020 the presence of alkyl groups had a substantial impact on the agglomeration process the compounds considered most suitable for removal of mp were substances that had between 3 and 5 carbon atoms in the chain 6 3 biological techniques fmp degradation via microorganisms is a topic of current interest ru et al 2020 bacterial and fungal strains are potentially valuable for polymer degradation enzyme catalyzed hydrolysis is another promising strategy candida antarctica and humicola insolens exhibited synergy in pet hydrolysis carniel et al 2017 alkalophilic strains agromyces sp and kocuria sp isolated from a nylon 6 factory effluent and activated sludge showed the ability to degrade nylon oligomers yasuhira et al 2007 liu and coworkers evaluated the performance of a pilot scale biofilter to polish effluent from a wwtp in denmark liu et al 2020 before biofilter step effluent contained 917 items m 3 which corresponded to a mass concentration of 24 8 μg m 3 following the biofilter the effluent concentration decreased to average values of 197 items m 3 and 2 8 μg m 3 indicating an overall removal efficiency of 79 and 89 for the number and mass of particles respectively arossa and coworkers investigated the removal of mp by red sea giant clam tridacna maxima arossa et al 2019 experiments revealed that the clams actively absorbed mp from water in which the average number retained within the animal was about 7 55 particles individual 1 day 1 in addition clam shells contributed to removal of plastic particles from water 66 03 chen and coworkers proposed the hyperthermophilic composting technology for in situ biodegradation of sludge based microplastics chen et al 2020 after 45 days of treatment 43 7 of the microplastics were removed from the sludge thermus bacillus and geobacillus were the dominant bacteria responsible for biodegradation during hyperthermophilic composting auta and coworkers isolated eight bacterial strains from mangrove sediment in peninsular malaysia to mitigate the environmental impact of microplastics auta et al 2017 bacterial isolates were selected for their potential to degrade uv treated pe pet pp and ps microplastics bacillus cereus and b gottheilii were the only bacteria that grew on synthetic media containing different microplastic polymers sole carbon source the percentages of weight loss of microplastic particles by b cereus after 40 days were 1 6 6 6 and 7 4 for pe pet and ps respectively bacillus gottheilii recorded weight loss percentages of 6 2 3 0 3 6 and 5 8 for pe pet pp and ps respectively numerous technologies confront difficulties removing small fmp patrício silva 2021 more clean technological alternatives are being studied for application in industrial plants i e membrane bioreactors wang et al 2022 electrochemical techniques dynamic membranes advanced oxidation processes and photocatalysis are also promising alternatives for fmp removal or degradation sait et al 2021 wang et al 2020b horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands cws are another large scale alternative in the fmp removal wang et al 2020a wang and coworkers evaluated removal efficiency using cws the mp removal efficiency was 88 fmp pollution of water and soil deserves attention by scientists and environmental engineers remediation strategies are required in all production processes to remove or reduce fmp generation although processes are available for fmp degradation or removal more effective technologies are needed table 1 shows some techniques applied in the remediation of microplastics from the environment unfortunately there is no technology which effectively removes all fmp in all situations a combination of techniques can offer a high performance return promoting awareness for reducing fmp production is an essential complement to remediation formulation of public policies that address fmp and their reduction can increase sustainable commitment 7 challenges and recommendations for future research fmp have emerged as pollutants in nature the gaps inherent in fibrous microplastics topics are numerous especially concerning the study of remediation techniques as the experimental conditions are quite different from the real environments anthropogenic activities are mainly responsible for fmp release fmp originate from textile products such as synthetic fibers e g pet de oliveira et al 2021b the coronavirus pandemic has significantly contributed to increases in fmp release via use of masks and ppe de sousa 2021 friction washing and improper disposal result in fmp release to the environment fmp transformations in different ecosystems and remediation technologies applied during industrial processes are relevant current topics recent investigations show advances in this area e g fmp degradation via microorganisms heterogeneous photocatalysis fenton reaction etc ye et al 2020 however there are still several limitations that deserve attention 1 optimization of fmp characterization and quantification techniques in different environments terrestrial aquatic atmospheric etc 2 expand experimental activities on long term exposure of organisms to fmp and visualize the effects caused also investigate fmp retention time in organisms 3 determine environmental risks that fmp present 4 evaluate the anthropogenic activities that discharge fmp into the environment 5 investigate the interactions between fmp and various environmental contaminants 6 biomarkers development 7 analyze the fmp lifecycle 8 novel fmp with sustainable characteristics i e readily degraded 9 assess combinations of remediation techniques to increase the fmp removal and degradation efficiency 10 invest in the development of viable and low cost biotechnological processes for fmp degradation 8 final considerations anthropogenic activities are the principal cause of fmp contamination in the environment growing demand for textiles and synthetic fibers results in increased volumes of fmp in all environmental compartments thus monitoring the impact of fmp on the environment must be emphasized risk management i e origin destination and possible complications to organisms and the environment must be conducted systematically industry specifically textile corporations must play a fundamental role in limiting fmp emissions corporations must abide by environmental legislation and environmental standards should prioritize the proper removal and or destruction of fmp public policy application and investment in appropriate technologies are essential to promote sustainability and effectively

1184,microplastics mp i e particles measuring less than 5 mm in size are considered emerging pollutants the ubiquity of mp is causing great concern among environmental and public health agencies anthropogenic activities are responsible for the extensive dispersal of mp in nature adverse effects on living organisms interactions with other contaminants occurring in the environment and the lack of effective degradation removal techniques are significant issues related to mp most mp found in nature are fibrous fmp fmp originate from textile products mainly synthetic fibers e g polyester synthetic fibers are intensively used to produce countless goods due to beneficial characteristics such as high mechanical resistance and economic feasibility fmp are ubiquitous on the planet and impart lasting adverse effects on biodiversity data on the consequences of long term exposure to these pollutants are scarce in the literature in addition few studies address the main types of synthetic microfibers released from textiles their occurrence adverse effects on organisms and remediation strategies this review discusses the relevant topics about fmp and alerts the dangers to the planet furthermore future perspectives and technological highlights for the fmp mitigation degradation are presented graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microplastics environment pollution textile fibers microplastic pollution textile industry data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction plastics are synthetic polymeric materials having high molar mass since their emergence in the early 20th century their versatility superior performance and low production costs have contributed to their continued growth and broad adoption andrady and neal 2009 barrows et al 2018 salvador cesa et al 2017 these materials are applied in many segments of modern society including domestic mobility textile biomedical agricultural and others andrady and neal 2009 among the main commercial applications is the production of staple fibers and microfilaments for manufacturing textile yarns which are then used in knitting fabrics woven fabrics household items garments or technical textiles applications e g automotive airbags bullet proof vest diapers artificial turf vehicle seat belts artificial implants tyre cords and others deng et al 2020 sait et al 2021 salvador cesa et al 2017 during the processing of synthetic fibers humans determine fibers fineness and length based on the characteristics and mechanical properties that the finished product needs to present varshney et al 2011 for these individual fibers to present suitable characteristics for the spinning process their thickness must be of micrometric dimensions fiori and brown 1951 neckář and vyšanská 2012 the textile spinning process consists of manufacturing yarns for weaving and sewing threads both yarns and threads need to be resistant flexible thin structures and at the same time present adequate elongation resilience and elasticity to be intertwined or sewn to make these characteristics possible fibers natural or manufactured due to their high fineness micrometric are the most suitable materials for clustering twisting and forming yarns and threads in this form the resulting yarn will be malleable pleasing to the touch and consequently suitable for application in the manufacture of delicate and flexible fabrics with nice draping neckář and vyšanská 2012 varshney et al 2011 conventional textile fibers for clothing have a diameter between 7 and 20 μm and in certain cases can reach up to 70 μm for heavy duty applications such as carpets milwich 2010 the fashion and clothing industry arouse great interest in increasingly fine fibers and yarns because fineness is a characteristic that is directly related to the quality of fabrics such as wearability visual appearance physical comfort and proper handling de oliveira et al 2021b fiori and brown 1951 neckář and vyšanská 2012 varshney et al 2011 to meet this demand the synthetic yarn industry has enabled the production of increasingly fine fibers and filaments reaching diameters as small as 5 μm and termed microfibers mfs milwich 2010 synthetic filaments as fine as those used in the textile industry mainly in the form of staple fibers are continuously released from textile products e g yarns fabrics nonwovens whenever they are subjected to mechanical forces such as when they are washed kawecki and nowack 2019 zhang et al 2021a for these reasons it is common to detect fibrous residues in industrial discharges from industrial laundries dyeing processes finishing and domestic washing cai et al 2020 deng et al 2020 although wastewater is the principal source of fibrous microplastics fmp deng et al 2020 their occurrence is also common in soil zhang and liu 2018 and the atmosphere batool et al 2022 in those cases fmp originate from spinning process residues clothing residues weaving dust prata 2018 weathering and fragmentation of geotextiles and agro textiles bai et al 2022 zhang and liu 2018 land disposal of household textiles or improper disposal detachment of synthetic mfs from textile structures results gives rise to free microplastics mp de oliveira et al 2021b in this context numerous studies have reported how mp can endanger the lives of humans and threaten ecosystems due to their occurrence in the atmosphere soil and water senathirajah et al 2021 mp in water bodies for example are ingested by animals which in turn end up in the human body via the food chain carbery et al 2018 many laboratory analyses have reported the occurrence of mp in natural and commercial foods and beverages senathirajah et al 2021 mp have also been detected from autopsies and in human waste one of the most critical factors regarding the persistence of mp in the environment is their high resistance to degradation this characteristic combined with the mismanagement of plastic waste favors the accumulation of mp in the environment barrows et al 2018 furthermore mp may have some adsorption capacity and serve as a support for pollutants present in the environment fred ahmadu et al 2020 numerous researchers have reported the appearance of mp containing toxic chemicals and microbiological agents capable of causing illness and even death of organisms fred ahmadu et al 2020 senathirajah et al 2021 mp are often recognized as a cocktail of contaminants due to their combination with pesticides pharmaceuticals heavy metals and other emerging pollutants in water soil and air fred ahmadu et al 2020 júnior et al 2022 in a study by senathirajah et al 2021 based on data extraction from fifty nine publications the average mass of mp particles between 0 and 1 mm was estimated subsequently considering various exposure routes the authors derived the global average rate of microplastic ingestion they showed that humans ingest an average of 0 1 to 5 g of mp weekly equivalent to 11 845 to 193 200 mp per year with drinking water being the most significant source regarding hazards of mfs derived from textiles there is an aggravating factor the functionalization of textile products with chemical additives some additives can exacerbate the damage to organisms via ingestion and or hinder the degradation of mp in the environment de oliveira et al 2021b sait et al 2021 textile products commonly contain many additives which are incorporated during manufacture such as lubricants flame retardants antimicrobial products halogenated compounds plasticizing agents formaldehyde based substances synthetic dyes and pigments and stabilizers among others de oliveira et al 2021b de oliveira et al 2021a immich et al 2021 zambrano et al 2021 analyzed the biodegradation of cotton fibers treated with different additives present in textile sludge for 102 days they reported that untreated fibers showed 70 degradation while fibers containing fabric softener degraded much faster around 90 and fibers with a durable press finishing degraded at about 63 lykaki et al 2021 observed a substantial reduction in the biodegradation of viscose fibers treated with antimicrobial products the authors reported a 10 degradation for fibers with antimicrobial treatment compared to 70 degradation for untreated fibers kept in biological sludge for 60 days according to the synthetic fiber market size share trends analysis report the global synthetic fibers market was valued at us 59 95 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compound annual rate cagr of 6 6 between 2021 and 2028 according to the report the polyester textile fiber segment led the market in 2020 accounting for more than 48 of the global revenue of synthetic fiber producers the segment is estimated to expand even faster from 2021 to 2028 due to the growing demand for polyesters the growth trends of the synthetic polymers segment have aroused concern regarding the imminent accumulation of mp in the environment for these reasons numerous research groups have sought to study the dynamics and impacts of mp in different ecosystems and outline strategies for remediation and mitigation of the release of these wastes into the environment currently literature reviews offer broad approaches regarding the release of mp into the environment in this review the main objective was to address the release of fmp specifically from textile processes and products this review opens with current data and concepts on plastics and microplastics next the release of fmp originating from textile products and processes is highlighted in addition the review discusses the main emission sites of synthetic textile mfs their occurrence in different ecosystems impacts remediation techniques research gaps and future perspectives 2 plastics and microplastics plastic is a macromolecular material of high molar weight resulting from polymerization reactions of organic monomers almost always derived from by products of the petrochemical industry due to their unique characteristics and properties these materials have become irreplaceable in many applications in modern society andrady and neal 2009 however plastics are sometimes managed irresponsibly according to barrows et al 2018 estimates of plastic waste generation are still often based on mesoplastics 5 mm to 2 5 cm and macroplastics 2 5 cm to 1 m because of their ease of detection larger particles are visible to the naked eye and cause a greater sense of urgency and discomfort however when discarded in the environment plastics are subject to natural weathering including the effects of rain solar radiation and microorganisms that promote a series of attacks on the microstructure of these materials singh and sharma 2008 from this point plastics break down into small pieces that progressively comminute creating an emerging and significant environmental problem de oliveira et al 2021b deng et al 2020 although there is no consensus on a minimum acceptable size for a plastic to be considered a microplastic such particles are mentioned in the literature as measuring between 0 1 and 5000 μm in size hartmann et al 2019 thompson et al 2004 since 1970 with the first report on the detection of plastics in the atlantic ocean carpenter and smith 1972 the occurrence of plastics in different ecosystems has been widely documented according to geyer et al 2017 from the 1950s to mid 2017 it is estimated that 8 3 billion tons of plastics were produced according to plastics the facts plasticseurope 2019 368 million tons of plastic were produced in 2019 also according to the report the production of specific polymer types worldwide was estimated at 29 8 polyethylene pe 19 4 polypropylene pp 10 polyvinyl chloride pvc 7 9 polyurethane pur 7 9 polyethylene terephthalate pet 6 2 polystyrene ps and 18 8 other plastics according to barrows et al 2018 more than 9 million tons of textile fibers are produced annually with about 60 of this volume being synthetic mfs of which polyester pet nylon polyamide pa and acrylic polyacrylonitrile pan are the principal fibers applied mp can be classified as primary or secondary primary mp are those already manufactured in dimensions smaller than 5 mm while secondary mp are plastics with less than 5 mm derived from the fragmentation of a larger plastic piece due to degradation processes cole et al 2011 primary mp are in the market not only as fibers but also as microparticles microcapsules microspheres and nanocrystals these particles are applied to products with a technological appeal such as personal hygiene products already banned in europe and america boucher and friot 2017 however it is estimated that 91 of the mp in marine environments are mfs sait et al 2021 in this case the fibers originate from industrial textile waste domestic wash water synthetic fishing nets and mooring ropes from marine platforms among others sait et al 2021 mp are transported in the environment in different ways in many cases their dispersal in nature is quite rapid and extensive reaching even remote glacial areas obbard 2018 fig 1 outlines how plastics and microplastics are dispersed in the environment following their release or disposal 3 fibrous microplastics originating from textiles the diversity of fibrous materials makes it challenging to measure mfs emitted by the industry especially from companies that manufacture different products fibers in the textile industry can be classified as natural or manufactured fibers natural fibers can be of plant origin e g cotton or animal origin e g wool and present a low risk of pollution regarding manufactured fibers there is diversity regarding the monomer used and its origin viscose or lyocell as well as other fibers obtained from regenerated natural polymers cannot be considered fmp therefore only synthetic fibers are considered mp pollutants fig 2 illustrates the molecular structures of the main synthetic polymers used in the manufacture of textile mfs this section presents the principal polluting synthetic fibers from the textile industry 3 1 polyester fibers polyesters are synthetic polymers widely used in the manufacture of textile products for example applications in clothing home textiles and technical textiles the polyesters most used in textile production are semi aromatic for example pet polyethylene terephthalate these polymers are more persistent in the environment when discarded due to their low biodegradability the high strength of polyesters is due to the low flexibility of the chain high crystallinity rigidity and stability provided by the aromatic rings tokiwa et al 2009 under specific conditions pet can be biodegraded for example in the presence of the bacterium ideonella sakaiensis shosuke et al 2016 however it should be noted that the presence of such microorganisms in nature is unusual based on this it concluded that the biodegradation of pet in nature is quite limited therefore it is expected that most of these plastics when discarded persist for long periods in the environment as polyesters are the most used polymers in textile production attempts to make possible the use of aliphatic polyesters in manufacturing fibers and yarns is valid as they are a biodegradable synthetic alternative among the polyesters with this potential are pla polylactic acid phb polyhydroxybutyrate ppl poly l lysine pcl polycaprolactone pbs polybutylene succinate pes polyethylene succinate pva polyvinyl alcohol and peg polyethylene glycol tokiwa et al 2009 wilkes and aristilde 2017 under certain conditions all these polyesters can be hydrolyzed and digested by certain enzymes capable of cleaving ester bonds and hydroxyl clusters wilkes and aristilde 2017 3 2 polyamide fibers polyamides pas are another important class of polymers in the textile industry in the form of mfs pas are widely used in blends with natural protein fibers or with cotton generally for clothing applications especially underwear and swimwear although the amide bonds in the structure make these polymers more susceptible to hydrolysis gewert et al 2015 their biodegradation remains slow depending on the type of nylon and environmental conditions hashimoto et al 2002 and yamano et al 2019 observed that nylon 4 is more biodegradable in soils and oceans 70 mass loss in 6 weeks when compared to nylon 6 one of the most used in manufacture of textile mfs 3 3 polyolefin fibers microplastics from polluting polymers such as polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp have the highest occurrence in coastal regions originating from fishing materials and packaging due to their low density polyolefin mp are generally found floating and or in suspension in water rather than in seafloor sediments andrady 2017 the environmental degradation of these polymers occurs mainly through photo oxidation which gives rise to carbonyl carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups in the polymer molecule subsequently chain scissions and consequent reduction in molecular weight occur rabek 1995 the slow degradation of polyolefins makes them brittle up until complete degradation to powder form lambert and wagner 2016 due to the low density of these polymers most of the particles float on the water and are readily carried to the sand by currents once in the soil where the mechanical tensions temperature and photo oxidative conditions are greater these particles undergo accelerated degradation and sometimes return to the waters in comminuted pieces mp and or nanoplastics nps for this reason some researchers have suggested that these polymers can contribute to more severe microplastic pollution of coastal regions song et al 2017 3 4 acrylic fibers acrylic fibers are polyacrylonitrile polymers another plastic material commonly used in textile production acrylic fibers are often applied to winter clothing and home textiles like polyester and polyamide acrylic fibers are common in mp waste one of the principal occurrences of this type of microplastic is in the air whether in indoor environments such as bedrooms and textile industries or the atmosphere of urban environments in manufacturing regions kacprzak and tijing 2022 liu et al 2019a 3 5 polyurethane fibers polyurethane pur is another polymer widely used in textile manufacturing generally applied under the lycra brand synthetic pur filaments are fundamental in fabrics and garments that require high elasticity and nice draping although pur is considered susceptible to microbial attacks hydrolysis and enzymatic cleavages in its ester bonds the appropriate natural conditions for this are limited 4 sources of fibrous microplastics in the textile industry the release of mp into the environment occurs at all stages of a product s life cycle that is during production transport use recycling and disposal boucher and friot 2017 it is estimated that 1 8 to 5 0 million tons of mp per year can reach the environment worldwide of this total up to 48 can reach the oceans according to the international union for conservation of nature iucn 2017 this estimate does not include mp derived from the decomposition of bulk plastic waste at sea thus making the report even more concerning investigating the origins of mp emissions and the paths by which these particles enter environmental compartments are crucial for tracking and understanding their distribution in the biosphere cai et al 2020 vandermeersch et al 2015 the oceans are the largest reservoir of microplastics however the primary sources of these wastes are land activities such as industrial processes agriculture littering and municipal waste landfills cai et al 2020 cleaning natural environments polluted by mp is practically impossible therefore establishing an efficient waste control and management system that monitors the sources of mp emissions is considered an effective pollution mitigation measure based on this perspective there has been a growing interest in mapping sources of mp pollution as a monitoring strategy recent studies indicate that most mp found in marine environments estuaries and other intertidal connections are mainly mfs lourenço et al 2017 mohamed nor and obbard 2014 sadri and thompson 2014 sait et al 2021 given that textile products are composed of fibers and mfs these materials and their manufacturing processes can be considered emission sources of mp deng et al 2020 although textile products release fibers during use and domestic washing any comparison between the content of fmp emitted in industrial effluents versus domestic effluents is challenging as few reports provide such data in the textile industries yarn and fabric ennoblement treatments such as cleaning bleaching dyeing finishing and wet treatments for customization in jeanswear generate large quantities of wastewater loaded with chemical contaminants and solid residues e g fibers and mfs although wastewater treatment plants wwtps can remove most microplastic fibrils from the tailings water and retain them in activated sludge the system is not completely effective freeman et al 2020 mason et al 2016 murphy et al 2016 the mp contained in the sludge still pose a risk of environmental pollution since the sludge can be applied in agricultural fields as a soil amendment and fertilizer bayo et al 2016 sludge can be treated differently between municipal facilities i e non standardization of treatments does not guarantee uniformity in sedimentation and filtration processes carr et al 2016 ziajahromi et al 2017 numerous studies have quantified the number of mfs released from household washes however non standardized methods and metrics have made it difficult to use these data for reliable statistical analysis henry et al 2019 salvador cesa et al 2017 according to de falco et al 2018b five kilograms of polyester fabric can release more than 6 million mfs after a homemade wash browne and co authors observed that a single polyester garment could lose more than 1900 mfs per wash browne et al 2011 hartline et al 2016 studied the weight loss of nylon shell and polyester fleece from jackets or sweaters following domestic washing they reported between 0 and 2 g of weight loss compared to the unwashed garment fabric structure influences the extent of release of mfs during washing as reported by carney almroth et al 2018 napper and thompson 2016 reported that a hybrid household wash of synthetic and natural textiles could on average release about 140 000 to 170 000 fibers for every 6 kg of product washed hernandez et al 2017 showed that polyester fabrics lost 75 more fibers when washed with detergent liquid or powder than without detergent according to the authors the same behavior can be observed for polypropylene fabrics other studies have evaluated washing machine models system temperature and the use of fabric softeners among other parameters although there are no absolute values on the release of fmp from textiles many factors clearly the release of mfs in textile washing kawecki and nowack 2019 fig 3 shows fmp released from washing textile products mp can also be released into the atmosphere closed weaving spinning and confection environments are places where floating fibrils are common due to the high speeds of textile machines the fibers produced are always accompanied by finer fibrous dust that is easy to inhale sometimes the floating fibrils are captured by exhaust systems and released to the external environment prata 2018 secondary mp are released from textiles exposed to the weather in locations where they are applied or discarded such emissions occur from the use of fishing and aquaculture equipment sanitary products geotextiles and agro textiles according to andrady 2011 almost all fishing activities use synthetic materials based on nylon and polyolefin lines threads and nets it is estimated that since the 1980s more than 18 000 such objects have been removed from marine fishing environments concerning sanitary products the disposal of non woven textile products present in wet wipes diapers and cleaning flannels among others results in mf release to water le hyaric et al 2009 reported that about 70 of objects trapped in sewage filters in a french city were synthetic textiles for sanitary use the extent of sewage treatment in europe is not equivalent in most countries such as brazil which is a populous country where less than 50 of its sewage is treated ministério do desenvolvimento regional 2020 5 occurrence of fibrous microplastics in different ecosystems during the coronavirus pandemic the extensive use of masks and personal protective equipment ppe has triggered an increase in fmp pollution de sousa 2021 ray et al 2022 unfortunately the single use products decontamination ppe and masks is not feasible since most of these materials are based on nonwovens which are structures of low mechanical and washing resistance therefore they deform easily not allowing safe reuse in addition the high cost of disinfection can make those products commercially disadvantageous disposable textile materials became quite evident during the pandemic and caused concern for environmental agencies revising the estimate that in 2030 the amount of plastic waste in the world would double de oliveira et al 2021b unfortunately following the coronavirus pandemic the estimated doubling of plastic waste in nature will occur before 2030 pollution of different ecosystems by fmp is evident in recent publications investigation of fmp in marine ecosystems is most prevalent due to irreversible consequences to aquatic organisms nakao et al 2021 the aquatic ecosystem receives fmp from all environments terrestrial and atmospheric chaudhry and sachdeva 2021 rain wind and inadequate disposal near shorelines of rivers seas lakes contribute to the deposition of fmp in aquatic ecosystems de sousa 2021 the use of polymeric materials in agriculture fishing nets and the dearth of processes for treating these pollutants result in the increase of fmp in marines ecosystem and the soil li et al 2016 the presence of fmp in the marine environment result in diverse effects 1 fmp can cause entanglement of organisms 2 deposition on the seafloor and 3 be a proliferator of non native and in some cases pathogenic microorganisms to other locations chaudhry and sachdeva 2021 li et al 2016 the principal cause of entanglement in the aquatic environment is retention by abandoned fishing nets li et al 2016 fmp deposition on the seafloor limits gaseous transfers cole et al 2011 algae microorganisms and non native invertebrate proliferation in a given location may be a consequence of the transmission of these organisms by fmp since ocean currents and winds can carry fmp over long distances in addition marine animals can be a vehicle for non native species by ingesting or aggregating these pollutants in their bodies salvador cesa et al 2017 zettler et al 2013 ingestion of fmp by organisms is due to visual confusion with food sources ingestion of fmp by marine animals can cause numerous irreversible problems such as 1 reduced reproduction capacity 2 poor digestion including blockage 3 damage to the immune system 4 low fitness and 5 problems in the absorption of nutrients carbery et al 2018 unfortunately fmp presence in aquatic organisms is recurrent due to the enormous input of these pollutants into water synthetic microfibers such as pet pa and acrylonitrile were found in wild populations of crabs carcinus aestuarii piarulli et al 2019 fig 4 shows synthetic fibers extracted from the crab gastrointestinal tract ps ingestion translocation and accumulation by mussels mytilus edulis have been investigated browne et al 2008 mp ingested by mussels accumulated in the intestine from which they were transferred to the circulatory system within three days furthermore the mp remained within the mussels for more than 48 days browne and coworkers concluded that particles of smaller size were more abundant than larger particles which increased the potential for accumulation in mussel tissues fish are widely reported in the literature as regarding fmp consumption rochman et al 2015 the presence of fmp pa pan pe and pet in the digestive tract of fish platichthys flesus and osmerus eperlanus was reported mcgoran et al 2017 platichthys flesus 75 had more plastic fibers in the intestine than osmerus eperlanus 20 benthic fish species acanthopagrus australis mugil cephalus and gerres subfasciatus were also used to quantify ingested debris synthetic and natural fibers polymers fragments halstead et al 2018 debris quantification showed the presence of fibers in most of the analyzed materials 83 prevalent fibers were acrylic polyester and rayon a semi synthetic fiber however the number of natural fibers found was of concern as these materials cause damage to marine organisms upon ingestion polypropylene fiber intake effects on langoustine growth and nutrition were evaluated for eight months welden and cowie 2016 reduction of body mass blood proteins and stored lipids were some of the harmful effects observed zooplankton species can also ingest fibers and mp detritus which is a critical concern since they are at a lower trophic level in the food chain desforges et al 2015 the consumption of these organisms by others at higher trophic levels requires attention to long term adverse effects numerous studies are currently investigating the presence of mp in seafood carbery et al 2018 plastic debris and textile fibers have been found in fish and shellfish marketed for human consumption rochman et al 2015 however health hazards from the ingestion of mp contaminated aquatic animals by humans have not been adequately investigated in the terrestrial environment mp from textile washing make up a significant portion of mp contaminants in the soil salvador cesa et al 2017 it is reported that mp in agricultural land exceed the total accumulated load of mp on the ocean surface nizzetto et al 2016 exposure of animals fundamental for soil maintenance to plastic microfibers can cause an ecosystem imbalance earthworms lumbricus terrestris exposure to polyester microfibers for 35 days demonstrated transcriptional responses related to the general stress and evidence of change in casting behavior prendergast miller et al 2019 a system based on earthworm aporrectodea rosea and ryegrass lolium perenne was proposed to evaluate the effects caused by the presence of plastic biodegradable polylactic acid conventional high density polyethylene hdpe and fmp on clothing on soil animals and plants boots et al 2019 the presence of plastic debris caused a reduced ryegrass seed germination percentage which was even lower when fibers were present earthworm biomass in soil was significantly reduced in the presence of contaminants causing problems to the digestive tract the results showed that mp also influence soil ph and macroaggregate stability and formation in addition mp may interfere with soil microbiota which is essential for plant development furthermore fmp application in agriculture i e encapsulated fertilizers and pesticides raises questions about harmful effects on humans as fmp accumulate in plant tissues azeem et al 2021 khalid et al 2020 li et al 2020 yin et al 2021 ingestion of contaminated plants by humans can cause serious health problems triggering the appearance of diseases in the future carbery et al 2018 the coronavirus pandemic has caused an increase of fmp in nature especially in the air de la torre et al 2022 li et al 2022 mohana et al 2023 the occurrence of fmp in air can trigger a series of respiratory problems and diseases related to inhalation particularly in susceptible individuals masud et al 2023 shi et al 2022 it is estimated that human lungs can be exposed to a range of 26 to 130 airborne microplastic particles per day prata 2018 fmp inhalation can in addition to causing diseases interact with other pollutants in the air and cause more severe damage to the individual piarulli et al 2019 if fmp inhalation occurs this debris can be challenging to remove from the respiratory system due to its morphology structure cox et al 2019 currently there is little research related to the impacts and occurrence of fmp in air however the daily use of masks has generated discussions about inhalation and fmp dissemination in the atmosphere thus evaluating the consequences of fmp exposure in outdoor and indoor environments with and without circulation the fmp release rate from textile products and the influence of morphology and composition on inhalation of synthetic fibers has been a hot topic in research in general the presence of microplastics in the environment triggers numerous harmful impacts such as 1 interactions with other persistent pollutants that can harm the maintenance and diversity of soil microbiota 2 changes in water retention capacity and soil structure 3 decreased photosynthesis efficiency and consequently plant growth 4 impact on nutrient bioavailability 5 influence on biogeochemical cycles liu et al 2017 xiang et al 2022 wan et al 2019 analyzed the effects of mp from plastic films of different sizes at relevant environmental concentrations on water evaporation and desiccation cracking in two clayey soils the presence of mp mixed with soil significantly increased the evaporation rate of water from the soil creating channels for water movement the effect was more pronounced in soils treated with 2 mm plastics than 5 and 10 mm plastics desiccation cracking was observed on the soil surface treated with 5 and 10 mm plastics therefore mp contamination in the environment can alter the water cycle in soils aggravating water scarcity zhang et al 2017 investigated the toxic effects of microplastics on the marine microalgae skeletonema costatum using a growth inhibition test the inhibition of microalgae growth was noticeable in the presence of microplastic mpvc average diameter 1 μm the maximum growth inhibition rate was 39 7 after 96 h of exposure a high concentration 50 mg l 1 of mpvc had adverse effects on microalgae photosynthesis as chlorophyll content and photosynthetic efficiency decreased ingestion of microplastics by organisms can promote oxidative stress and increase neurotoxicity also the ingestion of plastic by animals at lower trophic levels can trigger an imbalance in fauna and consequently in the quality of human food desforges et al 2015 therefore the presence of microplastics in nature is associated with several adverse effects elucidation of all impacts on ecological health is still preliminary and requires more in depth studies to unravel the short and long term consequences to ecosystems 6 remediation strategies for fibrous microplastics environmental contamination by fmp is an emerging threat to biodiversity and the ecosystem s balance li et al 2016 wang et al 2020b fmp remediation must be implemented in water and soil worldwide however existing remediation strategies need improvement these processes must be investigated more carefully regarding their effectiveness in treating fmp although bio technological approaches present excellent results in controlled environments patrício silva 2021 these technologies must be applied to actual industrial and water treatment plants there are numerous approaches to removing mitigating and degrading mp the main processes are filtration electro coagulation microbial degradation magnetic extraction membrane separation photocatalysis and enzyme based degradation wang et al 2020a which are discussed in the following sections 6 1 physical techniques periyasamy and tehrani bagha 2022 report that mechanical finishing such as calendaring shearing sueding and singeing can temporarily help to reduce the release of fibrils from fabrics the calendaring process compacts the fabrics by passing them between two rollers with pressure temperature and time control the result of calendaring is a more compact shiny fabric structure with tighter pores which theoretically reduces the mobility of the surface fibers reducing their early detachment the shearing process consists of deliberately lifting the fibrils from the surface of the fabrics then cutting the fibers close to the surface first the fabric generally woven fabrics is passed through a brushing roller that lifts the mfs then the material passes through rollers containing blades millimetrically positioned on the surface of the fabric to perform the cut the effect of this finishing makes the fabric feel better prevents the appearance of pilling and consequently can reduce the release of fibrils the sueding process aims to make the fabric feel smoother and more pleasant industrially the fabric is passed between rotating rollers coated with abrasive sandpaper the controlled abrasion of the sandpaper on the fabric surface depending on the contact pressure can remove the fibrils giving a softer touch and consequently delaying the release of fibrils from the structure singeing is a process that aims to remove the surface fibers of fabrics with fire in this process woven is exposed to direct flames or heated plates the result is a glossy material with a pleasant touch and no mfs periyasamy and tehrani bagha 2022 however all physical methods of removing fibrils during the manufacturing process are temporary and these finishes only withstand a few washes cai et al 2020 hossain et al 2021 therefore physical finishing methods for fabrics and yarns do not guarantee a substantial reduction in the release of fmp it is known that mfs released from textiles undergo progressive degradation in nature that leads these materials to smaller particle sizes which are mp and or nps with this physical techniques for the removal of mp in effluents are more effective techniques when it comes to the treatment of domestic and industrial wastewater in this context the same techniques that are used for removing mp in general can also be adapted for removing fmp yang and coworkers evaluated the treatment process at a water recovery plant in china for the removal efficiency of mp yang et al 2019 approximately 12 03 items per liter of mp were detected in the tributary after treatment microplastic concentrations were reduced by more than 95 and 0 59 items per liter of mp were detected in reclaimed water eighteen types of polymers of ten colors were identified among these particles pet ps and pp corresponded to more than 70 of the mp detected furthermore fmp were the dominant form detected with an average size of 1110 72 μm gies and coworkers evaluated the percentage of mp retention in a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp in canada gies et al 2018 about 1 76 trillion 1 28 trillion 0 36 trillion and 0 03 trillion mp enter the treatment plant annually deposit in the primary sludge in the secondary sludge and are released into the receiving environment respectively that is the retention of mp in the wwtp can reach approximately 99 zhang et al 2021a 2021b evaluated concentration variation and mp removal performance in a leachate treatment system with pretreatment biotreatment and advanced treatment approximately 58 33 of mp were removed during the leachate treatment process ultrafiltration showed the highest efficiency in removing mp the removal performance of fmp in the treatment was determined by particle properties size shape polymer type liu et al 2019a 2019b investigated the transport and fate of mp at a municipal wastewater treatment plant in china based on the conventional activated sludge process the unit was the number of mp per litter n l 1 the abundance of mp in the effluent decreased from 79 9 n l 1 to 28 4 n l 1 with a removal percentage of 64 4 the removed microplastics were transferred and stored mainly in the sludge furthermore the mp in the sludge after the dehydration process had an average size of 222 6 μm fibers and fragments were the primary particles found in the effluent samples tang and coworkers proposed the application of magnetic carbon nanotubes m cnts to remove mp from aqueous systems tang et al 2021 m cnts were effectively adsorbed onto pe pet and pa moreover magnetic biochar with porosity and graphitization pgmb was fabricated to remove metals from mp ye et al 2020 6 2 chemical techniques textile processes also offer the alternative of chemical finishes to reduce or delay the shedding of microfibers from substrates however the available treatments are based on encapsulating the yarns in the fabrics by covering the textile structures with resins and polymers although these treatments are more effective and some are permanent compared to physical finishes zambrano et al 2021 most treatments only withstand a few wash cycles and can alter the feel hydrophilicity color smell and draping of fabrics available finishes are based on a series of chemical products which include coatings with silicone resins polymethylmethacrylate pmma and pur among others which can reduce the release of fibrils fmp studies have shown that acrylic resins exhibit good resistance to pilling in virtually all types of fibrous composition pet pp pe pas pan and all types of fabric maior et al 2008 periyasamy and tehrani bagha 2022 the coating of textiles with these polymers promotes the film formation on the substrate s surface protecting it from the effects of abrasion zambrano et al 2021 some studies have investigated the attenuating effect of these finishes on the release of mfs de falco et al 2019 de falco et al 2018a maior et al 2008 however studies are scarce and there is no measure of the durability of finishes in some cases the detachment of mfs containing adhered resins is observed which can further aggravate pollution by fmp fmp undergo environmental weathering processes when exposed to sunlight mechanical degradation hydrolysis etc sait et al 2021 however the degradation process changes when fmp contain additional chemical substances for example fmp pet pa and pan were exposed to uv light in fresh and seawater for ten months pet and pa showed significant fragmentation and surface changes after exposure and pa exhibited chemical changes however pan did not undergo photodegradation sait et al 2021 in terms of removing fmp from domestic and industrial wastewater there are some alternative chemical treatments used for mp removal that can be adapted for the textile industry effective processes at drinking water treatment plants are essential to provide quality potable water different processes for removal of mp were evaluated in an advanced drinking water treatment plant adwtp removal efficiency via conventional treatment processes coagulation flocculation sedimentation and sand filtration was about 58 9 70 5 coagulation sedimentation steps predominate in mp removal primarily as fibers ozonation integrated with granular activated carbon gac filtration increased about 17 2 22 2 wang et al 2020b zhou et al 2022b studied the photocatalytic degradation of pet fiber based microplastics pet fmp using a heterogeneous catalyst based on srilankite tio2 crystalline transition phase combined with bi2o3 bismuth oxide they synthesized the z scheme bi2o3 n tio2 heterojunction by solvothermal reaction followed by calcination in the study a medium containing pet fmp and bi2o3 n tio2 was exposed to specific uv radiation for 48 h under different ph conditions the authors reported that the best results were observed at alkaline ph ph 9 since the alkaline condition is naturally hydrolytic for pet therefore polymeric degradation can be accelerated by the presence of bi2o3 n tio2 in the medium achieving satisfactory results in the removal of mfs in another study zhou et al 2022a investigated the photodegradation of pet fmp from the exposure of a medium containing pt nanoparticles decorated n doped tio2 nanoflowers which the authors present as pt n tio2 before radiation exposure the method emphasizes the importance of a hydrothermal pre treatment 180 c 12 h of pet fmp to initiate surface degradation points that originate a morphology with a rough appearance after radiation exposure the authors report a loss of up to 29 in mass which is about 8 times greater than the degraded mass of pet fmp without pre treatment removal of mp ps and pe using coagulation by polyaluminium chloride pac and ferric chloride was investigated zhou et al 2021 mp removal efficiency using pac was better than that for ferric chloride furthermore in the coagulation process hydrolysis products played a fundamental role mp removal efficiency under alkaline conditions was higher than under acidic conditions also stirring speed improved removal efficiency mp interactions with pollutants present in the environment are another crucial factor remediation processes can have negative consequences if mfs are bound with certain debris generating new compounds that are more harmful to living organisms ariza tarazona and coworkers reported the photocatalysis application to degrade hdpe microplastics extracted from a facial scrub ariza tarazona et al 2019 photocatalysis was mediated using two n tio2 based semiconductors obtained via different synthesis methods the first semiconductor was obtained by a green process from the extrapallial fluid of fresh blue mussels which demonstrated excellent capacity for photocatalytic degradation in solid and aqueous environments the second photocatalyst was obtained from a conventional sol gel synthesis and showed good removal efficiency in aqueous media sturm and coworkers reported using alkyltrichlorosilanes with different linear and branched alkyl groups for the attachment of mp pe and pp mixtures and the formation of larger agglomerates sturm et al 2020 the presence of alkyl groups had a substantial impact on the agglomeration process the compounds considered most suitable for removal of mp were substances that had between 3 and 5 carbon atoms in the chain 6 3 biological techniques fmp degradation via microorganisms is a topic of current interest ru et al 2020 bacterial and fungal strains are potentially valuable for polymer degradation enzyme catalyzed hydrolysis is another promising strategy candida antarctica and humicola insolens exhibited synergy in pet hydrolysis carniel et al 2017 alkalophilic strains agromyces sp and kocuria sp isolated from a nylon 6 factory effluent and activated sludge showed the ability to degrade nylon oligomers yasuhira et al 2007 liu and coworkers evaluated the performance of a pilot scale biofilter to polish effluent from a wwtp in denmark liu et al 2020 before biofilter step effluent contained 917 items m 3 which corresponded to a mass concentration of 24 8 μg m 3 following the biofilter the effluent concentration decreased to average values of 197 items m 3 and 2 8 μg m 3 indicating an overall removal efficiency of 79 and 89 for the number and mass of particles respectively arossa and coworkers investigated the removal of mp by red sea giant clam tridacna maxima arossa et al 2019 experiments revealed that the clams actively absorbed mp from water in which the average number retained within the animal was about 7 55 particles individual 1 day 1 in addition clam shells contributed to removal of plastic particles from water 66 03 chen and coworkers proposed the hyperthermophilic composting technology for in situ biodegradation of sludge based microplastics chen et al 2020 after 45 days of treatment 43 7 of the microplastics were removed from the sludge thermus bacillus and geobacillus were the dominant bacteria responsible for biodegradation during hyperthermophilic composting auta and coworkers isolated eight bacterial strains from mangrove sediment in peninsular malaysia to mitigate the environmental impact of microplastics auta et al 2017 bacterial isolates were selected for their potential to degrade uv treated pe pet pp and ps microplastics bacillus cereus and b gottheilii were the only bacteria that grew on synthetic media containing different microplastic polymers sole carbon source the percentages of weight loss of microplastic particles by b cereus after 40 days were 1 6 6 6 and 7 4 for pe pet and ps respectively bacillus gottheilii recorded weight loss percentages of 6 2 3 0 3 6 and 5 8 for pe pet pp and ps respectively numerous technologies confront difficulties removing small fmp patrício silva 2021 more clean technological alternatives are being studied for application in industrial plants i e membrane bioreactors wang et al 2022 electrochemical techniques dynamic membranes advanced oxidation processes and photocatalysis are also promising alternatives for fmp removal or degradation sait et al 2021 wang et al 2020b horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands cws are another large scale alternative in the fmp removal wang et al 2020a wang and coworkers evaluated removal efficiency using cws the mp removal efficiency was 88 fmp pollution of water and soil deserves attention by scientists and environmental engineers remediation strategies are required in all production processes to remove or reduce fmp generation although processes are available for fmp degradation or removal more effective technologies are needed table 1 shows some techniques applied in the remediation of microplastics from the environment unfortunately there is no technology which effectively removes all fmp in all situations a combination of techniques can offer a high performance return promoting awareness for reducing fmp production is an essential complement to remediation formulation of public policies that address fmp and their reduction can increase sustainable commitment 7 challenges and recommendations for future research fmp have emerged as pollutants in nature the gaps inherent in fibrous microplastics topics are numerous especially concerning the study of remediation techniques as the experimental conditions are quite different from the real environments anthropogenic activities are mainly responsible for fmp release fmp originate from textile products such as synthetic fibers e g pet de oliveira et al 2021b the coronavirus pandemic has significantly contributed to increases in fmp release via use of masks and ppe de sousa 2021 friction washing and improper disposal result in fmp release to the environment fmp transformations in different ecosystems and remediation technologies applied during industrial processes are relevant current topics recent investigations show advances in this area e g fmp degradation via microorganisms heterogeneous photocatalysis fenton reaction etc ye et al 2020 however there are still several limitations that deserve attention 1 optimization of fmp characterization and quantification techniques in different environments terrestrial aquatic atmospheric etc 2 expand experimental activities on long term exposure of organisms to fmp and visualize the effects caused also investigate fmp retention time in organisms 3 determine environmental risks that fmp present 4 evaluate the anthropogenic activities that discharge fmp into the environment 5 investigate the interactions between fmp and various environmental contaminants 6 biomarkers development 7 analyze the fmp lifecycle 8 novel fmp with sustainable characteristics i e readily degraded 9 assess combinations of remediation techniques to increase the fmp removal and degradation efficiency 10 invest in the development of viable and low cost biotechnological processes for fmp degradation 8 final considerations anthropogenic activities are the principal cause of fmp contamination in the environment growing demand for textiles and synthetic fibers results in increased volumes of fmp in all environmental compartments thus monitoring the impact of fmp on the environment must be emphasized risk management i e origin destination and possible complications to organisms and the environment must be conducted systematically industry specifically textile corporations must play a fundamental role in limiting fmp emissions corporations must abide by environmental legislation and environmental standards should prioritize the proper removal and or destruction of fmp public policy application and investment in appropriate technologies are essential to promote sustainability and effectively
