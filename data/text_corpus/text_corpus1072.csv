5360,lake urmia which was once the second largest saline lake in the world has been shrinking dramatically moreover lake urmia has become supersaturated with total salinity averaging more than 350 g l salt precipitation and dissolved materials brought by inflowing rivers have formed a layer of sediment with low hydraulic conductivity on the lakebed considering the flat bathymetry of lake urmia we conducted a series of numerical simulation scenarios to study the groundwater flow pattern in the vicinity of the hypersaline lake urmia using comsol multiphysics in the first step we performed the simulations in steady state conditions secondly we simulated the lake level fall in 10 years at a rate of 35 cm year followed by a lake level rise at a rate of 35 cm year for another 10 years the steady state results demonstrate that decreasing sediment hydraulic conductivity layer and increasing its thickness lead to a less intense saltwater intrusion with lower saltwater flux from the lake to the aquifer as the lake level begins to fall in cases with high sediment hydraulic conductivity incoming saltwater from the lake decreases and reaches nearly zero values through the time instead the lake begins to get recharged on the other hand as the lake level begins to rise after the falling period the saltwater flux from the lake to the aquifer increases and finally reaches a value of nearly two times greater than steady state results in low sediment hydraulic conductivity cases incoming saltwater from the lake to the aquifer remains negligible through both rising and falling scenarios keywords seawater intrusion surface water and groundwater interaction coastal aquifer lake urmia 1 introduction coastal zones are one of the most densely populated areas around the globe the average population density within 100 km of the shoreline is 112 people km2 that is nearly three times greater than the average global density of 44 people km2 small and nicholls 2003 with an area less than 20 of the earth s surface coastal regions comprise 75 of the megacities cities with more than 10 million inhabitants around the world parizi et al 2019 moreover coastal and marine environments are a major destination to millions of tourists 80 of all tourists every year crossland et al 2006 parizi et al 2019 consequently there is a high level of water demand for economic agricultural domestic and industrial uses which is mostly provided by limited groundwater resources groundwater resources comprising nearly 95 of the world unfrozen water are relatively convenient cheap and fresh sources of water morris et al 2003 the use of groundwater has rapidly increased such that 20 of the world s aquifers have been heavily overexploited gleeson et al 2012 in asia groundwater extraction accounts for 72 of the global withdrawal which provides about 25 of the total water consumption and 38 of the irrigation water use fao 2016 in europe the water demand of nearly 75 of the population is provided by groundwater rivera and candela 2018 future population growth and development will make the situation even more difficult requiring additional freshwater not only human activities but climate change e g global warming can also severely affect groundwater ranjan et al 2006 and cause depletion of groundwater resources pokhrel et al 2015 with groundwater level declining surface water ecosystems can also be impacted by the changing nature of groundwater surface water interactions safaie et al 2017 therefore there is a vital need to protect groundwater resources in coastal aquifers seawater moves towards the fresh aquifer seawater intrusion si forming a typical wedge shape of intruded saltwater due to density differences e g jiao and post 2019 in fact in salt wedges saltwater circulates from the sea into the aquifer and goes back to the sea e g smith 2004 the wedge shape and the seawater circulation rate depend on several factors including the aquifer hydraulic properties the density difference between groundwater seawater and the freshwater inflow and seabed geological characteristics such as shoreline shape and bathymetry e g ataie ashtiani et al 1999 ataie ashtiani et al 2013 glover 1959 smith 2004 furthermore if the rate of groundwater extraction exceeds the recharge rate seawater will further intrude into parts of the aquifer that had been previously fresh e g qahman et al 2005 wada et al 2010 there is no typical coastal groundwater system and each must be investigated individually jiao and post 2019 with the aid of numerical models more complex realistic simulations including intrusion of saltwater into an underlying aquifer from inland saline lakes around the world have been conducted rogers and dreiss 1995 studied groundwater pattern in response to lake level fluctuations and the fill basin permeability effects on solute transfer between the lake and groundwater in mono basin which is one of the steepest saline lakebeds in the us narayan and armstrong 1995 simulated saline flow from lake ranfurly to the river murray in australia and proposed that the local thin aquifer beneath the lake minimizes the effect of density dependent flow simmons and narayan 1998 studied the movement of brine to the underlying groundwater and its environmental impacts at lake tutchewop saline disposal complex australia and calculated the seepage rates from the basin under various management scenarios a few studies take the impacts of sea level fall slf on groundwater dynamics in coastal aquifers into consideration shibuo et al 2005 studied how receding shoreline changes groundwater flow pattern in the flat coast of aral sea they proposed that while the sea level is falling the circulation pattern essentially stops and the aquifer in the vicinity of the original shoreline remains vulnerable to si due to the initially intruded seawater shibuo et al 2006 studied the effect of bathymetry and topography on the groundwater flow pattern in the vicinity of the shrinking aral sea by exploring saltwater freshwater interaction in the regional flat and steep bathymetry their conclusion for the flat bathymetry case is consistent with the aforementioned finding of shibuo et al 2005 in the steep bathymetry case they concluded that the circulation pattern does not completely stop but becomes much less pronounced yechieli et al 2010 examined the response of groundwater systems to a rapid level decline at a rate of 1 m year in dead sea by both numerical simulations and field monitoring and suggested that the saltwater wedge moves towards the sea about 1 km from its initial location in a 20 year declining period some studies explore the influence of sea level rise slr on groundwater in coastal aquifers sherif and singh 1999 proposed that a 50 cm slr may extend the si zone by 9 km in nile delta and 0 4 km in bengal bay dausman and langevin 2005 predicted that a 48 cm slr in florida will cause the si zone to extend by 1 5 km yechieli et al 2010 explored the effect of slr in a period of 100 years at a rate of 1 cm year in a mild coastal topography with a slope of 2 5 and a steep coastal topography adjacent to the mediterranean sea they suggested that the fresh saline water interface moves 400 m and 1 m landward in the mild case and steep case respectively ketabchi et al 2016 provided a comprehensive review of slr influences on si and studied aquifer bed slope changing landward boundary conditions and recharge variation impacts on seawater toe using both analytical and numerical models and concluded that slr incremental impact on the saltwater intrusion is more considerable in the flatter coasts a general conclusion of the previous studies is that slr will cause further salinization of coastal aquifers however the interface movement varies significantly in different cases ketabchi et al 2016 werner and simmons 2009 and also may occur with a time lag when slr is fast kooi et al 2000 and when the permeability is low oude essink 1996 despite the importance and critical situation of lake urmia iran limited literature has been published on groundwater interactions in the lake urmia basin amiri and his colleagues have gone through a series of relative studies on this subject amiri et al 2016a investigated the hydrochemical evidence near the coast amiri et al 2016b used the groundwater quality index and hydrochemical facies evolution diagram and amiri et al 2016c conducted an isotopic analysis in west coasts to study si pattern in lake urmia these studies concluded that overexploitation of groundwater resources will cause freshwater to move towards the saltwater instead of si and thus the interaction between the lake and aquifer is minimized due to the role of sediment layer on the lake bed as a natural barrier amiri et al 2017 stated that filed samples from lake urmia and wells located in western parts of the lake reveal different isotopic and chemical pattern in groundwater and the lake and suggested that the sediment layer on the lakebed prevents the connection between the lake and groundwater resources sohrabi et al 2017 stated that si in lake urmia is not confirmed by yttrium and rare earth elements distribution in rock groundwater and lake urmia water samples and suggested that a focused study on si in lake urmia is required mehr et al 2019 stated that low hydraulic conductivity sediment prevents further si to the fresh aquifer and that there is no hydraulic continuity between the lake and the aquifer on the other hand tourian et al 2015 indicated a direct relationship between groundwater level and lake level vaheddoost et al 2015 indicated that there is considerable interaction between the lake and the aquifer in the northwest of the basin vaheddoost and aksoy 2018 analyzed groundwater data from observation wells and claimed that 70 of the water inflow from rivers is due to baseflow concluding that groundwater recharges the lake via the rivers that feed into the lake and thus lake shrinkage is a consequent of overexploitation of groundwater resources these controversial results do not define the processes regarding the connection of lake urmia with groundwater resources clearly the reason for development of such conflicting views may be the fact that each of these studies is conducted based on data collected from observation wells located in limited parts of urmia basin and may not be applicable to the whole section due to hydrogeological variations recently javadzadeh et al 2020 applied cross correlation analysis to study the interaction of lake groundwater levels of the lake urmia basin a dynamic equilibrium between water levels of lake urmia and surrounding groundwater was detected there are a couple of gaps in the knowledge and understanding of the saline lake and groundwater resources that are listed here first generally there is a fine layer lakebed deposition that may influence the lake and groundwater interaction and water and salt exchanges second to our knowledge there are no studies for both periods of slf and slr as it occurs in lake urmia finally the case of hypersaline lake interaction with groundwater in coincident with the above mentioned events has also rarely been studied here we investigate for the first time both slr and slf influences on the dynamics of saltwater intrusion and groundwater flow patterns around the hypersaline lake urmia iran a series of scenarios are studied to describe groundwater flow pattern 1 in a steady state condition under the impact of aquifer and sediment layer hydraulic conductivity variation and also sediment layer thickness variation and 2 the response of the lake to slf following the steady state condition and 3 the response of the lake to slr following the slf for this purpose we considered a cross section simulating lake urmia hydrogeological characteristics and performed numerical simulations using comsol multiphysics which is a finite element multiphysics simulation software 2 lake urmia crisis and restoration plan located in northwestern iran fig 1 a lake urmia was once the second largest saline lake and now it is the saltiest lake that supports life with salinity reaching to more than 350 g l asem et al 2014 sima et al 2020 lake urmia has a maximum length of 140 km a maximum width of 40 km and an average depth of 6 m marjani and jamali 2014 regarding its precious ecosystem biodiversity tourist attractions and conservation value lake urmia has been recognized as a protected field in 1967 a national park in 1971 a ramsar site in 1975 and a unesco biosphere reserve in 1976 aghakouchak et al 2015 asem et al 2014 danesh yazdi and ataie ashtiani 2019 eimanifar and mohebbi 2007 recently it has experienced a dramatic shrinkage fig 1 leading to serious problems including desertification local saline dust storm health related issues and modulation of biodiversity asem et al 2014 garousi et al 2013 from 1996 to 2016 lake urmia has lost 70 of its surface coverage 5816 km2 in 1996 vs 1802 km2 in 2016 and its volume has been reduced by 90 34 22 bcm in 1996 vs 1 24 bcm in 2016 as shown in fig 1 danesh yazdi and ataie ashtiani 2019 climatic variables and anthropogenic activities are recognized to be the main reasons of the lake urmia shrinkage although the impact level of each factor has remained controversial many studies confirm an increasing trend in temperature e g alizadeh choobari et al 2016 arkian et al 2018 fathian et al 2015 and a decreasing trend in precipitation e g alizadeh choobari et al 2016 hassanzadeh et al 2012 schulz et al 2020 shadkam et al 2016 agricultural lands and urban areas in lake urmia basin have increased by 98 and 180 from 1987 through 2016 leading to a considerable water demand increase chaudhari et al 2018 high levels of water consumption mainly for irrigational purposes coupled with deficient methods of irrigation resulted in an increase in evapotranspiration and over exploitation of incoming rivers which led to a 56 decrease in the amount of water that flows via rivers to the lake from 1966 1996 to 1997 2012 alizade et al 2018 chaudhari et al 2018 danesh yazdi and ataie ashtiani 2019 fathian et al 2015 khazaei et al 2019 schulz et al 2020 shadkam et al 2016 groundwater resources are also exposed to excessive pumping mainly to provide water for irrigation chaudhari et al 2018 danesh yazdi and ataie ashtiani 2019 khazaei et al 2019 withdrawals from groundwater in the basin increased from 1200 mcm in 1984 1985 to 2200 mcm in 2012 2013 danesh yazdi and ataie ashtiani 2019 ashraf et al 2017 proposed that 15 out of 27 studied aquifers have been depleted in urmia basin there is evidence that confirms the groundwater level has dropped by 16 m in some parts of the basin zarghami 2011 in 2013 the urmia lake restoration program ulrp was established as an attempt to restore the lake however serious weaknesses including lack of field data underestimating the value of field data and neglecting the socioeconomic consequences of mitigation actions resulted in a considerable gap between ulrp goals and the current situation of lake urmia in a way that the declining trend of water level in the lake has stopped since almost 2014 but the restoration actions failed to result in the lake level rising as previously planned and anticipated danesh yazdi and ataie ashtiani 2019 instead a small rise in water level has occurred in very recent years fig 1b however this may not be considered as a definite result of the restoration program because the increased salinity of the lake tds time series are shown in fig 1b caused lower water loss through evaporation and the diminished capacity of the aquifer led to less withdrawal through wells in very recent years to which the lake may have responded positively danesh yazdi and ataie ashtiani 2019 ulrp 2018 3 methods 3 1 conceptual model simulation cases and scenarios the hypersaline lake urmia is a relatively flat lake with generally low bed slopes in central parts of the lake lakebed has almost zero gradients while near the shoreline lakebed gradients vary from almost zero gradients to a 5 slope in steepest parts of western coast data provided by iranian space research center isrc 2018 13 permanent rivers aji chay alamlou river barandouz river gadar river ghaie river leylan river mahabad river nazlou river rozeh river shahar river simineh river zarrineh river and zola river flow into lake urmia bringing dissolved and suspended materials that eventually deposit on the lakebed through sedimentation the saturation index of dissolved salts in the lake is also high enough for salt precipitation karbassi et al 2010 also see fig 1b for tds time series these two processes sedimentation and precipitation form a layer of low hydraulic conductivity mostly composed of clay and salt on the lakebed fig 2 moreover neglecting the unsaturated zone in single layer aquifers does not have a significant effect on results mahmoodzadeh et al 2014 here we have applied the same conceptualization as discussed by mahmoodzadeh et al 2014 and a fully saturated domain as shown in fig 2b is simulated topographical features vary around lake urmia coasts involving steep rocky cliffs in northwest and parts of the southeast of the lake salt marshes mainly in southeastern and southwestern parts islands in central south parts and muddy flat low slope hills in eastern and southern parts khoshravan and jabbari 2015 amiri et al 2016c studied the hydrogeological characteristics of lake urmia in western parts using electrical conductivity assessment their results indicate that an unconfined aquifer mainly made up of medium sand to coarse sand is formed on the bedrock with its thickness varying from a few meters to about 170 m and a layer of clayey sand and salt sediment on the top with varying thickness from inconsiderable values to about 10 m the unsaturated zone is only a few meters thick moreover they proposed that the interface of the bedrock and the aquifer is horizontal in a considerable portion of the lake coast and that other than marginal parts of the aquifer which has been affected by si samples from distant parts reveal an average salinity of less than 0 5 0 ppt which is considered as freshwater fig 3 depicts the geometry of the aquifer cross section for the problem described in this paper which was designed based on the abovementioned properties based on the data provided by iranian space research center isrc 2018 on lake urmia bathymetry this cross section is a suitable representative cross section for a large part at the southwestern and western coast of the lake the total length is 6500 m and the aquifer thickness is 50 m k l t 1 is the aquifer hydraulic conductivity the shaded part demonstrates a layer of lower hydraulic conductivity with the thickness of t s l and hydraulic conductivity of k s lt 1 here t s was considered 10 m and 1 m table 1 no flow boundary conditions were set across top ground surface boundary the bottom boundary and across the left boundary to represent a groundwater divide the bottom boundary was considered impermeable to simulate the bedrock and the recharge across the upper boundary was ignored constant saltwater concentration and hydraulic head were assigned along the lakebed c s is the dimensionless saltwater concentration in the lake table 2 in this aquifer a uniform constant freshwater inlet flux from the landside boundary with a hydraulic head gradient of 0 001 m m flow is in equilibrium with saltwater intrusion from the lake table 1 c 0 is the dimensionless freshwater concentration table 2 detailed geological characteristics of the basin are essentially missing thus the aquifer is assumed to be homogenous and isotropic although it would lead to a less extended intrusion and transition zone abarca et al 2007 fahs et al 2018 in urmia hypersaline lake the density of water is higher than those in oceans here we have chosen the value of 1150 kg m3 as shown in table 2 which is the density of water in lake urmia in 2002 2003 based on the field data and is corresponding to tds of 240 290 g l fig 1b with major ions na mg2 cl and so4 2 marjani and jamali 2014 sima et al 2020 this high density facilitates intrusion while low conductivity sediment resists saltwater movement from the lake to the aquifer we set up simulation cases for indicating the coastal hydraulic system based on the lake hydrogeology with the combined effect of high density and low hydraulic conductivity sediment all simulation cases are reported in table 1 field observations conducted by the water resource authority of east azarbaijan at 129 locations mainly in the northern parts of the lake demonstrate a maximum horizontal hydraulic conductivity of 29 74 m d a minimum of 0 13 m d a mean of 3 3 m d and a standard deviation of 2 35 m d nadiri et al 2014 the hydraulic conductivity of the basin controls the rate of solute transfer between the lake and the aquifer in order to study its influence while site specific observations are missing for other parts of the coast we considered two different hydraulic conductivities of 10 m d and 1 m d that are in the range of the reported values table 1 we also assumed sediment hydraulic conductivity as different ratios of the aquifer hydraulic conductivity table 1 these values are consistent with the sediment clayey sandy structure hydraulic conductivity ranging from 10 4 m d to 1 m d based on clay content shevnin et al 2006 fig 1b depicts the actual lake urmia level fluctuation and the simulated water level our simulation consists of three steps in the first step all 12 cases table 1 were run in steady state to represent the stable system of the lake from 2001 to 2006 in the second step using the first step results as initial conditions we performed a 10 year transient simulation for cases 10 11 and 12 in which the lake water level drops at the rate of 35 cm year this step characterizes the lake level declining from 2006 to 2016 this is done by updating the boundary conditions in accordance with the receding shoreline in a way that the boundary elements which were left behind the shoreline were removed from the hydrostatic pressure and saline lake concentration boundary conditions in the third step final results of the previous step were set as initial conditions and then 10 year transient simulations were performed for cases 10 11 and 12 in which the lake level rises at the rate of 35 cm year this is in accordance with actual lake level from 2016 to 2020 and the rest is done as a prediction of ulrp future goals to raise the lake level to about 1274 m assuming that the rate of rising stays constant the simulation is done by updating boundary conditions in a way that the boundary elements that joined the advancing shoreline were added to the hydrostatic pressure and saline lake concentration boundary conditions in transient scenarios it has been assumed that the domain remains saturated through simulation time in reality the lake level does not stay steady or even fall or rise at a steady rate for a long time but experiences diurnal and seasonal variations however here we explore the hydraulic system of the aquifer in an average condition within a period that is considerably longer than diurnal and seasonal timescales 3 2 mathematical and numerical model density dependent flow in the porous media can be written in terms of flow and mass transport equations shao et al 2018 given the darcy s law for the saturated porous media and the freshwater head the net flux is 1 u k m h ρ ρ 0 ρ 0 e z where u lt 1 is the velocity k m lt 1 is the hydraulic conductivity of the porous matrix k in the aquifer and k s in the sediment layer h l is the equivalent freshwater head ρ ml 3 is the mixed fluid density ρ 0 ml 3 is the freshwater density and e z is the unit vector in the z direction the mass conservation law is assigned as the following equation 2 t ρ ε ρ u 0 where ε is the porosity here we used dispersed interface approach due to the higher accuracy that it delivers compared to the sharp interface approach ketabchi et al 2016 koussis and mazi 2018 and also the advantage of discussion about transition zone therefore the solute transport follows the advection dispersion equation 3 ε c t u c ε d m i d c 0 where c is the relative dimensionless salt concentration dm l 2 t 1 is the molecular diffusion coefficient i is the identity matrix and d is the dispersion tensor defined by 4 d α l α t u u u α l u i where α l l and α t l are the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients respectively the fluid density term was related to the solute concentration as 5 ρ ρ 0 c ρ s ρ 0 where ρ s m l 3 is the saltwater density in this paper numerical simulations were performed based on finite element method using comsol multiphysics comsol 2018 this software is a user friendly interactive and comprehensive package which allows coupling different physics used in various applications we coupled darcy s flow interface from subsurface module to simulate fluid flow in porous media with transport of diluted species in porous media used to account for the advection dispersion equation these interfaces in comsol have been successfully applied to study variable density groundwater flow in previous studies koohbor et al 2019 mozafari et al 2018 shafabakhsh et al 2019 model parameters given to comsol are listed in table 2 typical diffusion coefficient for saltwater diffusion in porous media used in similar studies is about 10 9 m2 s 1 e g ketabchi et al 2016 narayan and armstrong 1995 rogers and dreiss 1995 shibuo et al 2005 shibuo et al 2006 simmons and narayan 1998 smith and turner 2001 smith 2004 first runs for the steady state scenario have shown that by using a molecular diffusion with the same order of magnitude comsol iterative solver runs into convergence difficulties mainly in cases with lower sediment hydraulic conductivity cases 3 6 9 and 12 as in table 1 in which water flows extremely slowly through the sediment layer for convergence problems in steady state simulations some previous numerical studies advanced a long enough transient model run to a quasi steady state e g koohbor et al 2019 smith 2004 however this alternative did not work here eventually comparable results for all cases were provided in three steps first all cases were run and converged with the molecular diffusivity of 10 6 m2 s 1 second the results of the first step were used as initial guesses to another run to avoid irrelevant initial conditions and then in order to provide the most possible realistic results runs were conducted with the lowest molecular diffusion factor that led to the convergence in each case third the lowest value of molecular diffusion coefficient that all cases converged with 5 10 7 m2 s 1 as in table 2 was chosen and final runs were conducted with this value for all cases although it would lead to less saltwater penetration in the freshwater zone it should be noted that the well known henry problem henry 1964 which is often used as a benchmark in si problems considers a high diffusion coefficient of 1 86 10 5 m2 s 1 e g fahs et al 2016 fahs et al 2018 mozafari et al 2018 more recently ranjbar et al 2020 simulated slr combined with pumping activity in the southern shores of the caspian sea with a diffusion coefficient of 6 10 7 m2 s 1 3 3 output variables in order to quantify results the following metrics are discussed as in fahs et al 2016 and koohbor et al 2019 1 the dimensionless saltwater flux q s total the total saltwater flux that enters the aquifer from the lakebed boundary normalized by the freshwater flux entering the right boundary 2 the dimensionless mass of salt ms 1 a a c d x d z the double integral is calculated using the derived value tool of the comsol post processing interface here a is the total area of the cross section 3 length of the saltwater toe ltoe l the distance from left boundary to the 0 5 isochlor on the bottom boundary of the cross section as shown in fig 4 4 thickness of the saltwater wedge ls l the distance between the 0 1 and 0 9 isochlors on the bottom boundary of the cross section as shown in fig 4 3 4 numerical parameters and meshes the comsol meshing tool 2d triangular meshes are implemented in the simulations this non uniform mesh consists of 341 057 domain elements and 8933 boundary elements mesh size varies from 0 03 m fine near the lake boundaries to 5 m near the right boundary where freshwater enters the domain and a steep change in salt concentration is not expected various mesh sizes ranging from two times coarser to two times finer compared to size of the final mesh have been tested in all applied meshes the peclet number is less than 4 p e m δ l α l 4 in elements and thus the spatial stability criterion is satisfied voss 1984 mesh examination demonstrates an appropriate grid convergence where results do not change noticeably as a function of the mesh size the computational run time of steady state cases varies form 265 s in case 11 to 751 s in case 3 iterative solutions have been obtained with a relative tolerance of 0 001 in transient cases time steps are chosen automatically by comsol varying from about 4 103 s to 3 107 s in all cases and the average computational runtime for each scenario in each case is 832 s all simulations were conducted using intel core i7 6700hq cpu with specifications 2 60 ghz and 8 00 gb ram 4 results and discussions 4 1 steady state scenario fig 5 depicts the steady state salinity distributions and velocity vectors field for simulated cases the corresponding velocity vectors were plotted proportional to their magnitude negligible velocity vectors on the left side imply that the water is flowing extremely slowly or is in a stagnant condition under the lake to study the results more quantitatively the saltwater intrusion metrics the dimensionless saltwater flux the length of the saltwater toe the thickness of the saltwater wedge and the dimensionless mass of salt were plotted in fig 6 the velocity vectors variation in simulated cases fig 5 and the dimensionless saltwater flux q s total depicted in fig 6a are closely related when sediment hydraulic conductivity decreases and its thickness increases the dimensionless saltwater flux decreases until reaching a very low magnitude in cases with lowest sediment hydraulic conductivity cases 3 6 9 and 12 as shown in fig 6a in fig 5 in the cases with thick sediment layer and high sediment hydraulic conductivity cases 7 and 10 in fig 5g and 5j the downward velocity vectors of saline water that enters the domain from the lake is less pronounced compared to the thin sediment layer cases cases 1 and 4 in fig 5a and 5d implying a lower inlet saline flux to the aquifer as in fig 6a in cases with thick sediment layer and low sediment hydraulic conductivity cases 9 and 12 in fig 5i and 5 l the downward flow components disappear suggesting a negligible inlet saline flux to the aquifer as in fig 6a and the velocity vectors tend to be essentially horizontal and leftward along the sediment bottom near the shoreline the results illustrate that changing aquifer hydraulic conductivity while other parameters are kept constant does not change the dimensionless saltwater flux fig 6a and the velocity vector field noticeably fig 5 fig 7 depicts the associated streamlines the flow patterns change considerably in different lakebed characteristics the recirculating flow pattern forms due to the density differences between fresh and saline water while lakebed sediment acts as a barrier to the lake aquifer interaction fig 7a 7d 7g and 7j which are related to cases with higher sediment hydraulic conductivity cases 1 4 7 and 10 the recirculation flow pattern is such that saltwater enters the domain from the lake and then goes back to the lake as expected however in other cases decreasing sediment hydraulic conductivity and increasing its thickness causes this circulation pattern to become less pronounced instead saltwater circulates at the bottom of the domain with no interaction with lake and the freshwater flow that comes from the right boundary passes the transition zone and finally recharge the lake now we evaluate the influence of sediment layer thickness on the associated length of saltwater toe and the thickness of the saltwater wedge considering two different thickness values of 1 m and 10 m if the sediment thickness increases from 1 m to 10 m while other parameters remain constant the inland saltwater intrusion and the transition zone become less extended in a way that ltoe fig 6b decreases by an average of 128 6 m and ls decreases by an average of 66 17 m as depicted in fig 6b and fig 6c in cases with a sediment thickness of 10 m the dimensionless saltwater flux is lower fig 6a and the streamlines coming from the right boundary fig 7 go further leftward towards the salt wedge which implies that both 0 1 and 0 5 salinity isochlors are kept close to the lake compared to cases with a sediment thickness of 1 m considering fig 5a 5b and 5c in which the only difference is their sediment hydraulic conductivity dimensionless saltwater flux decreases fig 6a and the intrusion zone becomes shorter respectively in a way that ltoe fig 6b decreases by an average of 24 88 m similar results are obtained for simulated cases 4 to 12 fig 5d to 5 l the average decrease of ltoe fig 6b is 20 6 m in cases 4 to 6 83 44 m in cases 7 to 9 and 52 63 m in cases 10 to 12 in these cases as sediment hydraulic conductivity decreases both 0 1 and 0 9 isochlors tend to locate closer to the lake not shown in the figure because of lower salt input to the aquifer fig 6a this is more pronounced on the location of the 0 9 isochlor therefore ls becomes more extended as shown in fig 6c when all other parameters are constant with a decrease in the aquifer hydraulic conductivity both 0 1 and 0 9 isochlors move backwards to the lake the reason is that there is more difficulty in circulating through the salt wedge in these cases the combined effect of both isochlors being kept near the lake leads to ls fig 6c being approximately 100 m shorter in cases with aquifer hydraulic conductivity of 1 m d compared to cases with aquifer hydraulic conductivity of 10 m d fig 6d shows the dimensionless mass of salt in the aquifer m s increasing sediment thickness and decreasing sediment hydraulic conductivity result in lower salt content because of the lower salt flux to the aquifer fig 6a this clearly shows the role of sediment as a barrier to the incoming saltwater flux from the saline lake saltwater enters the domain from the lake more easily when sediment thickness is less as shown in fig 6a water flows through the domain more easily when aquifer hydraulic conductivity is high in cases with greater sediment thickness and higher aquifer hydraulic conductivity decreasing sediment hydraulic conductivity causes dimensionless mass of salt to decrease with a higher rate compared to cases with greater sediment thickness and lower aquifer hydraulic conductivity fig 6d as a result dimensionless mass of salt fig 6d in case 9 is less than in case 12 in cases with lower sediment thickness dimensionless mass of salt decreases as a result of decreasing aquifer hydraulic conductivity because the saline flux moves in the aquifer with more difficulty trends in ltoe fig 6b are also similar the gap between case 9 and case 8 results in fig 6c is considerable this again supports the idea that in cases with high aquifer hydraulic conductivity and low sediment hydraulic conductivity if the sediment thickness increases freshwater flux from the right boundary to the domain prevents saltwater intrusion in a way that higher isochlores are kept near the shoreline with smaller advancements 4 2 slf scenario fig 8 indicates the resulting salinity distribution and velocity field in the aquifer through 10 years of lake level falling for cases 10 11 and 12 in these cases the only difference is sediment hydraulic conductivity in all three cases the salinity transition zones do not move considerably from their initial locations through the time the lake is falling mainly because groundwater moves much slower than the receding shoreline fig 9 a depicts the dimensionless saltwater flux throughout the simulation time q s total at first there is a significant decrease of dimensionless saltwater flux in case 10 as time passes the flux becomes very low and stabilizes the reason is that the lake fall is accomplished by fewer lake boundary elements with lower hydraulic head in this new situation low sediment hydraulic conductivity would not let any advective flux which previously dominated dispersive and diffusive fluxes in case 11 initial dimensionless saltwater flux is lower than case 10 as stated before fig 6a in this case the dimensionless saltwater flux reaches the minimum magnitude sooner than case 10 which means that the lower sediment hydraulic conductivity acts as a stronger barrier in case 12 the sediment hydraulic conductivity is the smallest and the dimensionless saltwater flux remains negligible through the time fig 9a fig 10 shows the resulting streamlines during the slf simulation in case 10 initial streamlines that go from the lake to the aquifer disappear as time passes this is consistent with the decrease in dimensionless saltwater flux fig 9a finally in year 10 there is no entering streamline instead streamlines that come from the right boundary go further towards the lake this time the circulation continues without any interaction with the lake in case 11 the same scenario occurs however streamlines from the lake to the aquifer disappear sooner compared to case 10 in other words there is no such streamline in the second year which is consistent with very low dimensionless saltwater flux at this year fig 9a in case 12 the initial condition fig 7l already demonstrates no connection between the circulation and the lake and the pattern stays almost without any significant change through the simulation time in this case the freshwater that comes from the fresh parts of the aquifer passes the salinity transition zone and finally exits the domain from beneath the lake other than velocity vectors fig 8 that appear in the initial stagnant part beneath the lake the streamlines move further leftward consequently a greater salt flux exits the domain suggesting a total salinity loss fig 9b depicts that in all cases the saltwater toe experiences an approximately 0 5 m rightward movement due to the previously intruded salinity from the lake that is not going back to the lake through the previous flow pattern and then recedes by approximately 2 m implying a total 1 5 m leftward movement fig 9c demonstrates an increase in ls further analysis determined that the 0 1 isochlor remains almost immobile and the 0 9 isochlor shifts backwards in all cases the new flow pattern is the major reason to this different migration of isochlors as depicted in fig 10 streamlines do not change considerably at the location of the 0 1 isochlor however it experiences a significant change at the location of the 0 9 isochlor such that the previously freshwater coming from the landward boundary gets salinity through the transition zone reaches the higher salinity contours and then flows upward to the lake this is why the 0 9 isochlor retreats but the 0 1 isochlor stays almost at the same place and the 0 5 isochlor moves relatively small the rate of increase in ls is greatest for case 10 and the least in case 12 fig 9c at first case 10 has the shortest ls due to its sediment hydraulic conductivity however at year 10 due to different rates of increase ls in case 10 becomes longer than case 11 this different rates of the 0 9 isochlor retreatment is due to the fact that flow pattern changes in case 10 in which the incoming streamlines from the lake to the aquifer that previously maintained salinity beneath the lake such that the 0 9 isochlor stood further landward compared to case 12 and case 11 has vanished and upward flow towards the lake has appeared is much more pronounced than in case 12 in which the main change is that the streamlines from the aquifer to the lake go further left in case 11 the changes intensity and the rate of the 0 9 isochlor migration are almost in between furthermore as time passes the upward streamlines from the aquifer to the lake move downward to the bottom of the aquifer in all cases and then consequently the 0 9 isochlor retreats more rapidly in final years which causes ls to extend more rapidly we have defined ls as the distance from the 0 1 and 0 9 isochlors at the bottom of the aquifer in all cases as shown in fig 9d dimensionless mass of salt m s decreases in the course of simulation time with a very similar trend in all cases mainly because of the new flow pattern that implies a salt loss through the saline flow from the aquifer to the lake as describes above 4 3 slr scenario fig 11 shows the resulting salinity transition zones and the magnitude scaled velocity vector field the salinity distribution does not change considerably similar to the falling level simulation results fig 12 a illustrates the dimensionless saltwater flux q s total in cases 10 and 11 after a few years of essentially no dimensionless saltwater flux from the lake to the aquifer it increases when buoyancy forces dominate the low hydraulic conductivity sediment layer to form an advective flux increasing in the dimensionless saltwater flux to the aquifer starts about 2 years sooner in case 10 compared to case 11 low sediment hydraulic conductivity in case 12 prevents almost any inlet salt flux fig 13 depicts that in case 10 at the fifth year the circulation pattern becomes connected to the lake again which is consistent with the increase in the dimensionless saltwater flux fig 12a in case 11 this does not happen in the fifth year but rather it is seen in the final year however this does not occur throughout the entire simulation time in case 12 fig 12b depicts that ltoe retreats about 10 m in all cases this is a faster retreatment than the slf scenario this movement of the saltwater toe implies that although we expect a landward movement of the saltwater toe this migration is not significant in the simulation period it shows that the new flow pattern that had formed in the slf scenario carrying the salt concentration from beneath the lake to the lake is still affecting the saltwater toe fig 12c also shows that similar to the falling level scenario fig 9c ls becomes wider in all cases almost throughout the entire simulation time and also that the average rate has the highest value in case 10 and the least value in case 12 further analysis depicted that the 0 1 isochlor stays at its initial place while 0 9 isochor moves back this again supports the idea that the upward flow from beneath the lake moves saltwater out to the lake mainly in the location of higher salinity isochlors however due to the most pronounced flow pattern change in case 10 that the downward streamlines that form from the lake to the aquifer fig 13 in the final years the 0 9 isochlor moves 0 3 m rightward in this case in case 11 the 0 9 isochlor moves leftward only slower in final years due to milder flow pattern changes while in case 12 the 0 9 isochlor moves backwards with a linear trend through the time fig 12c mostly because in this case unlike other cases the dimensionless saltwater flux does not increase considerably through time fig 12a due to the low magnitude of dimensionless saltwater flux in initial years mainly for case 10 and 11 as depicted in fig 12a and the flow pattern described above the dimensionless mass of salt decreases for about 7 years in all cases fig 12d fig 11 depicts that in year 10 relative salinity in parts just below the lakebed in the sediment layer at around x 1500 m is greater compared to those in the fifth year this explains that while the saltwater toe is generally retreating the total salinity increases it is worth noting that final values of dimensionless saltwater flux q s total in cases 10 and 11 are about two times greater than the initial dimensionless saltwater flux at the beginning of lake level falling fig 12a and fig 9a the main reason is that at the end of the rising level simulation total salinity is lower than at the beginning of the scenario of lake level falling fig 12d and fig 9d thus the density difference that causes saltwater to intrude downward is more pronounced the results of this study shall be considered in the framework of the assumptions here a simplified conceptualization has been adapted to achieve a better understanding of the influence of lake bed properties on the si and groundwater hydraulics in lake urmia surrounding aquifers the provided descriptions for the numerical results are to help to develop the improved intuition of the system as there are limited available data on the hydrogeological system and groundwater quantity and quality for the lake urmia basin danesh yazdi and ataie ashtiani 2019 the formed insight in this study can be used to plan for gathering data on the interaction of the lake with groundwater lake sedimentation and salt dissolution precipitation processes this study can assist in the appropriate interpretation of the gathered data 5 conclusions solute transfer between the lake and the underlying aquifer is controlled by several factors such as lake bathymetry and the aquifer hydraulic system in this study 12 different simulation cases with varying sediment thickness sediment hydraulic conductivity and aquifer hydraulic conductivity were set to investigate how sediment and the aquifer affect the groundwater flow regime in the vicinity of lake urmia using comsol multiphysics steady state results demonstrate that 1 sediment layer prevents saltwater from entering the aquifer easily when sediment hydraulic conductivity decreases and its thickness increases the entering saltwater flux from the lake the total salt content in the aquifer and the length of saltwater toe decrease instead freshwaters from the fresh aquifer move towards the lake 2 changing aquifer hydraulic conductivity does not have a noticeable effect on saltwater entrance rate to the aquifer but the salinity transition zone extends with aquifer hydraulic conductivity increase 3 when sediment thickness is low with low hydraulic conductivity increasing aquifer hydraulic conductivity extends the length of the saltwater toe and increases the total salt content because of the effect of saltwater easier movement in the aquifer 4 reversely when sediment thickness is high and its hydraulic conductivity is very low increasing aquifer hydraulic conductivity results in the shorter saltwater toe and less total salt content because of the effect of easier movement of freshwater in the aquifer three cases were set to investigate how groundwater flow regime responses to a 10 year shrinkage of the lake results indicate that during this time 1 in cases with higher sediment hydraulic conductivity a circulation pattern exists at first but as the lake shrinks the inlet saltwater to the aquifer decreases and the circulation pattern becomes less pronounced in the case with very low hydraulic conductivity the aquifer recharges the lake and the saltwater entering the aquifer from the lake remains negligible through the time 2 the freshwater flow coming from the landside boundary flows further towards the lake passes the intrusion zone gains salinity and then recharges the lake in all cases when lake level rises after the level fall with the same rate 1 in final years in all cases the freshwater flow coming from the landside boundary lead to the lake without passing through the parts of the aquifer with high salinity concentrations and in the cases with higher sediment hydraulic conductivity the circulation pattern forms again 2 the incremental effect of slr on si does not occur considerably in this 10 year due to slow movement of water through the aquifer the present study is the first stage of the study of the interaction of hypersaline lake and its adjacent aquifers considering some of the complexities such as lakebed layer influence slf and slr using a simple conceptualization of the system the importance of factors such as heterogeneity saltwater density variation anisotropy groundwater pumping three dimensionality of the system and chemical reactions are investigated in future works the results of this study are not specific to the analysis of the lake urmia they are generally relevant to groundwater regime in the vicinity of seas or salt lakes that have thick sediment layer declaration of competing interest the

5360,lake urmia which was once the second largest saline lake in the world has been shrinking dramatically moreover lake urmia has become supersaturated with total salinity averaging more than 350 g l salt precipitation and dissolved materials brought by inflowing rivers have formed a layer of sediment with low hydraulic conductivity on the lakebed considering the flat bathymetry of lake urmia we conducted a series of numerical simulation scenarios to study the groundwater flow pattern in the vicinity of the hypersaline lake urmia using comsol multiphysics in the first step we performed the simulations in steady state conditions secondly we simulated the lake level fall in 10 years at a rate of 35 cm year followed by a lake level rise at a rate of 35 cm year for another 10 years the steady state results demonstrate that decreasing sediment hydraulic conductivity layer and increasing its thickness lead to a less intense saltwater intrusion with lower saltwater flux from the lake to the aquifer as the lake level begins to fall in cases with high sediment hydraulic conductivity incoming saltwater from the lake decreases and reaches nearly zero values through the time instead the lake begins to get recharged on the other hand as the lake level begins to rise after the falling period the saltwater flux from the lake to the aquifer increases and finally reaches a value of nearly two times greater than steady state results in low sediment hydraulic conductivity cases incoming saltwater from the lake to the aquifer remains negligible through both rising and falling scenarios keywords seawater intrusion surface water and groundwater interaction coastal aquifer lake urmia 1 introduction coastal zones are one of the most densely populated areas around the globe the average population density within 100 km of the shoreline is 112 people km2 that is nearly three times greater than the average global density of 44 people km2 small and nicholls 2003 with an area less than 20 of the earth s surface coastal regions comprise 75 of the megacities cities with more than 10 million inhabitants around the world parizi et al 2019 moreover coastal and marine environments are a major destination to millions of tourists 80 of all tourists every year crossland et al 2006 parizi et al 2019 consequently there is a high level of water demand for economic agricultural domestic and industrial uses which is mostly provided by limited groundwater resources groundwater resources comprising nearly 95 of the world unfrozen water are relatively convenient cheap and fresh sources of water morris et al 2003 the use of groundwater has rapidly increased such that 20 of the world s aquifers have been heavily overexploited gleeson et al 2012 in asia groundwater extraction accounts for 72 of the global withdrawal which provides about 25 of the total water consumption and 38 of the irrigation water use fao 2016 in europe the water demand of nearly 75 of the population is provided by groundwater rivera and candela 2018 future population growth and development will make the situation even more difficult requiring additional freshwater not only human activities but climate change e g global warming can also severely affect groundwater ranjan et al 2006 and cause depletion of groundwater resources pokhrel et al 2015 with groundwater level declining surface water ecosystems can also be impacted by the changing nature of groundwater surface water interactions safaie et al 2017 therefore there is a vital need to protect groundwater resources in coastal aquifers seawater moves towards the fresh aquifer seawater intrusion si forming a typical wedge shape of intruded saltwater due to density differences e g jiao and post 2019 in fact in salt wedges saltwater circulates from the sea into the aquifer and goes back to the sea e g smith 2004 the wedge shape and the seawater circulation rate depend on several factors including the aquifer hydraulic properties the density difference between groundwater seawater and the freshwater inflow and seabed geological characteristics such as shoreline shape and bathymetry e g ataie ashtiani et al 1999 ataie ashtiani et al 2013 glover 1959 smith 2004 furthermore if the rate of groundwater extraction exceeds the recharge rate seawater will further intrude into parts of the aquifer that had been previously fresh e g qahman et al 2005 wada et al 2010 there is no typical coastal groundwater system and each must be investigated individually jiao and post 2019 with the aid of numerical models more complex realistic simulations including intrusion of saltwater into an underlying aquifer from inland saline lakes around the world have been conducted rogers and dreiss 1995 studied groundwater pattern in response to lake level fluctuations and the fill basin permeability effects on solute transfer between the lake and groundwater in mono basin which is one of the steepest saline lakebeds in the us narayan and armstrong 1995 simulated saline flow from lake ranfurly to the river murray in australia and proposed that the local thin aquifer beneath the lake minimizes the effect of density dependent flow simmons and narayan 1998 studied the movement of brine to the underlying groundwater and its environmental impacts at lake tutchewop saline disposal complex australia and calculated the seepage rates from the basin under various management scenarios a few studies take the impacts of sea level fall slf on groundwater dynamics in coastal aquifers into consideration shibuo et al 2005 studied how receding shoreline changes groundwater flow pattern in the flat coast of aral sea they proposed that while the sea level is falling the circulation pattern essentially stops and the aquifer in the vicinity of the original shoreline remains vulnerable to si due to the initially intruded seawater shibuo et al 2006 studied the effect of bathymetry and topography on the groundwater flow pattern in the vicinity of the shrinking aral sea by exploring saltwater freshwater interaction in the regional flat and steep bathymetry their conclusion for the flat bathymetry case is consistent with the aforementioned finding of shibuo et al 2005 in the steep bathymetry case they concluded that the circulation pattern does not completely stop but becomes much less pronounced yechieli et al 2010 examined the response of groundwater systems to a rapid level decline at a rate of 1 m year in dead sea by both numerical simulations and field monitoring and suggested that the saltwater wedge moves towards the sea about 1 km from its initial location in a 20 year declining period some studies explore the influence of sea level rise slr on groundwater in coastal aquifers sherif and singh 1999 proposed that a 50 cm slr may extend the si zone by 9 km in nile delta and 0 4 km in bengal bay dausman and langevin 2005 predicted that a 48 cm slr in florida will cause the si zone to extend by 1 5 km yechieli et al 2010 explored the effect of slr in a period of 100 years at a rate of 1 cm year in a mild coastal topography with a slope of 2 5 and a steep coastal topography adjacent to the mediterranean sea they suggested that the fresh saline water interface moves 400 m and 1 m landward in the mild case and steep case respectively ketabchi et al 2016 provided a comprehensive review of slr influences on si and studied aquifer bed slope changing landward boundary conditions and recharge variation impacts on seawater toe using both analytical and numerical models and concluded that slr incremental impact on the saltwater intrusion is more considerable in the flatter coasts a general conclusion of the previous studies is that slr will cause further salinization of coastal aquifers however the interface movement varies significantly in different cases ketabchi et al 2016 werner and simmons 2009 and also may occur with a time lag when slr is fast kooi et al 2000 and when the permeability is low oude essink 1996 despite the importance and critical situation of lake urmia iran limited literature has been published on groundwater interactions in the lake urmia basin amiri and his colleagues have gone through a series of relative studies on this subject amiri et al 2016a investigated the hydrochemical evidence near the coast amiri et al 2016b used the groundwater quality index and hydrochemical facies evolution diagram and amiri et al 2016c conducted an isotopic analysis in west coasts to study si pattern in lake urmia these studies concluded that overexploitation of groundwater resources will cause freshwater to move towards the saltwater instead of si and thus the interaction between the lake and aquifer is minimized due to the role of sediment layer on the lake bed as a natural barrier amiri et al 2017 stated that filed samples from lake urmia and wells located in western parts of the lake reveal different isotopic and chemical pattern in groundwater and the lake and suggested that the sediment layer on the lakebed prevents the connection between the lake and groundwater resources sohrabi et al 2017 stated that si in lake urmia is not confirmed by yttrium and rare earth elements distribution in rock groundwater and lake urmia water samples and suggested that a focused study on si in lake urmia is required mehr et al 2019 stated that low hydraulic conductivity sediment prevents further si to the fresh aquifer and that there is no hydraulic continuity between the lake and the aquifer on the other hand tourian et al 2015 indicated a direct relationship between groundwater level and lake level vaheddoost et al 2015 indicated that there is considerable interaction between the lake and the aquifer in the northwest of the basin vaheddoost and aksoy 2018 analyzed groundwater data from observation wells and claimed that 70 of the water inflow from rivers is due to baseflow concluding that groundwater recharges the lake via the rivers that feed into the lake and thus lake shrinkage is a consequent of overexploitation of groundwater resources these controversial results do not define the processes regarding the connection of lake urmia with groundwater resources clearly the reason for development of such conflicting views may be the fact that each of these studies is conducted based on data collected from observation wells located in limited parts of urmia basin and may not be applicable to the whole section due to hydrogeological variations recently javadzadeh et al 2020 applied cross correlation analysis to study the interaction of lake groundwater levels of the lake urmia basin a dynamic equilibrium between water levels of lake urmia and surrounding groundwater was detected there are a couple of gaps in the knowledge and understanding of the saline lake and groundwater resources that are listed here first generally there is a fine layer lakebed deposition that may influence the lake and groundwater interaction and water and salt exchanges second to our knowledge there are no studies for both periods of slf and slr as it occurs in lake urmia finally the case of hypersaline lake interaction with groundwater in coincident with the above mentioned events has also rarely been studied here we investigate for the first time both slr and slf influences on the dynamics of saltwater intrusion and groundwater flow patterns around the hypersaline lake urmia iran a series of scenarios are studied to describe groundwater flow pattern 1 in a steady state condition under the impact of aquifer and sediment layer hydraulic conductivity variation and also sediment layer thickness variation and 2 the response of the lake to slf following the steady state condition and 3 the response of the lake to slr following the slf for this purpose we considered a cross section simulating lake urmia hydrogeological characteristics and performed numerical simulations using comsol multiphysics which is a finite element multiphysics simulation software 2 lake urmia crisis and restoration plan located in northwestern iran fig 1 a lake urmia was once the second largest saline lake and now it is the saltiest lake that supports life with salinity reaching to more than 350 g l asem et al 2014 sima et al 2020 lake urmia has a maximum length of 140 km a maximum width of 40 km and an average depth of 6 m marjani and jamali 2014 regarding its precious ecosystem biodiversity tourist attractions and conservation value lake urmia has been recognized as a protected field in 1967 a national park in 1971 a ramsar site in 1975 and a unesco biosphere reserve in 1976 aghakouchak et al 2015 asem et al 2014 danesh yazdi and ataie ashtiani 2019 eimanifar and mohebbi 2007 recently it has experienced a dramatic shrinkage fig 1 leading to serious problems including desertification local saline dust storm health related issues and modulation of biodiversity asem et al 2014 garousi et al 2013 from 1996 to 2016 lake urmia has lost 70 of its surface coverage 5816 km2 in 1996 vs 1802 km2 in 2016 and its volume has been reduced by 90 34 22 bcm in 1996 vs 1 24 bcm in 2016 as shown in fig 1 danesh yazdi and ataie ashtiani 2019 climatic variables and anthropogenic activities are recognized to be the main reasons of the lake urmia shrinkage although the impact level of each factor has remained controversial many studies confirm an increasing trend in temperature e g alizadeh choobari et al 2016 arkian et al 2018 fathian et al 2015 and a decreasing trend in precipitation e g alizadeh choobari et al 2016 hassanzadeh et al 2012 schulz et al 2020 shadkam et al 2016 agricultural lands and urban areas in lake urmia basin have increased by 98 and 180 from 1987 through 2016 leading to a considerable water demand increase chaudhari et al 2018 high levels of water consumption mainly for irrigational purposes coupled with deficient methods of irrigation resulted in an increase in evapotranspiration and over exploitation of incoming rivers which led to a 56 decrease in the amount of water that flows via rivers to the lake from 1966 1996 to 1997 2012 alizade et al 2018 chaudhari et al 2018 danesh yazdi and ataie ashtiani 2019 fathian et al 2015 khazaei et al 2019 schulz et al 2020 shadkam et al 2016 groundwater resources are also exposed to excessive pumping mainly to provide water for irrigation chaudhari et al 2018 danesh yazdi and ataie ashtiani 2019 khazaei et al 2019 withdrawals from groundwater in the basin increased from 1200 mcm in 1984 1985 to 2200 mcm in 2012 2013 danesh yazdi and ataie ashtiani 2019 ashraf et al 2017 proposed that 15 out of 27 studied aquifers have been depleted in urmia basin there is evidence that confirms the groundwater level has dropped by 16 m in some parts of the basin zarghami 2011 in 2013 the urmia lake restoration program ulrp was established as an attempt to restore the lake however serious weaknesses including lack of field data underestimating the value of field data and neglecting the socioeconomic consequences of mitigation actions resulted in a considerable gap between ulrp goals and the current situation of lake urmia in a way that the declining trend of water level in the lake has stopped since almost 2014 but the restoration actions failed to result in the lake level rising as previously planned and anticipated danesh yazdi and ataie ashtiani 2019 instead a small rise in water level has occurred in very recent years fig 1b however this may not be considered as a definite result of the restoration program because the increased salinity of the lake tds time series are shown in fig 1b caused lower water loss through evaporation and the diminished capacity of the aquifer led to less withdrawal through wells in very recent years to which the lake may have responded positively danesh yazdi and ataie ashtiani 2019 ulrp 2018 3 methods 3 1 conceptual model simulation cases and scenarios the hypersaline lake urmia is a relatively flat lake with generally low bed slopes in central parts of the lake lakebed has almost zero gradients while near the shoreline lakebed gradients vary from almost zero gradients to a 5 slope in steepest parts of western coast data provided by iranian space research center isrc 2018 13 permanent rivers aji chay alamlou river barandouz river gadar river ghaie river leylan river mahabad river nazlou river rozeh river shahar river simineh river zarrineh river and zola river flow into lake urmia bringing dissolved and suspended materials that eventually deposit on the lakebed through sedimentation the saturation index of dissolved salts in the lake is also high enough for salt precipitation karbassi et al 2010 also see fig 1b for tds time series these two processes sedimentation and precipitation form a layer of low hydraulic conductivity mostly composed of clay and salt on the lakebed fig 2 moreover neglecting the unsaturated zone in single layer aquifers does not have a significant effect on results mahmoodzadeh et al 2014 here we have applied the same conceptualization as discussed by mahmoodzadeh et al 2014 and a fully saturated domain as shown in fig 2b is simulated topographical features vary around lake urmia coasts involving steep rocky cliffs in northwest and parts of the southeast of the lake salt marshes mainly in southeastern and southwestern parts islands in central south parts and muddy flat low slope hills in eastern and southern parts khoshravan and jabbari 2015 amiri et al 2016c studied the hydrogeological characteristics of lake urmia in western parts using electrical conductivity assessment their results indicate that an unconfined aquifer mainly made up of medium sand to coarse sand is formed on the bedrock with its thickness varying from a few meters to about 170 m and a layer of clayey sand and salt sediment on the top with varying thickness from inconsiderable values to about 10 m the unsaturated zone is only a few meters thick moreover they proposed that the interface of the bedrock and the aquifer is horizontal in a considerable portion of the lake coast and that other than marginal parts of the aquifer which has been affected by si samples from distant parts reveal an average salinity of less than 0 5 0 ppt which is considered as freshwater fig 3 depicts the geometry of the aquifer cross section for the problem described in this paper which was designed based on the abovementioned properties based on the data provided by iranian space research center isrc 2018 on lake urmia bathymetry this cross section is a suitable representative cross section for a large part at the southwestern and western coast of the lake the total length is 6500 m and the aquifer thickness is 50 m k l t 1 is the aquifer hydraulic conductivity the shaded part demonstrates a layer of lower hydraulic conductivity with the thickness of t s l and hydraulic conductivity of k s lt 1 here t s was considered 10 m and 1 m table 1 no flow boundary conditions were set across top ground surface boundary the bottom boundary and across the left boundary to represent a groundwater divide the bottom boundary was considered impermeable to simulate the bedrock and the recharge across the upper boundary was ignored constant saltwater concentration and hydraulic head were assigned along the lakebed c s is the dimensionless saltwater concentration in the lake table 2 in this aquifer a uniform constant freshwater inlet flux from the landside boundary with a hydraulic head gradient of 0 001 m m flow is in equilibrium with saltwater intrusion from the lake table 1 c 0 is the dimensionless freshwater concentration table 2 detailed geological characteristics of the basin are essentially missing thus the aquifer is assumed to be homogenous and isotropic although it would lead to a less extended intrusion and transition zone abarca et al 2007 fahs et al 2018 in urmia hypersaline lake the density of water is higher than those in oceans here we have chosen the value of 1150 kg m3 as shown in table 2 which is the density of water in lake urmia in 2002 2003 based on the field data and is corresponding to tds of 240 290 g l fig 1b with major ions na mg2 cl and so4 2 marjani and jamali 2014 sima et al 2020 this high density facilitates intrusion while low conductivity sediment resists saltwater movement from the lake to the aquifer we set up simulation cases for indicating the coastal hydraulic system based on the lake hydrogeology with the combined effect of high density and low hydraulic conductivity sediment all simulation cases are reported in table 1 field observations conducted by the water resource authority of east azarbaijan at 129 locations mainly in the northern parts of the lake demonstrate a maximum horizontal hydraulic conductivity of 29 74 m d a minimum of 0 13 m d a mean of 3 3 m d and a standard deviation of 2 35 m d nadiri et al 2014 the hydraulic conductivity of the basin controls the rate of solute transfer between the lake and the aquifer in order to study its influence while site specific observations are missing for other parts of the coast we considered two different hydraulic conductivities of 10 m d and 1 m d that are in the range of the reported values table 1 we also assumed sediment hydraulic conductivity as different ratios of the aquifer hydraulic conductivity table 1 these values are consistent with the sediment clayey sandy structure hydraulic conductivity ranging from 10 4 m d to 1 m d based on clay content shevnin et al 2006 fig 1b depicts the actual lake urmia level fluctuation and the simulated water level our simulation consists of three steps in the first step all 12 cases table 1 were run in steady state to represent the stable system of the lake from 2001 to 2006 in the second step using the first step results as initial conditions we performed a 10 year transient simulation for cases 10 11 and 12 in which the lake water level drops at the rate of 35 cm year this step characterizes the lake level declining from 2006 to 2016 this is done by updating the boundary conditions in accordance with the receding shoreline in a way that the boundary elements which were left behind the shoreline were removed from the hydrostatic pressure and saline lake concentration boundary conditions in the third step final results of the previous step were set as initial conditions and then 10 year transient simulations were performed for cases 10 11 and 12 in which the lake level rises at the rate of 35 cm year this is in accordance with actual lake level from 2016 to 2020 and the rest is done as a prediction of ulrp future goals to raise the lake level to about 1274 m assuming that the rate of rising stays constant the simulation is done by updating boundary conditions in a way that the boundary elements that joined the advancing shoreline were added to the hydrostatic pressure and saline lake concentration boundary conditions in transient scenarios it has been assumed that the domain remains saturated through simulation time in reality the lake level does not stay steady or even fall or rise at a steady rate for a long time but experiences diurnal and seasonal variations however here we explore the hydraulic system of the aquifer in an average condition within a period that is considerably longer than diurnal and seasonal timescales 3 2 mathematical and numerical model density dependent flow in the porous media can be written in terms of flow and mass transport equations shao et al 2018 given the darcy s law for the saturated porous media and the freshwater head the net flux is 1 u k m h ρ ρ 0 ρ 0 e z where u lt 1 is the velocity k m lt 1 is the hydraulic conductivity of the porous matrix k in the aquifer and k s in the sediment layer h l is the equivalent freshwater head ρ ml 3 is the mixed fluid density ρ 0 ml 3 is the freshwater density and e z is the unit vector in the z direction the mass conservation law is assigned as the following equation 2 t ρ ε ρ u 0 where ε is the porosity here we used dispersed interface approach due to the higher accuracy that it delivers compared to the sharp interface approach ketabchi et al 2016 koussis and mazi 2018 and also the advantage of discussion about transition zone therefore the solute transport follows the advection dispersion equation 3 ε c t u c ε d m i d c 0 where c is the relative dimensionless salt concentration dm l 2 t 1 is the molecular diffusion coefficient i is the identity matrix and d is the dispersion tensor defined by 4 d α l α t u u u α l u i where α l l and α t l are the longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients respectively the fluid density term was related to the solute concentration as 5 ρ ρ 0 c ρ s ρ 0 where ρ s m l 3 is the saltwater density in this paper numerical simulations were performed based on finite element method using comsol multiphysics comsol 2018 this software is a user friendly interactive and comprehensive package which allows coupling different physics used in various applications we coupled darcy s flow interface from subsurface module to simulate fluid flow in porous media with transport of diluted species in porous media used to account for the advection dispersion equation these interfaces in comsol have been successfully applied to study variable density groundwater flow in previous studies koohbor et al 2019 mozafari et al 2018 shafabakhsh et al 2019 model parameters given to comsol are listed in table 2 typical diffusion coefficient for saltwater diffusion in porous media used in similar studies is about 10 9 m2 s 1 e g ketabchi et al 2016 narayan and armstrong 1995 rogers and dreiss 1995 shibuo et al 2005 shibuo et al 2006 simmons and narayan 1998 smith and turner 2001 smith 2004 first runs for the steady state scenario have shown that by using a molecular diffusion with the same order of magnitude comsol iterative solver runs into convergence difficulties mainly in cases with lower sediment hydraulic conductivity cases 3 6 9 and 12 as in table 1 in which water flows extremely slowly through the sediment layer for convergence problems in steady state simulations some previous numerical studies advanced a long enough transient model run to a quasi steady state e g koohbor et al 2019 smith 2004 however this alternative did not work here eventually comparable results for all cases were provided in three steps first all cases were run and converged with the molecular diffusivity of 10 6 m2 s 1 second the results of the first step were used as initial guesses to another run to avoid irrelevant initial conditions and then in order to provide the most possible realistic results runs were conducted with the lowest molecular diffusion factor that led to the convergence in each case third the lowest value of molecular diffusion coefficient that all cases converged with 5 10 7 m2 s 1 as in table 2 was chosen and final runs were conducted with this value for all cases although it would lead to less saltwater penetration in the freshwater zone it should be noted that the well known henry problem henry 1964 which is often used as a benchmark in si problems considers a high diffusion coefficient of 1 86 10 5 m2 s 1 e g fahs et al 2016 fahs et al 2018 mozafari et al 2018 more recently ranjbar et al 2020 simulated slr combined with pumping activity in the southern shores of the caspian sea with a diffusion coefficient of 6 10 7 m2 s 1 3 3 output variables in order to quantify results the following metrics are discussed as in fahs et al 2016 and koohbor et al 2019 1 the dimensionless saltwater flux q s total the total saltwater flux that enters the aquifer from the lakebed boundary normalized by the freshwater flux entering the right boundary 2 the dimensionless mass of salt ms 1 a a c d x d z the double integral is calculated using the derived value tool of the comsol post processing interface here a is the total area of the cross section 3 length of the saltwater toe ltoe l the distance from left boundary to the 0 5 isochlor on the bottom boundary of the cross section as shown in fig 4 4 thickness of the saltwater wedge ls l the distance between the 0 1 and 0 9 isochlors on the bottom boundary of the cross section as shown in fig 4 3 4 numerical parameters and meshes the comsol meshing tool 2d triangular meshes are implemented in the simulations this non uniform mesh consists of 341 057 domain elements and 8933 boundary elements mesh size varies from 0 03 m fine near the lake boundaries to 5 m near the right boundary where freshwater enters the domain and a steep change in salt concentration is not expected various mesh sizes ranging from two times coarser to two times finer compared to size of the final mesh have been tested in all applied meshes the peclet number is less than 4 p e m δ l α l 4 in elements and thus the spatial stability criterion is satisfied voss 1984 mesh examination demonstrates an appropriate grid convergence where results do not change noticeably as a function of the mesh size the computational run time of steady state cases varies form 265 s in case 11 to 751 s in case 3 iterative solutions have been obtained with a relative tolerance of 0 001 in transient cases time steps are chosen automatically by comsol varying from about 4 103 s to 3 107 s in all cases and the average computational runtime for each scenario in each case is 832 s all simulations were conducted using intel core i7 6700hq cpu with specifications 2 60 ghz and 8 00 gb ram 4 results and discussions 4 1 steady state scenario fig 5 depicts the steady state salinity distributions and velocity vectors field for simulated cases the corresponding velocity vectors were plotted proportional to their magnitude negligible velocity vectors on the left side imply that the water is flowing extremely slowly or is in a stagnant condition under the lake to study the results more quantitatively the saltwater intrusion metrics the dimensionless saltwater flux the length of the saltwater toe the thickness of the saltwater wedge and the dimensionless mass of salt were plotted in fig 6 the velocity vectors variation in simulated cases fig 5 and the dimensionless saltwater flux q s total depicted in fig 6a are closely related when sediment hydraulic conductivity decreases and its thickness increases the dimensionless saltwater flux decreases until reaching a very low magnitude in cases with lowest sediment hydraulic conductivity cases 3 6 9 and 12 as shown in fig 6a in fig 5 in the cases with thick sediment layer and high sediment hydraulic conductivity cases 7 and 10 in fig 5g and 5j the downward velocity vectors of saline water that enters the domain from the lake is less pronounced compared to the thin sediment layer cases cases 1 and 4 in fig 5a and 5d implying a lower inlet saline flux to the aquifer as in fig 6a in cases with thick sediment layer and low sediment hydraulic conductivity cases 9 and 12 in fig 5i and 5 l the downward flow components disappear suggesting a negligible inlet saline flux to the aquifer as in fig 6a and the velocity vectors tend to be essentially horizontal and leftward along the sediment bottom near the shoreline the results illustrate that changing aquifer hydraulic conductivity while other parameters are kept constant does not change the dimensionless saltwater flux fig 6a and the velocity vector field noticeably fig 5 fig 7 depicts the associated streamlines the flow patterns change considerably in different lakebed characteristics the recirculating flow pattern forms due to the density differences between fresh and saline water while lakebed sediment acts as a barrier to the lake aquifer interaction fig 7a 7d 7g and 7j which are related to cases with higher sediment hydraulic conductivity cases 1 4 7 and 10 the recirculation flow pattern is such that saltwater enters the domain from the lake and then goes back to the lake as expected however in other cases decreasing sediment hydraulic conductivity and increasing its thickness causes this circulation pattern to become less pronounced instead saltwater circulates at the bottom of the domain with no interaction with lake and the freshwater flow that comes from the right boundary passes the transition zone and finally recharge the lake now we evaluate the influence of sediment layer thickness on the associated length of saltwater toe and the thickness of the saltwater wedge considering two different thickness values of 1 m and 10 m if the sediment thickness increases from 1 m to 10 m while other parameters remain constant the inland saltwater intrusion and the transition zone become less extended in a way that ltoe fig 6b decreases by an average of 128 6 m and ls decreases by an average of 66 17 m as depicted in fig 6b and fig 6c in cases with a sediment thickness of 10 m the dimensionless saltwater flux is lower fig 6a and the streamlines coming from the right boundary fig 7 go further leftward towards the salt wedge which implies that both 0 1 and 0 5 salinity isochlors are kept close to the lake compared to cases with a sediment thickness of 1 m considering fig 5a 5b and 5c in which the only difference is their sediment hydraulic conductivity dimensionless saltwater flux decreases fig 6a and the intrusion zone becomes shorter respectively in a way that ltoe fig 6b decreases by an average of 24 88 m similar results are obtained for simulated cases 4 to 12 fig 5d to 5 l the average decrease of ltoe fig 6b is 20 6 m in cases 4 to 6 83 44 m in cases 7 to 9 and 52 63 m in cases 10 to 12 in these cases as sediment hydraulic conductivity decreases both 0 1 and 0 9 isochlors tend to locate closer to the lake not shown in the figure because of lower salt input to the aquifer fig 6a this is more pronounced on the location of the 0 9 isochlor therefore ls becomes more extended as shown in fig 6c when all other parameters are constant with a decrease in the aquifer hydraulic conductivity both 0 1 and 0 9 isochlors move backwards to the lake the reason is that there is more difficulty in circulating through the salt wedge in these cases the combined effect of both isochlors being kept near the lake leads to ls fig 6c being approximately 100 m shorter in cases with aquifer hydraulic conductivity of 1 m d compared to cases with aquifer hydraulic conductivity of 10 m d fig 6d shows the dimensionless mass of salt in the aquifer m s increasing sediment thickness and decreasing sediment hydraulic conductivity result in lower salt content because of the lower salt flux to the aquifer fig 6a this clearly shows the role of sediment as a barrier to the incoming saltwater flux from the saline lake saltwater enters the domain from the lake more easily when sediment thickness is less as shown in fig 6a water flows through the domain more easily when aquifer hydraulic conductivity is high in cases with greater sediment thickness and higher aquifer hydraulic conductivity decreasing sediment hydraulic conductivity causes dimensionless mass of salt to decrease with a higher rate compared to cases with greater sediment thickness and lower aquifer hydraulic conductivity fig 6d as a result dimensionless mass of salt fig 6d in case 9 is less than in case 12 in cases with lower sediment thickness dimensionless mass of salt decreases as a result of decreasing aquifer hydraulic conductivity because the saline flux moves in the aquifer with more difficulty trends in ltoe fig 6b are also similar the gap between case 9 and case 8 results in fig 6c is considerable this again supports the idea that in cases with high aquifer hydraulic conductivity and low sediment hydraulic conductivity if the sediment thickness increases freshwater flux from the right boundary to the domain prevents saltwater intrusion in a way that higher isochlores are kept near the shoreline with smaller advancements 4 2 slf scenario fig 8 indicates the resulting salinity distribution and velocity field in the aquifer through 10 years of lake level falling for cases 10 11 and 12 in these cases the only difference is sediment hydraulic conductivity in all three cases the salinity transition zones do not move considerably from their initial locations through the time the lake is falling mainly because groundwater moves much slower than the receding shoreline fig 9 a depicts the dimensionless saltwater flux throughout the simulation time q s total at first there is a significant decrease of dimensionless saltwater flux in case 10 as time passes the flux becomes very low and stabilizes the reason is that the lake fall is accomplished by fewer lake boundary elements with lower hydraulic head in this new situation low sediment hydraulic conductivity would not let any advective flux which previously dominated dispersive and diffusive fluxes in case 11 initial dimensionless saltwater flux is lower than case 10 as stated before fig 6a in this case the dimensionless saltwater flux reaches the minimum magnitude sooner than case 10 which means that the lower sediment hydraulic conductivity acts as a stronger barrier in case 12 the sediment hydraulic conductivity is the smallest and the dimensionless saltwater flux remains negligible through the time fig 9a fig 10 shows the resulting streamlines during the slf simulation in case 10 initial streamlines that go from the lake to the aquifer disappear as time passes this is consistent with the decrease in dimensionless saltwater flux fig 9a finally in year 10 there is no entering streamline instead streamlines that come from the right boundary go further towards the lake this time the circulation continues without any interaction with the lake in case 11 the same scenario occurs however streamlines from the lake to the aquifer disappear sooner compared to case 10 in other words there is no such streamline in the second year which is consistent with very low dimensionless saltwater flux at this year fig 9a in case 12 the initial condition fig 7l already demonstrates no connection between the circulation and the lake and the pattern stays almost without any significant change through the simulation time in this case the freshwater that comes from the fresh parts of the aquifer passes the salinity transition zone and finally exits the domain from beneath the lake other than velocity vectors fig 8 that appear in the initial stagnant part beneath the lake the streamlines move further leftward consequently a greater salt flux exits the domain suggesting a total salinity loss fig 9b depicts that in all cases the saltwater toe experiences an approximately 0 5 m rightward movement due to the previously intruded salinity from the lake that is not going back to the lake through the previous flow pattern and then recedes by approximately 2 m implying a total 1 5 m leftward movement fig 9c demonstrates an increase in ls further analysis determined that the 0 1 isochlor remains almost immobile and the 0 9 isochlor shifts backwards in all cases the new flow pattern is the major reason to this different migration of isochlors as depicted in fig 10 streamlines do not change considerably at the location of the 0 1 isochlor however it experiences a significant change at the location of the 0 9 isochlor such that the previously freshwater coming from the landward boundary gets salinity through the transition zone reaches the higher salinity contours and then flows upward to the lake this is why the 0 9 isochlor retreats but the 0 1 isochlor stays almost at the same place and the 0 5 isochlor moves relatively small the rate of increase in ls is greatest for case 10 and the least in case 12 fig 9c at first case 10 has the shortest ls due to its sediment hydraulic conductivity however at year 10 due to different rates of increase ls in case 10 becomes longer than case 11 this different rates of the 0 9 isochlor retreatment is due to the fact that flow pattern changes in case 10 in which the incoming streamlines from the lake to the aquifer that previously maintained salinity beneath the lake such that the 0 9 isochlor stood further landward compared to case 12 and case 11 has vanished and upward flow towards the lake has appeared is much more pronounced than in case 12 in which the main change is that the streamlines from the aquifer to the lake go further left in case 11 the changes intensity and the rate of the 0 9 isochlor migration are almost in between furthermore as time passes the upward streamlines from the aquifer to the lake move downward to the bottom of the aquifer in all cases and then consequently the 0 9 isochlor retreats more rapidly in final years which causes ls to extend more rapidly we have defined ls as the distance from the 0 1 and 0 9 isochlors at the bottom of the aquifer in all cases as shown in fig 9d dimensionless mass of salt m s decreases in the course of simulation time with a very similar trend in all cases mainly because of the new flow pattern that implies a salt loss through the saline flow from the aquifer to the lake as describes above 4 3 slr scenario fig 11 shows the resulting salinity transition zones and the magnitude scaled velocity vector field the salinity distribution does not change considerably similar to the falling level simulation results fig 12 a illustrates the dimensionless saltwater flux q s total in cases 10 and 11 after a few years of essentially no dimensionless saltwater flux from the lake to the aquifer it increases when buoyancy forces dominate the low hydraulic conductivity sediment layer to form an advective flux increasing in the dimensionless saltwater flux to the aquifer starts about 2 years sooner in case 10 compared to case 11 low sediment hydraulic conductivity in case 12 prevents almost any inlet salt flux fig 13 depicts that in case 10 at the fifth year the circulation pattern becomes connected to the lake again which is consistent with the increase in the dimensionless saltwater flux fig 12a in case 11 this does not happen in the fifth year but rather it is seen in the final year however this does not occur throughout the entire simulation time in case 12 fig 12b depicts that ltoe retreats about 10 m in all cases this is a faster retreatment than the slf scenario this movement of the saltwater toe implies that although we expect a landward movement of the saltwater toe this migration is not significant in the simulation period it shows that the new flow pattern that had formed in the slf scenario carrying the salt concentration from beneath the lake to the lake is still affecting the saltwater toe fig 12c also shows that similar to the falling level scenario fig 9c ls becomes wider in all cases almost throughout the entire simulation time and also that the average rate has the highest value in case 10 and the least value in case 12 further analysis depicted that the 0 1 isochlor stays at its initial place while 0 9 isochor moves back this again supports the idea that the upward flow from beneath the lake moves saltwater out to the lake mainly in the location of higher salinity isochlors however due to the most pronounced flow pattern change in case 10 that the downward streamlines that form from the lake to the aquifer fig 13 in the final years the 0 9 isochlor moves 0 3 m rightward in this case in case 11 the 0 9 isochlor moves leftward only slower in final years due to milder flow pattern changes while in case 12 the 0 9 isochlor moves backwards with a linear trend through the time fig 12c mostly because in this case unlike other cases the dimensionless saltwater flux does not increase considerably through time fig 12a due to the low magnitude of dimensionless saltwater flux in initial years mainly for case 10 and 11 as depicted in fig 12a and the flow pattern described above the dimensionless mass of salt decreases for about 7 years in all cases fig 12d fig 11 depicts that in year 10 relative salinity in parts just below the lakebed in the sediment layer at around x 1500 m is greater compared to those in the fifth year this explains that while the saltwater toe is generally retreating the total salinity increases it is worth noting that final values of dimensionless saltwater flux q s total in cases 10 and 11 are about two times greater than the initial dimensionless saltwater flux at the beginning of lake level falling fig 12a and fig 9a the main reason is that at the end of the rising level simulation total salinity is lower than at the beginning of the scenario of lake level falling fig 12d and fig 9d thus the density difference that causes saltwater to intrude downward is more pronounced the results of this study shall be considered in the framework of the assumptions here a simplified conceptualization has been adapted to achieve a better understanding of the influence of lake bed properties on the si and groundwater hydraulics in lake urmia surrounding aquifers the provided descriptions for the numerical results are to help to develop the improved intuition of the system as there are limited available data on the hydrogeological system and groundwater quantity and quality for the lake urmia basin danesh yazdi and ataie ashtiani 2019 the formed insight in this study can be used to plan for gathering data on the interaction of the lake with groundwater lake sedimentation and salt dissolution precipitation processes this study can assist in the appropriate interpretation of the gathered data 5 conclusions solute transfer between the lake and the underlying aquifer is controlled by several factors such as lake bathymetry and the aquifer hydraulic system in this study 12 different simulation cases with varying sediment thickness sediment hydraulic conductivity and aquifer hydraulic conductivity were set to investigate how sediment and the aquifer affect the groundwater flow regime in the vicinity of lake urmia using comsol multiphysics steady state results demonstrate that 1 sediment layer prevents saltwater from entering the aquifer easily when sediment hydraulic conductivity decreases and its thickness increases the entering saltwater flux from the lake the total salt content in the aquifer and the length of saltwater toe decrease instead freshwaters from the fresh aquifer move towards the lake 2 changing aquifer hydraulic conductivity does not have a noticeable effect on saltwater entrance rate to the aquifer but the salinity transition zone extends with aquifer hydraulic conductivity increase 3 when sediment thickness is low with low hydraulic conductivity increasing aquifer hydraulic conductivity extends the length of the saltwater toe and increases the total salt content because of the effect of saltwater easier movement in the aquifer 4 reversely when sediment thickness is high and its hydraulic conductivity is very low increasing aquifer hydraulic conductivity results in the shorter saltwater toe and less total salt content because of the effect of easier movement of freshwater in the aquifer three cases were set to investigate how groundwater flow regime responses to a 10 year shrinkage of the lake results indicate that during this time 1 in cases with higher sediment hydraulic conductivity a circulation pattern exists at first but as the lake shrinks the inlet saltwater to the aquifer decreases and the circulation pattern becomes less pronounced in the case with very low hydraulic conductivity the aquifer recharges the lake and the saltwater entering the aquifer from the lake remains negligible through the time 2 the freshwater flow coming from the landside boundary flows further towards the lake passes the intrusion zone gains salinity and then recharges the lake in all cases when lake level rises after the level fall with the same rate 1 in final years in all cases the freshwater flow coming from the landside boundary lead to the lake without passing through the parts of the aquifer with high salinity concentrations and in the cases with higher sediment hydraulic conductivity the circulation pattern forms again 2 the incremental effect of slr on si does not occur considerably in this 10 year due to slow movement of water through the aquifer the present study is the first stage of the study of the interaction of hypersaline lake and its adjacent aquifers considering some of the complexities such as lakebed layer influence slf and slr using a simple conceptualization of the system the importance of factors such as heterogeneity saltwater density variation anisotropy groundwater pumping three dimensionality of the system and chemical reactions are investigated in future works the results of this study are not specific to the analysis of the lake urmia they are generally relevant to groundwater regime in the vicinity of seas or salt lakes that have thick sediment layer declaration of competing interest the

5361,the widely used probability based drought indices for drought characterization usually underlie the assumption of the considered hydrometeorological variables to be stationary which is largely challenged under the current global change incorporating the parameters of probability distribution with covariates such as time or climate indices has become a common way to develop drought index considering nonstationarity however most previous drought studies emphasized more on the linear relationship between distribution parameters and related covariates which may neglect the inherent nonlinear relationship and lost useful information for drought assessment our study aims to develop a nonstationary standardized precipitation index nspi with distribution parameters nonlinearly varying with potential influencing climate indices the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin mlryrb of china are selected as the case study area to examine the performance of the nspi with the performance of the traditional standardized precipitation index spi results indicate that the nspi with climate indices as covariates is more robust than both the nspi with time as the covariate and the traditional spi furthermore the nonlinear dependence of distribution parameters on climate indices considered in the nonstationary model can be more suitable for drought assessment than the linear dependence of distribution parameters besides there exists a higher frequency of extreme drought by the nspi than the spi in recent decades in most regions of the mlryrb although the nspi is a little computationally expensive with more required inputs of climate variables it can depict the influence of changing environment on the drought occurrence thus can be a feasible alternative for drought assessment considering nonstationarity in view of future change and provide valuable support for further studies keywords meteorological drought nonstationarity nonlinear dependence climate change standardized precipitation index 1 introduction drought which occurs as a result of climate extremes that are driven by both natural variability and human activities is a well known natural disaster that has enormous negative effects on water availability agriculture and ecosystems sheffield et al 2013 zargar et al 2011 for example the extreme drought event from october 2010 to june 2011 in the yangtze river basin of china has affected an area of approximately 800 000 km2 5 million people 1 million livestock and 3 million hectares of arable area and induced an economic loss of approximately 15 billion rmb during late 2011 and 2014 california experienced extreme drought leading to extensive groundwater overdraft agricultural losses cutbacks in hydroelectricity generation and a series of voluntary and mandatory urban water restrictions mann and gleick 2015 more specifically increases in the frequency or intensity of droughts have been detected in many areas worldwide liu et al 2018 ma et al 2019 tian et al 2018 and in some cases have been attributed to climate change pachauri et al 2014 overall droughts have become a topic of focus for scientists and governments around the world aryal and zhu 2019 liu et al 2018 ma et al 2019 sam et al 2019 sheffield and wood 2006 tian et al 2018 to date precisely defining drought is still a difficult task because the occurrence of drought is influenced by multiple factors such as meteorology hydrology and socioeconomic factors and the stochastic nature of water demands in different regions mishra and singh 2010 generally drought refers to a deficit in water supply i e deficits in precipitation runoff and so on world meteorological organization wmo 1986 many definitions of drought have been proposed and can be generally classified into four types american meteorological society ams 2004 wilhite and glantz 1985 including meteorological hydrological agricultural and socioeconomic drought to date a large number of drought indices have been developed among which the probabilistic drought indices have been widely used because of their simplicity and effectiveness in drought assessment aghakouchak 2014 cheval 2015 hao and aghakouchak 2013 vicente serrano et al 2012 vicente serrano et al 2010 for instance the standardized precipitation index spi which was first proposed by mckee et al 1993 is a widespread meteorological drought index that transforms the precipitation variable into a standardized value using the gamma distribution and inverse standard normal distribution the major advantages of the spi are its simplicity in computation and its ability to reveal drought in a multiscale way cheval 2015 probabilistic drought indices are also applied to hydrological and agricultural droughts including the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index tao et al 2014 vicente serrano et al 2010 the standardized runoff index shukla and wood 2008 the standardized streamflow index vicente serrano et al 2012 and the standardized soil moisture index aghakouchak 2014 these abovementioned probabilistic drought indices are all based on the underlying assumption that the hydrological processes and meteorological time series are stationary however milly et al 2008 claimed that such an assumption of stationarity is questionable with the influences of human disturbances natural climate changes and low frequency internal variability therefore the nonstationarity of hydrological and meteorological variables which can be defined as sequences with significant trends abrupt changes or periodicity salas 1993 has been emphasized by many studies recently cancelliere 2017 lópez and francés 2013 razmi et al 2017 salas and obeysekera 2014 vasiliades et al 2015 villarini et al 2010 xiong 2015 zeng et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 in the perspective of meteorological drought research russo et al 2013 indicated that the most widely used spi which is based on the stationary gamma distribution may lose its effectiveness in modelling time series longer than about 30 years because the precipitation time series cannot be stationary and cannot be modeled with a stationary distribution due to the expected significant climate change signal for the time series longer than 30 years therefore some researchers have used nonstationary models to assess drought which assume that the scale parameter of the candidate distribution related to the drought variables changes with time bazrafshan and hejabi 2018 park et al 2019 russo et al 2013 salvi and ghosh 2016 wang et al 2015 in fact similar studies have been widely performed in terms of extreme precipitation and floods in which the parameter of the candidate probability distribution is dependent on time clarke 2002 cunderlik and ouarda 2006 kharin and zwiers 2005 salas and obeysekera 2014 or some physical covariates e g climate indices adlouni et al 2007 agilan and umamahesh 2017 lima et al 2015 lópez and francés 2013 razmi et al 2017 su and chen 2019 vasiliades et al 2015 villarini et al 2009 xiong et al 2015 zeng et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 the generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss proposed by rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 is a frequently used semi parametric regression model that characterizes nonstationarity by constructing linear or nonlinear functions between parameters and explanatory variables compared to broad applications of the gamlss in investigating the nonlinear structure of the nonstationarity of extreme precipitation and floods events gu et al 2019 hao et al 2019 lópez and francés 2013 zhang et al 2015 most previous studies that focused on nonstationarity in probabilistic drought indices pay more attention to the linear relationship between parameters and covariates e g time and climate indices for example russo et al 2013 proposed the nonstationary standardized precipitation indices snspi which has been found to be more robust than the traditional spi in the projection of precipitation changes under global warming in europe salvi and ghosh 2016 claimed that the snspi was able to produce realistic frequencies of meteorological extremes when incorporating climate change in the scale parameter and that it showed less sensitivity to the selected reference period wang et al 2015 proposed a time dependent standardized precipitation index spit that described the distribution parameter as an optimized polynomial function that accounted for the possible nonlinear behaviors of observations over time and implied that the nonstationarity of hydrological time series cannot be overlooked in drought assessment li et al 2015 found that the nonstationary model with the time varying scale parameter showed a slight difference from the stationary model and may be inappropriate in some regions they developed a nonstationary standardized precipitation index with large scale climate signals as covariates southern oscillation index atlantic multidecadal oscillation and north atlantic oscillation which showed to be more robust compared with the traditional spi however many studies have indicated that the relationship between parameters of probability distributions and covariates should be nonlinear because of the changing environment and intensive human activities lópez and francés 2013 um et al 2017 thus assuming a linear relationship between distribution parameters and related covariates in drought assessment may probably neglect the inherent nonlinear relationship and lose useful information for drought identification the referred proofs can be seen in lópez and francés 2013 and hao et al 2019 who suggested that the consideration of a nonlinear relationship between the parameter and the covariates can provide a better description of the changes in extreme precipitation or floods therefore interests have arisen regarding whether the consideration of nonlinear dependence of the distribution parameters on explanatory variables can give a better description of drought assessments in this study we aim to develop a nonstationary standardized precipitation index nspi based on the traditional spi with the scale parameter nonlinearly varying with climate indices which is anticipated to comprehensively describe the relationship between drought and climate change under the changing environment the gamlss model and stepwise method are employed to help constructing the nonstationary gamma distribution by selecting the most significant climate variables that influence the changes in parameters of traditional gamma distribution then the nonstationary gamma distribution with its scale parameter as a function of the determined climate variables and time is fitted to compute the nspi the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river basin mlryrb are chosen as the case study to examine the efficiency of the developed nspi with the comparison to the spi 2 methodology 2 1 calculation of the standardized precipitation index the spi which was first proposed by mckee et al 1993 is a commonly used index to characterize meteorological drought the calculation procedure of the spi is given below a given a certain time scale s the cumulative precipitation at the mth month during different years is calculated by 1 x s m t i g s 1 g x i g 12 t 1 m where x is the monthly precipitation series of n years t 1 2 n represents the yearly index and m is a specific month such as january february december b the cumulative precipitation series are fitted by a probability density function as recommended by mckee et al 1993 the gamma distribution is used in this study x s m gamma k θ 2 f x s m k θ 1 θ k γ k x s m k 1 e x s m θ x s m 0 where k and θ are the shape and scale parameters respectively and γ is the gamma function c then the cumulative probability of a particular precipitation event for a given time scale and month is computed the spi value is acquired by transforming the cumulative probability distribution into a standard normal distribution with a mean of zero and a variance of one via the following equation 3 x p φ 1 p where x p is the quantile value of the cumulative probability p and φ 1 is the inverse function of the cumulative distribution function cdf of the standard normal distribution φ the spi drought classification is listed in table 1 2 2 construction of the nonstationary standardized precipitation index conventional spi generally fit the precipitation data to a stationary model with constant distribution parameters according to russo et al 2013 the precipitation time series may be nonstationary changed because of the influence from the possible significant climate change signal when the length of the time series is longer than 30 years in this study some frequently used climate indices are used to represent the influences of climate change signal and they are incorporated into the nonstationary model based on the gamlss framework to construct a nonstationary meteorological drought index based on spi the main steps to construct the nspi are as follows 1 select suitable climate indices that have a close correlation with precipitation to represent the influences of climate change 2 fit a nonstationary gamma distribution for precipitation with the distribution parameter nonlinearly varying with climate indices 3 apply the stepwise method to select significant explanatory variables to simplify the model 4 finally transform the cumulative probability of a particular precipitation event into a standard normal distribution with a mean of zero and variance of one 2 2 1 climate index selection it is widely recognized that climatic oscillations such as the el niño southern oscillation enso pacific decadal oscillation pdo and arctic oscillation ao can significantly influence droughts in china li et al 2016 qian et al 2014 enso considered in this study refers to nino3 index sea surface temperature anomalies averaged in the nino3 region 5 s 5 n 90 150 w many studies have indicated that the existence of a high correlation between south china rainfall and sea surface temperature sst anomalies reflected by nino3 index wang et al 2018 li et al 2007 also found that the sea surface temperature anomalies sstas in the tropical indian ocean and tropical pacific ocean have a significant impact on rainfall in the following june in the yangtze river basin based on the indian ocean dipole iod index and nino3 index 5 s 5 n 150 90 w the strong correlation between precipitation anomalies in the yangtze river basin and ao has also been reported in several studies gong et al 2002 wei 2006 qian and zhou 2013 suggested that significant negative correlations exsit between the palmer drought severity index pdsi and pdo in north china xiao et al 2015 analyzed the teleconnections of enso north atlantic oscillation nao iod and the pdo with seasonal precipitation regimes over the yangtze river basin and found that enso was the leading driving factor of precipitation variability over the basin and that spring precipitation was influenced by the pdo and enso therefore the pdo nino3 and the ao are capable of describing the observed variability in precipitation in the mlryrb and these three candidate climate indices pdo ao and nino3 are selected to reflect the impacts of climate change on droughts he and guan 2013 pointed out that time lags should be considered in studies of the correlation between precipitation anomalies and large scale climatic indices and li et al 2015 considered different lead times when selecting climate indices affecting drought occurrence in the luanhe river basin in this study we employ similar method used in li et al 2015 and assume that monthly precipitation responds to climate indices with or without a time lag in addition the spearman correlation coefficients spearman 1987 between monthly precipitation and each climate index with an offset in time 0 1 12 are obtained to determine the optimal time lag with the maximum correlation coefficient let y s m l denote the climate index series at the corresponding time scale s with monthly precipitation x s m where l 0 1 12 is the lag time and l 0 means that precipitation responds to climate indices without a lag time thus for a given time scale s and month m the cumulative monthly precipitation sets x s m and 13 climate index datasets y s m l l 0 1 12 are prepared to obtain the optimal climate index series with optimal lag times by finding the offset times of the two series to determine the maximum correlation coefficient then the optimal climate indices series with strongest relationship with precipitation are used for the nspi computation 2 2 2 gamlss model in this study we apply the gamlss proposed by rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 to explain the relationship between drought and climate indices a gamlss model assumes that the observations yi are independent for i 1 2 n with the density function f y i θ i where θ i θ 1 i θ 2 i θ 3 i θ 4 i is a vector of the distribution parameters each of which can be a function of the explanatory variables the general gamlss model is defined as follows let y t y 1 y 2 y n be the n length vector of the response variable in addition let g k for k 1 2 be the known monotonic link functions relating the distribution parameters to the explanatory variables by 4 g k θ k η k x k β k j 1 j k h jk x jk where θ k is the vector of length n x k is a matrix n m of explanatory variables β k is a parameter vector of length m and the function h jk is an unknown function of the explanatory variable x jk for j 1 2 jk which can be a linear or nonlinear function i e smooth through cubic spline functions to increase the complexity and flexibility of the model the smoothing cubic spline function is considered in this study see rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 for detailed explanation the parameters θ k are estimated by the maximum likelihood estimation method mle rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 is used to evaluate the goodness of fit and avoid model overfitting 5 aic 2 k 2 ln l where k is the number of estimated parameters in the model and l is the maximum value of the likelihood function for the model in addition stepwise model selection is performed to help select explanatory variable terms by dropping or adding terms in distribution parameter to check if any of the existing terms can be left out to simplify the model and whether two way interactions of the existing terms are needed based on the chi square tests rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 all of the computations in this study are performed with the gamlss r package ihaka and gentleman 1996 available from cran of the r library 2 2 3 nspi calculation the nspi is constructed using a nonstationary gamma distribution by transforming precipitation time series into corresponding time series of probability values russo et al 2013 for fitting precipitation data to a nonstationary model the scale parameter of the gamma distribution is set as linearly or nonlinearly varying with time or climate indices thus for each month and time scale x s m t can be modeled as x s m t gamma k θ t with 6 θ t μ t k e x s m t k θ t μ t v a r x s m t k θ t 2 μ t 2 k where μ is the mean of gamma distribution in this study four models are considered to compare the different ways to model the standardized precipitation index a detailed description is shown in table 2 the shape parameter in gamma distribution is constant in this study to avoid large estimation uncertainty coles 2001 in fact using a varying scale parameter the means and variances of gamma distribution are also variant with time russo et al 2013 the parameter of gamma distribution is estimated by rigby and stasinopoulos algorithm rigby and stasinopoulos 1996 where b1 and b2 are constants b is a vector of length n c is the explanatory variables climate indices vector of length n h j is an unknown function cubic spline function in the gamlss r package of the explanatory variable c j for j 1 2 n mathematically the nspi is similar to the spi because they have similar calculation steps but the nspi is based on a nonstationary gamma distribution with a varying scale parameter hence the same drought classification for the nspi and spi is applied in this study table 1 3 study area and data 3 1 study area the yangtze river which is the longest and largest river in china originates from the tanggula range flows across 19 provinces from west to east and finally discharges into the east china sea the yangtze river basin yrb 24 5 n 90 122e covering a drainage area of approximately 1 8 million km2 is located in subtropical and temperate climate zones dominated by southeasterly monsoon winds the yrb is well known for its extreme precipitation events due to the unevenly distributed precipitation and population in this study the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river basin mlryrb 25 34 n 108 122 e fig 1 are selected as the case study area as this region has frequently suffered from severe droughts since 2000 tian et al 2016 the mlryrb are an important source of water and comprise a significant economic center in china with the average annual temperature between 14 and 18 c and the average annual precipitation between 1000 and 1400 mm the precipitation in this region is mainly concentrated in spring and summer over the past 20 years droughts have intensified in south china the mlryrb suffered from severe droughts in 2001 2004 2007 and 2011 which had great impacts on the population production industries and regional ecology 3 2 data monthly precipitation data covering the period of 1961 2015 are acquired from the gridded monthly precipitation dataset 0 5 0 5 provided by the national meteorological information center http data cma cn three climate indices are considered to demonstrate the effects of climate change on drought in the mlryrb i e the nino3 the pdo and the ao the data are collected from https www esrl noaa gov psd data climateindices list 4 results and discussion 4 1 selection of the optimal nonstationary model four models are constructed for each pixel and month using the gridded monthly precipitation datasets to calculate the spi or nspi at the time scale of 3 months to evaluate the performance of each model the areal averaged aic values of the four models in each month were computed table 3 it can be seen that model 3 can be regarded as the optimal model as the aic value is the smallest for all 12 months as similarly illustrated in fig 2 model 0 and model 1 have similar performances as the difference in the aic between these two models is quite small indicating that only parameter changing with time cannot evidently improve the performance of statistical modeling for precipitation time series the smaller aic values of model 2 and model 3 than model 0 indicate the better performance of the nonstationary model than the stationary model in addition the better performance of model 3 than model 2 indicate that the distribution parameters varying as a nonlinear function of climate indices gives the best fit of monthly precipitation in the mlryrb than the other models with parameters constantly or linearly varying with time and climate indices to further compare the efficiencies of the four models spatially we depict the spatial distribution of the difference in aic value for all months among the four models in fig 3 fig 3 shows that model 1 with time varying parameters performs worse than the stationary model 0 in most pixels especially in october in most pixels at all months the aic values of model 3 with climate indices as covariates are smaller than that of model 0 indicating that model 3 can better describe the changes in precipitation in the mlryrb compared to model 0 model 1 with distribution parameters varying as a function of time seems to be unsuitable to fit the monthly precipitation in the mlryrb since its aic value is larger than model 0 in almost all the pixels this is consistent with li et al 2015 who found slight differences between the stationary model with constant distribution parameters and the nonstationary model with distribution parameters varying with time in the luanhe river basin of china however li et al 2015 emphasized more on the linear relationship between the climate covariates and parameters and our study further suggests that the consideration of the nonlinear relationship in model 3 can obtain a better performance in the majority of the mlryrb compared to the linear relationship in model 2 model 3 gives the optimal performance for the nonstationary modeling of precipitation as it considers climate indices as nonlinear covariates which can provide useful information for drought assessment when considering nonstationarity by incorporating climate indices into the distribution parameter the nonstationary spi may reveal the realistic drought conditions with comparison to the traditional spi under the assumption of stationarity li et al 2015 similar proofs can also be seen in the studies on the nonstationarity analysis of precipitation and floods lópez and francés 2013 xiong et al 2015 zeng et al 2017 in which the nonstationary model with climate indices as covariates is proven to be more robust than the stationary model additionally due to the incorporation of climate variability into the nonstationary model model 3 shows a stronger physical mechanism and is more effective than model 1 which only uses time as a covariate li et al 2015 also indicated that the ability of the time dependent model is questionable to some extent regarding accurate drought assessment under climate change because of the limitations that identified linear monotonic trends may be better characterized as an abrupt shift or could be part of a larger cycle not evident in the period of record most importantly the nonlinear dependence of the distribution parameters on the climate indices can be expected to give better performance than the linear dependence in the nonstationary model as presented in gao et al 2017 hao et al 2019 um et al 2017 and the current study moreover we also examine the efficiency of model 3 at other time scales e g 6 months and 12 months which also indicates that the best performance of model 3 compared with model 0 model 1 and model 2 the details can be found in tables s1 s2 figs s1 and s2 in the supplementary materials due to the inefficiency of model 1 with time dependent parameters the rest part of this study mainly focuses on the analysis of the model 0 model 2 and model 3 referred to spi nspi l nspi with linear dependence and nspi nl nspi with nonlinear dependence respectively hereafter 4 2 identification of significant climate indices the significance of the relationship between the climate indices and precipitation is tested by the stepwise selection method in all months and the results are shown in fig 4 it is found that the three candidate climate indices all show good relationships with precipitation in different months as shown in fig 4 nino3 is selected as the significant climate index in the majority of pixels for most months except august september and october the ao dominantly affects a large portion of the area in january february march august september and october and the pdo is regarded as a crucial impact factor for precipitation in most of the area in march april and may in general the nino3 index which is used to indicate the influence of el niño on precipitation can be regarded as a key factor with great impact on precipitation in the mlryrb this is consistent with findings in previous studies feng et al 2010 wang et al 2018 yuan and yang 2012 additionally most selected climate indices in the stepwise method exhibit a nonlinear structure with distribution parameters indicating that the nonlinear dependence of distribution parameters on climate indices considered in the nonstationary model can give a better model performance for monthly precipitation than linear dependence for example the formula for a randomly selected pixel 30 n 114 5 e center pixel coordinates in october is fitted as μ cs nino3 cs pdo cs ao where cs represents the cubic spline function 4 3 efficiency of the spi nspi l and nspi nl in capturing the typical drought events in this study we choose three historical occurred severe drought events in 1978 2001 and 2011 to evaluate the performances of the spi nspi l and nspi nl in the study area here droughts are classified into five categories according to table 1 figs 5 to 7 present the drought propagation processes and the spatial distribution of the differences among spi nspi l and nspi nl values in each month at all pixels overall we can find that all the three drought indices can capture the three historical occurred drought events with similar drought propagation in spatial nevertheless the differences in the values of drought indices are significant in some pixels and exhibit obvious spatial variability at all three typical drought events the details are illustrated below in 1978 severe spring summer drought occurred in the mlryrb which is considered to be one of the top six extreme droughts from 1300 to 2010 liu 2017 the annual precipitation in 1978 was 30 to 50 less than the long term average level as shown in fig 5 both the nspi l and nspi nl show more severe drought conditions than the spi in most months except april and november in march both of the nonstationary models capture more severe droughts than the stationary model in the southern area of the study area however in the northwestern part of the basin only the nspi nl shows more severe drought than the spi additionally the nspi nl indicates more severe drought condition than the nspi l over the whole basin in march the severe drought event in 2001 was occurred almost in the whole china with affected drought area approximately 38 46 million hectares and it is the third largest drought area since 1949 the first and second largest is 2000 and 1978 respectively http www weather com cn zt kpzt 1244064 shtml this severe drought event can also be detected by the spi nspi l and nspi nl in the mlryrb during april to november fig 6 and it has exerted huge negative influence to the water resources management human lives and ecosystems in the study area for example it was reported that the water level at the shashi hydrological station which is located in the jinjiang river section of the middle reaches of the yangtze river on july 29 2001 is the lowest since 1903 liu 2017 the drought propagation process of all three drought indices in fig 6 shows that the drought originated from the northern part gradually propagated to the central part and finally covered the whole basin however slight difference can be observed among the three indices at most months along the entire study area in march spi with smaller value indicates a more severe drought condition than nspi l and nspi nl in a small part of the southern basin in november it can be seen that both the nspi l and nspi nl suggest more severe drought condition than the spi in the western basin the 2011 drought was a record breaking event in mlryzb over the past six decades li et al 2012 it was reported that more than 3 million hectares of crops were destroyed and more than 3 million people and 0 95 million livestock were short of drinking water liu 2017 as shown in fig 7 this extreme drought event mainly occurred from october 2010 to june 2011 and almost covered the whole basin area in addition from january to march the drought condition given by spi is more severe compared to that by the nspi l and nspi nl in the northern part while in april more severe drought condition was identified by the nspi l and nspi nl than the spi in the north western part of the basin as a whole the nonstationary drought indices nspi nl and nspi l exhibits similar drought propagation processes to the stationary drought index spi indicating the consistent capability to capture the occurred drought events however the comparison of the three historical occurred drought events indicates that the three drought indices may even present different level of drought conditions in some regions when the absolute difference of drought index value is larger than 0 5 this indicates that the risk assessment and return period estimation using spi nspi l and nspi nl will lead to different results unlike spi with precipitation as single dominant factor in the occurrence and evaluation of drought by considering the possible influences of climate indices that are modulated by internal interactions of the atmosphere and feedback from the oceans and land surface nspi nl appears to be more appropriate for drought assessment under a changing condition 4 4 comparison of spi nspi l and nspi nl in typical pixels for the drought in 2011 to better investigate the differences among the three indices we present the time series of drought index in the three selected pixels pixel 1 32 25 n 110 25 e in northwest hubei province pixel 2 31 75 n 113 25 e in northern hubei province and pixel 3 25 75 n 115 75 e in southern jiangxi province in 2011 see fig 1 and fig 8 as a whole the similar temporal behavior in fig 8 indicates the good consistency of the three drought indices in describing the drought propagation process however the drought severity given by the three drought indices exists evident differences in some months for example the drought condition in april 2011 is assigned to be severe drought by spi 1 88 while be an extreme drought by nspi l 2 42 and nspi nl 2 49 at pixel 1 for may 2011 the drought condition is extreme by all three drought indices spi 2 19 nspi l 2 63 and nspi nl 2 70 but the nspi l and nspi nl gives a more severe drought condition than spi as for pixel 2 nspi l 1 92 and nspi nl 1 92 indicate a severe drought while spi 1 49 shows a moderate drought in april 2011 according to history records given by duan et al 2012 hubei province was attacked by an extreme drought event during april to may 2011 we can find that the results given by nspi nl is more reliable than spi as for pixel 3 located in southern jiangxi province it is identified as a moderate drought category by spi 1 07 but a slight drought class as categorized by nspi l 0 69 and nspi nl 0 69 in may 2011 duan et al 2012 pointed out that the drought condition showed a recovery in southern jiangxi province with slight drought in early may 2011 it can be seen that the results of nonstationary drought indices are more consistent with history record the comparisons from the three typical pixels all indicate the better performance of nontstationary drought indices than the stationary index in capturing the drought conditions fig 9 demonstrates the disparities in the probability density function pdf of the spi nspi l and nspi nl over 12 months in 2011 at the previous three selected pixels evident differences can be observed in the pdf for example in january february april at pixel 1 in january february april may at pixel 2 and from mar to june at pixel 3 which correspond to differences of the drought indices series shown in fig 8 taking the month of april at pixel 1 as instance the three curves indicate large differences in the mean values among the three indices resulting in a slighter drought of spi compared with nspi l and nspi nl in fig 8 the pdf curve of selected pixels indicates clearly difference among the three drought indices representing the difference of statistic models the aic difference among the statistic models to fit precipitation series in figs 2 and 3 indicates that the nonstationary model with nonlinear dependence model 3 performs best lowest aic value which means that model 3 can provide the best probability distribution to reflect precipitation change overall the nonstationarity of precipitation cannot be ignored in drought assessment under climate change since remarkable difference is observed between traditional drought index spi and nonstationary drought indices nspi l nspi nl in the mlryrb 4 5 performances of spi nspi l and nspi nl in the evaluation of extreme drought potential future changes in extreme el niño occurrences could severely disrupt global weather patterns affecting the hydrologic cycle including changes in precipitation and increases in the frequency of extreme events such as droughts cai et al 2014 sheffield and wood 2008 the occurrence frequency of extreme droughts i e the drought index value is lower than 2 0 is individually computed by the spi nspi l and nspi nl the long term drought index series are divided into three parts to reflect the efficiency of the assessment of interannual variations in extreme drought frequency among the indices as illustrated in figs 10 and 11 a higher frequency of extreme drought is obtained based on nonstationary models than stationary model in a majority of the basin in addition the middle east region of the basin suffers from a lower frequency of extreme droughts based on the nonstationary models compared to the stationary model in 1961 1980 while this region experiences higher frequency of extreme droughts in later years moreover a higher frequency of extreme drought identified by the nspi nl with nonlinear dependence than the nspi l with linear dependence in the nonstationary model occurs from 1961 to 1980 but decreases from 1981 to 2000 and finally increases from 2001 to 2015 cai et al 2014 claimed that the large increase in extreme el niño events induced by greenhouse gases could lead to the increased occurrence of devastating weather events resulting in pronounced implications for the twenty first century climate as a result of climate change in recent decades the drought index considering nonstationarity of precipitation nspi l and nspi nl seems to be more appropriate for drought assessments than the stationary index spi especially for extreme drought furthermore the nonlinear dependence is somewhat more advantageous than linear dependence in nonstationary models 5 discussion the traditional spi is widely used in drought assessment and monitoring due to the fundamental strength that it can be calculated for a variety of time scales and thus to monitor not only short term water supplies but long term water resources mishra and singh 2010 it is generated by fitting precipitation series to gamma distribution with different parameters for each pixel to obtain accurate simulation of precipitation data on the other hand nspi attempts to get more accurate fit for the precipitation time series by using the nonstationary gamma distribution because it is generally known that a better fit of the precipitation can provide more reliable assessment of drought however spi only uses the sole variable of precipitation while nspi incorporates the impact of climate indices russo et al 2013 suggests that since the spi is a normalized measure relative to a specific location and period it has the advantage that its values are climatologically consistent for any location on the other hand one of the disadvantages of the spi is that it cannot be used for a comparison between different time periods which is required to assess the impact of climate change from the point of regional distribution of climate indices in nonstationary model the different climate indices that have significant influence on regional precipitation seem to show certain spatial patterns as shown in fig 4 thus it might be appropriate to calculate nspi values that are generated from different models using different climate indices and equations essentially spi and nspi are defined and calculated based on similar methodologies and their values have the same statistical meaning they share some common merits 1 straightforward calculation procedures 2 flexible time scales 3 comparability through space and time the results of nspi can be interpreted as the combined impact of temporally relative shortage on precipitation and the large scale climate patterns in the future work more emphasis can be focused on constructing the drought index by a nonstationary model incorporating the same climate indices as covariates with consistent structure in a typical region or considering the covariates of human induced factor wang et al 2015 indicated that it is reasonable to assume that the correlations of time dependent standardized precipitation index with different types of drought would be similar to those of spi moreover compared to spi based on a stationary gamma distribution the developed nspi in this study took account significant nonstationaritis by incorporating climate indices into nonstationary model under climate change in view of nonstationary conditions the pdf of precipitation would vary with time correspondingly as the time varying climate covariates li et al 2016 salas and obeysekera 2014 wang et al 2015 hence the developed nspi can respond to the evolution of the pdf over time showing to be more robust and proper than traditional spi for drought assessments under climate change in conclusion we suggest that when the monthly precipitation is nonstationarily changing the nspi nl with the better fit of precipitation time series will give a more reliable description of drought condition and the propagation process there is an important point for understanding results when non stationarity is considered for calculating procedure of spi as using time varying parameters for probability distribution or changing return period park et al 2019 for different times we fit probability distribution with different scale parameters for example for a long term precipitation series with decreasing trend the probability distribution fitted for recent precipitation moves left compared with that for past precipitation due to a decreasing scale parameter and consequently larger non exceedance probability of the cumulated precipitation at same months scale is obtained resulting in milder drought by nspi in recent years than past that is to say when considering the nonstationarity decreasing trend of precipitation nspi shows milder drought than spi as time transitions from the past to the present park et al 2019 suggested that the statistically developed nonstationary methods for meteorological drought still cannot be effectively understood for preparing disaster of hydrological agricultural drought because such realistic conditions like sensitive emotions of stakeholders for drought and some certain threshold precipitation for water supply should be taken into consideration another issue should be addressed is that the developed nspi in this study only considers the nonstationarity in precipitation which is the sole input variable for the spi s calculation in this regard due to the adopted climate indices include more information than the sole precipitation the nspi is expanded in ways not only breaking stationary assumption but also containing additional information while focusing on the other widely used drought indices such as pdsi and spei which considers more variables in their computation the nonstationarity in the other variable can also be considered in the future work for example because spei uses both precipitation and potential evapotranspiration vicente serrano et al 2010 we think spei will react differently in arid and semi arid regions bazrafshan 2017 even the amounts of precipitation are the same which highlights the importance of the consideration of nonstationarity in the pet and its impact on drought assessment bazrafshan and hejabi 2018 have investigated the capability of a time varying non stationary reconnaissance drought index nrdi based on both precipitation and evapotranspiration factors for drought monitoring in a changing climate but there are rare studies on developing nonstationary multiscalar drought index such as spei rdi incorporating large scale climatic signals as covariates thus the future work can focus on the construction of nonstationary drought index based on multivariables such as precipitation evapotranspiration temperature and etc with the consideration of large scale climatic signals or other physical influencing factors for drought assessment under changing environment 6 conclusion in this study a nonstationary standardized precipitation index nspi is developed to assess drought conditions the nspi is based on the traditional spi by fitting the cumulative precipitation to a nonstationary gamma distribution in which the scale parameter varies nonlinearly with climate indices using the gamlss the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin are selected as the case study area to compare the efficiency of the nspi with the traditional standardized precipitation index spi the main conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 by comparing the performances of different models including the stationary model and the nonstationary model with distribution parameters varying with time or climate indices it is concluded that the nonstationary model with climate indices as the covariates performed better than the other models with constant or time dependent parameters which has been found in previous studies in addition the main contribution of this study is that the constructed nspi in the nonstationary model considering nonlinear dependence of the distribution parameter with climate indices shows better performance than that with linear dependence and is more robust and suitable for drought monitoring 2 the results of the stepwise method show the significant association of the changes in monthly precipitation with nino3 reflecting the influence of enso on precipitation and the capabilities of the pdo nino3 ao to describe the observed variability in precipitation in the mlryrb it is also found that most selected climate indices are nonlinear terms showing that the nonlinear dependence of the distribution parameters on the climate indices considered in the nonstationary model can give better modeling results for monthly precipitation than linear dependence 3 comparisons between the spi and nspi for three extreme drought events in spatial distribution and typically for extreme drought in 2011 at three selected pixels reveal that all three drought indices can well capture drought propagation in the study area and nonstationary drought indices are more consistent with history record the observed marked differences between traditional drought index spi and nonstationary drought indices nspi l nspi nl indicate the nonstationarity of precipitation is unignorable in drought assessment under climate change 4 the frequency of extreme drought by nonstationary models is higher than that by stationary model in recent decades reflecting the influence of nonstationarity on extreme droughts the difference in the evaluation of interannual variations in extreme drought frequency between the nonstationary models shows more benefits when assuming nonlinear dependence compared to assuming linear dependence the developed nspi with nonlinear dependence on climate indices in the nonstationary model has a sufficient capacity for drought assessment and the drought risk management under climate change and we believe that it can provide useful information for the development of mitigation and adaptation strategies credit authorship contribution statement zhihong song

5361,the widely used probability based drought indices for drought characterization usually underlie the assumption of the considered hydrometeorological variables to be stationary which is largely challenged under the current global change incorporating the parameters of probability distribution with covariates such as time or climate indices has become a common way to develop drought index considering nonstationarity however most previous drought studies emphasized more on the linear relationship between distribution parameters and related covariates which may neglect the inherent nonlinear relationship and lost useful information for drought assessment our study aims to develop a nonstationary standardized precipitation index nspi with distribution parameters nonlinearly varying with potential influencing climate indices the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin mlryrb of china are selected as the case study area to examine the performance of the nspi with the performance of the traditional standardized precipitation index spi results indicate that the nspi with climate indices as covariates is more robust than both the nspi with time as the covariate and the traditional spi furthermore the nonlinear dependence of distribution parameters on climate indices considered in the nonstationary model can be more suitable for drought assessment than the linear dependence of distribution parameters besides there exists a higher frequency of extreme drought by the nspi than the spi in recent decades in most regions of the mlryrb although the nspi is a little computationally expensive with more required inputs of climate variables it can depict the influence of changing environment on the drought occurrence thus can be a feasible alternative for drought assessment considering nonstationarity in view of future change and provide valuable support for further studies keywords meteorological drought nonstationarity nonlinear dependence climate change standardized precipitation index 1 introduction drought which occurs as a result of climate extremes that are driven by both natural variability and human activities is a well known natural disaster that has enormous negative effects on water availability agriculture and ecosystems sheffield et al 2013 zargar et al 2011 for example the extreme drought event from october 2010 to june 2011 in the yangtze river basin of china has affected an area of approximately 800 000 km2 5 million people 1 million livestock and 3 million hectares of arable area and induced an economic loss of approximately 15 billion rmb during late 2011 and 2014 california experienced extreme drought leading to extensive groundwater overdraft agricultural losses cutbacks in hydroelectricity generation and a series of voluntary and mandatory urban water restrictions mann and gleick 2015 more specifically increases in the frequency or intensity of droughts have been detected in many areas worldwide liu et al 2018 ma et al 2019 tian et al 2018 and in some cases have been attributed to climate change pachauri et al 2014 overall droughts have become a topic of focus for scientists and governments around the world aryal and zhu 2019 liu et al 2018 ma et al 2019 sam et al 2019 sheffield and wood 2006 tian et al 2018 to date precisely defining drought is still a difficult task because the occurrence of drought is influenced by multiple factors such as meteorology hydrology and socioeconomic factors and the stochastic nature of water demands in different regions mishra and singh 2010 generally drought refers to a deficit in water supply i e deficits in precipitation runoff and so on world meteorological organization wmo 1986 many definitions of drought have been proposed and can be generally classified into four types american meteorological society ams 2004 wilhite and glantz 1985 including meteorological hydrological agricultural and socioeconomic drought to date a large number of drought indices have been developed among which the probabilistic drought indices have been widely used because of their simplicity and effectiveness in drought assessment aghakouchak 2014 cheval 2015 hao and aghakouchak 2013 vicente serrano et al 2012 vicente serrano et al 2010 for instance the standardized precipitation index spi which was first proposed by mckee et al 1993 is a widespread meteorological drought index that transforms the precipitation variable into a standardized value using the gamma distribution and inverse standard normal distribution the major advantages of the spi are its simplicity in computation and its ability to reveal drought in a multiscale way cheval 2015 probabilistic drought indices are also applied to hydrological and agricultural droughts including the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index tao et al 2014 vicente serrano et al 2010 the standardized runoff index shukla and wood 2008 the standardized streamflow index vicente serrano et al 2012 and the standardized soil moisture index aghakouchak 2014 these abovementioned probabilistic drought indices are all based on the underlying assumption that the hydrological processes and meteorological time series are stationary however milly et al 2008 claimed that such an assumption of stationarity is questionable with the influences of human disturbances natural climate changes and low frequency internal variability therefore the nonstationarity of hydrological and meteorological variables which can be defined as sequences with significant trends abrupt changes or periodicity salas 1993 has been emphasized by many studies recently cancelliere 2017 lópez and francés 2013 razmi et al 2017 salas and obeysekera 2014 vasiliades et al 2015 villarini et al 2010 xiong 2015 zeng et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 in the perspective of meteorological drought research russo et al 2013 indicated that the most widely used spi which is based on the stationary gamma distribution may lose its effectiveness in modelling time series longer than about 30 years because the precipitation time series cannot be stationary and cannot be modeled with a stationary distribution due to the expected significant climate change signal for the time series longer than 30 years therefore some researchers have used nonstationary models to assess drought which assume that the scale parameter of the candidate distribution related to the drought variables changes with time bazrafshan and hejabi 2018 park et al 2019 russo et al 2013 salvi and ghosh 2016 wang et al 2015 in fact similar studies have been widely performed in terms of extreme precipitation and floods in which the parameter of the candidate probability distribution is dependent on time clarke 2002 cunderlik and ouarda 2006 kharin and zwiers 2005 salas and obeysekera 2014 or some physical covariates e g climate indices adlouni et al 2007 agilan and umamahesh 2017 lima et al 2015 lópez and francés 2013 razmi et al 2017 su and chen 2019 vasiliades et al 2015 villarini et al 2009 xiong et al 2015 zeng et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 the generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss proposed by rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 is a frequently used semi parametric regression model that characterizes nonstationarity by constructing linear or nonlinear functions between parameters and explanatory variables compared to broad applications of the gamlss in investigating the nonlinear structure of the nonstationarity of extreme precipitation and floods events gu et al 2019 hao et al 2019 lópez and francés 2013 zhang et al 2015 most previous studies that focused on nonstationarity in probabilistic drought indices pay more attention to the linear relationship between parameters and covariates e g time and climate indices for example russo et al 2013 proposed the nonstationary standardized precipitation indices snspi which has been found to be more robust than the traditional spi in the projection of precipitation changes under global warming in europe salvi and ghosh 2016 claimed that the snspi was able to produce realistic frequencies of meteorological extremes when incorporating climate change in the scale parameter and that it showed less sensitivity to the selected reference period wang et al 2015 proposed a time dependent standardized precipitation index spit that described the distribution parameter as an optimized polynomial function that accounted for the possible nonlinear behaviors of observations over time and implied that the nonstationarity of hydrological time series cannot be overlooked in drought assessment li et al 2015 found that the nonstationary model with the time varying scale parameter showed a slight difference from the stationary model and may be inappropriate in some regions they developed a nonstationary standardized precipitation index with large scale climate signals as covariates southern oscillation index atlantic multidecadal oscillation and north atlantic oscillation which showed to be more robust compared with the traditional spi however many studies have indicated that the relationship between parameters of probability distributions and covariates should be nonlinear because of the changing environment and intensive human activities lópez and francés 2013 um et al 2017 thus assuming a linear relationship between distribution parameters and related covariates in drought assessment may probably neglect the inherent nonlinear relationship and lose useful information for drought identification the referred proofs can be seen in lópez and francés 2013 and hao et al 2019 who suggested that the consideration of a nonlinear relationship between the parameter and the covariates can provide a better description of the changes in extreme precipitation or floods therefore interests have arisen regarding whether the consideration of nonlinear dependence of the distribution parameters on explanatory variables can give a better description of drought assessments in this study we aim to develop a nonstationary standardized precipitation index nspi based on the traditional spi with the scale parameter nonlinearly varying with climate indices which is anticipated to comprehensively describe the relationship between drought and climate change under the changing environment the gamlss model and stepwise method are employed to help constructing the nonstationary gamma distribution by selecting the most significant climate variables that influence the changes in parameters of traditional gamma distribution then the nonstationary gamma distribution with its scale parameter as a function of the determined climate variables and time is fitted to compute the nspi the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river basin mlryrb are chosen as the case study to examine the efficiency of the developed nspi with the comparison to the spi 2 methodology 2 1 calculation of the standardized precipitation index the spi which was first proposed by mckee et al 1993 is a commonly used index to characterize meteorological drought the calculation procedure of the spi is given below a given a certain time scale s the cumulative precipitation at the mth month during different years is calculated by 1 x s m t i g s 1 g x i g 12 t 1 m where x is the monthly precipitation series of n years t 1 2 n represents the yearly index and m is a specific month such as january february december b the cumulative precipitation series are fitted by a probability density function as recommended by mckee et al 1993 the gamma distribution is used in this study x s m gamma k θ 2 f x s m k θ 1 θ k γ k x s m k 1 e x s m θ x s m 0 where k and θ are the shape and scale parameters respectively and γ is the gamma function c then the cumulative probability of a particular precipitation event for a given time scale and month is computed the spi value is acquired by transforming the cumulative probability distribution into a standard normal distribution with a mean of zero and a variance of one via the following equation 3 x p φ 1 p where x p is the quantile value of the cumulative probability p and φ 1 is the inverse function of the cumulative distribution function cdf of the standard normal distribution φ the spi drought classification is listed in table 1 2 2 construction of the nonstationary standardized precipitation index conventional spi generally fit the precipitation data to a stationary model with constant distribution parameters according to russo et al 2013 the precipitation time series may be nonstationary changed because of the influence from the possible significant climate change signal when the length of the time series is longer than 30 years in this study some frequently used climate indices are used to represent the influences of climate change signal and they are incorporated into the nonstationary model based on the gamlss framework to construct a nonstationary meteorological drought index based on spi the main steps to construct the nspi are as follows 1 select suitable climate indices that have a close correlation with precipitation to represent the influences of climate change 2 fit a nonstationary gamma distribution for precipitation with the distribution parameter nonlinearly varying with climate indices 3 apply the stepwise method to select significant explanatory variables to simplify the model 4 finally transform the cumulative probability of a particular precipitation event into a standard normal distribution with a mean of zero and variance of one 2 2 1 climate index selection it is widely recognized that climatic oscillations such as the el niño southern oscillation enso pacific decadal oscillation pdo and arctic oscillation ao can significantly influence droughts in china li et al 2016 qian et al 2014 enso considered in this study refers to nino3 index sea surface temperature anomalies averaged in the nino3 region 5 s 5 n 90 150 w many studies have indicated that the existence of a high correlation between south china rainfall and sea surface temperature sst anomalies reflected by nino3 index wang et al 2018 li et al 2007 also found that the sea surface temperature anomalies sstas in the tropical indian ocean and tropical pacific ocean have a significant impact on rainfall in the following june in the yangtze river basin based on the indian ocean dipole iod index and nino3 index 5 s 5 n 150 90 w the strong correlation between precipitation anomalies in the yangtze river basin and ao has also been reported in several studies gong et al 2002 wei 2006 qian and zhou 2013 suggested that significant negative correlations exsit between the palmer drought severity index pdsi and pdo in north china xiao et al 2015 analyzed the teleconnections of enso north atlantic oscillation nao iod and the pdo with seasonal precipitation regimes over the yangtze river basin and found that enso was the leading driving factor of precipitation variability over the basin and that spring precipitation was influenced by the pdo and enso therefore the pdo nino3 and the ao are capable of describing the observed variability in precipitation in the mlryrb and these three candidate climate indices pdo ao and nino3 are selected to reflect the impacts of climate change on droughts he and guan 2013 pointed out that time lags should be considered in studies of the correlation between precipitation anomalies and large scale climatic indices and li et al 2015 considered different lead times when selecting climate indices affecting drought occurrence in the luanhe river basin in this study we employ similar method used in li et al 2015 and assume that monthly precipitation responds to climate indices with or without a time lag in addition the spearman correlation coefficients spearman 1987 between monthly precipitation and each climate index with an offset in time 0 1 12 are obtained to determine the optimal time lag with the maximum correlation coefficient let y s m l denote the climate index series at the corresponding time scale s with monthly precipitation x s m where l 0 1 12 is the lag time and l 0 means that precipitation responds to climate indices without a lag time thus for a given time scale s and month m the cumulative monthly precipitation sets x s m and 13 climate index datasets y s m l l 0 1 12 are prepared to obtain the optimal climate index series with optimal lag times by finding the offset times of the two series to determine the maximum correlation coefficient then the optimal climate indices series with strongest relationship with precipitation are used for the nspi computation 2 2 2 gamlss model in this study we apply the gamlss proposed by rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 to explain the relationship between drought and climate indices a gamlss model assumes that the observations yi are independent for i 1 2 n with the density function f y i θ i where θ i θ 1 i θ 2 i θ 3 i θ 4 i is a vector of the distribution parameters each of which can be a function of the explanatory variables the general gamlss model is defined as follows let y t y 1 y 2 y n be the n length vector of the response variable in addition let g k for k 1 2 be the known monotonic link functions relating the distribution parameters to the explanatory variables by 4 g k θ k η k x k β k j 1 j k h jk x jk where θ k is the vector of length n x k is a matrix n m of explanatory variables β k is a parameter vector of length m and the function h jk is an unknown function of the explanatory variable x jk for j 1 2 jk which can be a linear or nonlinear function i e smooth through cubic spline functions to increase the complexity and flexibility of the model the smoothing cubic spline function is considered in this study see rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 for detailed explanation the parameters θ k are estimated by the maximum likelihood estimation method mle rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 is used to evaluate the goodness of fit and avoid model overfitting 5 aic 2 k 2 ln l where k is the number of estimated parameters in the model and l is the maximum value of the likelihood function for the model in addition stepwise model selection is performed to help select explanatory variable terms by dropping or adding terms in distribution parameter to check if any of the existing terms can be left out to simplify the model and whether two way interactions of the existing terms are needed based on the chi square tests rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 all of the computations in this study are performed with the gamlss r package ihaka and gentleman 1996 available from cran of the r library 2 2 3 nspi calculation the nspi is constructed using a nonstationary gamma distribution by transforming precipitation time series into corresponding time series of probability values russo et al 2013 for fitting precipitation data to a nonstationary model the scale parameter of the gamma distribution is set as linearly or nonlinearly varying with time or climate indices thus for each month and time scale x s m t can be modeled as x s m t gamma k θ t with 6 θ t μ t k e x s m t k θ t μ t v a r x s m t k θ t 2 μ t 2 k where μ is the mean of gamma distribution in this study four models are considered to compare the different ways to model the standardized precipitation index a detailed description is shown in table 2 the shape parameter in gamma distribution is constant in this study to avoid large estimation uncertainty coles 2001 in fact using a varying scale parameter the means and variances of gamma distribution are also variant with time russo et al 2013 the parameter of gamma distribution is estimated by rigby and stasinopoulos algorithm rigby and stasinopoulos 1996 where b1 and b2 are constants b is a vector of length n c is the explanatory variables climate indices vector of length n h j is an unknown function cubic spline function in the gamlss r package of the explanatory variable c j for j 1 2 n mathematically the nspi is similar to the spi because they have similar calculation steps but the nspi is based on a nonstationary gamma distribution with a varying scale parameter hence the same drought classification for the nspi and spi is applied in this study table 1 3 study area and data 3 1 study area the yangtze river which is the longest and largest river in china originates from the tanggula range flows across 19 provinces from west to east and finally discharges into the east china sea the yangtze river basin yrb 24 5 n 90 122e covering a drainage area of approximately 1 8 million km2 is located in subtropical and temperate climate zones dominated by southeasterly monsoon winds the yrb is well known for its extreme precipitation events due to the unevenly distributed precipitation and population in this study the middle and lower reaches of yangtze river basin mlryrb 25 34 n 108 122 e fig 1 are selected as the case study area as this region has frequently suffered from severe droughts since 2000 tian et al 2016 the mlryrb are an important source of water and comprise a significant economic center in china with the average annual temperature between 14 and 18 c and the average annual precipitation between 1000 and 1400 mm the precipitation in this region is mainly concentrated in spring and summer over the past 20 years droughts have intensified in south china the mlryrb suffered from severe droughts in 2001 2004 2007 and 2011 which had great impacts on the population production industries and regional ecology 3 2 data monthly precipitation data covering the period of 1961 2015 are acquired from the gridded monthly precipitation dataset 0 5 0 5 provided by the national meteorological information center http data cma cn three climate indices are considered to demonstrate the effects of climate change on drought in the mlryrb i e the nino3 the pdo and the ao the data are collected from https www esrl noaa gov psd data climateindices list 4 results and discussion 4 1 selection of the optimal nonstationary model four models are constructed for each pixel and month using the gridded monthly precipitation datasets to calculate the spi or nspi at the time scale of 3 months to evaluate the performance of each model the areal averaged aic values of the four models in each month were computed table 3 it can be seen that model 3 can be regarded as the optimal model as the aic value is the smallest for all 12 months as similarly illustrated in fig 2 model 0 and model 1 have similar performances as the difference in the aic between these two models is quite small indicating that only parameter changing with time cannot evidently improve the performance of statistical modeling for precipitation time series the smaller aic values of model 2 and model 3 than model 0 indicate the better performance of the nonstationary model than the stationary model in addition the better performance of model 3 than model 2 indicate that the distribution parameters varying as a nonlinear function of climate indices gives the best fit of monthly precipitation in the mlryrb than the other models with parameters constantly or linearly varying with time and climate indices to further compare the efficiencies of the four models spatially we depict the spatial distribution of the difference in aic value for all months among the four models in fig 3 fig 3 shows that model 1 with time varying parameters performs worse than the stationary model 0 in most pixels especially in october in most pixels at all months the aic values of model 3 with climate indices as covariates are smaller than that of model 0 indicating that model 3 can better describe the changes in precipitation in the mlryrb compared to model 0 model 1 with distribution parameters varying as a function of time seems to be unsuitable to fit the monthly precipitation in the mlryrb since its aic value is larger than model 0 in almost all the pixels this is consistent with li et al 2015 who found slight differences between the stationary model with constant distribution parameters and the nonstationary model with distribution parameters varying with time in the luanhe river basin of china however li et al 2015 emphasized more on the linear relationship between the climate covariates and parameters and our study further suggests that the consideration of the nonlinear relationship in model 3 can obtain a better performance in the majority of the mlryrb compared to the linear relationship in model 2 model 3 gives the optimal performance for the nonstationary modeling of precipitation as it considers climate indices as nonlinear covariates which can provide useful information for drought assessment when considering nonstationarity by incorporating climate indices into the distribution parameter the nonstationary spi may reveal the realistic drought conditions with comparison to the traditional spi under the assumption of stationarity li et al 2015 similar proofs can also be seen in the studies on the nonstationarity analysis of precipitation and floods lópez and francés 2013 xiong et al 2015 zeng et al 2017 in which the nonstationary model with climate indices as covariates is proven to be more robust than the stationary model additionally due to the incorporation of climate variability into the nonstationary model model 3 shows a stronger physical mechanism and is more effective than model 1 which only uses time as a covariate li et al 2015 also indicated that the ability of the time dependent model is questionable to some extent regarding accurate drought assessment under climate change because of the limitations that identified linear monotonic trends may be better characterized as an abrupt shift or could be part of a larger cycle not evident in the period of record most importantly the nonlinear dependence of the distribution parameters on the climate indices can be expected to give better performance than the linear dependence in the nonstationary model as presented in gao et al 2017 hao et al 2019 um et al 2017 and the current study moreover we also examine the efficiency of model 3 at other time scales e g 6 months and 12 months which also indicates that the best performance of model 3 compared with model 0 model 1 and model 2 the details can be found in tables s1 s2 figs s1 and s2 in the supplementary materials due to the inefficiency of model 1 with time dependent parameters the rest part of this study mainly focuses on the analysis of the model 0 model 2 and model 3 referred to spi nspi l nspi with linear dependence and nspi nl nspi with nonlinear dependence respectively hereafter 4 2 identification of significant climate indices the significance of the relationship between the climate indices and precipitation is tested by the stepwise selection method in all months and the results are shown in fig 4 it is found that the three candidate climate indices all show good relationships with precipitation in different months as shown in fig 4 nino3 is selected as the significant climate index in the majority of pixels for most months except august september and october the ao dominantly affects a large portion of the area in january february march august september and october and the pdo is regarded as a crucial impact factor for precipitation in most of the area in march april and may in general the nino3 index which is used to indicate the influence of el niño on precipitation can be regarded as a key factor with great impact on precipitation in the mlryrb this is consistent with findings in previous studies feng et al 2010 wang et al 2018 yuan and yang 2012 additionally most selected climate indices in the stepwise method exhibit a nonlinear structure with distribution parameters indicating that the nonlinear dependence of distribution parameters on climate indices considered in the nonstationary model can give a better model performance for monthly precipitation than linear dependence for example the formula for a randomly selected pixel 30 n 114 5 e center pixel coordinates in october is fitted as μ cs nino3 cs pdo cs ao where cs represents the cubic spline function 4 3 efficiency of the spi nspi l and nspi nl in capturing the typical drought events in this study we choose three historical occurred severe drought events in 1978 2001 and 2011 to evaluate the performances of the spi nspi l and nspi nl in the study area here droughts are classified into five categories according to table 1 figs 5 to 7 present the drought propagation processes and the spatial distribution of the differences among spi nspi l and nspi nl values in each month at all pixels overall we can find that all the three drought indices can capture the three historical occurred drought events with similar drought propagation in spatial nevertheless the differences in the values of drought indices are significant in some pixels and exhibit obvious spatial variability at all three typical drought events the details are illustrated below in 1978 severe spring summer drought occurred in the mlryrb which is considered to be one of the top six extreme droughts from 1300 to 2010 liu 2017 the annual precipitation in 1978 was 30 to 50 less than the long term average level as shown in fig 5 both the nspi l and nspi nl show more severe drought conditions than the spi in most months except april and november in march both of the nonstationary models capture more severe droughts than the stationary model in the southern area of the study area however in the northwestern part of the basin only the nspi nl shows more severe drought than the spi additionally the nspi nl indicates more severe drought condition than the nspi l over the whole basin in march the severe drought event in 2001 was occurred almost in the whole china with affected drought area approximately 38 46 million hectares and it is the third largest drought area since 1949 the first and second largest is 2000 and 1978 respectively http www weather com cn zt kpzt 1244064 shtml this severe drought event can also be detected by the spi nspi l and nspi nl in the mlryrb during april to november fig 6 and it has exerted huge negative influence to the water resources management human lives and ecosystems in the study area for example it was reported that the water level at the shashi hydrological station which is located in the jinjiang river section of the middle reaches of the yangtze river on july 29 2001 is the lowest since 1903 liu 2017 the drought propagation process of all three drought indices in fig 6 shows that the drought originated from the northern part gradually propagated to the central part and finally covered the whole basin however slight difference can be observed among the three indices at most months along the entire study area in march spi with smaller value indicates a more severe drought condition than nspi l and nspi nl in a small part of the southern basin in november it can be seen that both the nspi l and nspi nl suggest more severe drought condition than the spi in the western basin the 2011 drought was a record breaking event in mlryzb over the past six decades li et al 2012 it was reported that more than 3 million hectares of crops were destroyed and more than 3 million people and 0 95 million livestock were short of drinking water liu 2017 as shown in fig 7 this extreme drought event mainly occurred from october 2010 to june 2011 and almost covered the whole basin area in addition from january to march the drought condition given by spi is more severe compared to that by the nspi l and nspi nl in the northern part while in april more severe drought condition was identified by the nspi l and nspi nl than the spi in the north western part of the basin as a whole the nonstationary drought indices nspi nl and nspi l exhibits similar drought propagation processes to the stationary drought index spi indicating the consistent capability to capture the occurred drought events however the comparison of the three historical occurred drought events indicates that the three drought indices may even present different level of drought conditions in some regions when the absolute difference of drought index value is larger than 0 5 this indicates that the risk assessment and return period estimation using spi nspi l and nspi nl will lead to different results unlike spi with precipitation as single dominant factor in the occurrence and evaluation of drought by considering the possible influences of climate indices that are modulated by internal interactions of the atmosphere and feedback from the oceans and land surface nspi nl appears to be more appropriate for drought assessment under a changing condition 4 4 comparison of spi nspi l and nspi nl in typical pixels for the drought in 2011 to better investigate the differences among the three indices we present the time series of drought index in the three selected pixels pixel 1 32 25 n 110 25 e in northwest hubei province pixel 2 31 75 n 113 25 e in northern hubei province and pixel 3 25 75 n 115 75 e in southern jiangxi province in 2011 see fig 1 and fig 8 as a whole the similar temporal behavior in fig 8 indicates the good consistency of the three drought indices in describing the drought propagation process however the drought severity given by the three drought indices exists evident differences in some months for example the drought condition in april 2011 is assigned to be severe drought by spi 1 88 while be an extreme drought by nspi l 2 42 and nspi nl 2 49 at pixel 1 for may 2011 the drought condition is extreme by all three drought indices spi 2 19 nspi l 2 63 and nspi nl 2 70 but the nspi l and nspi nl gives a more severe drought condition than spi as for pixel 2 nspi l 1 92 and nspi nl 1 92 indicate a severe drought while spi 1 49 shows a moderate drought in april 2011 according to history records given by duan et al 2012 hubei province was attacked by an extreme drought event during april to may 2011 we can find that the results given by nspi nl is more reliable than spi as for pixel 3 located in southern jiangxi province it is identified as a moderate drought category by spi 1 07 but a slight drought class as categorized by nspi l 0 69 and nspi nl 0 69 in may 2011 duan et al 2012 pointed out that the drought condition showed a recovery in southern jiangxi province with slight drought in early may 2011 it can be seen that the results of nonstationary drought indices are more consistent with history record the comparisons from the three typical pixels all indicate the better performance of nontstationary drought indices than the stationary index in capturing the drought conditions fig 9 demonstrates the disparities in the probability density function pdf of the spi nspi l and nspi nl over 12 months in 2011 at the previous three selected pixels evident differences can be observed in the pdf for example in january february april at pixel 1 in january february april may at pixel 2 and from mar to june at pixel 3 which correspond to differences of the drought indices series shown in fig 8 taking the month of april at pixel 1 as instance the three curves indicate large differences in the mean values among the three indices resulting in a slighter drought of spi compared with nspi l and nspi nl in fig 8 the pdf curve of selected pixels indicates clearly difference among the three drought indices representing the difference of statistic models the aic difference among the statistic models to fit precipitation series in figs 2 and 3 indicates that the nonstationary model with nonlinear dependence model 3 performs best lowest aic value which means that model 3 can provide the best probability distribution to reflect precipitation change overall the nonstationarity of precipitation cannot be ignored in drought assessment under climate change since remarkable difference is observed between traditional drought index spi and nonstationary drought indices nspi l nspi nl in the mlryrb 4 5 performances of spi nspi l and nspi nl in the evaluation of extreme drought potential future changes in extreme el niño occurrences could severely disrupt global weather patterns affecting the hydrologic cycle including changes in precipitation and increases in the frequency of extreme events such as droughts cai et al 2014 sheffield and wood 2008 the occurrence frequency of extreme droughts i e the drought index value is lower than 2 0 is individually computed by the spi nspi l and nspi nl the long term drought index series are divided into three parts to reflect the efficiency of the assessment of interannual variations in extreme drought frequency among the indices as illustrated in figs 10 and 11 a higher frequency of extreme drought is obtained based on nonstationary models than stationary model in a majority of the basin in addition the middle east region of the basin suffers from a lower frequency of extreme droughts based on the nonstationary models compared to the stationary model in 1961 1980 while this region experiences higher frequency of extreme droughts in later years moreover a higher frequency of extreme drought identified by the nspi nl with nonlinear dependence than the nspi l with linear dependence in the nonstationary model occurs from 1961 to 1980 but decreases from 1981 to 2000 and finally increases from 2001 to 2015 cai et al 2014 claimed that the large increase in extreme el niño events induced by greenhouse gases could lead to the increased occurrence of devastating weather events resulting in pronounced implications for the twenty first century climate as a result of climate change in recent decades the drought index considering nonstationarity of precipitation nspi l and nspi nl seems to be more appropriate for drought assessments than the stationary index spi especially for extreme drought furthermore the nonlinear dependence is somewhat more advantageous than linear dependence in nonstationary models 5 discussion the traditional spi is widely used in drought assessment and monitoring due to the fundamental strength that it can be calculated for a variety of time scales and thus to monitor not only short term water supplies but long term water resources mishra and singh 2010 it is generated by fitting precipitation series to gamma distribution with different parameters for each pixel to obtain accurate simulation of precipitation data on the other hand nspi attempts to get more accurate fit for the precipitation time series by using the nonstationary gamma distribution because it is generally known that a better fit of the precipitation can provide more reliable assessment of drought however spi only uses the sole variable of precipitation while nspi incorporates the impact of climate indices russo et al 2013 suggests that since the spi is a normalized measure relative to a specific location and period it has the advantage that its values are climatologically consistent for any location on the other hand one of the disadvantages of the spi is that it cannot be used for a comparison between different time periods which is required to assess the impact of climate change from the point of regional distribution of climate indices in nonstationary model the different climate indices that have significant influence on regional precipitation seem to show certain spatial patterns as shown in fig 4 thus it might be appropriate to calculate nspi values that are generated from different models using different climate indices and equations essentially spi and nspi are defined and calculated based on similar methodologies and their values have the same statistical meaning they share some common merits 1 straightforward calculation procedures 2 flexible time scales 3 comparability through space and time the results of nspi can be interpreted as the combined impact of temporally relative shortage on precipitation and the large scale climate patterns in the future work more emphasis can be focused on constructing the drought index by a nonstationary model incorporating the same climate indices as covariates with consistent structure in a typical region or considering the covariates of human induced factor wang et al 2015 indicated that it is reasonable to assume that the correlations of time dependent standardized precipitation index with different types of drought would be similar to those of spi moreover compared to spi based on a stationary gamma distribution the developed nspi in this study took account significant nonstationaritis by incorporating climate indices into nonstationary model under climate change in view of nonstationary conditions the pdf of precipitation would vary with time correspondingly as the time varying climate covariates li et al 2016 salas and obeysekera 2014 wang et al 2015 hence the developed nspi can respond to the evolution of the pdf over time showing to be more robust and proper than traditional spi for drought assessments under climate change in conclusion we suggest that when the monthly precipitation is nonstationarily changing the nspi nl with the better fit of precipitation time series will give a more reliable description of drought condition and the propagation process there is an important point for understanding results when non stationarity is considered for calculating procedure of spi as using time varying parameters for probability distribution or changing return period park et al 2019 for different times we fit probability distribution with different scale parameters for example for a long term precipitation series with decreasing trend the probability distribution fitted for recent precipitation moves left compared with that for past precipitation due to a decreasing scale parameter and consequently larger non exceedance probability of the cumulated precipitation at same months scale is obtained resulting in milder drought by nspi in recent years than past that is to say when considering the nonstationarity decreasing trend of precipitation nspi shows milder drought than spi as time transitions from the past to the present park et al 2019 suggested that the statistically developed nonstationary methods for meteorological drought still cannot be effectively understood for preparing disaster of hydrological agricultural drought because such realistic conditions like sensitive emotions of stakeholders for drought and some certain threshold precipitation for water supply should be taken into consideration another issue should be addressed is that the developed nspi in this study only considers the nonstationarity in precipitation which is the sole input variable for the spi s calculation in this regard due to the adopted climate indices include more information than the sole precipitation the nspi is expanded in ways not only breaking stationary assumption but also containing additional information while focusing on the other widely used drought indices such as pdsi and spei which considers more variables in their computation the nonstationarity in the other variable can also be considered in the future work for example because spei uses both precipitation and potential evapotranspiration vicente serrano et al 2010 we think spei will react differently in arid and semi arid regions bazrafshan 2017 even the amounts of precipitation are the same which highlights the importance of the consideration of nonstationarity in the pet and its impact on drought assessment bazrafshan and hejabi 2018 have investigated the capability of a time varying non stationary reconnaissance drought index nrdi based on both precipitation and evapotranspiration factors for drought monitoring in a changing climate but there are rare studies on developing nonstationary multiscalar drought index such as spei rdi incorporating large scale climatic signals as covariates thus the future work can focus on the construction of nonstationary drought index based on multivariables such as precipitation evapotranspiration temperature and etc with the consideration of large scale climatic signals or other physical influencing factors for drought assessment under changing environment 6 conclusion in this study a nonstationary standardized precipitation index nspi is developed to assess drought conditions the nspi is based on the traditional spi by fitting the cumulative precipitation to a nonstationary gamma distribution in which the scale parameter varies nonlinearly with climate indices using the gamlss the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin are selected as the case study area to compare the efficiency of the nspi with the traditional standardized precipitation index spi the main conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 by comparing the performances of different models including the stationary model and the nonstationary model with distribution parameters varying with time or climate indices it is concluded that the nonstationary model with climate indices as the covariates performed better than the other models with constant or time dependent parameters which has been found in previous studies in addition the main contribution of this study is that the constructed nspi in the nonstationary model considering nonlinear dependence of the distribution parameter with climate indices shows better performance than that with linear dependence and is more robust and suitable for drought monitoring 2 the results of the stepwise method show the significant association of the changes in monthly precipitation with nino3 reflecting the influence of enso on precipitation and the capabilities of the pdo nino3 ao to describe the observed variability in precipitation in the mlryrb it is also found that most selected climate indices are nonlinear terms showing that the nonlinear dependence of the distribution parameters on the climate indices considered in the nonstationary model can give better modeling results for monthly precipitation than linear dependence 3 comparisons between the spi and nspi for three extreme drought events in spatial distribution and typically for extreme drought in 2011 at three selected pixels reveal that all three drought indices can well capture drought propagation in the study area and nonstationary drought indices are more consistent with history record the observed marked differences between traditional drought index spi and nonstationary drought indices nspi l nspi nl indicate the nonstationarity of precipitation is unignorable in drought assessment under climate change 4 the frequency of extreme drought by nonstationary models is higher than that by stationary model in recent decades reflecting the influence of nonstationarity on extreme droughts the difference in the evaluation of interannual variations in extreme drought frequency between the nonstationary models shows more benefits when assuming nonlinear dependence compared to assuming linear dependence the developed nspi with nonlinear dependence on climate indices in the nonstationary model has a sufficient capacity for drought assessment and the drought risk management under climate change and we believe that it can provide useful information for the development of mitigation and adaptation strategies credit authorship contribution statement zhihong song

5362,sediment from urban impervious surfaces has the potential to be an important vector for contaminants particularly where stormwater culverts and other buried channels draining large impervious areas exit from underground pipes into open channels to better understand urban sediment sources and their relation to fallout radionuclides we collected samples of rainfall urban sediment pavement sediment topsoil streambank sediment and fluvial sediment suspended sediment and bed sediment for 7be 210pbex and 137cs analysis the results indicate that each rainfall event tags pavement sediment with elevated activities of 7be and 210pbex such that runoff from impervious surfaces in the buried channel part of the stream network contains the highest activities pavement sediment because it is characteristically a thin veneer has a small mass to rainwater ratio resulting in a greater tagging of 7be and 210pbex activity than does topsoil on a per gram basis an unmixing model indicated that suspended sediment samples collected at the culvert outlet from the buried channel network are from pavement sediment sources 45 25 with a smaller component of topsoil 22 19 and a component from streambanks 32 35 that we infer to be older channel material and subsoil eroded from within the culvert system downstream from the culvert suspended sediment collected from the open channel parts of the stream had 7be and 210pbex activities that were substantially reduced by the contribution of sediment from streambanks 57 15 with pavement contributions decreasing to 15 9 and topsoil contributing 28 7 the results highlight the utility of 7be 210pbex and 137cs as tracers of urban sediment sources resulting in a unique radionuclide signature for urban watersheds compared to other sediment source

where some streambanks contain legacy contamination from sediment deposited in the past 18th 19th centuries southworth et al 2013 taylor and owens 2009 it is well documented that urbanization and increased impervious cover leads to more runoff and higher peak flows leopold 1968 paul and meyer 2001 walsh et al 2005 these hydrologic changes increase streampower leading to channel widening streambank erosion and channel incision booth 1990 1991 gellis et al 2017a wolman 1967 thus streambanks in urban environments are expected to contribute a large part of the total sediment load devereux et al 2010 gellis et al 2017a cashman et al 2018 in many urban areas however stream channels are paved over or buried during urbanization and directed into culverts pipes and concrete lined

streambanks typically contain lower activities of 7be 210pbex and 137cs because the vertical position of streambanks leads to little direct contact with rainfall matisoff et al 2005 hancock et al 2014 differences in 7be 210pbex and 137cs activities between geomorphic features streambanks and upland surfaces have been used to discriminate sediment sources and estimate the transport and transit times

of these only froger et al 2018 examined 7be 210pbex and 137cs activities and sediment processes in urban settings in an analysis of fluvial sediment for wadeable streams in the midwest u s gellis et al 2017b reported that stream sediment in watersheds with urban areas had higher activities of 7be and 210pbex than stream sediment in agricultural and undeveloped settings supporting information fig s1 that study however considered only surface agricultural soil and streambank and channel erosion as endmember sources of stream sediment and did not differentiate sediment delivered from impervious surfaces in source partitioning froger et al 2018 reported high 7be and 210pbex activities in sediment collected from paved road surfaces and attributed elevated activities in suspended sediments in streams as resulting from particles rapidly transported from urban areas in these settings 7be and 210pbex activities may be higher in the buried channel portions of the watershed with substantial impervious surfaces in contrast to the open channel parts of the watershed where streambank erosion processes become important understanding sediment sources and 7be and 210pbex dynamics in urban settings could provide insight into particle associated contaminant sources and transport processes affecting urban streams here we examine sediment sources and transport processes and associated 7be 210pbex and 137cs in an urban watershed we address three key questions how do activities of 7be and 210pbex vary in urban sediments by source type and in response to rain events what do these activities tell us about the sources of sediment to urban streams how do stream channel dynamics affect activities of 7be and 210pbex as sediment is transported from urban source areas with buried channels into open channel downstream areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area to address the questions described above we examined 7be 210pbex and 137cs activities for two locations in the dead run watershed an urban watershed in baltimore maryland fig 1 one location was the upper part of the watershed where except for two gullies in a small open space between roads there are no open channels all the natural stream channels were buried during urbanization all surface runoff that enters the buried channel network through numerous storm drains exits to an open channel at the alexander avenue culvert herein called the alexander culvert drainage area 0 369 km2 fig 1 about one half of this area is impervious roads rooftops and parking lots and the other half is non impervious or open space lawns parks and green space table 1 the second sampling location was the area that drains from alexander culvert to the u s geological survey usgs stream gaging site dead run near catonsville maryland usgs station id 01589312 about 0 7 km downstream from alexander culvert dead run gage 1 63 km2 drainage area the drainage area at the gage which includes the alexander culvert drainage is 42 impervious and 58 open space table 1 the watershed drains the piedmont physiographic province and is underlain by the mount washington amphibolite subunit of the baltimore complex crowley 1976 andby interbedded gravels sands silts and clays of the potomac group in the upper reaches of the watershed flow exits the alexander culvert and continues in an open channel to the dead run gage fig 1 two tributaries t1 and t2 fig 1 enter dead run between alexander culvert and the dead run gage these tributaries are buried channels in their upper reaches and exit at culverts to open channels several small storm drains also enter the channel from neighborhoods upstream of the gage during the study parts of dead run between the alexander culvert and tributary t1 were undergoing restoration to create a stabilized reach with an engineered riparian zone fig 1 fig 2 a although some disturbance of the channel may have occurred during the restoration measures were taken during the restoration to reduce erosion including pinning of erosion control nets and fabric along the stream our results at the dead run gage are unlikely to have been compromised by these activities between the gage and the restoration area and along t1 channels are incised fig 2b c with steep eroding streambanks and bed material that ranges from gravel and sands to fines dead run is

rainfall stormwater runoff pavement sediment road and parking lot particulates soil streambank material and fluvial sediment bed and ss were collected during three periods 1 summer 14 july 17 aug 2017 2 fall 20 oct 10 nov 2017 and 3 winter spring 27 feb 14 may 2018 seasons 2 2 1 sample collection rainfall n 33 samples was collected in two 9 5 l acid washed plastic buckets placed 1 5 m above the ground rainfall for the summer was collected at the usgs office in catonsville md 6 km from the dead run gage and for the other seasons was collected at a rain gage at the dead run gage the rain sample was acidified with 10 hydrochloric acid hcl and transferred to 1 l bottles along with three 10 hcl rinses of the collection bucket prior to shipping to the usgs sediment radioisotope laboratory in menlo park ca for 7be 210pbex and 137cs analysis runoff samples as defined here are stormwater runoff that occurs on impervious surfaces and contains sediment two types of runoff were sampled stormwater runoff collected at the alexander culvert n 9 samples and road runoff collected at road storm drains and parking lot storm drains n 8 samples both types of runoff were collected by submerging an 18 9 l bucket into the runoff flow pavement sediment samples n 85 samples were collected at the beginning of each sampling season and after rainfall events at four road sites chosen to represent the range of road types present in the watershed residential and commercial and from one parking lot in the alexander culvert watershed fig 1 similar to collins et al 2011 pavement sediment was collected with a hand broom and dustpan from alongside the curb and upgradient of a storm grate and placed in a plastic bag in order to obtain at least 3 g of fine sediment the area swept varied between samples and although each area was swept clean it is likely that some sediment remained behind to estimate the mass of material present on pavement in the area draining to alexander culvert sediment also was sampled 4 times with a high efficiency vacuum envirometrics model hvs3 high volume surface sampler n 39 samples the vacuum which is designed for sampling settled house dust at particle sizes 5 µm or larger was fitted with a 12 5 cm long 1 cm wide nozzle prior to outdoor sampling controlled tests with the vacuum were done in the usgs baltimore md laboratory where known masses of fine material 63 µm were vacuumed the hvs3 averaged 98 3 efficiency for the range of masses tested table s1 although wind and unevenness of the pavement surface may introduce variability when sampling outdoors for two of the four vacuuming events only the pavement sites used in the sweep samples not including street c fig 1 were vacuumed for the other two vacuuming events sites were selected randomly to cover the spatial extent of the alexander culvert drainage area each sample was collected by starting at the midpoint in the road and ending at the curb a sediment yield at each vacuum site was determined by dividing the sediment mass recovered by the area vacuumed determined as the width of the nozzle 12 5 cm multiplied by the road or parking lot length sampled m yields are reported as a total unsieved sediment yield g m2 and a fine 63 µm sediment yield g m2 we consider both of these yields as potential sediment yields as the entire mass of sediment may not be mobilized and transported from the pavement by any given rain event soil samples were collected at nine sites fig 1 in the dead run watershed at each site three to five subsamples were taken using a plastic spatula from the top 1 cm of surficial soil within 3 m of one another and composited four samples of streambank material were taken from eroding streambanks between the restored area and the dead run gage fig 1 prior to sample collection the exposed surface of a streambank was scraped off and discarded each streambank sample is a composite of subsamples from 3 to 5 eroding streambanks collected from the bottom to the top of each streambank using a plastic hand shovel fluvial sediment consisted of samples of ss and bed material ss was collected at alexander culvert and the dead run gage figs 1 and 2d e using passive samplers phillips et al 2000 after a rainfall event water if present and sediment were removed from the passive samplers and transferred to 18 9 l buckets samples of bed material were collected at the dead run gage bed material was collected from the surface 1cm of fine grained channel deposits using a stainless steel spatula sediment from at least five deposits was collected and composited into one sample a bed sample was not collected at alexander culvert because the channel immediately below the culvert was a transport reach with a gravel bed devoid of fines for most of the collection period 2 2 2 sample analysis all samples were transported to the usgs laboratory in baltimore md and refrigerated sediment for radionuclide analysis pavement sediment soil bank material decanted ss samples following a minimum of 1 week of refrigeration and settling and bed material were wet sieved with distilled deionized di water using a 63 μm polyester sieve the sieved slurry was collected in glass bowls and dried at 65 c for 2 or more days the dried fine sediment 63 μm was removed with a plastic utensil and sent for analysis of fallout radionuclides organic carbon content and grain size sediment samples were analyzed for 7be 210pb 226ra and 137cs at the usgs sediment radioisotope laboratory in menlo park ca using high resolution germanium detector gamma spectrometers following methods described in fuller et al 1999 and van metre et al 2004 measured activities of 7be and 137cs were corrected for radioactive decay from the date of sample collection to the date of analysis excess 210pbex was calculated as the difference between the measured total 210pb and 226ra which is determined from the short lived intermediate gamma emitting isotopes 214pb and 214bi method detection limits mdls for 7be and 210pbex were 0 0067 bq g the sample specific detection limit for 7be was determined by correcting the mdl for decay and varied among samples 0 0117 to 0 0317 bq g as a result of different times between sample collection and analysis the mdl for 137cs was 0 0004 bq g the reported 1 sigma uncertainty in the measured radionuclide activity σ1 was calculated from the random counting error of samples and background standard spectra at the 1 standard deviation level uncertainty in measured activity was typically within 10 of the measured activity for total 210pb and 226ra 18 for 7be and 20 for 137cs uncertainty in unsupported 210pb was propagated from the uncertainties in total 210pb and 226ra activity and averaged 20 acidified rain samples were screened through 63 µm polypropylene mesh into a container along with three 10 hcl rinses of each shipping bottle and processed following the methods outlined in conaway et al 2013 and nakano et al 2008 to concentrate the radionuclides into a small volume briefly 0 100 ml each of stable pb and be inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms stock standard solutions 1000 µg ml was added to the acidified sample to determine recovery five ml of 10 wt v solution of ferric chloride was added to facilitate concentration of radionuclides by sorption of pb and be to iron hydroxide formed on raising ph samples were equilibrated on an orbital shaker for 48 h concentrated ammonium hydroxide was then added to increase ph to 10 and precipitate iron hydroxide to sorb both the stable and radioactive isotopes of pb and be the iron hydroxide floc was recovered by centrifugation after settling and decanting off the overlying solution by siphon the concentrated iron hydroxide was then dissolved in concentrated hcl and transferred to a tared bottle concentrations of the added stable pb and be yield tracers in rainfall samples were measured by icp ms recoveries averaged 95 8 and 86 6 for stable pb and be respectively a subsample was transferred and weighed into a polyethylene vial for radionuclide analysis by high resolution gamma spectrometry as described for sediment samples activities of 210pb and 7be in rainfall samples were corrected for the recovery yield of pb and be ratio of measured to added mass of stable and pb and be and the fraction of redissolved sample analyzed this method assumes that the stable pb and be attain isotopic equilibrium with all fallout radionuclides in the sample such that the radioisotopes are recovered in the same proportion as the yield tracer the resulting activity was then divided by volume of rain collected to yield activities in units of bq l 137cs and 226ra were below detection limits in rain samples indicating negligible contributions of 210pb and 7be from aeolian dust that may have entered the rainfall collector additionally all 210pb activity in rainfall is considered unsupported 210pb 210pbex because the supported activity defined by 226ra was not detectable runoff samples were split in the laboratory to determine fallout radionuclide activities in whole water and in isolated particulates one split was churned and an aliquot was taken to determine the suspended sediment concentration ssc the volume of the aliquot was recorded and the aliquot was pumped through a 0 45 µm glass fiber filter the filter was dried at 105 c and weighed the remaining slurry from this split was processed for analysis in the same manner as ss from the passive samplers to record activity in the particulates in bq g a second split was prepared and analyzed in the same way as rainwater to measure total whole water 7be and 210pbex activities it was assumed that 7be and 210pb are effectively solubilized from the ss at the low ph of the acidified sample it also was assumed that isotopic equilibrium is attained between yield tracers stable pb and be and 7be and 210pb both in solution and on sediments 210pb activity in total whole water runoff samples is considered unsupported 210pb 210pbex because the supported activity defined by 226ra was not detectable reported activities in the whole water samples in units of bq l were normalized to ssc to obtain units of bq g additional analytical methods for sediment are shown in si text i 2 2 3 collection and computation of rainfall turbidity suspended sediment and flow umbc operates a rainfall and water quality network in the baltimore metropolitan region that includes dead run water quality sensors and a rain gage station are co located with usgs stream gage 01589312 the collection and computation methods for rainfall turbidity suspended sediment and flow are described in si text ii 2 3 potential activity of 7be and 210pbex we used measured activities of 210pbex and 7be in rainfall potential sediment yields from pavement and 210pbex and 7be activities in pavement sediment measured prior to the rainfall event to estimate the enrichment of pavement sediment that might occur potential activity in response to a rainfall event the potential activity of 7be and 210pbex in the sweep samples after being tagged by rainfall was determined as 1 rdsed pot t r a i n tot rain act sed yld r d s e d p r e where rdsedpot t is the potential activity of 7be or 210pbex in pavement sediment for sample period t as a result of precipitation bq g raintot is the total rainfall over 1 m2 of the ground surface l m2 rainact is the measured activity of 7be or 210pbex in rainfall bq l sedyld is the median fine sediment yield from vacuuming g m2 1 57 g m2 clifton et al 2019 and rdsedpre is the pavement sediment activity for 7be or 210pbex bq g prior to the rainfall event and corrected for 7be decay since the time of the last pavement sediment sweep because of the strong affinity of 7be and 210pbex to fine particulate matter benmansour et al 2014 taylor et al 2012 we assume that all whole water runoff samples have an activity per liter bq l equal to rainfall and that some of the 7be and 210pbex are likely sorbed to particles and surfaces that are not transported with runoff to the culvert the calculation therefore provides an upper limit for radionuclide tagging 2 4 sediment sourcing pavement sediment can be from a mixture of sources including upland soil from lawns and open space building and construction material leaf litter atmospheric deposition of particles worn tires and pavement erosion taylor and owens 2009 sansalone and cristina 2004 a two endmember mixing model using 137cs as a tracer was used to calculate soil and non soil sources to pavement sediment one endmember is soil with an activity equal to the median of the 137cs activity in soil samples 0 0071 bq g clifton et al 2019 the non soil endmember is assigned zero activity under the assumption that the non soil material is from sources such as construction materials and tire and asphalt wear that are not expected to have detectable 137cs activity the percentage of pavement residue originating from soil was determined as 2 soil cs sample cs med 100 where soil is the percentage of the sample that is derived from soil cssample is the 137cs activity bq g of the sample and csmed is the median of the 137cs activities in the soil samples 0 0071 bq g to determine sources of ss samples collected from alexander culvert and ss and bed sediment at dead run an unmixing model commonly used in sediment source studies was applied 3 r e s i 1 n cssi s 1 m c s i p s cssi 2 where res is the residual sum of squares cssi is the concentration of tracer property i in the target sediment csi is the mean concentration of the tracer property in the source group s and ps is the relative contribution from source group s after walling 2005 after schuller et al 2013 the unmixing model equation assumes that 0 ps 1 and 4 s 1 m p s 1 the ps that yields the lowest residual sum of squares corresponds to the final source contributions pavement soil banks for a given target sample 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall and flow during the study rainfall pavement and fluvial samples were collected for 17 sampling periods over a range of flows distributed over the three sampling seasons fig 3 table 2 si table s2 a sample period begins after the last sample is collected from the previous sampling period the end of a rainfall event and ends when the last sample of the current sampling period is collected also a rainfall event samples collected during each sampling period can include pavement sweeps dry weather and rainfall runoff and suspended and bed sediment from one or more rainfall events a sampling period had as many as one to five peak flows depending on how closely spaced the rainfall events were table 2 the decision to collect samples was based on rainfall and discharge the lower sediment tube at dead run gage filled at a discharge of about 0 19 m3 s when it rained we examined the on line real time discharge at dead run if it exceeded 0 19 m3 s the decision was made to retrieve ss samples if conditions permitted low flow street sweeps were collected only when conditions were dry additional rainfall event s did occur before it was possible to get street sweeps during some sampling periods and thus a sampling period may have had multiple rainfall and ss samples but only one set of sweep samples often because of high flow conditions it was not possible to access the suspended sampler immediately at the end of the event and in some of these cases a second flow event occurred table 2 during the same sampling period and the sampler composited suspended sediment over more than one closely spaced rainfall event rain samples were collected during 16 of the 17 sampling periods and analyzed for radionuclides seventeen runoff samples 9 stormwater samples at alexander culvert and 8 stormwater samples from roads were collected during 4 of the 17 sampling periods table 2 of the 9 runoff samples collected at alexander culvert 7 were used for whole water analysis bq l and 6 were used for dry sediment analysis bq g of the 8 runoff samples collected on roads 7 were used for whole water analysis bq l and 5 were used for dry sediment analysis bq g clifton et al 2019 to determine if any of the seasons sampled were drier or wetter than average rainfall for each sampling season was compared to the historic rainfall for the same season measured at the national weather service gage at the baltimore washington international airport usw00093721 16 2 km from the dead run gage table s3 the three seasons had rainfall that was 179 summer 137 fall and 70 winter spring of normal rainfall for that season table s3 the wetter summer and fall seasons could affect the results by supplying more sediment than might occur during average rainfall conditions or could cause higher flows that exhaust sediment in channel storage conversely samples collected during the drier winter spring season might reflect lower sediment flux than might occur during average rainfall conditions 3 2 radionuclide activities in source and collected sediment samples the three types of source material pavement sediment upland soil and streambanks have characteristic activities of 7be 210pbex and 137cs that reflect differences in initial pre rain activities and the timing and intensity of radionuclide tagging and dilution clifton et al 2019 activities of 137cs were higher in soils than in streambank material and similar to or higher than those in pavement sediment fig 4 fallout of 137cs for north america largely ceased by the late 1960s ritchie and mchenry 1990 and soil now is a reservoir of legacy 137cs from past fallout variable 137cs activities in pavement sediment likely reflect varying contributions of upland soil to the sediment on the impervious surface significant differences in activities of 137cs as well as 210pbex and 7be among some of the pavement sediment sites mann whitney rank sum test p 0 05 table s4 likely reflect different source contributions to sediment at a site the detection of 137cs activity in some streambanks indicates that these samples do not represent older alluvial deposits which should be devoid of 137cs but may indicate deposition from eroded topsoil that occurred when parts of the dead run watershed were developed between the 1950s and 1970s the median year for homes built in the dead run watershed was 1962 barnes et al 2018 which is one year earlier than the peak fallout of 137cs thus topsoil mobilized during the build out of the area would have contained relatively high 137cs which could have been deposited on the floodplain in contrast to 137cs 210pbex and 7be are continually deposited on the land surface by atmospheric fallout resulting in distinct signatures of these two radionuclides in the three sediment sources activities of 210pbex and 7be were substantially higher in samples of pavement sediment than in samples of upland soil and streambank material fig 4a b the difference between activities in pavement sediment and streambank material is consistent with the limited exposure of streambanks to modern atmospheric fallout gellis et al 2017b hancock et al 2014 matisoff et al 2005 the soil activities of 210pbex in dead run watershed are similar to those reported for agricultural topsoil in the midwest gellis et al 2017b fig 5 the difference between activities in pavement sediment and upland soil fig 5 reflects the difference in the mass of sediment exposed to rain on pavement a thin veneer of sediment is exposed to a relatively large volume of rain whereas for soil the top several centimeters are exposed as a result on a per gram basis pavement sediment receives greater amounts of radionuclides resulting in higher activities during a rain event than does soil activities of 210pbex and 7be in pavement sediment are correlated r2 0 51 fig s2a because they both are delivered to the earth s surface by rainfall and both associate with particles mcneary and baskaran 2003 matisoff et al 2005 in contrast 210pbex in pavement sediment is not correlated with activities of 137cs fig s2b r2 0 12 and suggests a fundamental difference between pavement sediment and soils fig 5 however 210pbex and 137cs are strongly correlated in soils wallbrink and murray 1996 huh and su 2004 porto et al 2010 teramage et al 2013 porto et al 2010 suggested that the close relation of 210pbex and 137cs activities in soils reflects a similar and consistent response to erosion and sediment redistribution processes pavement sediment which is transported away and replenished over short time scales does not undergo such processes we interpret the lack of correlation between 210pbex and 137cs activities in pavement sediment as resulting from tagging of pavement sediment by recent fallout of 210pbex and 7be but not of 137cs activities of 7be 210pbex and 137cs in runoff ss and bed samples are expected to be bracketed by those in the sediment sources pavement sediment soils and for dead run streambanks activities of 137cs in fluvial sediments collected at alexander culvert and dead run are within the range of source sediment pavement sediment upland soil and streambank material fig 4c activities of 7be and 210pbex in ss at alexander culvert however are similar to or greater than those in the assumed source materials fig 4a b the explanation for this is presented in section 3 3 3 3 radionuclide activity by event activities of 210pbex and 7be are highest in particles in runoff alexander and road runoff followed by ss at alexander culvert and pavement sediment figs s3a c the amount of enrichment of 7be and 210pbex in runoff and alexander culvert ss relative to the pavement sediment samples can be quite large as indicated by the ratios of these activities for the four runoff periods sampled to pavement sediment sample activities fig 6 we hypothesize that the difference in activities provides critical insight into the dynamics of 210pbex and 7be particle tagging at the scale of an urban watershed and explains why the fluvial sample 210pbex and 7be activities are not bracketed by the source activities rainfall runoff entrains a relatively small mass of particles in suspension which comes in contact with a relatively large volume of precipitation leading to enrichment in particle associated radionuclides carried by the rainfall runoff the mass of particles that remains on the pavement also is exposed to rainfall but the ratio of rainfall volume to pavement sediment mass is smaller resulting in less enrichment on a per particle mass basis by extension soil with its much greater mass of particles and downward diffusion of rainwater through infiltration is even less enriched by a given rainfall event than are pavement particles fig 5 one of the four rainfall events sampled 2 august 2017 included runoff samples collected in alexander culvert shortly after the onset of rainfall figs s3aix xi s4 for that event 7be activity of sediment in runoff samples decreased through the event 12 6 10 4 8 81 3 24 bq g fig s3 ax a similar pattern was observed for 210pbex 2 65 2 41 1 66 0 65 bq g fig s3axi delivery of 7be has been observed to decrease rapidly during a rain event a process attributed to scavenging and washout of radionuclides from the atmosphere caillet et al 2001 ioannidou and papastefanou 2006 gourdin et al 2014 thus the earlier part of the runoff period would have higher radionuclide tagging of sediment than later in the event decreasing activities of 7be and 210pbex relative to the onset of rainfall could be related to the washout of those radionuclides during an event fig s5 however the composite rainfall samples collected by this study do not allow for an evaluation of rainfall activities over the course of the event furthermore fallout radionuclide activity during a storm can be influenced by other factors such as cloud height storm types and duration and seasonality todd et al 1989 kaste et al 2002 karwan et al 2016 another potential explanation for the higher activities in the alexander culvert runoff and ss samples versus other sources is grain size and organic content differences among the sample types the activity of radionuclides has been shown to increase with decreasing sediment size taylor et al 2014 he and walling 1996 and increasing organic content navas et al 2011 motha et al 2002 examination of grain size d50 and organic content total organic carbon toc among sample types does not indicate that the alexander culvert ss has finer grain sizes or higher toc content fig s6 and thus neither grain size nor organic content explain the higher activities in the alexander culvert runoff and ss samples relative to sediment sources froger et al 2018 also did not observe any relation between sediment grain size and 7be and 210pbex activities for an urban area in france 3 4 sediment sources a two endmember model using 137cs eq 2 determined the sources of pavement sediment and indicates a soil contribution to the pavement sediment samples n 85 of 26 23 the high variability within the source contributions reflect the heterogeneity of pavement sediment and is consistent with other studies that have reported a wide range of soil and or inorganic sediment on impervious surfaces loganathan et al 2013 sartor et al 1974 fergusson and ryan 1984 sediment sources to suspended sediment collected at alexander culvert and suspended and bed sediment collected at dead run were apportioned using an unmixing model eqs 3 and 4 with three tracers 7be 210pbex 137cs and the results averaged table 3 table s5 several metrics mean median 90th percentile were tested for each endmember the pavement sediment endmember was assigned the median pavement sediment activities for 137cs 0 0015 bq g and the median activities from runoff for 210pbex 1 638 bq g and 7be 4 121 bq g assuming that these runoff particles more reasonably represent activities of pavement sediment that is transported to the stream because pavement sediment is not currently subject to fallout of 137cs we believed it adequately reflected 137cs activities in runoff median radionuclide activities were used for the soil endmembers 137cs 0 0071 bq g 210pbex 0 1070 bq g 7be 0 0611 bq g and values were set to one half the detection levels for the streambank and other fallout radionuclide free material endmember 210pbex 0 0033 bq g 7be 0 0050 bq g 137cs 0 0002 bq g low fallout radionuclide activities in some target samples indicate that a low activity or fallout radionuclide free endmember is supplying sediment in spite of the detection of 137cs and to lesser extent 210pbex in bank samples collected for this study large variation in activities of the endmember and target samples resulted in large variability 20 in source proportions for the alexander ss samples table 3 target samples should be bracketed by the source sample activities within 10 of the minimum and 10 of maximum activity gellis and gorman sanisaca 2018 in 4 of 57 target samples the sample activities of 210pbex n 1 and 7be n 4 were outside the range of endmember activities in a direction that implies a mix of soil and pavement sediment the two higher activity sources fig 7 all four target samples were alexander culvert ss which had relatively high activities of 7be and 210pbex one possible explanation for the activities in these samples is that the soil in suspension in runoff is being tagged by rainfall radionuclides in the runoff similar to the tagging of the pavement sediment the model results indicate that pavement sediment is the dominant sediment source in the buried channel part of the watershed at alexander culvert and that downstream at dead run where the channel is open streambank sediment dominates the unmixing model results in a mean pavement contribution at alexander culvert of 45 25 in ss samples with a contribution from older channel material of 32 35 and the remainder coming from soils 22 19 table 3 these relatively large contributions of pavement sediment are consistent with the ranges of 210pbex and 7be in pavement sediment runoff and alexander culvert samples fig 7 and with the nature of the contributing watershed the dead run gage site sampled the open channel portion thus all three potential sources are expected based on the unmixing model the mean fraction of pavement sediment is 15 9 in dead run ss and 4 2 in bed sediment the decrease in the pavement sediment contribution from alexander culvert to dead run indicates relatively rapid dilution of the pavement sediment fraction downstream from where buried channels emerge into open channels the dilution is from streambanks which contributed 57 15 of the dead run ss and 57 12 of the dead run bed sediment counterintuitively the model results indicate an average of 32 35 streambank contribution to alexander culvert ss with very high variability between sampled events because the culvert emerges from buried channels with no exposed streambanks there should be only two major sources possible soil and pavement sediment we interpret the modeled component of streambank material at the culvert as older channel material and subsoil eroded from within the culvert system in many urban areas stream channels have been buried in pipes culverts and combined sewer systems broadhead and lerner 2013 broadhead et al 2015 elmore and kaushal 2008 the breakup cracking and wear of these underground pipes and culverts is common and leads to openings that allow the surrounding soil to enter the pipe infiltration tang et al 2018 sato and kuwano 2015 ellis 2001 the continued erosion of the soil forms a cavity and in some cases leads to sinkholes ali and choi 2019 sato and kuwano 2015 tang et al 2018 we hypothesize that the bank source contributions observed in our model output at alexander culvert reflect buried channel sediment entering the culvert through openings further studies that examine sediment transport and the condition of underground pipes in areas of buried channels may help to resolve this question and radionuclide analyses such as done here could indicate culvert systems subject to underground failures sediment budgets from the literature that quantify sediment sources in urban watersheds indicate that the contribution from impervious areas ranges from 4 to 46 table s6 covering the range in pavement sediment contributions to fluvial sediments from the alexander culvert 45 and dead run gage 4 to 15 table 3 contributions from soil 22 to 39 and streambank and other fallout radionuclide free material i e older channel deposits 32 to 57 sources at dead run are also within the range reported for other urban areas table s6 because pavement sediment is a vector for metals pahs and other urban contaminants van metre and mahler 2003 mahler et al 2005 callender and rice 2000 its proportion in fluvial sediment is an indicator of the contribution of pavement sediment to sediment contamination the high percentage of pavement sediment at alexander culvert indicates the potential for contaminant hot spots where culverts and buried channels discharge to urban streams although the fraction of pavement sediment decreases rapidly with distance downstream it nonetheless accounts for about one third or more of suspended sediment in some samples at the dead run gage 3 5 potential radionuclide tagging of pavement sediment based on eq 1 the potential activity of 7be and 210pbex added to pavement sediment by tagging from rain events is more than sufficient to account for the sediment activity measured in the runoff and the alexander culvert ss samples fig 8 activities in runoff samples and rain samples are also compared using whole water units of measurement bq l activity volume table s7 which avoids the large uncertainty in the pavement sediment yields activities of 210pbex and 7be in rain are substantially greater than those in whole water samples of runoff for the same event table s7 although the rainfall samples reflect rainfall collected over a longer time than represented by the runoff and the runoff samples represent a single point in time the data are consistent with the hypothesis that a substantial part of the rainfall load of 7be and 210pbex does not exit the system but is retained within watershed soils pavement surface or other solid surfaces 3 6 urban pavement sediment yields the total potential sediment yield determined from vacuuming sand and fines averaged 55 6 97 2 g m2 and the fine sediment potential yield averaged 5 9 11 7 g m2 n 39 the high variability and skewness figs s7a b are consistent with those reported for other studies sartor et al 1974 the median total sediment yield 15 4 g m2 and fine sediment yield of 1 57 g m2 were used in further analysis parking lot samples had significantly lower total and fine sediment yields than road samples mann whitney rank sum test p 0 003 figs s7a b pavement sediment yields determined for this study are comparable to those reported by waschbush 2003 and by selbig and bannerman 2007 but are greater than those reported by mahler et al 2005 figs s7 c most of the pavement sediment mass is sand sized mean percentage of material 63 μm of 16 1 16 9 a grain size commonly found in urban environments sartor et al 1974 waschbush 2003 selbig and bannerman 2007 taylor and owens 2009 could pavement sediment constitute a substantial part of stream sediment in an urban environment wolman 1967 presented a conceptual model where sediment yields in an urban environment were projected to decrease after development related to the loss of upland sediment source areas contrary to this expected decline in sediment yield as urban areas expand gellis et al 2017a cashman et al 2018 found that sediment yields for difficult run an urban suburban watershed in virginia outside of washington d c remained high even after 30 or more years had passed since peak rates of urbanization both studies attributed the high sediment yields to streambank erosion to determine the potential sediment load and yield available on impervious services the median total and fine yields from the vacuum samples were extrapolated to the total impervious area of roads and parking lots in the dead run gage 0 42 km2 table 1 the results indicate that about 6 4 and 0 65 mg of total and fine sediment respectively are present on impervious surfaces in the dead run watershed at any given time the average annual ss load at the dead run gage 2013 2016 is 127 mg kemper et al 2019 three events sampled for percent fines in dead run at catonsville and surrounding gages table s8 indicated that on average 91 of the suspended sediment is 63 µm if the same ratio of fines and sand in suspended sediment is applied to the impervious surface sediment then 0 71 mg of sediment is available for transport which is a very small percentage 0 6 of the total annual suspended sediment load measured at the dead run gage however this relatively small mass represents the potential sediment available at any one time on roads and parking lots and it is likely that only a part of this impervious sediment is mobilized in a given flow event to estimate the total mass of impervious sediment mobilized in a given year from all events we first defined an event as when peak flow exceeds the 90th percentile of all 5 minute discharges for the 2017 and 2018 study period 0 032 m3 s using this definition 68 flow events occurred sediment delivery in urban watersheds can be high russell et al 2019 and in watersheds with impervious areas similar to dead run 50 the sediment delivery ratio is 50 heathcoate 2009 if we assume that 50 of the impervious sediment is mobilized and delivered to the stream the estimated total contribution of the 68 events is 24 mg or 19 of the annual sediment load our results suggest that the sediment available for transport from roads and parking lots has the potential to be an important contributor to the total sediment load in an urban stream as well as an important contributor of contaminants we recognize that values assigned to define an event and to estimate the percentage of sediment mobilized on impervious surfaces were arbitrary the actual mass available for transport mobilized from impervious areas and delivered to the stream would require systematic event based monitoring over time which was beyond the scope of this study however this estimate of pavement sediment determined using the sediment yield provided by the vacuum cleaner results 19 is similar to the pavement sediment contribution results from the unmixing model 15 for dead run ss table 3 indicating our assumption of 50 mobility in a given event is reasonable 3 7 conceptual model we propose a conceptual model based on the activities of 7be and 210pbex in rain runoff samples pavement sediment topsoil and fluvial samples that describes how activities of 7be 210pbex 137cs in sediment change as sediment is transported in an urban setting fig 9 antecedent conditions control the initial 7be and 210pbex activity of pavement sediment before a rainfall runoff event occurs as reflected by the activities of the pavement sediment samples collected prior to rain events this initial activity is a function of 7be and 210pbex activity tagging from previous events dilution from deposition of other material with lower activities of those radionuclides during and between events and decay of 7be since the last event decay is negligible for 210pbex over the short period between rainfall events we assume that the highest activities of 7be and 210pbex in rainfall occur early in the rain event initial runoff and decrease exponentially ioannidou and papastefanou 2006 fig s5 pavement sediment particles transported by initial rainfall runoff receive the highest amounts of 7be and 210pbex because sediment mass is small relative to rainwater volume these particles are transported to the stream where they contribute to the radionuclide activities of ss and to a lesser degree bed sediment fig 9 this initial runoff of tagged sediment is reflected in elevated 7be and 210pbex activities figs s3a c and ssc in the runoff samples table s7 throughout the runoff period fig 9 pavement sediment continues to be tagged by rain a process that is cumulative but activities in pavement sediment are lower than those in runoff sediment for three possible reasons 1 lower rainfall activities of 7be and 210pbex later in the event 2 the relatively greater ratio of residual pavement sediment mass to rainfall volume compared to that of suspended sediment mass in runoff to rainfall volume i e runoff water and 3 dilution of the remaining pavement sediment with soil during the event as soil is eroded and transported to adjacent impervious surfaces fallout radionuclide analysis confirms that pavement sediment contains a component of soil the suspended sediment collected at the alexander culvert integrates activities over the storm hydrograph which includes the higher activities of 7be and 210pbex in the initial runoff and lower activities of 7be and 210pbex from later runoff and from topsoil and bank material fig 9 the results of this study indicate that the proportion of pavement sediment in suspended sediment in the buried channel part of the urban watershed is substantially higher than in the open channel reaches as a result concentrations of urban pavement related contaminants associated with suspended sediment also are likely to be higher in buried channels the part of an urban watershed that is directly connected to the stream by stormwater drains and buried channels has been termed effective imperviousness booth and jackson 1997 and has been reported to be a better predictor of ecologically relevant geomorphic indicators vietz et al 2014 and bedload yield russell et al 2018 than the percentage of total impervious cover over the watershed our results indicate that the better prediction capability may be because effective imperviousness better represents areas of potential contaminant transport to the stream than does total impervious area delineating the part of an urban watershed that contains buried channels may provide insight into how sediment and contaminants are transported in urban environments 4 summary and conclusion our results indicate that material washed from impervious surfaces pavement sediment is an important contributor to urban stream sediment especially in areas with large amounts of impervious surface and buried channels pavement sediment can be a vector for many common urban contaminants and can be an especially important contributor to receiving streams where networks of buried channels exit into open channels activities of 7be and 210pbex in fluvial sediment differ between buried and open channels fallout of 7be and 210pbex in rainfall and radionuclide tagging of pavement sediment increases the activities on the sediment which also contains relic activities from previous events we hypothesize that the low ratio of sediment mass to rainfall volume in entrained sediment results in higher activities in the runoff sediment than in the pavement sediment which in turn is for the same reason more highly tagged than soils as runoff particles move through buried channels activities of 7be and 210pbex remain high with the exception of material entering buried channels through cracks and breaks there is limited opportunity for dilution by soils and streambank erosion once the suspended sediment moves into the open channel parts of the watershed 7be and 210pbex activities are diluted by contributions of lower activity sediment from stream beds and streambanks these findings support the hypothesis that sediment from urban impervious surfaces is substantially enriched in 210pbex and 7be from rainfall but not in 137cs resulting in a unique radionuclide signature compared to other sediment source settings this difference in source activity provides a tool for identifying the sediment contribution to streams from heavily developed urban areas and suggests the need to define source terms by land use in regional stream sediment source and age studies using

5362,sediment from urban impervious surfaces has the potential to be an important vector for contaminants particularly where stormwater culverts and other buried channels draining large impervious areas exit from underground pipes into open channels to better understand urban sediment sources and their relation to fallout radionuclides we collected samples of rainfall urban sediment pavement sediment topsoil streambank sediment and fluvial sediment suspended sediment and bed sediment for 7be 210pbex and 137cs analysis the results indicate that each rainfall event tags pavement sediment with elevated activities of 7be and 210pbex such that runoff from impervious surfaces in the buried channel part of the stream network contains the highest activities pavement sediment because it is characteristically a thin veneer has a small mass to rainwater ratio resulting in a greater tagging of 7be and 210pbex activity than does topsoil on a per gram basis an unmixing model indicated that suspended sediment samples collected at the culvert outlet from the buried channel network are from pavement sediment sources 45 25 with a smaller component of topsoil 22 19 and a component from streambanks 32 35 that we infer to be older channel material and subsoil eroded from within the culvert system downstream from the culvert suspended sediment collected from the open channel parts of the stream had 7be and 210pbex activities that were substantially reduced by the contribution of sediment from streambanks 57 15 with pavement contributions decreasing to 15 9 and topsoil contributing 28 7 the results highlight the utility of 7be 210pbex and 137cs as tracers of urban sediment sources resulting in a unique radionuclide signature for urban watersheds compared to other sediment source

where some streambanks contain legacy contamination from sediment deposited in the past 18th 19th centuries southworth et al 2013 taylor and owens 2009 it is well documented that urbanization and increased impervious cover leads to more runoff and higher peak flows leopold 1968 paul and meyer 2001 walsh et al 2005 these hydrologic changes increase streampower leading to channel widening streambank erosion and channel incision booth 1990 1991 gellis et al 2017a wolman 1967 thus streambanks in urban environments are expected to contribute a large part of the total sediment load devereux et al 2010 gellis et al 2017a cashman et al 2018 in many urban areas however stream channels are paved over or buried during urbanization and directed into culverts pipes and concrete lined

streambanks typically contain lower activities of 7be 210pbex and 137cs because the vertical position of streambanks leads to little direct contact with rainfall matisoff et al 2005 hancock et al 2014

of these only froger et al 2018 examined 7be 210pbex and 137cs activities and sediment processes in urban settings in an analysis of fluvial sediment for wadeable streams in the midwest u s gellis et al 2017b reported that stream sediment in watersheds with urban areas had higher activities of 7be and 210pbex than stream sediment in agricultural and undeveloped settings supporting information fig s1 that study however considered only surface agricultural soil and streambank and channel erosion as endmember sources of stream sediment and did not differentiate sediment delivered from impervious surfaces in source partitioning froger et al 2018 reported high 7be and 210pbex activities in sediment collected from paved road surfaces and attributed elevated activities in suspended sediments in streams as resulting from particles rapidly transported from urban areas in these settings 7be and 210pbex activities may be higher in the buried channel portions of the watershed with substantial impervious surfaces in contrast to the open channel parts of the watershed where streambank erosion processes become important understanding sediment sources and 7be and 210pbex dynamics in urban settings could provide insight into particle associated contaminant sources and transport processes affecting urban streams here we examine sediment sources and transport processes and associated 7be 210pbex and 137cs in an urban watershed we address three key questions how do activities of 7be and 210pbex vary in urban sediments by source type and in response to rain events what do these activities tell us about the sources of sediment to urban streams how do stream channel dynamics affect activities of 7be and 210pbex as sediment is transported from urban source areas with buried channels into open channel downstream areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area to address the questions described above we examined 7be 210pbex and 137cs activities for two locations in the dead run watershed an urban watershed in baltimore maryland fig 1 one location was the upper part of the watershed where except for two gullies in a small open space between roads there are no open channels all the natural stream channels were buried during urbanization all surface runoff that enters the buried channel network through numerous storm drains exits to an open channel at the alexander avenue culvert herein called the alexander culvert drainage area 0 369 km2 fig 1 about one half of this area is impervious roads rooftops and parking lots and the other half is non impervious or open space lawns parks and green space table 1 the second sampling location was the area that drains from alexander culvert to the u s geological survey usgs stream gaging site dead run near catonsville maryland usgs station id 01589312 about 0 7 km downstream from alexander culvert dead run gage 1 63 km2 drainage area the drainage area at the gage which includes the alexander culvert drainage is 42 impervious and 58 open space table 1 the watershed drains the piedmont physiographic province and is underlain by the mount washington amphibolite subunit of the baltimore complex crowley 1976 andby interbedded gravels sands silts and clays of the potomac group in the upper reaches of the watershed flow exits the alexander culvert and continues in an open channel to the dead run gage fig 1 two tributaries t1 and t2 fig 1 enter dead run between alexander culvert and the dead run gage these tributaries are buried channels in their upper reaches and exit at culverts to open channels several small storm drains also enter the channel from neighborhoods upstream of the gage during the study parts of dead run between the alexander culvert and tributary t1 were undergoing restoration to create a stabilized reach with an engineered riparian zone fig 1 fig 2 a although some disturbance of the channel may have occurred during the restoration measures were taken during the restoration to reduce erosion including pinning of erosion control nets and fabric along the stream our results at the dead run gage are unlikely to have been compromised by these activities between the gage and the restoration area and along t1 channels are incised fig 2b c with steep eroding streambanks and bed material that ranges from gravel and sands to fines dead run is

rainfall stormwater runoff pavement sediment road and parking lot particulates soil streambank material and fluvial sediment bed and ss were collected during three periods 1 summer 14 july 17 aug 2017 2 fall 20 oct 10 nov 2017 and 3 winter spring 27 feb 14 may 2018 seasons 2 2 1 sample collection rainfall n 33 samples was collected in two 9 5 l acid washed plastic buckets placed 1 5 m above the ground rainfall for the summer was collected at the usgs office in catonsville md 6 km from the dead run gage and for the other seasons was collected at a rain gage at the dead run gage the rain sample was acidified with 10 hydrochloric acid hcl and transferred to 1 l bottles along with three 10 hcl rinses of the collection bucket prior to shipping to the usgs sediment radioisotope laboratory in menlo park ca for 7be 210pbex and 137cs analysis runoff samples as defined here are stormwater runoff that occurs on impervious surfaces and contains sediment two types of runoff were sampled stormwater runoff collected at the alexander culvert n 9 samples and road runoff collected at road storm drains and parking lot storm drains n 8 samples both types of runoff were collected by submerging an 18 9 l bucket into the runoff flow pavement sediment samples n 85 samples were collected at the beginning of each sampling season and after rainfall events at four road sites chosen to represent the range of road types present in the watershed residential and commercial and from one parking lot in the alexander culvert watershed fig 1 similar to collins et al 2011 pavement sediment was collected with a hand broom and dustpan from alongside the curb and upgradient of a storm grate and placed in a plastic bag in order to obtain at least 3 g of fine sediment the area swept varied between samples and although each area was swept clean it is likely that some sediment remained behind to estimate the mass of material present on pavement in the area draining to alexander culvert sediment also was sampled 4 times with a high efficiency vacuum envirometrics model hvs3 high volume surface sampler n 39 samples the vacuum which is designed for sampling settled house dust at particle sizes 5 µm or larger was fitted with a 12 5 cm long 1 cm wide nozzle prior to outdoor sampling controlled tests with the vacuum were done in the usgs baltimore md laboratory where known masses of fine material 63 µm were vacuumed the hvs3 averaged 98 3 efficiency for the range of masses tested table s1 although wind and unevenness of the pavement surface may introduce variability when sampling outdoors for two of the four vacuuming events only the pavement sites used in the sweep samples not including street c fig 1 were vacuumed for the other two vacuuming events sites were selected randomly to cover the spatial extent of the alexander culvert drainage area each sample was collected by starting at the midpoint in the road and ending at the curb a sediment yield at each vacuum site was determined by dividing the sediment mass recovered by the area vacuumed determined as the width of the nozzle 12 5 cm multiplied by the road or parking lot length sampled m yields are reported as a total unsieved sediment yield g m2 and a fine 63 µm sediment yield g m2 we consider both of these yields as potential sediment yields as the entire mass of sediment may not be mobilized and transported from the pavement by any given rain event soil samples were collected at nine sites fig 1 in the dead run watershed at each site three to five subsamples were taken using a plastic spatula from the top 1 cm of surficial soil within 3 m of one another and composited four samples of streambank material were taken from eroding streambanks between the restored area and the dead run gage fig 1 prior to sample collection the exposed surface of a streambank was scraped off and discarded each streambank sample is a composite of subsamples from 3 to 5 eroding streambanks collected from the bottom to the top of each streambank using a plastic hand shovel fluvial sediment consisted of samples of ss and bed material ss was collected at alexander culvert and the dead run gage figs 1 and 2d e using passive samplers phillips et al 2000 after a rainfall event water if present and sediment were removed from the passive samplers and transferred to 18 9 l buckets samples of bed material were collected at the dead run gage bed material was collected from the surface 1cm of fine grained channel deposits using a stainless steel spatula sediment from at least five deposits was collected and composited into one sample a bed sample was not collected at alexander culvert because the channel immediately below the culvert was a transport reach with a gravel bed devoid of fines for most of the collection period 2 2 2 sample analysis all samples were transported to the usgs laboratory in baltimore md and refrigerated sediment for radionuclide analysis pavement sediment soil bank material decanted ss samples following a minimum of 1 week of refrigeration and settling and bed material were wet sieved with distilled deionized di water using a 63 μm polyester sieve the sieved slurry was collected in glass bowls and dried at 65 c for 2 or more days the dried fine sediment 63 μm was removed with a plastic utensil and sent for analysis of fallout radionuclides organic carbon content and grain size sediment samples were analyzed for 7be 210pb 226ra and 137cs at the usgs sediment radioisotope laboratory in menlo park ca using high resolution germanium detector gamma spectrometers following methods described in fuller et al 1999 and van metre et al 2004 measured activities of 7be and 137cs were corrected for radioactive decay from the date of sample collection to the date of analysis excess 210pbex was calculated as the difference between the measured total 210pb and 226ra which is determined from the short lived intermediate gamma emitting isotopes 214pb and 214bi method detection limits mdls for 7be and 210pbex were 0 0067 bq g the sample specific detection limit for 7be was determined by correcting the mdl for decay and varied among samples 0 0117 to 0 0317 bq g as a result of different times between sample collection and analysis the mdl for 137cs was 0 0004 bq g the reported 1 sigma uncertainty in the measured radionuclide activity σ1 was calculated from the random counting error of samples and background standard spectra at the 1 standard deviation level uncertainty in measured activity was typically within 10 of the measured activity for total 210pb and 226ra 18 for 7be and 20 for 137cs uncertainty in unsupported 210pb was propagated from the uncertainties in total 210pb and 226ra activity and averaged 20 acidified rain samples were screened through 63 µm polypropylene mesh into a container along with three 10 hcl rinses of each shipping bottle and processed following the methods outlined in conaway et al 2013 and nakano et al 2008 to concentrate the radionuclides into a small volume briefly 0 100 ml each of stable pb and be inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms stock standard solutions 1000 µg ml was added to the acidified sample to determine recovery five ml of 10 wt v solution of ferric chloride was added to facilitate concentration of radionuclides by sorption of pb and be to iron hydroxide formed on raising ph samples were equilibrated on an orbital shaker for 48 h concentrated ammonium hydroxide was then added to increase ph to 10 and precipitate iron hydroxide to sorb both the stable and radioactive isotopes of pb and be the iron hydroxide floc was recovered by centrifugation after settling and decanting off the overlying solution by siphon the concentrated iron hydroxide was then dissolved in concentrated hcl and transferred to a tared bottle concentrations of the added stable pb and be yield tracers in rainfall samples were measured by icp ms recoveries averaged 95 8 and 86 6 for stable pb and be respectively a subsample was transferred and weighed into a polyethylene vial for radionuclide analysis by high resolution gamma spectrometry as described for sediment samples activities of 210pb and 7be in rainfall samples were corrected for the recovery yield of pb and be ratio of measured to added mass of stable and pb and be and the fraction of redissolved sample analyzed this method assumes that the stable pb and be attain isotopic equilibrium with all fallout radionuclides in the sample such that the radioisotopes are recovered in the same proportion as the yield tracer the resulting activity was then divided by volume of rain collected to yield activities in units of bq l 137cs and 226ra were below detection limits in rain samples indicating negligible contributions of 210pb and 7be from aeolian dust that may have entered the rainfall collector additionally all 210pb activity in rainfall is considered unsupported 210pb 210pbex because the supported activity defined by 226ra was not detectable runoff samples were split in the laboratory to determine fallout radionuclide activities in whole water and in isolated particulates one split was churned and an aliquot was taken to determine the suspended sediment concentration ssc the volume of the aliquot was recorded and the aliquot was pumped through a 0 45 µm glass fiber filter the filter was dried at 105 c and weighed the remaining slurry from this split was processed for analysis in the same manner as ss from the passive samplers to record activity in the particulates in bq g a second split was prepared and analyzed in the same way as rainwater to measure total whole water 7be and 210pbex activities it was assumed that 7be and 210pb are effectively solubilized from the ss at the low ph of the acidified sample it also was assumed that isotopic equilibrium is attained between yield tracers stable pb and be and 7be and 210pb both in solution and on sediments 210pb activity in total whole water runoff samples is considered unsupported 210pb 210pbex because the supported activity defined by 226ra was not detectable reported activities in the whole water samples in units of bq l were normalized to ssc to obtain units of bq g additional analytical methods for sediment are shown in si text i 2 2 3 collection and computation of rainfall turbidity suspended sediment and flow umbc operates a rainfall and water quality network in the baltimore metropolitan region that includes dead run water quality sensors and a rain gage station are co located with usgs stream gage 01589312 the collection and computation methods for rainfall turbidity suspended sediment and flow are described in si text ii 2 3 potential activity of 7be and 210pbex we used measured activities of 210pbex and 7be in rainfall potential sediment yields from pavement and 210pbex and 7be activities in pavement sediment measured prior to the rainfall event to estimate the enrichment of pavement sediment that might occur potential activity in response to a rainfall event the potential activity of 7be and 210pbex in the sweep samples after being tagged by rainfall was determined as 1 rdsed pot t r a i n tot rain act sed yld r d s e d p r e where rdsedpot t is the potential activity of 7be or 210pbex in pavement sediment for sample period t as a result of precipitation bq g raintot is the total rainfall over 1 m2 of the ground surface l m2 rainact is the measured activity of 7be or 210pbex in rainfall bq l sedyld is the median fine sediment yield from vacuuming g m2 1 57 g m2 clifton et al 2019 and rdsedpre is the pavement sediment activity for 7be or 210pbex bq g prior to the rainfall event and corrected for 7be decay since the time of the last pavement sediment sweep because of the strong affinity of 7be and 210pbex to fine particulate matter benmansour et al 2014 taylor et al 2012 we assume that all whole water runoff samples have an activity per liter bq l equal to rainfall and that some of the 7be and 210pbex are likely sorbed to particles and surfaces that are not transported with runoff to the culvert the calculation therefore provides an upper limit for radionuclide tagging 2 4 sediment sourcing pavement sediment can be from a mixture of sources including upland soil from lawns and open space building and construction material leaf litter atmospheric deposition of particles worn tires and pavement erosion taylor and owens 2009 sansalone and cristina 2004 a two endmember mixing model using 137cs as a tracer was used to calculate soil and non soil sources to pavement sediment one endmember is soil with an activity equal to the median of the 137cs activity in soil samples 0 0071 bq g clifton et al 2019 the non soil endmember is assigned zero activity under the assumption that the non soil material is from sources such as construction materials and tire and asphalt wear that are not expected to have detectable 137cs activity the percentage of pavement residue originating from soil was determined as 2 soil cs sample cs med 100 where soil is the percentage of the sample that is derived from soil cssample is the 137cs activity bq g of the sample and csmed is the median of the 137cs activities in the soil samples 0 0071 bq g to determine sources of ss samples collected from alexander culvert and ss and bed sediment at dead run an unmixing model commonly used in sediment source studies was applied 3 r e s i 1 n cssi s 1 m c s i p s cssi 2 where res is the residual sum of squares cssi is the concentration of tracer property i in the target sediment csi is the mean concentration of the tracer property in the source group s and ps is the relative contribution from source group s after walling 2005 after schuller et al 2013 the unmixing model equation assumes that 0 ps 1 and 4 s 1 m p s 1 the ps that yields the lowest residual sum of squares corresponds to the final source contributions pavement soil banks for a given target sample 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall and flow during the study rainfall pavement and fluvial samples were collected for 17 sampling periods over a range of flows distributed over the three sampling seasons fig 3 table 2 si table s2 a sample period begins after the last sample is collected from the previous sampling period the end of a rainfall event and ends when the last sample of the current sampling period is collected also a rainfall event samples collected during each sampling period can include pavement sweeps dry weather and rainfall runoff and suspended and bed sediment from one or more rainfall events a sampling period had as many as one to five peak flows depending on how closely spaced the rainfall events were table 2 the decision to collect samples was based on rainfall and discharge the lower sediment tube at dead run gage filled at a discharge of about 0 19 m3 s when it rained we examined the on line real time discharge at dead run if it exceeded 0 19 m3 s the decision was made to retrieve ss samples if conditions permitted low flow street sweeps were collected only when conditions were dry additional rainfall event s did occur before it was possible to get street sweeps during some sampling periods and thus a sampling period may have had multiple rainfall and ss samples but only one set of sweep samples often because of high flow conditions it was not possible to access the suspended sampler immediately at the end of the event and in some of these cases a second flow event occurred table 2 during the same sampling period and the sampler composited suspended sediment over more than one closely spaced rainfall event rain samples were collected during 16 of the 17 sampling periods and analyzed for radionuclides seventeen runoff samples 9 stormwater samples at alexander culvert and 8 stormwater samples from roads were collected during 4 of the 17 sampling periods table 2 of the 9 runoff samples collected at alexander culvert 7 were used for whole water analysis bq l and 6 were used for dry sediment analysis bq g of the 8 runoff samples collected on roads 7 were used for whole water analysis bq l and 5 were used for dry sediment analysis bq g clifton et al 2019 to determine if any of the seasons sampled were drier or wetter than average rainfall for each sampling season was compared to the historic rainfall for the same season measured at the national weather service gage at the baltimore washington international airport usw00093721 16 2 km from the dead run gage table s3 the three seasons had rainfall that was 179 summer 137 fall and 70 winter spring of normal rainfall for that season table s3 the wetter summer and fall seasons could affect the results by supplying more sediment than might occur during average rainfall conditions or could cause higher flows that exhaust sediment in channel storage conversely samples collected during the drier winter spring season might reflect lower sediment flux than might occur during average rainfall conditions 3 2 radionuclide activities in source and collected sediment samples the three types of source material pavement sediment upland soil and streambanks have characteristic activities of 7be 210pbex and 137cs that reflect differences in initial pre rain activities and the timing and intensity of radionuclide tagging and dilution clifton et al 2019 activities of 137cs were higher in soils than in streambank material and similar to or higher than those in pavement sediment fig 4 fallout of 137cs for north america largely ceased by the late 1960s ritchie and mchenry 1990 and soil now is a reservoir of legacy 137cs from past fallout variable 137cs activities in pavement sediment likely reflect varying contributions of upland soil to the sediment on the impervious surface significant differences in activities of 137cs as well as 210pbex and 7be among some of the pavement sediment sites mann whitney rank sum test p 0 05 table s4 likely reflect different source contributions to sediment at a site the detection of 137cs activity in some streambanks indicates that these samples do not represent older alluvial deposits which should be devoid of 137cs but may indicate deposition from eroded topsoil that occurred when parts of the dead run watershed were developed between the 1950s and 1970s the median year for homes built in the dead run watershed was 1962 barnes et al 2018 which is one year earlier than the peak fallout of 137cs thus topsoil mobilized during the build out of the area would have contained relatively high 137cs which could have been deposited on the floodplain in contrast to 137cs 210pbex and 7be are continually deposited on the land surface by atmospheric fallout resulting in distinct signatures of these two radionuclides in the three sediment sources activities of 210pbex and 7be were substantially higher in samples of pavement sediment than in samples of upland soil and streambank material fig 4a b the difference between activities in pavement sediment and streambank material is consistent with the limited exposure of streambanks to modern atmospheric fallout gellis et al 2017b hancock et al 2014 matisoff et al 2005 the soil activities of 210pbex in dead run watershed are similar to those reported for agricultural topsoil in the midwest gellis et al 2017b fig 5 the difference between activities in pavement sediment and upland soil fig 5 reflects the difference in the mass of sediment exposed to rain on pavement a thin veneer of sediment is exposed to a relatively large volume of rain whereas for soil the top several centimeters are exposed as a result on a per gram basis pavement sediment receives greater amounts of radionuclides resulting in higher activities during a rain event than does soil activities of 210pbex and 7be in pavement sediment are correlated r2 0 51 fig s2a because they both are delivered to the earth s surface by rainfall and both associate with particles mcneary and baskaran 2003 matisoff et al 2005 in contrast 210pbex in pavement sediment is not correlated with activities of 137cs fig s2b r2 0 12 and suggests a fundamental difference between pavement sediment and soils fig 5 however 210pbex and 137cs are strongly correlated in soils wallbrink and murray 1996 huh and su 2004 porto et al 2010 teramage et al 2013 porto et al 2010 suggested that the close relation of 210pbex and 137cs activities in soils reflects a similar and consistent response to erosion and sediment redistribution processes pavement sediment which is transported away and replenished over short time scales does not undergo such processes we interpret the lack of correlation between 210pbex and 137cs activities in pavement sediment as resulting from tagging of pavement sediment by recent fallout of 210pbex and 7be but not of 137cs activities of 7be 210pbex and 137cs in runoff ss and bed samples are expected to be bracketed by those in the sediment sources pavement sediment soils and for dead run streambanks activities of 137cs in fluvial sediments collected at alexander culvert and dead run are within the range of source sediment pavement sediment upland soil and streambank material fig 4c activities of 7be and 210pbex in ss at alexander culvert however are similar to or greater than those in the assumed source materials fig 4a b the explanation for this is presented in section 3 3 3 3 radionuclide activity by event activities of 210pbex and 7be are highest in particles in runoff alexander and road runoff followed by ss at alexander culvert and pavement sediment figs s3a c the amount of enrichment of 7be and 210pbex in runoff and alexander culvert ss relative to the pavement sediment samples can be quite large as indicated by the ratios of these activities for the four runoff periods sampled to pavement sediment sample activities fig 6 we hypothesize that the difference in activities provides critical insight into the dynamics of 210pbex and 7be particle tagging at the scale of an urban watershed and explains why the fluvial sample 210pbex and 7be activities are not bracketed by the source activities rainfall runoff entrains a relatively small mass of particles in suspension which comes in contact with a relatively large volume of precipitation leading to enrichment in particle associated radionuclides carried by the rainfall runoff the mass of particles that remains on the pavement also is exposed to rainfall but the ratio of rainfall volume to pavement sediment mass is smaller resulting in less enrichment on a per particle mass basis by extension soil with its much greater mass of particles and downward diffusion of rainwater through infiltration is even less enriched by a given rainfall event than are pavement particles fig 5 one of the four rainfall events sampled 2 august 2017 included runoff samples collected in alexander culvert shortly after the onset of rainfall figs s3aix xi s4 for that event 7be activity of sediment in runoff samples decreased through the event 12 6 10 4 8 81 3 24 bq g fig s3 ax a similar pattern was observed for 210pbex 2 65 2 41 1 66 0 65 bq g fig s3axi delivery of 7be has been observed to decrease rapidly during a rain event a process attributed to scavenging and washout of radionuclides from the atmosphere caillet et al 2001 ioannidou and papastefanou 2006 gourdin et al 2014 thus the earlier part of the runoff period would have higher radionuclide tagging of sediment than later in the event decreasing activities of 7be and 210pbex relative to the onset of rainfall could be related to the washout of those radionuclides during an event fig s5 however the composite rainfall samples collected by this study do not allow for an evaluation of rainfall activities over the course of the event furthermore fallout radionuclide activity during a storm can be influenced by other factors such as cloud height storm types and duration and seasonality todd et al 1989 kaste et al 2002 karwan et al 2016 another potential explanation for the higher activities in the alexander culvert runoff and ss samples versus other sources is grain size and organic content differences among the sample types the activity of radionuclides has been shown to increase with decreasing sediment size taylor et al 2014 he and walling 1996 and increasing organic content navas et al 2011 motha et al 2002 examination of grain size d50 and organic content total organic carbon toc among sample types does not indicate that the alexander culvert ss has finer grain sizes or higher toc content fig s6 and thus neither grain size nor organic content explain the higher activities in the alexander culvert runoff and ss samples relative to sediment sources froger et al 2018 also did not observe any relation between sediment grain size and 7be and 210pbex activities for an urban area in france 3 4 sediment sources a two endmember model using 137cs eq 2 determined the sources of pavement sediment and indicates a soil contribution to the pavement sediment samples n 85 of 26 23 the high variability within the source contributions reflect the heterogeneity of pavement sediment and is consistent with other studies that have reported a wide range of soil and or inorganic sediment on impervious surfaces loganathan et al 2013 sartor et al 1974 fergusson and ryan 1984 sediment sources to suspended sediment collected at alexander culvert and suspended and bed sediment collected at dead run were apportioned using an unmixing model eqs 3 and 4 with three tracers 7be 210pbex 137cs and the results averaged table 3 table s5 several metrics mean median 90th percentile were tested for each endmember the pavement sediment endmember was assigned the median pavement sediment activities for 137cs 0 0015 bq g and the median activities from runoff for 210pbex 1 638 bq g and 7be 4 121 bq g assuming that these runoff particles more reasonably represent activities of pavement sediment that is transported to the stream because pavement sediment is not currently subject to fallout of 137cs we believed it adequately reflected 137cs activities in runoff median radionuclide activities were used for the soil endmembers 137cs 0 0071 bq g 210pbex 0 1070 bq g 7be 0 0611 bq g and values were set to one half the detection levels for the streambank and other fallout radionuclide free material endmember 210pbex 0 0033 bq g 7be 0 0050 bq g 137cs 0 0002 bq g low fallout radionuclide activities in some target samples indicate that a low activity or fallout radionuclide free endmember is supplying sediment in spite of the detection of 137cs and to lesser extent 210pbex in bank samples collected for this study large variation in activities of the endmember and target samples resulted in large variability 20 in source proportions for the alexander ss samples table 3 target samples should be bracketed by the source sample activities within 10 of the minimum and 10 of maximum activity gellis and gorman sanisaca 2018 in 4 of 57 target samples the sample activities of 210pbex n 1 and 7be n 4 were outside the range of endmember activities in a direction that implies a mix of soil and pavement sediment the two higher activity sources fig 7 all four target samples were alexander culvert ss which had relatively high activities of 7be and 210pbex one possible explanation for the activities in these samples is that the soil in suspension in runoff is being tagged by rainfall radionuclides in the runoff similar to the tagging of the pavement sediment the model results indicate that pavement sediment is the dominant sediment source in the buried channel part of the watershed at alexander culvert and that downstream at dead run where the channel is open streambank sediment dominates the unmixing model results in a mean pavement contribution at alexander culvert of 45 25 in ss samples with a contribution from older channel material of 32 35 and the remainder coming from soils 22 19 table 3 these relatively large contributions of pavement sediment are consistent with the ranges of 210pbex and 7be in pavement sediment runoff and alexander culvert samples fig 7 and with the nature of the contributing watershed the dead run gage site sampled the open channel portion thus all three potential sources are expected based on the unmixing model the mean fraction of pavement sediment is 15 9 in dead run ss and 4 2 in bed sediment the decrease in the pavement sediment contribution from alexander culvert to dead run indicates relatively rapid dilution of the pavement sediment fraction downstream from where buried channels emerge into open channels the dilution is from streambanks which contributed 57 15 of the dead run ss and 57 12 of the dead run bed sediment counterintuitively the model results indicate an average of 32 35 streambank contribution to alexander culvert ss with very high variability between sampled events because the culvert emerges from buried channels with no exposed streambanks there should be only two major sources possible soil and pavement sediment we interpret the modeled component of streambank material at the culvert as older channel material and subsoil eroded from within the culvert system in many urban areas stream channels have been buried in pipes culverts and combined sewer systems broadhead and lerner 2013 broadhead et al 2015 elmore and kaushal 2008 the breakup cracking and wear of these underground pipes and culverts is common and leads to openings that allow the surrounding soil to enter the pipe infiltration tang et al 2018 sato and kuwano 2015 ellis 2001 the continued erosion of the soil forms a cavity and in some cases leads to sinkholes ali and choi 2019 sato and kuwano 2015 tang et al 2018 we hypothesize that the bank source contributions observed in our model output at alexander culvert reflect buried channel sediment entering the culvert through openings further studies that examine sediment transport and the condition of underground pipes in areas of buried channels may help to resolve this question and radionuclide analyses such as done here could indicate culvert systems subject to underground failures sediment budgets from the literature that quantify sediment sources in urban watersheds indicate that the contribution from impervious areas ranges from 4 to 46 table s6 covering the range in pavement sediment contributions to fluvial sediments from the alexander culvert 45 and dead run gage 4 to 15 table 3 contributions from soil 22 to 39 and streambank and other fallout radionuclide free material i e older channel deposits 32 to 57 sources at dead run are also within the range reported for other urban areas table s6 because pavement sediment is a vector for metals pahs and other urban contaminants van metre and mahler 2003 mahler et al 2005 callender and rice 2000 its proportion in fluvial sediment is an indicator of the contribution of pavement sediment to sediment contamination the high percentage of pavement sediment at alexander culvert indicates the potential for contaminant hot spots where culverts and buried channels discharge to urban streams although the fraction of pavement sediment decreases rapidly with distance downstream it nonetheless accounts for about one third or more of suspended sediment in some samples at the dead run gage 3 5 potential radionuclide tagging of pavement sediment based on eq 1 the potential activity of 7be and 210pbex added to pavement sediment by tagging from rain events is more than sufficient to account for the sediment activity measured in the runoff and the alexander culvert ss samples fig 8 activities in runoff samples and rain samples are also compared using whole water units of measurement bq l activity volume table s7 which avoids the large uncertainty in the pavement sediment yields activities of 210pbex and 7be in rain are substantially greater than those in whole water samples of runoff for the same event table s7 although the rainfall samples reflect rainfall collected over a longer time than represented by the runoff and the runoff samples represent a single point in time the data are consistent with the hypothesis that a substantial part of the rainfall load of 7be and 210pbex does not exit the system but is retained within watershed soils pavement surface or other solid surfaces 3 6 urban pavement sediment yields the total potential sediment yield determined from vacuuming sand and fines averaged 55 6 97 2 g m2 and the fine sediment potential yield averaged 5 9 11 7 g m2 n 39 the high variability and skewness figs s7a b are consistent with those reported for other studies sartor et al 1974 the median total sediment yield 15 4 g m2 and fine sediment yield of 1 57 g m2 were used in further analysis parking lot samples had significantly lower total and fine sediment yields than road samples mann whitney rank sum test p 0 003 figs s7a b pavement sediment yields determined for this study are comparable to those reported by waschbush 2003 and by selbig and bannerman 2007 but are greater than those reported by mahler et al 2005 figs s7 c most of the pavement sediment mass is sand sized mean percentage of material 63 μm of 16 1 16 9 a grain size commonly found in urban environments sartor et al 1974 waschbush 2003 selbig and bannerman 2007 taylor and owens 2009 could pavement sediment constitute a substantial part of stream sediment in an urban environment wolman 1967 presented a conceptual model where sediment yields in an urban environment were projected to decrease after development related to the loss of upland sediment source areas contrary to this expected decline in sediment yield as urban areas expand gellis et al 2017a cashman et al 2018 found that sediment yields for difficult run an urban suburban watershed in virginia outside of washington d c remained high even after 30 or more years had passed since peak rates of urbanization both studies attributed the high sediment yields to streambank erosion to determine the potential sediment load and yield available on impervious services the median total and fine yields from the vacuum samples were extrapolated to the total impervious area of roads and parking lots in the dead run gage 0 42 km2 table 1 the results indicate that about 6 4 and 0 65 mg of total and fine sediment respectively are present on impervious surfaces in the dead run watershed at any given time the average annual ss load at the dead run gage 2013 2016 is 127 mg kemper et al 2019 three events sampled for percent fines in dead run at catonsville and surrounding gages table s8 indicated that on average 91 of the suspended sediment is 63 µm if the same ratio of fines and sand in suspended sediment is applied to the impervious surface sediment then 0 71 mg of sediment is available for transport which is a very small percentage 0 6 of the total annual suspended sediment load measured at the dead run gage however this relatively small mass represents the potential sediment available at any one time on roads and parking lots and it is likely that only a part of this impervious sediment is mobilized in a given flow event to estimate the total mass of impervious sediment mobilized in a given year from all events we first defined an event as when peak flow exceeds the 90th percentile of all 5 minute discharges for the 2017 and 2018 study period 0 032 m3 s using this definition 68 flow events occurred sediment delivery in urban watersheds can be high russell et al 2019 and in watersheds with impervious areas similar to dead run 50 the sediment delivery ratio is 50 heathcoate 2009 if we assume that 50 of the impervious sediment is mobilized and delivered to the stream the estimated total contribution of the 68 events is 24 mg or 19 of the annual sediment load our results suggest that the sediment available for transport from roads and parking lots has the potential to be an important contributor to the total sediment load in an urban stream as well as an important contributor of contaminants we recognize that values assigned to define an event and to estimate the percentage of sediment mobilized on impervious surfaces were arbitrary the actual mass available for transport mobilized from impervious areas and delivered to the stream would require systematic event based monitoring over time which was beyond the scope of this study however this estimate of pavement sediment determined using the sediment yield provided by the vacuum cleaner results 19 is similar to the pavement sediment contribution results from the unmixing model 15 for dead run ss table 3 indicating our assumption of 50 mobility in a given event is reasonable 3 7 conceptual model we propose a conceptual model based on the activities of 7be and 210pbex in rain runoff samples pavement sediment topsoil and fluvial samples that describes how activities of 7be 210pbex 137cs in sediment change as sediment is transported in an urban setting fig 9 antecedent conditions control the initial 7be and 210pbex activity of pavement sediment before a rainfall runoff event occurs as reflected by the activities of the pavement sediment samples collected prior to rain events this initial activity is a function of 7be and 210pbex activity tagging from previous events dilution from deposition of other material with lower activities of those radionuclides during and between events and decay of 7be since the last event decay is negligible for 210pbex over the short period between rainfall events we assume that the highest activities of 7be and 210pbex in rainfall occur early in the rain event initial runoff and decrease exponentially ioannidou and papastefanou 2006 fig s5 pavement sediment particles transported by initial rainfall runoff receive the highest amounts of 7be and 210pbex because sediment mass is small relative to rainwater volume these particles are transported to the stream where they contribute to the radionuclide activities of ss and to a lesser degree bed sediment fig 9 this initial runoff of tagged sediment is reflected in elevated 7be and 210pbex activities figs s3a c and ssc in the runoff samples table s7 throughout the runoff period fig 9 pavement sediment continues to be tagged by rain a process that is cumulative but activities in pavement sediment are lower than those in runoff sediment for three possible reasons 1 lower rainfall activities of 7be and 210pbex later in the event 2 the relatively greater ratio of residual pavement sediment mass to rainfall volume compared to that of suspended sediment mass in runoff to rainfall volume i e runoff water and 3 dilution of the remaining pavement sediment with soil during the event as soil is eroded and transported to adjacent impervious surfaces fallout radionuclide analysis confirms that pavement sediment contains a component of soil the suspended sediment collected at the alexander culvert integrates activities over the storm hydrograph which includes the higher activities of 7be and 210pbex in the initial runoff and lower activities of 7be and 210pbex from later runoff and from topsoil and bank material fig 9 the results of this study indicate that the proportion of pavement sediment in suspended sediment in the buried channel part of the urban watershed is substantially higher than in the open channel reaches as a result concentrations of urban pavement related contaminants associated with suspended sediment also are likely to be higher in buried channels the part of an urban watershed that is directly connected to the stream by stormwater drains and buried channels has been termed effective imperviousness booth and jackson 1997 and has been reported to be a better predictor of ecologically relevant geomorphic indicators vietz et al 2014 and bedload yield russell et al 2018 than the percentage of total impervious cover over the watershed our results indicate that the better prediction capability may be because effective imperviousness better represents areas of potential contaminant transport to the stream than does total impervious area delineating the part of an urban watershed that contains buried channels may provide insight into how sediment and contaminants are transported in urban environments 4 summary and conclusion our results indicate that material washed from impervious surfaces pavement sediment is an important contributor to urban stream sediment especially in areas with large amounts of impervious surface and buried channels pavement sediment can be a vector for many common urban contaminants and can be an especially important contributor to receiving streams where networks of buried channels exit into open channels activities of 7be and 210pbex in fluvial sediment differ between buried and open channels fallout of 7be and 210pbex in rainfall and radionuclide tagging of pavement sediment increases the activities on the sediment which also contains relic activities from previous events we hypothesize that the low ratio of sediment mass to rainfall volume in entrained sediment results in higher activities in the runoff sediment than in the pavement sediment which in turn is for the same reason more highly tagged than soils as runoff particles move through buried channels activities of 7be and 210pbex remain high with the exception of material entering buried channels through cracks and breaks there is limited opportunity for dilution by soils and streambank erosion once the suspended sediment moves into the open channel parts of the watershed 7be and 210pbex activities are diluted by contributions of lower activity sediment from stream beds and streambanks these findings support the hypothesis that sediment from urban impervious surfaces is substantially enriched in 210pbex and 7be from rainfall but not in 137cs resulting in a unique radionuclide signature compared to other sediment source settings this difference in source activity provides a tool for identifying the sediment contribution to streams from heavily developed urban areas and suggests the need to define source terms by land use in regional stream sediment source and age studies using

5363,the kashmir valley represents a critical region for understanding isotopic changes in the atmospheric moisture sources since it is located at the intercept between the influences of mid latitude westerlies and the southwest monsoon circulation this study presents the variation in isotopic composition δ18o and δ2h of daily precipitation samples collected from the kashmir valley north western himalaya to quantify the effect of meteorological parameters separately for the southwest monsoon swm season and the periods of western disturbances wds the results suggest that precipitation isotopic composition is strongly modulated by temperature and relative humidity during the periods of wds still this dependency is weak in the case of the swm season moisture transport pathways calculated from hysplit back trajectory analysis shows a wide spatial variability during the monsoon season on the other hand the origin of moisture during the wd season was mostly restricted from the mediterranean region providing an explanation of a strong dependency between the precipitation isotopes and the meteorological parameters during the wd period such kind of relation may provide additional diagnostic for the wd events and may help in paleo monsoon investigations keywords precipitation isotope monsoon western disturbances kashmir valley 1 introduction investigating the control of atmospheric variables on the stable isotope composition in daily precipitation is essential for better understanding of the regional hydrological cycle ait brahim et al 2016 dar and ghosh 2017 midhun et al 2018 bajaj et al 2019 garaga et al 2019 lekshmy et al 2019 ansari et al 2020 earlier studies have demonstrated the significance of isotope fractionation processes in precipitation on spatio temporal scales as a fingerprint to record the moisture transport pathways and other processes xie et al 2011 yu et al 2014 2015 midhun et al 2018 sinha et al 2019 sinha and chakraborty 2019 this is because both hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions denoted as δ2h and δ18o respectively in precipitation undergo spatio temporal variability that depends on various meteorological parameters and processes such as vapor source the degree of moisture recycling relative humidity rh temperature and circulation tian et al 2007 the regional climate of the himalayas is dominated by two distinct moisture transport pathways western disturbances wds and the south west monsoon swm wds are a type of eastward moving extra tropical cyclonic weather systems affecting the northern indian climate and contributes significantly to the northern indian winter october may precipitation dimri and mohanty 2009 cannon et al 2014 these upper air troughs or cyclonic circulations in mid latitudes pickup moisture from the mediterranean black sea and the caspian sea and thus strongly influence the precipitation over the himalayas especially the core westerly zone of the kashmir valley dimri and mohanty 2009 the wds deliver a large amount of precipitation 40 45 of annual average to the western himalayas and thus have a significant influence on the socio economic activities in this monsoon shadow region providing water resources to himalayan rivers and high altitude glaciers madhura et al 2014 in the context of kashmir valley a plethora of work has been carried out by several authors regarding the isotopic composition of monthly and seasonal scale precipitation sources jeelani et al 2013 2015 jeelani et al 2017 2018 jeelani and deshpande 2017 these studies have highlighted the monthly and seasonal variability in precipitation isotopes and identified the control of dual moisture sources associated with wds and swm derived precipitation however being the monthly composites these studies were not capable of resolving the short term processes that are related to individual rain events corresponding to the wd and swm moisture sources so far there is only a single study by jeelani et al 2018 highlighting the variability in stable isotopes using daily precipitation datasets however this study mainly focused on assessing the spatial variability of stable isotopes in rainwater from the southern foothills of the himalayas srinagar jammu kashmir in western india to dibrugarh assam in northeast india furthermore meteorological parameters such as temperature relative humidity surface pressure are known to be essential factors and significantly affect the himalayan atmospheric moisture budget tiwari et al 2016 for instance it is qualitatively known that the isotopic values of precipitation driven by dual moisture pathways swm and wd events respond differently to the meteorological parameters such as precipitation temperature relative humidity but no effort has so far been made to quantify their role the indian subcontinent is characterized by its large spatial expanse and heterogeneity in weather systems that give rise to a variety of climatic regimes dimri and chevuturi 2016 this variability and pattern of monsoonal rains summer and winter have a significant impact on regional livelihoods perennial rivers glaciers and of particular importance to countries like india as the agricultural and economic activities of the country highly depend on the seasonal precipitation both wd and swm moreover the flow of himalayan rivers and the seasonal glacial ice cover primarily rely on the amount and duration of the wd and swm derived precipitation the snow melt and the perennial rivers provide freshwater resources to a significant portion of the asian population living in the downstream areas bershaw et al 2012 hence any changes in the strength and behavior of these two precipitation drivers may have severe consequences on the regional socio economic and agricultural activities particularly during periods of droughts and floods dimri et al 2015 in this study we have measured the isotopic composition of daily precipitation from kashmir valley north western himalaya to better quantify the relationship between the precipitation isotopes and some of the essential meteorological variables such as temperature rh and the surface pressure since the region is influenced by the dual moisture transport pathways studying the feedback processes between precipitation isotopes and meteorological parameters would be crucial for a better understanding of the regional hydrology the shortage of daily precipitation δ18o isotope time series measurements from this region also makes it difficult to assess the accuracy of results derived from precipitation isotope based model simulation studies the high temporal resolution of daily precipitation isotope data from this study will help to constrain the dynamical controls on precipitation isotope δ18o variability in this region further this will also prove useful to operational meteorologists to observe the synoptic scale processes hence the primary objective of this study is to establish quantitative relation between the precipitation isotopes and the basic weather parameters for both the wd and swm further we discuss how these relationships may help in studying the present and past climatic processes 2 study area 2 1 modern climate setting the himalayan region is characterized by a highly variable climate and day to day weather changes significantly even over short distances these changes are governed by local factors such as topography and large scale processes like extra tropical disturbances the kashmir valley enjoys mediterranean to a sub mediterranean type of temperate climate characterized by four well marked seasons viz spring summer autumn and winter bagnolus and meher homji 1959 although the sway of swm into the kashmir valley is still enigmatic due to the upliftment of pir panjal ranges however it is believed that a significant amount of arabian sea and bay of bengal borne sw monsoon winds enter the kashmir valley through the mountainous passes jeelani et al 2017 jeelani and deshpande 2017 it has been noted that the precipitation exhibits a very distinct distribution pattern compared to the regions that are heavily influenced by the swm jeelani et al 2017 2018 the climatological variation of monthly precipitation and temperature are shown in fig 1 a in this region the temperature attains its annual maximum value during the months of july and august whereas over the rest of india the maximum temperature is reached in may to illustrate the effect of the pir panjal mountain range that restricts the entry of swm generated moisture into the kashmir valley we have compared the climatological precipitation distributions of srinagar meteorological station mostly affected by wds and jammu meteorological station affected mainly by swm fig 1b illustrates this comparison the partial blocking of the swm winds by the pir panjal ranges and the northern extent of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz governs the moisture transport that finally precipitate in these two regions the jammu area receives dominant precipitation from swm sources and less precipitation from the wds however the kashmir valley is dominated by precipitation brought by the wds during october may and receives relatively reduced precipitation during the swm period june september these kinds of distribution patterns are very likely to affect the isotopic characteristics of rain at these two regions since the wd and swm derived precipitation possess different isotopic signatures with different annual precipitation amounts jeelani et al 2017 2018 for instance jeelani et al 2017 highlighted that srinagar meteorological station in kashmir valley received a significant amount of precipitation 71 485 mm during wd periods october to may and 29 196 mm during the swm season over a period from 1901 to 2014 further they concluded that wd derived precipitation october may is depleted in 18o and 2h than the swm precipitation june september the local environmental factors such as temperature surface pressure and relative humidity also reveal a distinct variability during these two periods jeelani et al 2017 using the above temporal variability in the isotopic composition of precipitation as constrained by jeelani et al 2017 we have divided our observation period into the wd period october may dominated by westerlies and the monsoon season june september influenced by the swm circulation however it is to be noted here that the transition periods between these two seasons are not distinct especially early june often experiences wd events 3 data and methods daily precipitation samples n 174 were collected using a 2 l plastic bottle from bandipora region of kashmir valley see fig 1c 34 0 27 n 74 0 59 e 1590 m amsl from july 2016 to june 2018 the time of collection was 08 30 h 03 00 utc rainwater collection setup was installed in an open place at the height of about 5 m above the ground the precipitation samples were typically collected as rain except in winter months when the samples were collected as fresh snow the tip of the funnel was attached to a plastic tube whose other end touched the collection bottle to prevent evaporative loss of the collected rainwater additionally a light weight plastic ball was kept inside the funnel to reduce the overhead evaporative loss fresh snow samples were collected following the iaea gnip guidelines wu et al 2014 the snow samples were collected using a 20 mm 20 mm flat metal surface at the end of the snowfall event the snow was packed and sealed into the 30 ml hdpe sampling bottles and allowed to melt indoor the rain amount was measured and converted in rain rate mm day using a calibration formula following the iaea gnip precipitation sampling guide http www naweb iaea org napc ih documents other gnip manual v2 02 en hq pdf required amounts 30 ml from daily representative rainwater samples were transferred into polyethylene bottles 30 ml tightly capped wrapped with parafilm samples were analyzed for stable isotopes 18o 16o and 2h 1h at the stable isotope laboratory of the indian institute of tropical meteorology iitm pune by a liquid water isotope analyser model tiwa 45 ep of the los gatos research usa results are reported in the δ notation against the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow and expressed in per mil notation the precision of the measurements was monitored by using an internal laboratory water standard the analytical uncertainty of isotope analyses 1σ based on a long term analysis of the internal laboratory standard was 0 7 0 1 and 0 75 for δ2h δ18o and d excess respectively the corresponding meteorological parameters such as rh and temperature t were obtained from the imd daily weather charts www imdpune gov in weather weatherrealised html sea level pressure was converted to the surface pressure at the station height of 1590 m using a scale parameter of 8 0 km it may be noted that the movement of the troughs and ridges from the mediterranean towards the indian himalayan region on a typical rainy day or a few days before the rainy day is generally considered as the appearance of a wd event towards this the all india daily weather reports aidwr of the imd were consulted to identify the location and movement of the monsoon trough and western disturbances additionally the reanalysis product of t and rh were obtained from the era interim era 5 https apps ecmwf int over an area of 0 25 0 25 around the sampling site these data available for every six hours were averaged to represent the daily variation further reconstruction of backward trajectories of the moisture sources arriving at the sampling station was done using the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit model stein et al 2015 to estimate the trajectory release point we have calculated the vertical profiles of moisture using the era 5 data over the study region the altitudinal space that was characterized by maximum humidity was considered as the trajectory release point however this method yielded some high humidity values at levels close to the sea level while the sample site is located at a level of 1590 m fig s1 upper panel diagram shows the vertical positions where humidity was maximum for the entire study period the horizontal line represents the sampling height above sea level the points appearing below this line are not viable this may arise due to the limitation of the model which may not always produce realistic data in a complex topographic environment one of the characteristics of this diagram is that most of the maximum humidity values occur between a vertical window of 2000 4000 m so we take a mean height of 3000 m above sea level approx 1400 m above the ground level as the trajectory release point nevertheless maximum moisture based dynamic heights have also been used to calculate the back trajectories to compare their pattern with that calculated based on fixed height criterion an ensemble of back trajectory has been shown in fig s1 a d which shows a very similar pattern with the trajectories calculated based on fixed height criterion as illustrated in fig 2 also according to the imd reports the presence of the cyclonic circulations associated with the wd events most of the time occurs at this height ca 3 km from the sea level hence we proceed further with the fixed height based trajectory calculation the duration of the moisture transport was considered as 240 h based on the moisture residence time of 8 10 days stein et al 2015 van der ent and tuinenburg 2017 wang et al 2018 4 results 4 1 trajectory analysis fig 2 shows the backward trajectories calculated for the wd period left panel and the monsoon season right panel respectively it is evident from this figure that the moisture pathways had a wide spatial variability for the monsoon season a large amount of moisture was derived from the arabian sea but the number of trajectories that originated from the bay of bengal is small implying that a relatively small amount of moisture was sourced from the bay of bengal on the other hand a few trajectories had their origin in the mediterranean even during the monsoon season two such trajectories were originated in early june 10th and 11th in 2017 according to the imd daily weather report the wd as an upper air circulation at 3 1 km amsl was existing over north pakistan and the adjoining area of jammu and kashmir similarly the second week of june 2018 also experienced the presence of a wd event that existed as an upper air cyclonic circulation over the study area extending between 5 8 and 7 6 km as a result a trajectory calculated for 11th june 2018 was found to have originated in the mediterranean region the kashmir valley experiences strong monsoon winds mostly during the months of august september while passing through the high mountain pir panjal peaks additionally a large amount of terrestrial moisture is also generated from the neighbourhood during the wd period the dominant moisture sources are from the west and north west passing over the mediterranean the black sea and the caspian sea these air masses are responsible for precipitation in the western himalayan region during the winter season the rain derived from the westerly winds has distinct isotopic signatures 4 2 isotopic records of precipitation fig 3 a b shows the temporal variability of precipitation amount and the corresponding δ18o of the bandipora sampling site the δ18o values range from 22 06 to 8 24 with an average value of 3 31 for the entire observation period the mean δ18o values for the wd period grey shading and the swm period are 4 47 5 97 and 1 35 5 28 respectively the isotopic values are lower during the wd period compared to the swm season to investigate the isotopic characteristics at temporal scale the observation period was broadly divided into the sw monsoon 1 jul 2016 to 1 sep 2016 12 jun 2017 to 15 sep 2017 and 15 jun 2018 to 30 jun 2018 and wd period 21 oct 2016 to 10 jun 2017 and 15 nov 2017 to 20 may 2018 based on the synoptic properties as described in the imd daily weather reports as mentioned in the data and method section the d excess fig 3c variability was somewhat inversely related to the δ18o profile the temperature fig 3d shows more or less out of phase characteristics with that of the rh the rh fig 3e was nearly the same for both periods in this context it may be noted that precipitation δ18o occasionally shows high positive values which may seem unusual for such a region however the high values were generated mainly due to the evaporation of raindrops careful observation shows that most of the high δ18o 5 values occurred in the early summer may and june and were associated with low precipitation 0 4 to 6 mm day events such kind of high positive values were also observed by jeelani et al 2018 in their srinagar sampling site more discussion in this regard is presented later 4 3 δ18o and the meteorological variables table 1 summarizes the correlation values between δ18o and the meteorological variables separately for the wd and the swm season precipitation δ18o exhibited a weak inverse correlation with the precipitation amount however it shows a significant positive correlation with temperature and a significant negative correlation with surface pressure fig 3b and f show the daily variation of surface pressure and δ18o values at the bandipora sampling station during the observation period some high precipitation events 29 50 mm day were also recorded at the sampling station for example in the first week of april 2017 5th 6th and 7th day higher precipitation amounts 32 4 50 and 32 8 mm respectively were observed fig 3a corresponding with lower surface pressure values fig 3f an examination of the daily imd weather reports for this period suggests the formation of a western depression over the punjab and the adjoining areas of north rajasthan and haryana coupled with low sea level pressure i e slp of 1002 1000 and 1008 hpa on april 5th 6th and 7th respectively it is to be mentioned that the slp values have been reduced to surface pressure values corresponding to the sampling site altitude of 1590 m subsequently higher precipitation amounts 40 29 1 and 50 6 mm with low slp values were also recorded on august 3rd december 12th 2017 and april 21st 2018 respectively further we observed 18o enrichment in our precipitation samples which is consistent with its inverse relationship with the surface pressure but not in conformity with the supposedly anti correlation with precipitation hence the analysis of the δ18o surface pressure and δ18o precipitation relationship implies that surface pressure in this region might be playing a significant role in controlling the precipitation isotopic composition while the precipitation amount has an insignificant role 5 discussion 5 1 local meteoric water line lmwl we have calculated lmwl for the entire observation period fig 4 a as well as separately for the wd and sw monsoon season fig 4b the ordinary least square osl method has been used additionally the precipitation weighted ordinary least square pw ols generated lines crawford et al 2014 are also shown in the following table period description slope σ slope intercept σ intercept n r2 p overall ols 7 18 0 09 10 39 0 65 174 0 97 0 01 pw ols 7 47 0 09 13 33 0 60 swm ols 7 62 0 15 7 45 0 79 65 0 97 0 01 pw ols 7 65 0 13 9 36 0 78 wd ols 7 16 0 11 12 41 0 86 109 0 97 0 01 pw ols 7 60 0 11 15 89 0 79 the slope 7 18 or 7 47pw is slightly less than that of the gmwl slope 8 but the intercept 10 39 is statistically the same somewhat higher if the weighted value is considered with that of the gmwl value 10 fig 4a the lmwl for the swm period jjas has a slope of 7 62 7 65pw and an intercept of 7 45 9 36pw whereas the wd period oct may exhibits a slope of 7 16 7 60pw and intercept of 12 41 15 89pw fig 4b the lmwl slope in the case of the monsoon season shows practically the same values with or without weighting by the precipitation amount which slightly differs in the case of the wd season this means that the low amount of precipitation during the months of apr may to some extent affects the slope of the lmwl during the wd period which is also manifested in the isotopic profile that occasionally revealed high δ18o values as described earlier a slope lower than 8 slope of gmwl typically indicates the presence of kinetic fractionation driven by raindrop evaporation below the sub cloud layer this characteristic behavior also manifests in the form of an inverse correlation between δ18o and d excess gat 1996 chakraborty et al 2018 scatter diagrams were plotted between δ18o and d excess separately for the swm and wd season fig s3 a reasonably strong correlation r2 0 32 n 109 p 0 01 was found for the wd period indicating a significant amount of raindrop evaporation however the correlation was statistically insignificant r2 0 09 n 65 p 0 1 for the sw monsoon season implying a negligible amount of raindrop evaporation had taken place during this period 5 2 δ18o and d excess anomaly the δ18oversus d excess relationship for the wd period is much steeper slope 0 83 compared to the swm period slope 0 37 table 1 from this observation it may be qualitatively said that the wd derived raindrops underwent evaporation more than twice than the swm derived rain however raindrop evaporation leads to enrichment in stable isotopes resulting in higher δ18o and lower d excess further as mentioned earlier the average δ18o values for the wd period is 4 67 against 1 35 for the swm period so instead of being enriched in isotopic values the wd derived rains get depleted by about 3 32 relative to the swm derived rain the rainout process can only explain this discrepancy since the moisture is sourced far in the mediterranean region the wd rain events suffer from the continental effect resulting in substantial isotopic depletion due to the rainout processes considering the empirical longitudinal effect of 0 002 km criss 1999 it may be estimated that the wd derived moisture must have travelled a minimum distance of 1660 km 3 32 1 0 002 km to get depleted by 3 32 this makes sense as the eastern edge of the mediterranean sea is approximately 2880 km west of our sampling site backward trajectory ensembles reveal that precipitation isotope composition over the sampling site is governed by the interplay of marine moisture transported by the sw summer monsoon during jjas and westerly wind driven moisture generated over the mediterranean sea during winter months this points towards the fact that precipitation isotope records from the kashmir valley can capture signals of the variability in moisture sources governed by dual transport pathways to constrain this we present here the d excess anomaly since it is a good proxy for characterizing the atmospheric moisture sources aemisegger et al 2014 the anomaly has been calculated by subtracting the mean value from the individual values and then normalized by its standard deviation the anomalies are characterized by positive values during the wd winter season fig s4 while the negative anomalies are typically associated with the swm as the moistures were produced at relatively higher rh over the oceans positive values suggest that vapours were generated under relatively low rh conditions a total of 40 precipitation samples 23 of the total samples analyzed were observed to have d excess values 20 it is known that precipitation in the eastern mediterranean is generally characterized by high d excess 20 gat and carmi 1970 araguás araguás et al 2000 gat et al 2003 hence the observed higher d excess values particularly during the wd period fig s5a are thus attributed to the moisture generated over the eastern mediterranean sea the effect of wds on d excess even during the monsoon season could also be assessed from the synoptic weather chart of the imd as mentioned earlier on 10 jan 2017 the wd activity was detected as an upper air circulation at 3 1 km asl prevailing over the adjoining region of jammu kashmir with monsoon axis at 5 8 km asl close to our sampling region this confirms that brief episodic increase of high d excess values fig s5b during the sw monsoon period was also controlled by the prevalence of the westerly moisture sources 6 synoptic controls on precipitation isotopes to investigate the effect of meteorological parameters on the precipitation isotopes we performed correlation analyses among the following parameters for the full observation period and separately for the wd and the swm periods precipitation p δ18o temperature t δ18o relative humidity rh δ18o surface pressure sp δ18o and surface pressure sp precipitation p a weak negative correlation was observed between the precipitation δ18o and precipitation amount for all the periods table 1 this does not conform to the observation of jeelani et al 2017 who found a good correlation between these two parameters on a monthly time scale indicating different controlling mechanisms operating on precipitation isotopes on monthly and daily time scales a statistically significant positive correlation r2 0 61 p 0 01 was observed between t δ18o during the wd period however when the relationship is examined only for the monsoon season the r2 value nearly vanishes it is known that isotopic fractionation is temperature dependent but this dependency gets subdued by the amount effect in the tropics dansgaard 1964 the t δ18o relation holds good in the mid and high latitude regions for which the temperature dependency has been estimated as 0 69 c 1 criss 1991 such kind of correlation has also been observed in the southern tibetan plateau gao et al 2013 our estimation of 0 8 c 1 agrees reasonably well with those estimates hence the presence absence of strong t δ18o relation during the wd monsoon period provides an excellent tool to decipher the past wd monsoon events from suitable proxy records such as the tree rings for example bose et al 2016 demonstrated that the oxygen isotopic records of tree rings from the western himalayan region could be used to reconstruct the past isotopic composition of soil water if the individual tree rings can be sampled and analyzed at the seasonal resolution then it may be possible to decipher the past wd signatures in their isotopic values among other parameters the rh seems to have strong control over the precipitation δ18o both for the wd and monsoon period strong inverse correlation r2 0 40 p 0 01 was found between rh and δ18o though the correlation is statistically insignificant r2 0 17 for the monsoon season this observation also indicates that the precipitation derived from the wd events better respond to humidity than the monsoon rain additionally a reasonably strong negative correlation r2 0 43 p 0 01 was found between the sp and δ18o for the wd period the same relation also holds good for the monsoon season albeit in a weaker form r2 0 11 precipitation δ18o usually does not show any dependency on the surface pressure to our knowledge such kind of behavior has not been reported however precipitation isotope does show altitude dependency garzione et al 2000 with this consideration a negative correlation observed between δ18o and the surface pressure at our study area which has an altitude of 1590 m seems to be logical additionally the connection between δ18o and sp may arise due to the interplay between pressure and height this aspect will be examined later as per our observation the wd derived precipitation δ18o is strongly correlated with t rh and sp which is not significant in the case of the sw monsoon derived precipitation it is noteworthy that on site meteorological parameters such as t rh and sp have a minimal influence on the precipitation δ18o during the swm period such variability in controlling the precipitation isotope composition during the swm period is likely to arise due to other parameters and or large scale atmospheric conditions kurita 2013 one such role could be attributed to the large scale regional convection dominant during monsoon season governing changes in the precipitation isotopes recent studies on precipitation isotopes indicate that regional convection is the primary driver of precipitation isotopes in the tropics and sub tropics vimeux et al 2011 moerman et al 2013 benetti et al 2014 lekshmy et al 2014 he et al 2018a b for example large scale variations up to 20 in the stable isotopic compositions of daily precipitation have been observed in the tropics resulting from regional convection activities moerman et al 2013 he et al 2015 permana et al 2016 model studies have also demonstrated that variations in precipitation isotopes over the tropical sub tropical regions during monsoon seasons are ubiquitous features governed by regional convective systems kurita 2013 and references therein tremoy et al 2014 recently ansari et al 2020 reported that large scale convective activities dominantly controlled the isotopic signature of monsoon jjas precipitation from eastern india while the local meteorological variables played a minor role simultaneous investigation of long term isotopic compositions in vapour daily precipitation and measurements of regional atmospheric conditions particularly during the swm period would provide invaluable information to evaluate the role of large scale atmospheric conditions in controlling the precipitation isotope composition however investigating the role of such regional atmospheric conditions on swm derived precipitation δ18o variability is beyond the scope of this study and will be addressed in our future studies 6 1 multiple regression analysis between precipitation isotopes and the meteorological variables we have performed multiple regression analysis whereby the precipitation δ18o was regressed with t rh and sp separately for the monsoon season and the wd period the precipitation has not been considered in this exercise since the isotopic values maintain a poor correlation with precipitation as shown in table 1 both t rh and sp were significantly correlated with precipitation δ18o for the wd events while the relationship was not significant in the case of the monsoon precipitation the same is true for the multiple regression cases as shown below 2 δ 18 o wd 0 65 0 07 t 0 104 0 05 r h 0 0024 0 005 s p r 2 0 87 n 109 p 0 001 3 δ 18 o monsoon 0 226 0 221 t 0 202 0 067 r h 0 011 0 010 s p r 2 0 29 n 58 p 0 001 fig 5 shows the scatter diagram between the observed δ18o and the predicted δ18o for the wd season and the swm season respectively a linear fit yields a correlation coefficient of r2 0 87 for the wd season and 0 29 for the monsoon season a strong correlation in the case of the wd period reveals that precipitation isotopes during the wd events behave very differently than the monsoon season for example the above equations show that the temperature coefficient of precipitation δ18o during the wd period is 2 times to that of the monsoon season however a linear model explaining the variability of δ18o may overestimate or underestimate the effect of the predictor variable if the variables are correlated to each other duy et al 2018 konecky et al 2019 hence it is essential to remove the inter dependency between t rh and surface pressure towards this we carried out the partial correlation and principal component analyses to examine the interlinking effects between different variables the details have been presented in the supplementary section both the analyses demonstrate that the temperature and rh play a significant role while the surface pressure has a minor role in determining the precipitation isotopic composition further the results of the partial correlation analysis revealed that t rh and the sp explain only about a quarter of the variability observed in precipitation δ18o hence the variability of about 87 as explained by the linear regression model seems to be an overestimation that arises due to the inter dependency of the meteorological parameters thus to get a realistic estimate the inter dependency effect must be removed using suitable statistical analysis such as partial correlation analysis and or principal component analysis additional atmospheric parameters processes such as moisture generated through evapotranspiration must be considered in order to explain the unexplained variability 6 2 potential applications the above mentioned characteristics of the wd derived precipitation may have some potential applications for example a strong dependency of the wd derived precipitation isotopes with the basic meteorological parameters gives it a unique property that may be useful to study the synoptic scale systems involving the moisture dynamical processes for example re analysis based atmospheric data are widely used to explore a variety of processes but such kind of data may contain large uncertainty especially for a region which is characterized by complex topography and insufficient observational data such as the western himalaya it appears to have a significant error in its t and rh estimates we have used t re analysed data of the era interim see the methods section and calculated the correlation coefficients with the precipitation δ18o fig s6 shows the results for both the parameters the correlation coefficients are significantly better in the case of the observed data vs δ18o compared to the era interim derived parameters several investigators confirmed that the precipitation isotopes are intricately related to the moisture fluxes moore et al 2014 chakraborty et al 2016 dar and ghosh 2017 midhun et al 2018 sinha et al 2019 hence if water isotopic data i e both rainwater and ground level vapor are made available on a regional basis from the western himalayan region it may be possible to derive better information about the moisture dynamical processes and in turn to better constrain the re analysed data additionally it may be potentially useful to the operational meteorologists involved in synoptic observations using this technique fingerprinting the wd precipitation that extends from the western himalaya to northeast india may also be possible another likely application is to investigate the role of wd derived precipitation isotope signatures in the north eastern region of india it is believed that a significant amount of moisture is transported from the western himalaya to some parts of ne india dimri and mohanty 2009 but direct evidence of this is still lacking ne india has become highly vulnerable in terms of its moisture resources a recent study by choudhury et al 2019 highlights that this region has experienced a steep decline in precipitation during the last 5 6 decades these authors also estimated local moisture contribution which corresponds to only 7 of the total moisture supply in this context it is essential to identify the role and subsequent importance of wd derived moisture in this region using the methodology discussed in this study for a better understanding of the regional hydrological budget it may also find an application in paleomonsoon research for example ghosh et al 2017 demonstrated that freshwater mollusc if characterized by high growth rate is potentially useful in delineating the active and break phases of precipitation within a given season if such kinds of archives are available in the kashmir valley it is in principle possible to record the isotopic signatures of the precipitation derived by the wd and the monsoon system of the past hence the isotopic analysis of those archives could provide valuable records to characterize the past precipitation data as demonstrated in this study 7 conclusions isotopic analysis of daily precipitation collected from the kashmir valley reveals the presence of two distinct moisture sources in this region the marine vapor is mainly derived from the arabian sea and appears during the late summer the maximum intrusion takes place during late august and early september on the other hand wds bring moisture from the mediterranean region mainly from october to early june precipitation isotopes show a significant correlation with t rh and the sp the extent of correlation is strong for the wd season but weak for the monsoon season this characteristic feature of the wd derived precipitation may have the potential to provide better information about moisture dynamics than that offered by the re analysed data for the western himalayan region multiple linear regression involving meteorological variables reveals strong correlation especially for the wd season however a high value of correlation is likely to be arising due to the inter dependency of the predictor variables this effect has been removed employing partial correlation analysis by decoupling this effect individual contributions of the parameters on the precipitation δ18o have been quantified it has been shown that t rh and sp could explain only about 7 14 and 2 of the observed δ18o variability for the wd period respectively the quantification process for the monsoon season reveals that they are negligibly small the study highlights that a simple correlation analysis between the precipitation isotopes and multiple meteorological parameters may overestimate the correlation values the analytical artifact arises due to the interdependency of the meteorological parameters hence the effect must be removed

5363,the kashmir valley represents a critical region for understanding isotopic changes in the atmospheric moisture sources since it is located at the intercept between the influences of mid latitude westerlies and the southwest monsoon circulation this study presents the variation in isotopic composition δ18o and δ2h of daily precipitation samples collected from the kashmir valley north western himalaya to quantify the effect of meteorological parameters separately for the southwest monsoon swm season and the periods of western disturbances wds the results suggest that precipitation isotopic composition is strongly modulated by temperature and relative humidity during the periods of wds still this dependency is weak in the case of the swm season moisture transport pathways calculated from hysplit back trajectory analysis shows a wide spatial variability during the monsoon season on the other hand the origin of moisture during the wd season was mostly restricted from the mediterranean region providing an explanation of a strong dependency between the precipitation isotopes and the meteorological parameters during the wd period such kind of relation may provide additional diagnostic for the wd events and may help in paleo monsoon investigations keywords precipitation isotope monsoon western disturbances kashmir valley 1 introduction investigating the control of atmospheric variables on the stable isotope composition in daily precipitation is essential for better understanding of the regional hydrological cycle ait brahim et al 2016 dar and ghosh 2017 midhun et al 2018 bajaj et al 2019 garaga et al 2019 lekshmy et al 2019 ansari et al 2020 earlier studies have demonstrated the significance of isotope fractionation processes in precipitation on spatio temporal scales as a fingerprint to record the moisture transport pathways and other processes xie et al 2011 yu et al 2014 2015 midhun et al 2018 sinha et al 2019 sinha and chakraborty 2019 this is because both hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions denoted as δ2h and δ18o respectively in precipitation undergo spatio temporal variability that depends on various meteorological parameters and processes such as vapor source the degree of moisture recycling relative humidity rh temperature and circulation tian et al 2007 the regional climate of the himalayas is dominated by two distinct moisture transport pathways western disturbances wds and the south west monsoon swm wds are a type of eastward moving extra tropical cyclonic weather systems affecting the northern indian climate and contributes significantly to the northern indian winter october may precipitation dimri and mohanty 2009 cannon et al 2014 these upper air troughs or cyclonic circulations in mid latitudes pickup moisture from the mediterranean black sea and the caspian sea and thus strongly influence the precipitation over the himalayas especially the core westerly zone of the kashmir valley dimri and mohanty 2009 the wds deliver a large amount of precipitation 40 45 of annual average to the western himalayas and thus have a significant influence on the socio economic activities in this monsoon shadow region providing water resources to himalayan rivers and high altitude glaciers madhura et al 2014 in the context of kashmir valley a plethora of work has been carried out by several authors regarding the isotopic composition of monthly and seasonal scale precipitation sources jeelani et al 2013 2015 jeelani et al 2017 2018 jeelani and deshpande 2017 these studies have highlighted the monthly and seasonal variability in precipitation isotopes and identified the control of dual moisture sources associated with wds and swm derived precipitation however being the monthly composites these studies were not capable of resolving the short term processes that are related to individual rain events corresponding to the wd and swm moisture sources so far there is only a single study by jeelani et al 2018 highlighting the variability in stable isotopes using daily precipitation datasets however this study mainly focused on assessing the spatial variability of stable isotopes in rainwater from the southern foothills of the himalayas srinagar jammu kashmir in western india to dibrugarh assam in northeast india furthermore meteorological parameters such as temperature relative humidity surface pressure are known to be essential factors and significantly affect the himalayan atmospheric moisture budget tiwari et al 2016 for instance it is qualitatively known that the isotopic values of precipitation driven by dual moisture pathways swm and wd events respond differently to the meteorological parameters such as precipitation temperature relative humidity but no effort has so far been made to quantify their role the indian subcontinent is characterized by its large spatial expanse and heterogeneity in weather systems that give rise to a variety of climatic regimes dimri and chevuturi 2016 this variability and pattern of monsoonal rains summer and winter have a significant impact on regional livelihoods perennial rivers glaciers and of particular importance to countries like india as the agricultural and economic activities of the country highly depend on the seasonal precipitation both wd and swm moreover the flow of himalayan rivers and the seasonal glacial ice cover primarily rely on the amount and duration of the wd and swm derived precipitation the snow melt and the perennial rivers provide freshwater resources to a significant portion of the asian population living in the downstream areas bershaw et al 2012 hence any changes in the strength and behavior of these two precipitation drivers may have severe consequences on the regional socio economic and agricultural activities particularly during periods of droughts and floods dimri et al 2015 in this study we have measured the isotopic composition of daily precipitation from kashmir valley north western himalaya to better quantify the relationship between the precipitation isotopes and some of the essential meteorological variables such as temperature rh and the surface pressure since the region is influenced by the dual moisture transport pathways studying the feedback processes between precipitation isotopes and meteorological parameters would be crucial for a better understanding of the regional hydrology the shortage of daily precipitation δ18o isotope time series measurements from this region also makes it difficult to assess the accuracy of results derived from precipitation isotope based model simulation studies the high temporal resolution of daily precipitation isotope data from this study will help to constrain the dynamical controls on precipitation isotope δ18o variability in this region further this will also prove useful to operational meteorologists to observe the synoptic scale processes hence the primary objective of this study is to establish quantitative relation between the precipitation isotopes and the basic weather parameters for both the wd and swm further we discuss how these relationships may help in studying the present and past climatic processes 2 study area 2 1 modern climate setting the himalayan region is characterized by a highly variable climate and day to day weather changes significantly even over short distances these changes are governed by local factors such as topography and large scale processes like extra tropical disturbances the kashmir valley enjoys mediterranean to a sub mediterranean type of temperate climate characterized by four well marked seasons viz spring summer autumn and winter bagnolus and meher homji 1959 although the sway of swm into the kashmir valley is still enigmatic due to the upliftment of pir panjal ranges however it is believed that a significant amount of arabian sea and bay of bengal borne sw monsoon winds enter the kashmir valley through the mountainous passes jeelani et al 2017 jeelani and deshpande 2017 it has been noted that the precipitation exhibits a very distinct distribution pattern compared to the regions that are heavily influenced by the swm jeelani et al 2017 2018 the climatological variation of monthly precipitation and temperature are shown in fig 1 a in this region the temperature attains its annual maximum value during the months of july and august whereas over the rest of india the maximum temperature is reached in may to illustrate the effect of the pir panjal mountain range that restricts the entry of swm generated moisture into the kashmir valley we have compared the climatological precipitation distributions of srinagar meteorological station mostly affected by wds and jammu meteorological station affected mainly by swm fig 1b illustrates this comparison the partial blocking of the swm winds by the pir panjal ranges and the northern extent of the inter tropical convergence zone itcz governs the moisture transport that finally precipitate in these two regions the jammu area receives dominant precipitation from swm sources and less precipitation from the wds however the kashmir valley is dominated by precipitation brought by the wds during october may and receives relatively reduced precipitation during the swm period june september these kinds of distribution patterns are very likely to affect the isotopic characteristics of rain at these two regions since the wd and swm derived precipitation possess different isotopic signatures with different annual precipitation amounts jeelani et al 2017 2018 for instance jeelani et al 2017 highlighted that srinagar meteorological station in kashmir valley received a significant amount of precipitation 71 485 mm during wd periods october to may and 29 196 mm during the swm season over a period from 1901 to 2014 further they concluded that wd derived precipitation october may is depleted in 18o and 2h than the swm precipitation june september the local environmental factors such as temperature surface pressure and relative humidity also reveal a distinct variability during these two periods jeelani et al 2017 using the above temporal variability in the isotopic composition of precipitation as constrained by jeelani et al 2017 we have divided our observation period into the wd period october may dominated by westerlies and the monsoon season june september influenced by the swm circulation however it is to be noted here that the transition periods between these two seasons are not distinct especially early june often experiences wd events 3 data and methods daily precipitation samples n 174 were collected using a 2 l plastic bottle from bandipora region of kashmir valley see fig 1c 34 0 27 n 74 0 59 e 1590 m amsl from july 2016 to june 2018 the time of collection was 08 30 h 03 00 utc rainwater collection setup was installed in an open place at the height of about 5 m above the ground the precipitation samples were typically collected as rain except in winter months when the samples were collected as fresh snow the tip of the funnel was attached to a plastic tube whose other end touched the collection bottle to prevent evaporative loss of the collected rainwater additionally a light weight plastic ball was kept inside the funnel to reduce the overhead evaporative loss fresh snow samples were collected following the iaea gnip guidelines wu et al 2014 the snow samples were collected using a 20 mm 20 mm flat metal surface at the end of the snowfall event the snow was packed and sealed into the 30 ml hdpe sampling bottles and allowed to melt indoor the rain amount was measured and converted in rain rate mm day using a calibration formula following the iaea gnip precipitation sampling guide http www naweb iaea org napc ih documents other gnip manual v2 02 en hq pdf required amounts 30 ml from daily representative rainwater samples were transferred into polyethylene bottles 30 ml tightly capped wrapped with parafilm samples were analyzed for stable isotopes 18o 16o and 2h 1h at the stable isotope laboratory of the indian institute of tropical meteorology iitm pune by a liquid water isotope analyser model tiwa 45 ep of the los gatos research usa results are reported in the δ notation against the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow and expressed in per mil notation the precision of the measurements was monitored by using an internal laboratory water standard the analytical uncertainty of isotope analyses 1σ based on a long term analysis of the internal laboratory standard was 0 7 0 1 and 0 75 for δ2h δ18o and d excess respectively the corresponding meteorological parameters such as rh and temperature t were obtained from the imd daily weather charts www imdpune gov in weather weatherrealised html sea level pressure was converted to the surface pressure at the station height of 1590 m using a scale parameter of 8 0 km it may be noted that the movement of the troughs and ridges from the mediterranean towards the indian himalayan region on a typical rainy day or a few days before the rainy day is generally considered as the appearance of a wd event towards this the all india daily weather reports aidwr of the imd were consulted to identify the location and movement of the monsoon trough and western disturbances additionally the reanalysis product of t and rh were obtained from the era interim era 5 https apps ecmwf int over an area of 0 25 0 25 around the sampling site these data available for every six hours were averaged to represent the daily variation further reconstruction of backward trajectories of the moisture sources arriving at the sampling station was done using the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit model stein et al 2015 to estimate the trajectory release point we have calculated the vertical profiles of moisture using the era 5 data over the study region the altitudinal space that was characterized by maximum humidity was considered as the trajectory release point however this method yielded some high humidity values at levels close to the sea level while the sample site is located at a level of 1590 m fig s1 upper panel diagram shows the vertical positions where humidity was maximum for the entire study period the horizontal line represents the sampling height above sea level the points appearing below this line are not viable this may arise due to the limitation of the model which may not always produce realistic data in a complex topographic environment one of the characteristics of this diagram is that most of the maximum humidity values occur between a vertical window of 2000 4000 m so we take a mean height of 3000 m above sea level approx 1400 m above the ground level as the trajectory release point nevertheless maximum moisture based dynamic heights have also been used to calculate the back trajectories to compare their pattern with that calculated based on fixed height criterion an ensemble of back trajectory has been shown in fig s1 a d which shows a very similar pattern with the trajectories calculated based on fixed height criterion as illustrated in fig 2 also according to the imd reports the presence of the cyclonic circulations associated with the wd events most of the time occurs at this height ca 3 km from the sea level hence we proceed further with the fixed height based trajectory calculation the duration of the moisture transport was considered as 240 h based on the moisture residence time of 8 10 days stein et al 2015 van der ent and tuinenburg 2017 wang et al 2018 4 results 4 1 trajectory analysis fig 2 shows the backward trajectories calculated for the wd period left panel and the monsoon season right panel respectively it is evident from this figure that the moisture pathways had a wide spatial variability for the monsoon season a large amount of moisture was derived from the arabian sea but the number of trajectories that originated from the bay of bengal is small implying that a relatively small amount of moisture was sourced from the bay of bengal on the other hand a few trajectories had their origin in the mediterranean even during the monsoon season two such trajectories were originated in early june 10th and 11th in 2017 according to the imd daily weather report the wd as an upper air circulation at 3 1 km amsl was existing over north pakistan and the adjoining area of jammu and kashmir similarly the second week of june 2018 also experienced the presence of a wd event that existed as an upper air cyclonic circulation over the study area extending between 5 8 and 7 6 km as a result a trajectory calculated for 11th june 2018 was found to have originated in the mediterranean region the kashmir valley experiences strong monsoon winds mostly during the months of august september while passing through the high mountain pir panjal peaks additionally a large amount of terrestrial moisture is also generated from the neighbourhood during the wd period the dominant moisture sources are from the west and north west passing over the mediterranean the black sea and the caspian sea these air masses are responsible for precipitation in the western himalayan region during the winter season the rain derived from the westerly winds has distinct isotopic signatures 4 2 isotopic records of precipitation fig 3 a b shows the temporal variability of precipitation amount and the corresponding δ18o of the bandipora sampling site the δ18o values range from 22 06 to 8 24 with an average value of 3 31 for the entire observation period the mean δ18o values for the wd period grey shading and the swm period are 4 47 5 97 and 1 35 5 28 respectively the isotopic values are lower during the wd period compared to the swm season to investigate the isotopic characteristics at temporal scale the observation period was broadly divided into the sw monsoon 1 jul 2016 to 1 sep 2016 12 jun 2017 to 15 sep 2017 and 15 jun 2018 to 30 jun 2018 and wd period 21 oct 2016 to 10 jun 2017 and 15 nov 2017 to 20 may 2018 based on the synoptic properties as described in the imd daily weather reports as mentioned in the data and method section the d excess fig 3c variability was somewhat inversely related to the δ18o profile the temperature fig 3d shows more or less out of phase characteristics with that of the rh the rh fig 3e was nearly the same for both periods in this context it may be noted that precipitation δ18o occasionally shows high positive values which may seem unusual for such a region however the high values were generated mainly due to the evaporation of raindrops careful observation shows that most of the high δ18o 5 values occurred in the early summer may and june and were associated with low precipitation 0 4 to 6 mm day events such kind of high positive values were also observed by jeelani et al 2018 in their srinagar sampling site more discussion in this regard is presented later 4 3 δ18o and the meteorological variables table 1 summarizes the correlation values between δ18o and the meteorological variables separately for the wd and the swm season precipitation δ18o exhibited a weak inverse correlation with the precipitation amount however it shows a significant positive correlation with temperature and a significant negative correlation with surface pressure fig 3b and f show the daily variation of surface pressure and δ18o values at the bandipora sampling station during the observation period some high precipitation events 29 50 mm day were also recorded at the sampling station for example in the first week of april 2017 5th 6th and 7th day higher precipitation amounts 32 4 50 and 32 8 mm respectively were observed fig 3a corresponding with lower surface pressure values fig 3f an examination of the daily imd weather reports for this period suggests the formation of a western depression over the punjab and the adjoining areas of north rajasthan and haryana coupled with low sea level pressure i e slp of 1002 1000 and 1008 hpa on april 5th 6th and 7th respectively it is to be mentioned that the slp values have been reduced to surface pressure values corresponding to the sampling site altitude of 1590 m subsequently higher precipitation amounts 40 29 1 and 50 6 mm with low slp values were also recorded on august 3rd december 12th 2017 and april 21st 2018 respectively further we observed 18o enrichment in our precipitation samples which is consistent with its inverse relationship with the surface pressure but not in conformity with the supposedly anti correlation with precipitation hence the analysis of the δ18o surface pressure and δ18o precipitation relationship implies that surface pressure in this region might be playing a significant role in controlling the precipitation isotopic composition while the precipitation amount has an insignificant role 5 discussion 5 1 local meteoric water line lmwl we have calculated lmwl for the entire observation period fig 4 a as well as separately for the wd and sw monsoon season fig 4b the ordinary least square osl method has been used additionally the precipitation weighted ordinary least square pw ols generated lines crawford et al 2014 are also shown in the following table period description slope σ slope intercept σ intercept n r2 p overall ols 7 18 0 09 10 39 0 65 174 0 97 0 01 pw ols 7 47 0 09 13 33 0 60 swm ols 7 62 0 15 7 45 0 79 65 0 97 0 01 pw ols 7 65 0 13 9 36 0 78 wd ols 7 16 0 11 12 41 0 86 109 0 97 0

considered with that of the gmwl value 10 fig 4a the lmwl for the swm period jjas has a slope of 7 62 7 65pw and an intercept of 7 45 9 36pw whereas the wd period oct may exhibits a slope of 7 16 7 60pw and intercept of 12 41 15 89pw fig 4b the lmwl slope in the case of the monsoon season shows practically the same values with or without weighting by the precipitation amount which slightly differs in the case of the wd season this means that the low amount of precipitation during the months of apr may to some extent affects the slope of the lmwl during the wd period which is also manifested in the isotopic profile that occasionally revealed high δ18o values as described earlier a slope lower than 8 slope of gmwl typically indicates the presence of kinetic fractionation driven by raindrop evaporation below the sub cloud layer this characteristic behavior also manifests in the form of an inverse correlation between δ18o and d excess gat 1996 chakraborty et al 2018 scatter diagrams were plotted between δ18o and d excess separately for the swm and wd season fig s3 a reasonably strong correlation r2 0 32 n 109 p 0 01 was found for the wd period indicating a significant amount of raindrop evaporation however the correlation was statistically insignificant r2 0 09 n 65 p 0 1 for the sw monsoon season implying a negligible amount of raindrop evaporation had taken place during this period 5 2 δ18o and d excess anomaly the δ18oversus d excess relationship for the wd period is much steeper slope 0 83 compared to the swm period slope 0 37 table 1 from this observation it may be qualitatively said that the wd derived raindrops underwent evaporation more than twice than the swm derived rain however raindrop evaporation leads to enrichment in stable isotopes resulting in higher δ18o and lower d excess further as mentioned earlier the average δ18o values for the wd period is 4 67 against 1 35 for the swm period so instead of being enriched in isotopic values the wd derived rains get depleted by about 3 32 relative to the swm derived rain the rainout process can only explain this discrepancy since the moisture is sourced far in the mediterranean region the wd rain events suffer from the continental effect resulting in substantial isotopic depletion due to the rainout processes considering the empirical longitudinal effect of 0 002 km criss 1999 it may be estimated that the wd derived moisture must have travelled a minimum distance of 1660 km 3 32 1 0 002 km to get depleted by 3 32 this makes sense as the eastern edge of the mediterranean sea is approximately 2880 km west of our sampling site backward trajectory ensembles reveal that precipitation isotope composition over the sampling site is governed by the interplay of marine moisture transported by the sw summer monsoon during jjas and westerly wind driven moisture generated over the mediterranean sea during winter months this points towards the fact that precipitation isotope records from the kashmir valley can capture signals of the variability in moisture sources governed by dual transport pathways to constrain this we present here the d excess anomaly since it is a good proxy for characterizing the atmospheric moisture sources aemisegger et al 2014 the anomaly has been calculated by subtracting the mean value from the individual values and then normalized by its standard deviation the anomalies are characterized by positive values during the wd winter season fig s4 while the negative anomalies are typically associated with the swm as the moistures were produced at relatively higher rh over the oceans positive values suggest that vapours were generated under relatively low rh conditions a total of 40 precipitation samples 23 of the total samples analyzed were observed to have d excess values 20 it is known that precipitation in the eastern mediterranean is generally characterized by high d excess 20 gat and carmi 1970 araguás araguás et al 2000 gat et al 2003 hence the observed higher d excess values particularly during the wd period fig s5a are thus attributed to the moisture generated over the eastern mediterranean sea the effect of wds on d excess even during the monsoon season could also be assessed from the synoptic weather chart of the imd as mentioned earlier on 10 jan 2017 the wd activity was detected as an upper air circulation at 3 1 km asl prevailing over the adjoining region of jammu kashmir with monsoon axis at 5 8 km asl close to our sampling region this confirms that brief episodic increase of high d excess values fig s5b during the sw monsoon period was also controlled by the prevalence of the westerly moisture sources 6 synoptic controls on precipitation isotopes to investigate the effect of meteorological parameters on the precipitation isotopes we performed correlation analyses among the following parameters for the full observation period and separately for the wd and the swm periods precipitation p δ18o temperature t δ18o relative humidity rh δ18o surface pressure sp δ18o and surface pressure sp precipitation p a weak negative correlation was observed between the precipitation δ18o and precipitation amount for all the periods table 1 this does not conform to the observation of jeelani et al 2017 who found a good correlation between these two parameters on a monthly time scale indicating different controlling mechanisms operating on precipitation isotopes on monthly and daily time scales a statistically significant positive correlation r2 0 61 p 0 01 was observed between t δ18o during the wd period however when the relationship is examined only for the monsoon season the r2 value nearly vanishes it is known that isotopic fractionation is temperature dependent but this dependency gets subdued by the amount effect in the tropics dansgaard 1964 the t δ18o relation holds good in the mid and high latitude regions for which the temperature dependency has been estimated as 0 69 c 1 criss 1991 such kind of correlation has also been observed in the southern tibetan plateau gao et al 2013 our estimation of 0 8 c 1 agrees reasonably well with those estimates hence the presence absence of strong t δ18o relation during the wd monsoon period provides an excellent tool to decipher the past wd monsoon events from suitable proxy records such as the tree rings for example bose et al 2016 demonstrated that the oxygen isotopic records of tree rings from the western himalayan region could be used to reconstruct the past isotopic composition of soil water if the individual tree rings can be sampled and analyzed at the seasonal resolution then it may be possible to decipher the past wd signatures in their isotopic values among other parameters the rh seems to have strong control over the precipitation δ18o both for the wd and monsoon period strong inverse correlation r2 0 40 p 0 01 was found between rh and δ18o though the correlation is statistically insignificant r2 0 17 for the monsoon season this observation also indicates that the precipitation derived from the wd events better respond to humidity than the monsoon rain additionally a reasonably strong negative correlation r2 0 43 p 0 01 was found between the sp and δ18o for the wd period the same relation also holds good for the monsoon season albeit in a weaker form r2 0 11 precipitation δ18o usually does not show any dependency on the surface pressure to our knowledge such kind of behavior has not been reported however precipitation isotope does show altitude dependency garzione et al 2000 with this consideration a negative correlation observed between δ18o and the surface pressure at our study area which has an altitude of 1590 m seems to be logical additionally the connection between δ18o and sp may arise due to the interplay between pressure and height this aspect will be examined later as per our observation the wd derived precipitation δ18o is strongly correlated with t rh and sp which is not significant in the case of the sw monsoon derived precipitation it is noteworthy that on site meteorological parameters such as t rh and sp have a minimal influence on the precipitation δ18o during the swm period such variability in controlling the precipitation isotope composition during the swm period is likely to arise due to other parameters and or large scale atmospheric conditions kurita 2013 one such role could be attributed to the large scale regional convection dominant during monsoon season governing changes in the precipitation isotopes recent studies on precipitation isotopes indicate that regional convection is the primary driver of precipitation isotopes in the tropics and sub tropics vimeux et al 2011 moerman et al 2013 benetti et al 2014 lekshmy et al 2014 he et al 2018a b for example large scale variations up to 20 in the stable isotopic compositions of daily precipitation have been observed in the tropics resulting from regional convection activities moerman et al 2013 he et al 2015 permana et al 2016 model studies have also demonstrated that variations in precipitation isotopes over the tropical sub tropical regions during monsoon seasons are ubiquitous features governed by regional convective systems kurita 2013 and references therein tremoy et al 2014 recently ansari et al 2020 reported that large scale convective activities dominantly controlled the isotopic signature of monsoon jjas precipitation from eastern india while the local meteorological variables played a minor role simultaneous investigation of long term isotopic compositions in vapour daily precipitation and measurements of regional atmospheric conditions particularly during the swm period would provide invaluable information to evaluate the role of large scale atmospheric conditions in controlling the precipitation isotope composition however investigating the role of such regional atmospheric conditions on swm derived precipitation δ18o variability is beyond the scope of this study and will be addressed in our future studies 6 1 multiple regression analysis between precipitation isotopes and the meteorological variables we have performed multiple regression analysis whereby the precipitation δ18o was regressed with t rh and sp separately for the monsoon season and the wd period the precipitation has not been considered in this exercise since the isotopic values maintain a poor correlation with precipitation as shown in table 1 both t rh and sp were significantly correlated with precipitation δ18o for the wd events while the relationship was not significant in the case of the monsoon precipitation the same is true for the multiple regression cases as shown below 2 δ 18 o wd 0 65 0 07 t 0 104 0 05 r h 0 0024 0 005 s p r 2 0 87 n 109 p 0 001 3 δ 18 o monsoon 0 226 0 221 t 0 202 0 067 r h 0 011 0 010 s p r 2 0 29 n 58 p 0 001 fig 5 shows the scatter diagram between the observed δ18o and the predicted δ18o for the wd season and the swm season respectively a linear fit yields a correlation coefficient of r2 0 87 for the wd season and 0 29 for the monsoon season a strong correlation in the case of the wd period reveals that precipitation isotopes during the wd events behave very differently than the monsoon season for example the above equations show that the temperature coefficient of precipitation δ18o during the wd period is 2 times to that of the monsoon season however a linear model explaining the variability of δ18o may overestimate or underestimate the effect of the predictor variable if the variables are correlated to each other duy et al 2018 konecky et al 2019 hence it is essential to remove the inter dependency between t rh and surface pressure towards this we carried out the partial correlation and principal component analyses to examine the interlinking effects between different variables the details have been presented in the supplementary section both the analyses demonstrate that the temperature and rh play a significant role while the surface pressure has a minor role in determining the precipitation isotopic composition further the results of the partial correlation analysis revealed that t rh and the sp explain only about a quarter of the variability observed in precipitation δ18o hence the variability of about 87 as explained by the linear regression model seems to be an overestimation that arises due to the inter dependency of the meteorological parameters thus to get a realistic estimate the inter dependency effect must be removed using suitable statistical analysis such as partial correlation analysis and or principal component analysis additional atmospheric parameters processes such as moisture generated through evapotranspiration must be considered in order to explain the unexplained variability 6 2 potential applications the above mentioned characteristics of the wd derived precipitation may have some potential applications for example a strong dependency of the wd derived precipitation isotopes with the basic meteorological parameters gives it a unique property that may be useful to study the synoptic scale systems involving the moisture dynamical processes for example re analysis based atmospheric data are widely used to explore a variety of processes but such kind of data may contain large uncertainty especially for a region which is characterized by complex topography and insufficient observational data such as the western himalaya it appears to have a significant error in its t and rh estimates we have used t re analysed data of the era interim see the methods section and calculated the correlation coefficients with the precipitation δ18o fig s6 shows the results for both the parameters the correlation coefficients are significantly better in the case of the observed data vs δ18o compared to the era interim derived parameters several investigators confirmed that the precipitation isotopes are intricately related to the moisture fluxes moore et al 2014 chakraborty et al 2016 dar and ghosh 2017 midhun et al 2018 sinha et al 2019 hence if water isotopic data i e both rainwater and ground level vapor are made available on a regional basis from the western himalayan region it may be possible to derive better information about the moisture dynamical processes and in turn to better constrain the re analysed data additionally it may be potentially useful to the operational meteorologists involved in synoptic observations using this technique fingerprinting the wd precipitation that extends from the western himalaya to northeast india may also be possible another likely application is to investigate the role of wd derived precipitation isotope signatures in the north eastern region of india it is believed that a significant amount of moisture is transported from the western himalaya to some parts of ne india dimri and mohanty 2009 but direct evidence of this is still lacking ne india has become highly vulnerable in terms of its moisture resources a recent study by choudhury et al 2019 highlights that this region has experienced a steep decline in precipitation during the last 5 6 decades these authors also estimated local moisture contribution which corresponds to only 7 of the total moisture supply in this context it is essential to identify the role and subsequent importance of wd derived moisture in this region using the methodology discussed in this study for a better understanding of the regional hydrological budget it may also find an application in paleomonsoon research for example ghosh et al 2017 demonstrated that freshwater mollusc if characterized by high growth rate is potentially useful in delineating the active and break phases of precipitation within a given season if such kinds of archives are available in the kashmir valley it is in principle possible to record the isotopic signatures of the precipitation derived by the wd and the monsoon system of the past hence the isotopic analysis of those archives could provide valuable records to characterize the past precipitation data as demonstrated in this study 7 conclusions isotopic analysis of daily precipitation collected from the kashmir valley reveals the presence of two distinct moisture sources in this region the marine vapor is mainly derived from the arabian sea and appears during the late summer the maximum intrusion takes place during late august and early september on the other hand wds bring moisture from the mediterranean region mainly from october to early june precipitation isotopes show a significant correlation with t rh and the sp the extent of correlation is strong for the wd season but weak for the monsoon season this characteristic feature of the wd derived precipitation may have the potential to provide better information about moisture dynamics than that offered by the re analysed data for the western himalayan region multiple linear regression involving meteorological variables reveals strong correlation especially for the wd season however a high value of correlation is likely to be arising due to the inter dependency of the predictor variables this effect has been removed employing partial correlation analysis by decoupling this effect individual contributions of the parameters on the precipitation δ18o have been quantified it has been shown that t rh and sp could explain only about 7 14 and 2 of the observed δ18o variability for the wd period respectively the quantification process for the monsoon season reveals that they are negligibly small the study highlights that a simple correlation analysis between the precipitation isotopes and multiple meteorological parameters may overestimate the correlation values the analytical artifact arises due to the interdependency of the meteorological parameters hence the effect must be removed

5364,the study attempts to determine paleo recharge sources for two major aquifer units of kuwait namely kuwait group aquifer kga and dammam formation dfm were collected and analyzed for major ions and isotopes the obtained results of 14c ages indicated that the groundwater samples ranged from 31 9 ky to 3 9 ky in dfm and 23 3 ky to 0 8 ky in kga the variations in δ18o signatures with respect to age reflected that there were two major sources of rainwater such as enriched southern indian ocean monsoon and the depleted northwesterly mediterranean vapor source the samples found to show variations during the three marine isotopic stages mis 1 3 heinrich events bolling allerod and dryas time periods in both aquifers a shift in the intertropical convergence zone itcz was witnessed in the groundwater of both aquifers from 7 8 ky to 4 9 ky the variation in the holocene climate is mainly due to the influence of tropospheric easterly jet governed by the swing in itcz as a result of holocene volcanism the mean δ18o values of dfm samples 3 81 reflect depletion than kga samples 2 31 and the d excess values were 0 95 and 2 05 respectively thus it could be inferred that the dfm was predominantly recharged during late pleistocene period and it was in a relatively cooler climate than recharge environment of kga the study infers that kga was recharged between 26on and 26 8on latitudes and that of the dfm was noted to be recharged south west of kuwait in two different patches between 25 8on and 26 2on and 26 7on 27 4on latitudes during late pleistocene the kga was concluded to be recharged between 25 5on and 27 5on latitudes south of kuwait during holocene keywords groundwater paleoclimate isotopes itcz recharge moisture source 1 introduction shallow and deep groundwaters are recharged by either precipitation or surface water sources the interpretation of the paleoclimate is generally derived from the inversion models based on transfer functions and on current climatic conditions these approaches help in developing paleo temperatures and rainfall regimes hatté and schwartz 2003 several proxies ranging from thousand hundred years have been used to develop a long term record on climate change this has led to look into insights on the past climatic trends by adopting various proxies like ice cores sediments microfossils tree rings groundwater etc macrofossil assemblages like beetles mollusks and midge larvae serve as the basis of major paleoclimate studies hatté and schwartz 2003 the models thus developed require input from a variety of sources similarly another paleo thermometer record was inferred to be the width of tree rings yadav and singh 2002 the information about paleo temperature and ancient precipitation were derived from δ18o and δ13c values for cellulose cook et al 1998 speleotherm carbonates also provide information on paleoclimate and water cycle dorale 1998 the detail studies on ice cores provided information on glacial levels land surface and seas surface temperatures variations in albedo and shifts in monsoon trends etc clemens et al 1991 the study on the pleistocene holocene time was attempted by various authors adopting different approaches like studies on paleosols gravels and alluvial fans spleotherms lake sediments etc fleitmann et al 2007 lézine et al 2017 parker et al 2006a 2006b schulz and whitney 1986 the extreme arid conditions of arabia were reflected by studying the aeolian sand and also from the calcite formed due to hypersaline springs found in fractures clark and fontes 1990 studies on the soil zones with petrogypsic nature also revealed the arid climatic conditions in the arabian region rose 2006 similarly the dispersion of biota with respect to the time scale in the arabian peninsula was studied to understand the climate change during the holocene period parker 2009 petraglia and alsharekh 2003 rose 2006 a study on the pollen marine organism and spores in the soil samples collected from the karbala region of mesopotamian plain ali 2013 addressed the paleo climatic conditions in the holocene period the paleoclimate condition of nw china was studied for the late pleistocene lp by using stable and radioactive isotopes in groundwater along with the hydrochemical data li et al 2015 jiang et al 2019 túri et al 2019 the study indicated that the holocene climate was warmer and that of lp had cooler climate during recharge the results were derived mainly by analyzing the value of d excess δ18o and δd of groundwater along with 14c climatic change during the late quaternary has been inferred from the isotopic composition of groundwater in various places all over the world in africa fontes et al 1991 edmunds et al 1999 bakari et al 2012 north america

1997 walraevens 1998 eiler 2011 ettayfi et al 2012 but so far no investigation has been carried out in this part of the peninsula the isotopic investigations carried out so far in kuwait have been related either to understanding its groundwater flow processes hadi et al 2016 saravana kumar 2013 or deciphering contamination sources akber et al 2006 the flow velocity of groundwater was determined in kuwait by using carbon isotopes bhandary et al 2015 and the isotope systematics of the kuwait region was studied by various authors hadi et al 2016 hadi and al ruwaih 2008 al senafy et al 2012 wakida and lerner 2005 bhandari et al 2012 the kuwait meteoric water line was also earlier attempted by the authors hadi et al 2016 to compare with the groundwater isotopes ebrahim and siwek 1993 carried out a study on groundwater quality variation at selected sites in kuwait to evaluate the quality of groundwater in the freshwater fields of raudhatain and umm al aish and in the farming areas of al abdally and al wafra the 14c data suggested an age range of 700 3450 years with total dissolved solids tds in the range of 950 2400 mg l the tritium content was measured in the samples and it was inferred that the samples were relatively recent 1952 and after recharge in this area 14c age of the water samples occurring in the lower parts of the kga ranged from 7600 to 10000 years another recent study was conducted at kisr to characterize the groundwater age flow direction flow velocity and recharge area of the kuwait groundwaters using carbon isotopes this study identified that 14c corrected ages ranged from recent to 25 000 years before present the 14c isochrones of the groundwater samples indicated that the general groundwater direction is toward the northeast saravana kumar 2013 hadi et al 2016 carried out a detailed environmental isotopic δd δ18o δ 13c 3h 14c study on the southern kuwait groundwater the authors deduced that the groundwater of kga and dfm were recharged by different sources in different time periods they also inferred that the deeper groundwater of kga was recharged during warm periods while that of dfm formation during the colder humid periods the results were derived based on δ18o δd and d excess the age of kga groundwater was determined by 14c and it ranged from 24 to 5 thousand years ky the aquifers may be regional or trans boundary in nature few regional groundwater systems extending beyond the borders of the middle east and north african mena region referred as shared aquifers are listed in table 1 most of the groundwater systems listed are mainly recharged during the late pleistocene holocene lp h period hence a detailed investigation on the recharge environment and the spatial extent is essential for the management of the resource understanding past climatic conditions becomes a priority to examine the interrelationship between a groundwater system and its atmosphere ocean any variation in the regime and quantity of precipitation together with variations in temperature and evapotranspiration not only affects groundwater recharge but also its quality therefore an understanding of the paleoclimatic conditions at the time of recharge and their control on the hydrology of any groundwater system like that of kuwait s complex and coastal multi aquifer system is essential for constructing its hydrogeological model for sustainable management of the water resources in addition information in the paleoclimate conditions would serve as an extensive base for the calibration of the global climate models and thus would help in the prediction of future climate scenarios this could form a very significant baseline for the future management of the reserve and could play a key role in integrated water resource management this study is attempted to address the sources of recharge interconnection between water bodies in the aquifers with respect to various meteoric waters and its relation to late pleistocene holocene lp h periods 2 study area kuwait is located in the northwestern part of the arabian region extending between 28 30on 30 30on and 46 3oe 48 3oe fig 1 spatially covering an extent of about 18 000 km2 it is bounded in the south by saudi arabia and in the north and west by iraq the country has a highest elevation in the southwest 270 m with a gentle slope toward the north east fig 1 the topography shows undulations filled with gravel and sandy mostly due to the aeolian process in general it is an arid desert with low relief and less geomorphic features among the features the significant ones are the ahmadi ridge jal az zour escarpment wara hill and wadi al batin the western boundary of the country is represented by the valley of wadi al batin extending for 8 11 km the ahmadi ridge extends north to south n s and located along the southeast se region of the country running parallel to the coast with an elevation of 13 m above mean sea level amsl the escarpment extends southwest northeast sw ne located the north of bay for about 60 km with an altitude of 145 m amsl al sulaimi and al ruwaih 2005 the country has limited water resources with cold winter and dry hot summer with an average annual precipitation of 110 120 mm predominantly during the period from october to may it has been observed that the annual evaporation rates are higher and it may vary from 2500 mm to 4500 mm in the coastal region and along the inland respectively this scenario of extensive evaporation rate with scarce rainfall and lesser rain events has resulted in the dry sandy top soil there is an acute shortage of freshwater resources and hence the brackish groundwater forms the chiefly dependent natural source of water alhumoud 2008 barth and steinkohl 2004 reported two main weather regimes in the peninsula appendix 3 namely north westerlies from the atlantic during winter flows eastwards to the arabian gulf to the mediterranean sea resulting in light rain events and gentle cool winds and summer wind occurs due to indian ocean monsoon iom resulting in heavy rainfall along the southern part of the arabian peninsula glennie et al 2002 these two processes governing the rainfall patterns of the peninsula persisted during the pleistocene holocene time periods muzuka 2000 fleitmann et al 2007 the records of these climatic conditions were found to be preserved in the sediments of the arabian sea indian ocean and the gulf of oman geological fence diagram for the central part of kuwait is presented in fig 2 various gradations of gravel sand silt and clay material can be observed in a discontinuous fashion in the kga of the study area clay represents the base of kga and it is discontinuous it covers n ne and n nw parts completely and partially in e ne and e se parts the clay base is absent in the southern part of the study area massive and porous limestone represents dfm aquifer it can be observed that the thickness of dfm aquifer increases from south to north in the study area the porous limestone appears intercalated with massive limestones of the dfm 2 1 hydrogeology the country is mainly dependent on two main aquifers for groundwater resources largely brackish in nature the kga are formed after the eocene period and composed of consolidated deposits with clastic consolidates to unconsolidated sediments the kuwait group contains two aquifers the dibdibbah formations in the north and the ghar formation in the central and southern areas the kga is completely saturated with water along the coast and completely dry in the southwest edge of kuwait and at the ahmadi ridge the water level in kga varies from about 90 m above mean sea level in the southwest to zero along the coast the thickness of the kuwait group increases from 150 m in the southwestern parts of kuwait to 400 m northeast the total transmissivity of the kga increases from the southwest 10 m2 d 1 and less to the northeast 1500 m2 d 1 and more with the increase in saturated thickness in this direction from 0 to 400 m the dibdibbah formation that overlies the ghar and the lower fars formations in the northeastern parts of kuwait to the northwest of kuwait bay forms the uppermost aquifer of the kuwait group a shaley unit separates the aquifer from the underlying main kga the aquifer is unconfined within the confines of kuwait the transmissivity of the aquifer increases from about 10 m2 d 1 in the areas adjacent to kuwait bay to 150 200 m2 d 1 in the northeastern corner of the country the next dependent aquifer is the dfm formed during eocene in a marine environment the dfm exists in confined condition and the kga is unconfined appendix 2 mukhopadhyay et al 1994 mukhopadhyay 1995 mukhopadhyay et al 1996 a major unconformity separates the dfm which is deposited in a marine environment from kuwait group sediments that are deposited in a continental environment the thickness of the dfm varies from about 150 m in the southwest to 280 m in the northeast the piezometric level in the dfm varies from 90 m in the southwest to only a few meters above mean sea level near the coast abusada 1988 because of its karstic nature the transmissivity in the dfm is variable especially in the southern and southwestern parts of kuwait but it shows a generally decreasing trend towards the north and east al sulaimi and mukhopadhyay 2000 in spite of the local presence of clay lenses that may act as aquitards and the variation in the degree of karstification within the dfm that affects the vertical hydraulic conductivity the two aquifers are hydraulically connected under natural undisturbed conditions there is an upward hydraulic gradient from the dfm to the kga senay et al 1987 the regional groundwater flow was reported to be from the southwest to the northeast direction and it was inferred to discharge water along the gulf al sulaimi and el rabaa 1994 mukhopadhyay et al 1994 these aquifers are trans boundary and extend to saudi arabia and iraq the precipitation in kuwait is insufficient to recharge the aquifers mukhopadhyay et al 1994 and it was implied that the rainfall in the adjacent countries helped to recharge the aquifers the lateral underground flow from saudi arabia is the main source for recharge appendix 3 precipitation is a minor recharge source in the depression of northern kuwait where limited freshwater lenses occur in the upper part of the kuwait group especially in the raudhatain umm al aish and abdally areas kga 3 methodology the study focuses on the interpretation from isotopes and hence the samples were observed for δ18o δd d excess major ions δ 13c and selected samples for 14c to understand the recharge environment and ages of groundwater 14c values provide information of groundwater ages recharged between 50 ky and 100 years the samples from both the major aquifers were considered 58 samples representing kga and 55 from dfm fig 3 14c ages for accessible 35 samples of kga and 27 of dfm were obtained details are presented in the appendices 4 and 5 the kga samples were spatially distributed throughout kuwait the dfm samples were concentrated predominantly in the central part of kuwait extending east west where the distribution of samples were considered according to the availability of wells for sampling the wells were purged using a submersible pump before the collection of samples during well purging temperature ph ec do and orp of groundwater were measured at appropriate intervals a flow through cell having attached ph ec do and orp provides an

of 3 samples were analysed for δ18o δd δ 13c and 14c in international atomic energy agency and biofocus lab germany 14c age calcualtions were made by using two methods pearson and hanshaw 1970 and fontes and garnier 1979 the age derived from the fontes and garnier 1979 method was adopted for the study 4 results the maximum minimum and average values of the different chemical parameters are listed in table 2 the δ18o of the kga varied from 5 7 to 1 3 with an average of 2 31 and that of dfm ranging from 1 5 to 6 8 with an average 3 81 similarly the δd of the kga varied from 43 75 to 6 1 with an average of 19 37 and that of dfm varying from 2 3 to 38 66 with an average of 28 45 it is also interesting to note that the d excess of the kga had an average of 0 95 and that of dfm being 2 05 most of the kga samples were younger 802 years 23391 years than the dfm 3942 years 31916 years 4 1 age of samples and distribution the ages of the kga groundwater samples ranged from 802 to 23391 years and they were classified into four groups as follows 1 3 ky 2 3 ky to 6 ky 3 6 ky to11 2 ky and 4 11 2 ky among the 35 samples considered for 14c ages 4 6 10 and 15 samples respectively fig 4 represented these groups most of the kga samples ranged from 6 ky to 23 3 ky the distribution of samples showed that most of the older samples are represented along the sw to ne region across the bay it is predominantly bordered by the younger water ranging from 6 ky to 11 ky the younger groundwater of kga was chiefly observed along the southern part of kuwait especially in the coastal region the youngest water is located in the raudhatain field in the north the samples of dfm were categorized into 5 different classes as follows 1 5 ky 2 5 10 ky 3 10 1 5ky 4 15 20 ky and 5 20 ky the representation of samples showed that 2 2 4 7 and 12 were observed in these classes respectively fig 5 among the 27 samples considered for 14c ages it is to be noted that most of the samples of dfm formation were 15 ky the older waters are distributed from inland to coast and the younger ones are scattered inland structurally kuwait has five major lineaments two extending from ne sw jal al liyah lineament and wadi al musannat jal azor lineament and two along nne and ssw wadi al batin and kuwait arch lineamant apart from these major structures strike slip faults were observed near the burgan oil filed three synclinal structures were observed in the central part of kuwait between ne sw lineaments umm al aish rabiyah and ash shiqq an intersection of western kuwait arch lineament and wadi jal azor lineament is noticed along the southern part of kuwait bay the structural studies by carman 1996 have also reported intersection of minor structures along the northern and southern part of the bay these intersection of structures might have facilitated the movement of older groundwater towards the bay from deeper horizons the process of groundwater extraction along the coastal region have led to the migration of saline water into the coastal aquifer indicating the signatures of recent groundwater along the shore a problem of water logging due to increase in shallow groundwater table leading to the rise older groundwater from deeper horizons to the shallow depths in the urban regions was reported by hamdan and mukhopadhyay 1991 and mukhopadhyay et al 2006 hence erratic distribution of younger waters against the older waters may be due to the influence of geological structure sea water intrusion or due to the variation in the depth of sampling 4 2 stable isotope the correlation between the stable isotopes of δ18o and δd in freshwater was attempted by craig 1961 on a universal scale the analyzed isotope values are always expressed in delta δ δ r sample r vsmow r vsmow 10 3 where r indicates the heavier to lighter ratio of hydrogen or oxygen isotopes the above craig s study has demarcated a definite relationship between these two isotopes and derived a universal line referred as global meteoric water line gmwl craig s derivation showed the relation between both the isotopes as follows 1 δ d 8 δ 18 o 10 this relationship has led to a method of interpolating rainwater as it follows a systematic pattern the derived trend of the meteoric line reflects a universal or global nature of precipitation but the trend of a local meteoric line lmwl varies depending upon the climate land use pattern vapor sources and other geographical parameters although the lmwl helps in the identification of the recent recharge pattern it differs from the regression values and the d excess value of gmwl in the absence of lmwl gmwl is used as it helps in the interpretation of the provenance of recharge in this direction craig observed a significant fact that the colder climate areas are associated with depleted isotopes and vice versa in the warmer climatic condition the lmwl of the nearby regions are provided in table 3 5 discussion a shift in the position below the lmwl gmwl was generally noted for few rainwater samples and most of the groundwater samples in δ18o δd plot due to the process of evaporation the reverse scenario of a sample representation above the lmwl is rare and this situation is expected due to re evaporation and precipitation of local surface water body and the prevalence of less humidity such samples have high d excess it was also reported that if the condensation were to prevail before the mixing of these secondary vapor sources with the tropospheric masses the isotopic signatures of these samples would be expected to fall well above the lmwl clark and fritz 1997 rozanski et al 1992 simpkins 1995 as discussed earlier lmwl plots were close to gmwl with minor variation in slope such variations could have been due to local changes in different parameters like climate temperature source of moisture rainfall season and secondary evaporation 5 1 δ18o and δd relationship there are several factors affecting the isotopic values of the precipitations air temperature amount of precipitation and air mass history rozanski et al 1992 gat 1996 dansgaard 1964 tan 2009 2013 the effect also depends on the source moisture isotope values of δ18o and δd along with 14c ages have helped in reconstructing the paleoclimates yang et al 2016 apart from the source moisture other global parameters like sea surface temperature sst relative humidity and vertical shear index vuille et al 2005 yang et al 2016 distillation during the process of transportation of vapor liu et al 2014 etc also affect the isotope signatures the average isotopic signatures of rainfall derived from the pacific ocean moisture is 2 5 lesser than the iom the δ18o and δd values of all the groundwater samples were plotted to determine the relationship with the various meteoric water lines eastern mediterranean meteoric water line emmwl north oman meteoric water line nomwl global meteoric water line gmwl and kuwait meteoric water line kmwl appendix 9 the plot shows that few samples of dfm formation fall along the emmwl nomwl and kmwl most of the samples fall parallel to gmwl although the samples from both the aquifers showed enrichment dfm was comparatively depleted and few samples indicated mediterranean vapor sources a more detailed inference was made by implying that the δ18o δd relation existed with respect to the age of the samples different marine isotope stages mis were inferred for lp h periods extending from 60 ky to present about three different stages inferred as mis 3 mis 2 and mis 1 lisiecki and raymo 2005 considered to represent the lp h periods 5 2 groundwater age and lmwl irrespective of the aquifer the older groundwater samples 20 ky were observed to be depleted without much fluctuation in isotopic values and that the samples fell parallel to gmwl the samples of this period represented mis 2 14 29 ky and 3 29 57ky stages which had a variation in monsoon intensity fluctuation in aridity to include the heinrich events h2 h5 schulz et al 1998 the ice cores have recorded six significant discharges of sediment and rock debris from north american ice sheets to north atlantic ocean through series of events and this time period is referred as heinrich events four samples of dfm represented mis 3 stage and it is worth noting that the samples were relatively enriched than the samples falling between 25 and 30 ky fig 6 series of arid phases observed during this period were indicated by h4 to h6 events which might be attributed to the enrichment it was also inferred from the marine cores that the aridity was intensified in mis 3 after 33 ky bp before present ivanova et al 2003 and since all the samples of this interval were seen to fall between 30 and 33 ky bp it indicated enrichment the study also revealed that groundwater served as a source for the interdunal lakes apart from rainfall which has led to the long time persistence of these lakes even in arid conditions thus resulting to the capture of evaporative enriched isotope signatures for samples 30 ky the period 25 20 ky bp was noted with colder conditions with periods of wetness series of lakes were observed in north arabia during 25 21 ky bp and subsequently it was followed by aridity abboud 2000 abed et al 2008 concurrently during this period lakes were also reported in jafar basin huckriede and wiesemann 1968 in lake hasa jordan schuldenrein and clark 1994 wet conditions were also observed in the southern part of the peninsula in rub al khali region mcclure 1976 1984 and mud fan depression mcclure and swain 1974 nearly 1000 ephemeral water bodies were observed near the rub al khali region even up to a depth of 10 m spread along the ew direction wetness was detected predominantly from 46 to 23 ky bp and dune accumulation was not observed lancaster and tchakerian 2003 glennie et al 2002 clark and fontes 1990 reported c3 vegetation and identified hyper alkaline spring calcite deposits c3 vegetation are generally observed in wet regions or during cold season with lesser optimum temperature for photosynthesis the prominent wetness and cold climatic conditions resulted in the depleted isotopic signatures during this period in both the aquifers large amount of rainfall during this period could have also influenced the depletion of the isotopic values hence its deduced from the above observation that the period from 20 to 25 ky was predominantly cooler however during 15 20 ky bp enrichment was observed in both the aquifers in similar pattern fig 6 this may be due to the influence of increased aridity and frequent dust storms prevailing during this period the early stage of mis 2 corresponded to the terminal pleistocene and represented by an increased period of aridity and the initiation of dune formation the predominance of aeolian process was seen between 20 and 15 ky bp during the last glacial maxima lgm and in the late glacial periods parker and goudie 2007 goudie 2009 gardner 1988 preusser 2002 the impact of the process was reflected in the samples of this period reduction of moisture and increase of aridity were detected during 19 ky bp clark and fontes 1990 it was also noted that the northwesterly trajectory was predominant during this period rad et al 1999 it is also interesting to observe that samples of both the aquifers behaved similarly during this period the samples of dfm were observed parallel to emmwl during 10 15 ky bp indicating that the moisture source may be from the northwest which is relatively more depleted than the southwest indian ocean monsoon iom nonetheless the kga samples recharged during the same period were observed to be more enriched as they were inferred to have recharged from a different source iom predominantly this set of kga samples fell parallel to the gmwl fig 6 a brief phase of wetness witnessed from 15 to 13 ky bp was also noted and this corresponds to bolling allerod ba interstadial this period was slightly warmer and represented by mass wasting of lgm sheets in northern hemisphere leuschner and sirocko 2003 the time period from 14 5 ky to 11 5 ky is a transition period represented by fluctuation from glacial to inter glacial conditions in the northern hemisphere and referred as dryas there had been series of warmer and colder events during this period concurrently the initiation of younger dryas was represented in the northern and central part of the arabian peninsula 13 5 ky bp this period was characterized by shammal winds flowing from nw peaking at 11 5 ky bp which is observed from the isotopic signature of dfm formation the monsoonal activity was lesser during this period and northward shift of the iom was not observed until 9 2 ky bp parker et al 2004 the samples representing 10 5 ky fig 6 in both the aquifers showed wide variation in isotopic values ranging from enrichment to depletion reflecting a drastic variation in climatic condition humid to arid it was also detected that the variation of δ18o was greater than δd as there were reports of more rainy and dry conditions during this period with different intensities the late pleistocene resulted in the termination of hyperarid condition and the onset of humidity with a wet phase during the initial stages of holocene until 5 ky bp wilkinson 1997 stokes and bray 2005 parker et al 2006a the monsoonal rainfall has resulted in the intensive rainfall along the central and eastern part of arabia during the early holocene the initiations of wet conditions were witnessed earlier in the southern part of the peninsula compared to the central and the northern parts davies 2006 parker et al 2006a the onset of wet condition during this period is due to the northward migration of inter tropical convergence zone itcz as a result of warmer conditions in the northern hemisphere demenocal et al 2000 this process of shift in itcz was witnessed in the stalactite deposit of oman fleitmann et al 2007 neff et al 2001 from south to north during 10 3 to 9 6 ky bp as a result of iom advancement represented by the depleted isotope signatures in both aquifers although the cessation of dune migration was observed by goudie et al 2000 the first lake deposit at this stage was observed only during 8 5 ky bp parker et al 2004 reflecting the fact that it has taken about 1 8 ky bp for the migration of iom from 15on to 25on in the arabian peninsula this early stage was witnessed with c3 plants and a profound distribution of moisture in the peninsula the groundwater resulting from the recharge of evaporative water bodies like lakes surface water bodies during this period has resulted in the enriched values arnoux et al 2017 huang et al 2020 thus a vast variation in the δ18o values was noted during this period moreover from 5 to 6 ky bp the retreat of itcz was initiated resulting in the slightly warmer conditions with lesser rain events later samples 5 ky bp fig 6 showed steep enrichment in isotopes of both the aquifers however during this period the variation of δd was prominent than δ18o falling parallel to gmwl reflecting hyper arid conditions neff et al 2001 and uerpmann 2002 inferred that the southward retreat of itcz resulting in the lack of rain events led to the development of arid to hyper arid condition the existence of lakes in rub al khali started to perish however the lives of the lakes were extended even after the retreat of the itcz due to the influence of westerlies reflecting the variations in the isotopic values of the samples cuthbert et al 2019 a wide range of δ18o variation was detected in the samples of kga than dfm which may be due to the evaporation prior to recharge and the variation in moisture sources during 5 ky to 3 ky bp 5 3 comparison to other pleistocene holocene p h waters the stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen were studied from the perspective of relating to p h groundwaters in portugal de melo et al 2001 new mexico phillips et al 1986 egypt sultan et al 1997 north and central united states siegel 1991 libya edmunds and wright 1979 columbia brown et al 2010 hungary stute and deak 1989 china zongyu et al 2003 australia jacobson et al 1989 and british isles elliot et al 1999 fig 7 the values of δ18o and δd of the p h groundwaters from various parts of the world were plotted along with the samples of the study area though the groundwater samples represent different geographical locations and different climatic conditions there existed a linear relationship between these values the enriched samples of the region also reveals the fact that peninsula experienced less humid conditions since lp the holocene samples along with those of the present study showed a relationship of δd 7 96 δ18o 9 8 and that of pleistocene showed δd 6 5 δ18o 7 4 the groundwater samples of the study area were discerned to fall above these samples indicating enrichment irrespective of the aquifer fig 7 the dfm formation samples were spotted to be relatively more depleted than the kga samples further these samples were recharged between the late p h hence the slope may vary between the earlier inferred relationship of p h resulting in an intercept between 7 4 and 9 8 5 4 variation of δ18o with respect to age the relationship of δ18o in the samples of kga and dfm formation was studied with respect to ages fig 8 the relationship of δ18o with respect to the 14c ages showed that the samples of both the aquifers were distributed throughout the ages but most of the dfm samples were distributed between 15 and 35 ky bp and that of kga mostly at 17 ky bp it was seen that dfm samples were predominntly depleted irrespective of age few enriched kga samples were noted from 4 to 2 ky and 9 ky bp the enrichment may be due to difference in recharge conditions the difference in sea surface temperature was developed for past 68 ky from the sediment cores using δ18o of seawater govil and naidu 2010 the last glacial maximum was observed to be 4 c cooler than the current conditions and it was reflected by the depleted δ18o signatures in the samples of dfm formation during this period the monsoon derived precipitations were deduced to be higher during mis 3 0 3 to 1 0 and mis1 1 08 to 2 and lesser during mis2 1 and 4 0 9 to 1 4 isotopes of the present study also showed similar trend except for those recorded during the extreme events comparing the climatic stages derived from mis beyond last glacial maxima lgm dfm samples were seen to be more depleted fig 8 there was enrichment of δ18o in the samples seen from 15 to 20 ky bp indicating the decrease in moisture and increase in arid conditions it was also reported that the mis 2 temperature varied from 24 5 to 27 c and two abrupt warmer periods were observed during 19 ky and one during 17 ky bp referred to as arabian sea warmer events saher et al 2007 it was attributed mainly to the upwelling intensity and due to the increased sst relatively depletion in δ18o of both the aquifers was observed from 15 ky to 10 ky bp during bolling and allerod ba late glacial and during the dryas period due to the increase of moisture conditions with lesser influence of iom similar variations were also noted in δ18o values of globigerinoides ruber collected near the oman and south arabian peninsula sirocko et al 1993 the study reported variations from 0 to 1 7 from 20 ky to the present and sharp variations were also noted during 13 5 ky 13 06 ky and 9 9 ky bp these variations could be attributed to the fluctuations in the precipitation or evaporation patterns increased inflow of lighter or freshwater in the gulf influencing growth of g ruber this scenario reflected increased rain events and humid nature responsible for the depleted values of the samples in these aquifers the influence of nw moisture source was witnessed during this period in dfm formation and not in kga fig 8 the δ18o around 13 ky bp represented a glacial and holocene transition the early holocene humid interval was reported during 9 9 to 8 6 ky bp during the end of dryas there was an increase in temperature recorded reflecting aridity and lesser humid conditions resulting in the increase of δ18o values from 11 ky to 8 9 ky bp in the samples which was more prominent in kga samples fig 8 the northern part of the arabian region had witnessed increased arid conditions during the pre boreal and during the end of younger dryas rad et al 1999 the samples of dammam formation during 10 5 ky bp showed more depletion than that of the kga due to the difference in the recharge sources as inferred from earlier observations subsequently during the shift of itcz there had been increase in rainfall from 8 5 to 5 ky bp seen in the depleted δ18o values this period was noted with pronounced wet conditions due to strong influence of iom monsoon with more humidity the drainage flowing toward north drained the arabian inland and extended even to the arabian gulf parker 2009 studies showed the existence of holocene lakes at rub al khali desert bordered by the dune sand formed during the early holocene younger dryas and late glacial periods goudie et al 2000 the persistence of low temperatures was seen during 8 5 to 6 ky bp by the presence of c3 plants and followed by arid phase during 6 to 4 ky bp represented by c4 plants the c4 vegetation are generally found in dry areas or warm climates this time period was reported with maximum amount rainfall verman 2002 reflecting the depletion in δ18o of the groundwater samples of both the aquifers around 7 8ky maximum rainfall during the holocene period was represented by an increase of about 100 to 400 mm yr in the arabian region was recorded sanlaville 1992 the studies by kutzbach 1981 and sarnthein 1972 revealed that the northward shift of iom intensified the rain events and the seasonal influences observed in the arabian inland and in the bubiyan island located in the gulf it was also gathered that the rainfall increased about 50 than the current scenario several studies have recorded the variation in climate during different stages of pleistocene holocene p h witnessed from paleo productivity of microfossils in the arabian sea due to the variation in the intensity of iom and thus δ18o signatures a 1000 km northward shift of itcz was observed in north africa sanlaville 1992 the δ18o values for samples 5 ky bp showed an enrichment fig 8 reflecting a warmer period with lesser amount of rainfall shift of itcz beyond 5 9 bp resulted in the retrieval of iom neff et al 2001 resulting in the reduction of rainfall the shift of monsoonal conditions led to cessation of lakes around rub al khali mcclure 1976 the period was reported to be dry with aridity of higher intensity desiccation of lakes and subsequently the lakes were filled with sands parker et al 2004 resulting in the development of c4 plants bray and stokes 2004 the condition was also witnessed by the influence of dolomite flux beyond 5 ky bp reflecting the retreat of itcz southwards thereby strengthening the north westerlies this variability in climate was also found to be recorded in g ruber studies there were also depleted δ18o values noted reflecting the incidences of wetter periods 5 2 ky bp coinciding with the bronze age potts 1990 subsequent enrichment was due to intense aridity reported from 4 2 to 4 1 ky bp arz et al 2006 there was another period with depleted δ18o values when rivers of tigris and euphrates were sources of settlements from 4 3 to 4 2 ky bp with development of rainfed agriculture in the northern part of the peninsula kuzucuoglu and marro 2007 which may correspond to the initiation of the meghalayan stage the decrease of rain event and cessation of lakes resulted in the recharge of the evaporated surface water the process has shown the increase in δ18o values in kga severe conditions of aridity were observed around 3 3 5 ky bp in arabia china and india potts 1990 fedele 1990 the enrichment of δ18o was observed due to the increase of sst in the arabian sea from 3 5 ky to recent it is interesting to note that there has been a period of depleted δ18o value around 1 5 ky bp although the iom has retreated during 5 ky bp the extreme events of moisture sources from nw could have resulted in the depletion during this period in general there was an enrichment of isotopic values of δ18o during the holocene compared to the pleistocene thus it is deduced that cooler humid climate prevailed during pleistocene the observations on the holocene δ18o values of the samples show that each stage greelandian northgrippian has been initiated with a period of wetness followed by aridity 5 5 deuterium excess d excess the d excess is governed by the kinetic fractionation of the source vapor lesser value indicates the impact of evaporation and higher value reflects the signature of moisture recycling gat and matsui 1991 gat et al 1994 machavaram and krishnamurthy 1995 gat 2000 bhattacharya et al 2003 dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1982 kondoh and shimada 1997 this value of excess was determined by craig 1961 by analyzing the stable isotopes in the rainwater samples throughout the world and it is determined by the following d e x c e s s δ d 8 δ 18 o the primary precipitation has a d excess value ranging from 8 to 10 but these values may vary depending on the rate of evaporation and humidity gat and carmi 1970 the d excess values would depend on the source composition air temperature moisture and isotopic signatures of source vapor trinidad et al 2017 higher variation in d excess in groundwater is generally due to two major probabilities fynn et al 2016 as follows variation in the recharge sources fluctuations in the thickness of the vadose zone and their spatial variation relative proportion of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes are expressed through d excess values in water the variations from the global meteoric line d 10 could help in understating the process proceeding to recharge or recharge condition fig 9 the atmospheric polar circulation or the general circulation models have made use of this parameter to study the climate change petit et al 1991 hoffmann et al 2000 although there are several uncertainties in the determination of d excess as it depends on the analytical values of δd and δ18o it forms an integral component in addressing the issues related to paleoclimates the parameters apart from the paleoclimate significance could help in determining the history of modern day precipitation trajectory evaporation mixing source vapor etc lesser value 10 of d excess generally signifies the evaporation influencing rainwater further during the process of recharge it leaves its imprint on this groundwater gat and carmi 1970 alternately a vapor mass created by the process of significant secondary evaporation from the local surface water bodies can result in a higher value of d excess if the process progresses in a low humid environment subsequently the process of re condensation of this vapor after a proportional mixing with atmospheric flux will result in high d excess precipitation clark and fritz 1997 the process of evaporation is generally noted in rainwater prior to groundwater recharge tirumalesh et al 2017 during the process of d excess interpretation harvey et al 2005 revealed that the d excess value of 3 has to be used with precaution to understand the source in general there is a negative relationship between d excess and δ18o this value is a measure of evaporation and its relation to the physicochemical parameters helps to reveal the history of the recharge process the decrease of d excess revealed the increase of evaporation tsujimura et al 2001 hadi et al 2016 also inferred that the d excess represents a mixture of groundwaters with various origin and history the decrease of d excess reflects the decrease in humidity and increase of arid conditions most of the samples irrespective of the aquifer had d excess fluctuating around zero value right through the ages except for the period of extreme climate changes the d excess showed conditions similar to the present day during 23 ky with more increase in humidity during ba interstadial and in holocene during the shift in itcz further negative d excess indicated the arid conditions with more evaporations during 15 20 ky bp 8 3 9 ky bp and 3 ky bp fig 9 wasson et al 1983 1984 recorded a deglaciation around 12 8 ky bp continued by a short period of aridity from 11 7 to 10 ky bp which was also witnessed by the increase in salinity almogi labin et al 1991 it is inferred that till lgm the d excess was predominantly positive and from lgm to present there has been a significant representation of negative values reflecting frequent periods of aridity hence the dfm samples recharged before lgm and during ba were inferred to be during the moist humid conditions this recharge might have been probably from nw different vapor source as inferred from the earlier discussions on δ18o and on the comparison with emmwl the samples of 15 20 ky bp were inferred to be recharged during arid conditions fig 9 this climatic signature was also reflected in the kga samples indicating evaporative less humid conditions of recharge the d excess values of the samples were generally evident of recharge conditions there were three different behaviors of kga and dfm samples observed fig 10 with respect to d excess such as higher d excess near zero and negative values the higher positive value with depleted δ18o would indicate the recharge in moist conditions and those with negative d excess with enriched δ18o indicating arid conditions it is interesting to note that most of the samples irrespective of the aquifers fell along the d excess value of zero this may lead to the inferences as follows the meteoric water line during the period of study might have had an equation of δd 8 δ18o for this region there was a significant evaporation of the precipitation prior to recharge the samples fell between 6 and 2 δ18o values and it was observed that the dfm had relatively higher values with depleted δ18o compared to kga along the d excess 0 line it may also be due to the variations in sst affecting the isotopic signatures of the evaporating water body the d excess value of zero indicates the process of sub cloud evaporation of rain drops indicating aridity during the time of precipitation and reflecting the prevalence similar conditions from late pleistocene it was also noted that there had been a shift in itcz characterizing the variation in monsoon in terms of space and pattern this shift has resulted in the precipitation of the evaporated vapor near the source and thus it might have also affected the isotopic signatures of δ18o and δd leading to the variations in the d excess it was also witnessed in the present day context that cold winter experienced in the northern hemisphere region could result in the weakening of the intensity of iom in the following summer thus affecting the isotopic signatures and d excess the inference on the paleoclimates from the δ18o and d excess are summarized in table 4 the paleoclimatic variations and their signatures on recharge has thus been reflected in the groundwater of both the aquifers table 5 5 6 shift in itcz the seasonal wind trajectories and the patterns of summer monsoon are mainly governed by the variations in solar radiation resulting from the melting of glaciers at elevated land masses and thereby exposing the land surface therefore it was deduced that the changes in the albedo affected the heat flow of the asian continent and thereby the duration and strength of monsoon over the arabian sea kutzbach and guetter 1986 barnett et al 1989 few studies have reported the paleo monsoonal changes in india and china kutzbach and street perrott 1985 prell and kutzbach 1987 yan and petit maire 1994 studied the paleoclimatic record of iom comparing sahara arabia india tibet and china the ancient trend in the atmospheric circulation was determined as tropospheric easterly jet which has a high pressure 100 300 hpa migrating from north china to north africa having been discerned near the exit south and entry of the monsoon north of the monsoon influencing the isotopic values according to moisture sources and temperature of recharge the asian monsoon revival since mid holocene changes in the spatial timings patterns and their variations after the glaciation periods could not be attributed due to astronomical forcing yan and petit maire 1994 the regional perspective of atmospheric circulation revealed that the change in temperature at greater spatial extent is more prominent than the variation in rainfall zhong wei et al 1994 circulation of atmospheric vapor rising from the equator towards the poles at a height of 10 15 km and descending near the tropics later returning to the equator along the surface is referred to as hadley cell the variation in atmospheric circulation patterns with respect to hadley cell from lgm was studied by dagostino et al 2017 considering the near surface meridional potential temperature the gradient subtropical stability and the tropical tropopause level it was brought out that the change in the temperature levels affect the hadley cell and his model was more appropriate for the northern hemisphere the influence of the sst on the shift of itcz is mainly governed by the cross equatorial temperature gradients shift of itcz was witnessed during mid holocene heinrich 1 and during lgm the freshwater release from the ice sheets to the deep ocean due to the heinrich events affect the salinity and thus the thermo haline circulation mcmanus et al 2004 the thermo haline circulation plays a key role in heat transfer to the north latitude resulting in cooler north atlantic so dry climatic conditions are witnessed in the northern hemisphere due to the southward shift of tropical rain belt deplazes et al 2013 the cross equatorial atmospheric heat transfer studies reveal that the attributed mean shift of itcz 5 to be local and that of 0 1 to be global mcgee et al 2014 this northward shift in global precipitation is also observed in the recent times due to variation in the heat transfer along the equatorial region from southern to northern hemisphere frierson et al 2013 donohoe 2016 ganachaud and wunsch 2003 this change in the sst may also be due to the volcanic events affecting the variation in amount of heat transfer from southern to northern hemisphere the global volcanism program gvp 2013 of smithsonian university records 1426 volcanic events during the holocene period 10ky and 1241 events during the pleistocene 2 6 million years to 10ky most of the volcanic eruptions with higher explosivity index fall along the east and south of the china resulting in the changes of variation in albedo affecting the tropospheric easterly jet few such holocene volcanic events were also recorded north of the peninsula karakhanian et al 2002 hamann et al 2010 and northwestern saudi arabia downs et al 2018 which would have affected the circulation pattern of the vapor source the eruptions results in the cooling of the troposphere and heating of the stratosphere lacis et al 1992 hence a relative cooling is noted in temperature of the region after the event this effect of cooling may last for 3 to 4 years colose et al 2016 thus this large scale impact of the volcanic eruptions on the climate change relates to the shift of itcz the eruptions mainly varied the period and the amount of rainfall which indirectly affected depleted the δ18o signals it is witnessed by the depleted signals of north westerlies during 10 15 ky of dfm fig 6 and in few samples of 5 10 ky in kga the shift in itcz during the mid holocene periods 6ky might have also been resulted due to this process affecting the tropospheric easterly jet from china weaker summer monsoons lesser rainfall and more trade winds in the northern hemisphere were observed during this period similar conditions also prevailed during the heinrich 1 event when the southern hemisphere had warm temperatures than the north shakun et al 2012 gibbons et al 2014 5 7 determination of the recharge zones bowen and wilkinson 2002 developed a method to calculate estimate the δ18o values for modern precipitation later this method was adopted for the records near the ocean 200 m jasechko 2016 adopted this method for a set of late pleistocene and late holocene data to determine the latitude of recharge using δ18o values 2 δ 18 o lh 0 006566 lat 2 0 2897 lat 7 5 3 δ 18 o lp 0 008467 lat 2 0 3828 lat 8 8 both the equations had a regression value of 0 66 and 0 65 respectively subsequently the equations were modified with the inclusion of elevation component as follows 4 δ 18 o lh 0 006566 lat 2 0 2897 lat 3 3 alt 7 5 5 δ 18 o lp 0 008467 lat 2 0 3828 lat 3 8 alt 8 8 the altitude correction for lh includes a value of 3 3 km and that of lp is 3 8 km there are limitations observed for this calculation as follows the calculation was based on assumption that there is no substantial mixing of young and old waters torgersen et al 2013 the seasonal variations of precipitation did not impact much on the δ18o variations with respect to lp and lh and those represented are assumed to be signatures of annual precipitations o 12 dansgaard oeschger events o heinrich events h2 h5 o capture of lgm o dryas period o all these changes are presented as an amalgamated value o it is assumed that there had been no major alterations that took place after the recharge although few such events were reported by cartwright et al 2012 and morrissey et al 2010 the latitude values were calculated based on the relationship for the late pleistocene waters developed by jasechko and taylor 2015 this results showed that most of the kga were recharged between 26on and 26 8on and that of the dammam aquifer was noted to be recharged in two different patches between 25 8on and 26 2on and 26 7on 27 4on appendix 10 since the latitudinal interval of recharge for the kga was very small it could be inferred to be a specific outcrop or along a surface water flow transacting the dammam aquifer as the latitude of recharge for the dammam aquifer is falling in north and south of kga fig 11 further those along the south have a negative d excess reflecting the impact of evaporation or arid conditions during the process of recharge the northernmost vapors were seen to be more depleted with higher d excess fig 9 considering the suitable geographical conditions extending sw from the study area it was found to match with 1 n of the calculated value since the equation derived by jaeschko 2016 is for relating the samples globally this slight latitudinal variation locally could be attributed to the region of recharge the recharge of kga during holocene covers a large area in the southern part extending from 24 5on to 26 5on appendix 11 latitudinal variations was considered and it was inferred that the recharge took place between 25 5on and 27 5on fig 12 and most of the samples showed arid conditions with few samples showing a humid nature the area of recharge was found to be greater than that of the pleistocene time as there was a shift of itcz toward northward and the impact of iom was also noted even up to the central part of the peninsula the humidity optimum was dated in arabian peninsula extending to nefud between 9 and 6 ky donner 1985 schulz and whitney 1986 this was also witnessed by the maximum growth of g ruber during 8 ky bp along the deposits of sapropel between 9 and 8 ky bp reflecting predominance of wet period rossignol strick et al 1982 the enriched δ18o in this may be due to the recharge from the paleo lakes prevailed in between these latitudes 6 conclusion the study has identified two principal sources the depleted northwesterly eastern mediterranean meteoric vapor and the enriched southwestern iom greater amount of rainfall and colder climates have resulted in the depleted isotopic signatures in groundwater during the early holocene and late pleistocene the kga was predominantly recharged during the holocene period signatures of itcz shift and the development of aridity during the late holocene periods were reflected in the groundwater further recharge during holocene has occurred between 25 5on and 27 5on latitudes and it matched with the outcrops of the kga the groundwater of dfm was identified to be recharged predominantly during pleistocene by north westerly source and relatively depleted than kga the groundwater recharged in the aquifer had the imprints of heinrich event bolling allerod events and variations during dryas it was determined to be recharged between 25 8on and 26 2on and 26 7on 27 4on latitudes during late pleistocene both greelandian and northgrippian stages are inferred to be initiated with a period of wetness followed by aridity the shift of itcz was triggered by the holocene volcanism the events with higher explosivity index along the southeast and west of china had influenced the troposhperic easterly jet regionally the extreme rain events sub cloud evaporation process and the colder periods during the late pleistocene and holocene were captured by the d excess values hence isotopes studies in groundwater at par with other techniques could serve as a significant tool in studying the paleoclimates even though there are few constraints further addition of more groundwater isotope data in the arabian peninsula and the integrated studies on paleo drainage system through remote sensing techniques will help to attain a more vivid picture on the paleoclimate and the recharge scenarios credit authorship contribution statement chidambaram sabarathinam writing original draft software funding

5364,the study attempts to determine paleo recharge sources for two major aquifer units of kuwait namely kuwait group aquifer kga and dammam formation dfm were collected and analyzed for major ions and isotopes the obtained results of 14c ages indicated that the groundwater samples ranged from 31 9 ky to 3 9 ky in dfm and 23 3 ky to 0 8 ky in kga the variations in δ18o signatures with respect to age reflected that there were two major sources of rainwater such as enriched southern indian ocean monsoon and the depleted northwesterly mediterranean vapor source the samples found to show variations during the three marine isotopic stages mis 1 3 heinrich events bolling allerod and dryas time periods in both aquifers a shift in the intertropical convergence zone itcz was witnessed in the groundwater of both aquifers from 7 8 ky to 4 9 ky the variation in the holocene climate is mainly due to the influence of tropospheric easterly jet governed by the swing in itcz as a result of holocene volcanism the mean δ18o values of dfm samples 3 81 reflect depletion than kga samples 2 31 and the d excess values were 0 95 and 2 05 respectively thus it could be inferred that the dfm was predominantly recharged during late pleistocene period and it was in a relatively cooler climate than recharge environment of kga the study infers that kga was recharged between 26on and 26 8on latitudes and that of the dfm was noted to be recharged south west of kuwait in two different patches between 25 8on and 26 2on and 26 7on 27 4on latitudes during late pleistocene the kga was concluded to be recharged between 25 5on and 27 5on latitudes south of kuwait during holocene keywords groundwater paleoclimate isotopes itcz recharge moisture source 1 introduction shallow and deep groundwaters are recharged by either precipitation or surface water sources the interpretation of the paleoclimate is generally derived from the inversion models based on transfer functions and on current climatic conditions these approaches help in developing paleo temperatures and rainfall regimes hatté and schwartz 2003 several proxies ranging from thousand hundred years have been used to develop a long term record on climate change this has led to look into insights on the past climatic trends by adopting various proxies like ice cores sediments microfossils tree rings groundwater etc macrofossil assemblages like beetles mollusks and midge larvae serve as the basis of major paleoclimate studies hatté and schwartz 2003 the models thus developed require input from a variety of sources similarly another paleo thermometer record was inferred to be the width of tree rings yadav and singh 2002 the information about paleo temperature and ancient precipitation were derived from δ18o and δ13c values for cellulose cook et al 1998 speleotherm carbonates also provide information on paleoclimate and water cycle dorale 1998 the detail studies on ice cores provided information on glacial levels land surface and seas surface temperatures variations in albedo and shifts in monsoon trends etc clemens et al 1991 the study on the pleistocene holocene time was attempted by various authors adopting different approaches like studies on paleosols gravels and alluvial fans spleotherms lake sediments etc fleitmann et al 2007 lézine et al 2017 parker et al 2006a 2006b schulz and whitney 1986 the extreme arid conditions of arabia were reflected by studying the aeolian sand and also from the calcite formed due to hypersaline springs found in fractures clark and fontes 1990 studies on the soil zones with petrogypsic nature also revealed the arid climatic conditions in the arabian region rose 2006 similarly the dispersion of biota with respect to the time scale in the arabian peninsula was studied to understand the climate change during the holocene period parker 2009 petraglia and alsharekh 2003 rose 2006 a study on the pollen marine organism and spores in the soil samples collected from the karbala region of mesopotamian plain ali 2013 addressed the paleo climatic conditions in the holocene period the paleoclimate condition of nw china was studied for the late pleistocene lp by using stable and radioactive isotopes in groundwater along with the hydrochemical data li et al 2015 jiang et al 2019 túri et al 2019 the study indicated that the holocene climate was warmer and that of lp had cooler climate during recharge the results were derived mainly by analyzing the value of d excess δ18o and δd of groundwater along with 14c climatic change during the late quaternary has been inferred from the isotopic composition of groundwater in various places all over the world in africa fontes et al 1991 edmunds et al 1999 bakari et al 2012 north america stute et al 1992 dutton 1995 castro and goblet 2003 hough et al 2014 asia sukhija et al 1998 saravana kumar et al 2008 zhao et al 2018 australia love et al 1994 and europe rozanski 1985 darling et al 1997 walraevens 1998 eiler 2011 ettayfi et al 2012 but so far no investigation has been carried out in this part of the peninsula the isotopic investigations carried out so far in kuwait have been related either to understanding its groundwater flow processes hadi et al 2016 saravana kumar 2013 or deciphering contamination sources akber et al 2006 the flow velocity of groundwater was determined in kuwait by using carbon isotopes bhandary et al 2015 and the isotope systematics of the kuwait region was studied by various authors hadi et al 2016 hadi and al ruwaih 2008 al senafy et al 2012 wakida and lerner 2005 bhandari et al 2012 the kuwait meteoric water line was also earlier attempted by the authors hadi et al 2016 to compare with the groundwater isotopes ebrahim and siwek 1993 carried out a study on groundwater quality variation at selected sites in kuwait to evaluate the quality of groundwater in the freshwater fields of raudhatain and umm al aish and in the farming areas of al abdally and al wafra the 14c data suggested an age range of 700 3450 years with total dissolved solids tds in the range of 950 2400 mg l the tritium content was measured in the samples and it was inferred that the samples were relatively recent 1952 and after recharge in this area 14c age of the water samples occurring in the lower parts of the kga ranged from 7600 to 10000 years another recent study was conducted at kisr to characterize the groundwater age flow direction flow velocity and recharge area of the kuwait groundwaters using carbon isotopes this study identified that 14c corrected ages ranged from recent to 25 000 years before present the 14c isochrones of the groundwater samples indicated that the general groundwater direction is toward the northeast saravana kumar 2013 hadi et al 2016 carried out a detailed environmental isotopic δd δ18o δ 13c 3h 14c study on the southern kuwait groundwater the authors deduced that the groundwater of kga and dfm were recharged by different sources in different time periods they also inferred that the deeper groundwater of kga was recharged during warm periods while that of dfm formation during the colder humid periods the results were derived based on δ18o δd and d excess the age of kga groundwater was determined by 14c and it ranged from 24 to 5 thousand years ky the aquifers may be regional or trans boundary in nature few regional groundwater systems extending beyond the borders of the middle east and north african mena region referred as shared aquifers are listed in table 1 most of the groundwater systems listed are mainly recharged during the late pleistocene holocene lp h period hence a detailed investigation on the recharge environment and the spatial extent is essential for the management of the resource understanding past climatic conditions becomes a priority to examine the interrelationship between a groundwater system and its atmosphere ocean any variation in the regime and quantity of precipitation together with variations in temperature and evapotranspiration not only affects groundwater recharge but also its quality therefore an understanding of the paleoclimatic conditions at the time of recharge and their control on the hydrology of any groundwater system like that of kuwait s complex and coastal multi aquifer system is essential for constructing its hydrogeological model for sustainable management of the water resources in addition information in the paleoclimate conditions would serve as an extensive base for the calibration of the global climate models and thus would help in the prediction of future climate scenarios this could form a very significant baseline for the future management of the reserve and could play a key role in integrated water resource management this study is attempted to address the sources of recharge interconnection between water bodies in the aquifers with respect to various meteoric waters and its relation to late pleistocene holocene lp h periods 2 study area kuwait is located in the northwestern part of the arabian region extending between 28 30on 30 30on and 46 3oe 48 3oe fig 1 spatially covering an extent of about 18 000 km2 it is bounded in the south by saudi arabia and in the north and west by iraq the country has a highest elevation in the southwest 270 m with a gentle slope toward the north east fig 1 the topography shows undulations filled with gravel and sandy mostly due to the aeolian process in general it is an arid desert with low relief and less geomorphic features among the features the significant ones are the ahmadi ridge jal az zour escarpment wara hill and wadi al batin the western boundary of the country is represented by the valley of wadi al batin extending for 8 11 km the ahmadi ridge extends north to south n s and located along the southeast se region of the country running parallel to the coast with an elevation of 13 m above mean sea level amsl the escarpment extends southwest northeast sw ne located the north of bay for about 60 km with an altitude of 145 m amsl al sulaimi and al ruwaih 2005 the country has limited water resources with cold winter and dry hot summer with an average annual precipitation of 110 120 mm predominantly during the period from october to may it has been observed that the annual evaporation rates are higher and it may vary from 2500 mm to 4500 mm in the coastal region and along the inland respectively this scenario of extensive evaporation rate with scarce rainfall and lesser rain events has resulted in the dry sandy top soil there is an acute shortage of freshwater resources and hence the brackish groundwater forms the chiefly dependent natural source of water alhumoud 2008 barth and steinkohl 2004 reported two main weather regimes in the peninsula appendix 3 namely north westerlies from the atlantic during winter flows eastwards to the arabian gulf to the mediterranean sea resulting in light rain events and gentle cool winds and summer wind occurs due to indian ocean monsoon iom resulting in heavy rainfall along the southern part of the arabian peninsula glennie et al 2002 these two processes governing the rainfall patterns of the peninsula persisted during the pleistocene holocene time periods muzuka 2000 fleitmann et al 2007 the records of these climatic conditions were found to be preserved in the sediments of the arabian sea indian ocean and the gulf of oman geological fence diagram for the central part of kuwait is presented in fig 2 various gradations of gravel sand silt and clay material can be observed in a discontinuous fashion in the kga of the study area clay represents the base of kga and it is discontinuous it covers n ne and n nw parts completely and partially in e ne and e se parts the clay base is absent in the southern part of the study area massive and porous limestone represents dfm aquifer it can be observed that the thickness of dfm aquifer increases from south to north in the study area the porous limestone appears intercalated with massive limestones of the dfm 2 1 hydrogeology the country is mainly dependent on two main aquifers for groundwater resources largely brackish in nature the kga are formed after the eocene period and composed of consolidated deposits with clastic consolidates to unconsolidated sediments the kuwait group contains two aquifers the dibdibbah formations in the north and the ghar formation in the central and southern areas the kga is completely saturated with water along the coast and completely dry in the southwest edge of kuwait and at the ahmadi ridge the water level in kga varies from about 90 m above mean sea level in the southwest to zero along the coast the thickness of the kuwait group increases from 150 m in the southwestern parts of kuwait to 400 m northeast the total transmissivity of the kga increases from the southwest 10 m2 d 1 and less to the northeast 1500 m2 d 1 and more with the increase in saturated thickness in this direction from 0 to 400 m the dibdibbah formation that overlies the ghar and the lower fars formations in the northeastern parts of kuwait to the northwest of kuwait bay forms the uppermost aquifer of the kuwait group a shaley unit separates the aquifer from the underlying main kga the aquifer is unconfined within the confines of kuwait the transmissivity of the aquifer increases from about 10 m2 d 1 in the areas adjacent to kuwait bay to 150 200 m2 d 1 in the northeastern corner of the country the next dependent aquifer is the dfm formed during eocene in a marine environment the dfm exists in confined condition and the kga is unconfined appendix 2 mukhopadhyay et al 1994 mukhopadhyay 1995 mukhopadhyay et al 1996 a major unconformity separates the dfm which is deposited in a marine environment from kuwait group sediments that are deposited in a continental environment the thickness of the dfm varies from about 150 m in the southwest to 280 m in the northeast the piezometric level in the dfm varies from 90 m in the southwest to only a few meters above mean sea level near the coast abusada 1988 because of its karstic nature the transmissivity in the dfm is variable especially in the southern and southwestern parts of kuwait but it shows a generally decreasing trend towards the north and east al sulaimi and mukhopadhyay 2000 in spite of the local presence of clay lenses that may act as aquitards and the variation in the degree of karstification within the dfm that affects the vertical hydraulic conductivity the two aquifers are hydraulically connected under natural undisturbed conditions there is an upward hydraulic gradient from the dfm to the kga senay et al 1987 the regional groundwater flow was reported to be from the southwest to the northeast direction and it was inferred to discharge water along the gulf al sulaimi and el rabaa 1994 mukhopadhyay et al 1994 these aquifers are trans boundary and extend to saudi arabia and iraq the precipitation in kuwait is insufficient to recharge the aquifers mukhopadhyay et al 1994 and it was implied that the rainfall in the adjacent countries helped to recharge the aquifers the lateral underground flow from saudi arabia is the main source for recharge appendix 3 precipitation is a minor recharge source in the depression of northern kuwait where limited freshwater lenses occur in the upper part of the kuwait group especially in the raudhatain umm al aish and abdally areas kga 3 methodology the study focuses on the interpretation from isotopes and hence the samples were observed for δ18o δd d excess major ions δ 13c and selected samples for 14c to understand the recharge environment and ages of groundwater 14c values provide information of groundwater ages recharged between 50 ky and 100 years the samples from both the major aquifers were considered 58 samples representing kga and 55 from dfm fig 3 14c ages for accessible 35 samples of kga and 27 of dfm were obtained details are presented in the appendices 4 and 5 the kga samples were spatially distributed throughout kuwait the dfm samples were concentrated predominantly in the central part of kuwait extending east west where the distribution of samples were considered according to the availability of wells for sampling the wells were purged using a submersible pump before the collection of samples during well purging temperature ph ec do and orp of groundwater were measured at appropriate intervals a flow through cell having attached ph ec do and orp provides an airtight setup to measure temperature ph ec do and orp of groundwater being purged without having contact with atmosphere samples to be used for analyses of major cations major anions toc and 222rn

examination of water and wastewater apha 2012 were followed for the analyses of major cations major anions and toc the collected samples were filtered and analyzed for electrical conductivity ec and ph the total dissolved solids tds by evaporation method major cations and anions using ion chromatograph a radon in air monitor rad7 was used to measure radon activity coupled with a specially manufactured closed loop aeration system that strips free radon from the water el taher 2012 the samples were analyzed for stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen using laser spectroscopic analyzer with a precision 0 3 forδ18o 3 0 forδ 2h stable carbon isotope was measured using isotope ratio mass spectrometer and 14c content was determined by accelerated mass spectrometry ams with a precision of 3 samples were analysed for δ18o δd δ 13c and 14c in international atomic energy agency and biofocus lab germany 14c age calcualtions were made by using two methods pearson and hanshaw 1970 and fontes and garnier 1979 the age derived from the fontes and garnier 1979 method was adopted for the study 4 results the maximum minimum and average values of the different chemical parameters are listed in table 2 the δ18o of the kga varied from 5 7 to 1 3 with an average of 2 31 and that of dfm ranging from 1 5 to 6 8 with an average 3 81 similarly the δd of the kga varied from 43 75 to 6 1 with an average of 19 37 and that of dfm varying from 2 3 to 38 66 with an average of 28 45 it is also interesting to note that the d excess of the kga had an average of 0 95 and that of dfm being 2 05 most of the kga samples were younger 802 years 23391 years than the dfm 3942 years 31916 years 4 1 age of samples and distribution the ages of the kga groundwater samples ranged from 802 to 23391 years and they were classified into four groups as follows 1 3 ky 2 3 ky to 6 ky 3 6 ky to11 2 ky and 4 11 2 ky among the 35 samples considered for 14c ages 4 6 10 and 15 samples respectively fig 4 represented these groups most of the kga samples ranged from 6 ky to 23 3 ky the distribution of samples showed that most of the older samples are represented along the sw to ne region across the bay it is predominantly bordered by the younger water ranging from 6 ky to 11 ky the younger groundwater of kga was chiefly observed along the southern part of kuwait especially in the coastal region the youngest water is located in the raudhatain field in the north the samples of dfm were categorized into 5 different classes as follows 1 5 ky 2 5 10 ky 3 10 1 5ky 4 15 20 ky and 5 20 ky the representation of samples showed that 2 2 4 7 and 12 were observed in these classes respectively fig 5 among the 27 samples considered for 14c ages it is to be noted that most of the samples of dfm formation were 15 ky the older waters are distributed from inland to coast and the younger ones are scattered inland structurally kuwait has five major lineaments two extending from ne sw jal al liyah lineament and wadi al musannat jal azor lineament and two along nne and ssw wadi al batin and kuwait arch lineamant apart from these major structures strike slip faults were observed near the burgan oil filed three synclinal structures were observed in the central part of kuwait between ne sw lineaments umm al aish rabiyah and ash shiqq an intersection of western kuwait arch lineament and wadi jal azor lineament is noticed along the southern part of kuwait bay the structural studies by carman 1996 have also reported intersection of minor structures along the northern and southern part of the bay these intersection of structures might have facilitated the movement of older groundwater towards the bay from deeper horizons the process of groundwater extraction along the coastal region have led to the migration of saline water into the coastal aquifer indicating the signatures of recent groundwater along the shore a problem of water logging due to increase in shallow groundwater table leading to the rise older groundwater from deeper horizons to the shallow depths in the urban regions was reported by hamdan and mukhopadhyay 1991 and mukhopadhyay et al 2006 hence erratic distribution of younger waters against the older waters may be due to the influence of geological structure sea water intrusion or due to the variation in the depth of sampling 4 2 stable isotope the correlation between the stable isotopes of δ18o and δd in freshwater was attempted by craig 1961 on a universal scale the analyzed isotope values are always expressed in delta δ δ r sample r vsmow r vsmow 10 3 where r indicates the heavier to lighter ratio of hydrogen or oxygen isotopes the above craig s study has demarcated a definite relationship between these two isotopes and derived a universal line referred as global meteoric water line gmwl craig s derivation showed the relation between both the isotopes as follows 1 δ d 8 δ 18 o 10 this relationship has led to a method of interpolating rainwater as it follows a systematic pattern the derived trend of the meteoric line reflects a universal or global nature of precipitation but the trend of a local meteoric line lmwl varies depending upon the climate land use pattern vapor sources and other geographical parameters although the lmwl helps in the identification of the recent recharge pattern it differs from the regression values and the d excess value of gmwl in the absence of lmwl gmwl is used as it helps in the interpretation of the provenance of recharge in this direction craig observed a significant fact that the colder climate areas are associated with depleted isotopes and vice versa in the warmer climatic condition the lmwl of the nearby regions are provided in table 3 5 discussion a shift in the position below the lmwl gmwl was generally noted for few rainwater samples and most of the groundwater samples in δ18o δd plot due to the process of evaporation the reverse scenario of a sample representation above the lmwl is rare and this situation is expected due to re evaporation and precipitation of local surface water body and the prevalence of less humidity such samples have high d excess it was also reported that if the condensation were to prevail before the mixing of these secondary vapor sources with the tropospheric masses the isotopic signatures of these samples would be expected to fall well above the lmwl clark and fritz 1997 rozanski et al 1992 simpkins 1995 as discussed earlier lmwl plots were close to gmwl with minor variation in slope such variations could have been due to local changes in different parameters like climate temperature source of moisture rainfall season and secondary evaporation 5 1 δ18o and δd relationship there are several factors affecting the isotopic values of the precipitations air temperature amount of precipitation and air mass history rozanski et al 1992 gat 1996 dansgaard 1964 tan 2009 2013 the effect also depends on the source moisture isotope values of δ18o and δd along with 14c ages have helped in reconstructing the paleoclimates yang et al 2016 apart from the source moisture other global parameters like sea surface temperature sst relative humidity and vertical shear index vuille et al 2005 yang et al 2016 distillation during the process of transportation of vapor liu et al 2014 etc also affect the isotope signatures the average isotopic signatures of rainfall derived from the pacific ocean moisture is 2 5 lesser than the iom the δ18o and δd values of all the groundwater samples were plotted to determine the relationship with the various meteoric water lines eastern mediterranean meteoric water line emmwl north oman meteoric water line nomwl global meteoric water line gmwl and kuwait meteoric water line kmwl appendix 9 the plot shows that few samples of dfm formation fall along the emmwl nomwl and kmwl most of the samples fall parallel to gmwl although the samples from both the aquifers showed enrichment dfm was comparatively depleted and few samples indicated mediterranean vapor sources a more detailed inference was made by implying that the δ18o δd relation existed with respect to the age of the samples different marine isotope stages mis were inferred for lp h periods extending from 60 ky to present about three different stages inferred as mis 3 mis 2 and mis 1 lisiecki and raymo 2005 considered to represent the lp h periods 5 2 groundwater age and lmwl irrespective of the aquifer the older groundwater samples 20 ky were observed to be depleted without much fluctuation in isotopic values and that the samples fell parallel to gmwl the samples of this period represented mis 2 14 29 ky and 3 29 57ky stages which had a variation in monsoon intensity fluctuation in aridity to include the heinrich events h2 h5 schulz et al 1998 the ice cores have recorded six significant discharges of sediment and rock debris from north american ice sheets to north atlantic ocean through series of events and this time period is referred as heinrich events four samples of dfm represented mis 3 stage and it is worth noting that the samples were relatively enriched than the samples falling between 25 and 30 ky fig 6 series of arid phases observed during this period were indicated by h4 to h6 events which might be attributed to the enrichment it was also inferred from the marine cores that the aridity was intensified in mis 3 after 33 ky bp before present ivanova et al 2003 and since all the samples of this interval were seen to fall between 30 and 33 ky bp it indicated enrichment the study also revealed that groundwater served as a source for the interdunal lakes apart from rainfall which has led to the long time persistence of these lakes even in arid conditions thus resulting to the capture of evaporative enriched isotope signatures for samples 30 ky the period 25 20 ky bp was noted with colder conditions with periods of wetness series of lakes were observed in north arabia during 25 21 ky bp and subsequently it was followed by aridity abboud 2000 abed et al 2008 concurrently during this period lakes were also reported in jafar basin huckriede and wiesemann 1968 in lake hasa jordan schuldenrein and clark 1994 wet conditions were also observed in the southern part of the peninsula in rub al khali region mcclure 1976 1984 and mud fan depression mcclure and swain 1974 nearly 1000 ephemeral water bodies were observed near the rub al khali region even up to a depth of 10 m spread along the ew direction wetness was detected predominantly from 46 to 23 ky bp and dune accumulation was not observed lancaster and tchakerian 2003 glennie et al 2002 clark and fontes 1990 reported c3 vegetation and identified hyper alkaline spring calcite deposits c3 vegetation are generally observed in wet regions or during cold season with lesser optimum temperature for photosynthesis the prominent wetness and cold climatic conditions resulted in the depleted isotopic signatures during this period in both the aquifers large amount of rainfall during this period could have also influenced the depletion of the isotopic values hence its deduced from the above observation that the period from 20 to 25 ky was predominantly cooler however during 15 20 ky bp enrichment was observed in both the aquifers in similar pattern fig 6 this may be due to the influence of increased aridity and frequent dust storms prevailing during this period the early stage of mis 2 corresponded to the terminal pleistocene and represented by an increased period of aridity and the initiation of dune formation the predominance of aeolian process was seen between 20 and 15 ky bp during the last glacial maxima lgm and in the late glacial periods parker and goudie 2007 goudie 2009 gardner 1988 preusser 2002 the impact of the process was reflected in the samples of this period reduction of moisture and increase of aridity were detected during 19 ky bp clark and fontes 1990 it was also noted that the northwesterly trajectory was predominant during this period rad et al 1999 it is also interesting to observe that samples of both the aquifers behaved similarly during this period the samples of dfm were observed parallel to emmwl during 10 15 ky bp indicating that the moisture source may be from the northwest which is relatively more depleted than the southwest indian ocean monsoon iom nonetheless the kga samples recharged during the same period were observed to be more enriched as they were inferred to have recharged from a different source iom predominantly this set of kga samples fell parallel to the gmwl fig 6 a brief phase of wetness witnessed from 15 to 13 ky bp was also noted and this corresponds to bolling allerod ba interstadial this period was slightly warmer and represented by mass wasting of lgm sheets in northern hemisphere leuschner and sirocko 2003 the time period from 14 5 ky to 11 5 ky is a transition period represented by fluctuation from glacial to inter glacial conditions in the northern hemisphere and referred as dryas there had been series of warmer and colder events during this period concurrently the initiation of younger dryas was represented in the northern and central part of the arabian peninsula 13 5 ky bp this period was characterized by shammal winds flowing from nw peaking at 11 5 ky bp which is observed from the isotopic signature of dfm formation the monsoonal activity was lesser during this period and northward shift of the iom was not observed until 9 2 ky bp parker et al 2004 the samples representing 10 5 ky fig 6 in both the aquifers showed wide variation in isotopic values ranging from enrichment to depletion reflecting a drastic variation in climatic condition humid to arid it was also detected that the variation of δ18o was greater than δd as there were reports of more rainy and dry conditions during this period with different intensities the late pleistocene resulted in the termination of hyperarid condition and the onset of humidity with a wet phase during the initial stages of holocene until 5 ky bp wilkinson 1997 stokes and bray 2005 parker et al 2006a the monsoonal rainfall has resulted in the intensive rainfall along the central and eastern part of arabia during the early holocene the initiations of wet conditions were witnessed earlier in the southern part of the peninsula compared to the central and the northern parts davies 2006 parker et al 2006a the onset of wet condition during this period is due to the northward migration of inter tropical convergence zone itcz as a result of warmer conditions in the northern hemisphere demenocal et al 2000 this process of shift in itcz was witnessed in the stalactite deposit of oman fleitmann et al 2007 neff et al 2001 from south to north during 10 3 to 9 6 ky bp as a result of iom advancement represented by the depleted isotope signatures in both aquifers although the cessation of dune migration was observed by goudie et al 2000 the first lake deposit at this stage was observed only during 8 5 ky bp parker et al 2004 reflecting the fact that it has taken about 1 8 ky bp for the migration of iom from 15on to 25on in the arabian peninsula this early stage was witnessed with c3 plants and a profound distribution of moisture in the peninsula the groundwater resulting from the recharge of evaporative water bodies like lakes surface water bodies during this period has resulted in the enriched values arnoux et al 2017 huang et al 2020 thus a vast variation in the δ18o values was noted during this period moreover from 5 to 6 ky bp the retreat of itcz was initiated resulting in the slightly warmer conditions with lesser rain events later samples 5 ky bp fig 6 showed steep enrichment in isotopes of both the aquifers however during this period the variation of δd was prominent than δ18o falling parallel to gmwl reflecting hyper arid conditions neff et al 2001 and uerpmann 2002 inferred that the southward retreat of itcz resulting in the lack of rain events led to the development of arid to hyper arid condition the existence of lakes in rub al khali started to perish however the lives of the lakes were extended even after the retreat of the itcz due to the influence of westerlies reflecting the variations in the isotopic values of the samples cuthbert et al 2019 a wide range of δ18o variation was detected in the samples of kga than dfm which may be due to the evaporation prior to recharge and the variation in moisture sources during 5 ky to 3 ky bp 5 3 comparison to other pleistocene holocene p h waters the stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen were studied from the perspective of relating to p h groundwaters in portugal de melo et al 2001 new mexico phillips et al 1986 egypt sultan et al 1997 north and central united states siegel 1991 libya edmunds and wright 1979 columbia brown et al 2010 hungary stute and deak 1989 china zongyu et al 2003 australia jacobson et al 1989 and british isles elliot et al 1999 fig 7 the values of δ18o and δd of the p h groundwaters from various parts of the world were plotted along with the samples of the study area though the groundwater samples represent different geographical locations and different climatic conditions there existed a linear relationship between these values the enriched samples of the region also reveals the fact that peninsula experienced less humid conditions since lp the holocene samples along with those of the present study showed a relationship of δd 7 96 δ18o 9 8 and that of pleistocene showed δd 6 5 δ18o 7 4 the groundwater samples of the study area were discerned to fall above these samples indicating enrichment irrespective of the aquifer fig 7 the dfm formation samples were spotted to be relatively more depleted than the kga samples further these samples were recharged between the late p h hence the slope may vary between the earlier inferred relationship of p h resulting in an intercept between 7 4 and 9 8 5 4 variation of δ18o with respect to age the relationship of δ18o in the samples of kga and dfm formation was studied with respect to ages fig 8 the relationship of δ18o with respect to the 14c ages showed that the samples of both the aquifers were distributed throughout the ages but most of the dfm samples were distributed between 15 and 35 ky bp and that of kga mostly at 17 ky bp it was seen that dfm samples were predominntly depleted irrespective of age few enriched kga samples were noted from 4 to 2 ky and 9 ky bp the enrichment may be due to difference in recharge conditions the difference in sea surface temperature was developed for past 68 ky from the sediment cores using δ18o of seawater govil and naidu 2010 the last glacial maximum was observed to be 4 c cooler than the current conditions and it was reflected by the depleted δ18o signatures in the samples of dfm formation during this period the monsoon derived precipitations were deduced to be higher during mis 3 0 3 to 1 0 and mis1 1 08 to 2 and lesser during mis2 1 and 4 0 9 to 1 4 isotopes of the present study also showed similar trend except for those recorded during the extreme events comparing the climatic stages derived from mis beyond last glacial maxima lgm dfm samples were seen to be more depleted fig 8 there was enrichment of δ18o in the samples seen from 15 to 20 ky bp indicating the decrease in moisture and increase in arid conditions it was also reported that the mis 2 temperature varied from 24 5 to 27 c and two abrupt warmer periods were observed during 19 ky and one during 17 ky bp referred to as arabian sea warmer events saher et al 2007 it was attributed mainly to the upwelling intensity and due to the increased sst relatively depletion in δ18o of both the aquifers was observed from 15 ky to 10 ky bp during bolling and allerod ba late glacial and during the dryas period due to the increase of moisture conditions with lesser influence of iom similar variations were also noted in δ18o values of globigerinoides ruber collected near the oman and south arabian peninsula sirocko et al 1993 the study reported variations from 0 to 1 7 from 20 ky to the present and sharp variations were also noted during 13 5 ky 13 06 ky and 9 9 ky bp these variations could be attributed to the fluctuations in the precipitation or evaporation patterns increased inflow of lighter or freshwater in the gulf influencing growth of g ruber this scenario reflected increased rain events and humid nature responsible for the depleted values of the samples in these aquifers the influence of nw moisture source was witnessed during this period in dfm formation and not in kga fig 8 the δ18o around 13 ky bp represented a glacial and holocene transition the early holocene humid interval was reported during 9 9 to 8 6 ky bp during the end of dryas there was an increase in temperature recorded reflecting aridity and lesser humid conditions resulting in the increase of δ18o values from 11 ky to 8 9 ky bp in the samples which was more prominent in kga samples fig 8 the northern part of the arabian region had witnessed increased arid conditions during the pre boreal and during the end of younger dryas rad et al 1999 the samples of dammam formation during 10 5 ky bp showed more depletion than that of the kga due to the difference in the recharge sources as inferred from earlier observations subsequently during the shift of itcz there had been increase in rainfall from 8 5 to 5 ky bp seen in the depleted δ18o values this period was noted with pronounced wet conditions due to strong influence of iom monsoon with more humidity the drainage flowing toward north drained the arabian inland and extended even to the arabian gulf parker 2009 studies showed the existence of holocene lakes at rub al khali desert bordered by the dune sand formed during the early holocene younger dryas and late glacial periods goudie et al 2000 the persistence of low temperatures was seen during 8 5 to 6 ky bp by the presence of c3 plants and followed by arid phase during 6 to 4 ky bp represented by c4 plants the c4 vegetation are generally found in dry areas or warm climates this time period was reported with maximum amount rainfall verman 2002 reflecting the depletion in δ18o of the groundwater samples of both the aquifers around 7 8ky maximum rainfall during the holocene period was represented by an increase of about 100 to 400 mm yr in the arabian region was recorded sanlaville 1992 the studies by kutzbach 1981 and sarnthein 1972 revealed that the northward shift of iom intensified the rain events and the seasonal influences observed in the arabian inland and in the bubiyan island located in the gulf it was also gathered that the rainfall increased about 50 than the current scenario several studies have recorded the variation in climate during different stages of pleistocene holocene p h witnessed from paleo productivity of microfossils in the arabian sea due to the variation in the intensity of iom and thus δ18o signatures a 1000 km northward shift of itcz was observed in north africa sanlaville 1992 the δ18o values for samples 5 ky bp showed an enrichment fig 8 reflecting a warmer period with lesser amount of rainfall shift of itcz beyond 5 9 bp resulted in the retrieval of iom neff et al 2001 resulting in the reduction of rainfall the shift of monsoonal conditions led to cessation of lakes around rub al khali mcclure 1976 the period was reported to be dry with aridity of higher intensity desiccation of lakes and subsequently the lakes were filled with sands parker et al 2004 resulting in the development of c4 plants bray and stokes 2004 the condition was also witnessed by the influence of dolomite flux beyond 5 ky bp reflecting the retreat of itcz southwards thereby strengthening the north westerlies this variability in climate was also found to be recorded in g ruber studies there were also depleted δ18o values noted reflecting the incidences of wetter periods 5 2 ky bp coinciding with the bronze age potts 1990 subsequent enrichment was due to intense aridity reported from 4 2 to 4 1 ky bp arz et al 2006 there was another period with depleted δ18o values when rivers of tigris and euphrates were sources of settlements from 4 3 to 4 2 ky bp with development of rainfed agriculture in the northern part of the peninsula kuzucuoglu and marro 2007 which may correspond to the initiation of the meghalayan stage the decrease of rain event and cessation of lakes resulted in the recharge of the evaporated surface water the process has shown the increase in δ18o values in kga severe conditions of aridity were observed around 3 3 5 ky bp in arabia china and india potts 1990 fedele 1990 the enrichment of δ18o was observed due to the increase of sst in the arabian sea from 3 5 ky to recent it is interesting to note that there has been a period of depleted δ18o value around 1 5 ky bp although the iom has retreated during 5 ky bp the extreme events of moisture sources from nw could have resulted in the depletion during this period in general there was an enrichment of isotopic values of δ18o during the holocene compared to the pleistocene thus it is deduced that cooler humid climate prevailed during pleistocene the observations on the holocene δ18o values of the samples show that each stage greelandian northgrippian has been initiated with a period of wetness followed by aridity 5 5 deuterium excess d excess the d excess is governed by the kinetic fractionation of the source vapor lesser value indicates the impact of evaporation and higher value reflects the signature of moisture recycling gat and matsui 1991 gat et al 1994 machavaram and krishnamurthy 1995 gat 2000 bhattacharya et al 2003 dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1982 kondoh and shimada 1997 this value of excess was determined by craig 1961 by analyzing the stable isotopes in the rainwater samples throughout the world and it is determined by the following d e x c e s s δ d 8 δ 18 o the primary precipitation has a d excess value ranging from 8 to 10 but these values may vary depending on the rate of evaporation and humidity gat and carmi 1970 the d excess values would depend on the source composition air temperature moisture and isotopic signatures of source vapor trinidad et al 2017 higher variation in d excess in groundwater is generally due to two major probabilities fynn et al 2016 as follows variation in the recharge sources fluctuations in the thickness of the vadose zone and their spatial variation relative proportion of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes are expressed through d excess values in water the variations from the global meteoric line d 10 could help in understating the process proceeding to recharge or recharge condition fig 9 the atmospheric polar circulation or the general circulation models have made use of this parameter to study the climate change petit et al 1991 hoffmann et al 2000 although there are several uncertainties in the determination of d excess as it depends on the analytical values of δd and δ18o it forms an integral component in addressing the issues related to paleoclimates the parameters apart from the paleoclimate significance could help in determining the history of modern day precipitation trajectory evaporation mixing source vapor etc lesser value 10 of d excess generally signifies the evaporation influencing rainwater further during the process of recharge it leaves its imprint on this groundwater gat and carmi 1970 alternately a vapor mass created by the process of significant secondary evaporation from the local surface water bodies can result in a higher value of d excess if the process progresses in a low humid environment subsequently the process of re condensation of this vapor after a proportional mixing with atmospheric flux will result in high d excess precipitation clark and fritz 1997 the process of evaporation is generally noted in rainwater prior to groundwater recharge tirumalesh et al 2017 during the process of d excess interpretation harvey et al 2005 revealed that the d excess value of 3 has to be used with precaution to understand the source in general there is a negative relationship between d excess and δ18o this value is a measure of evaporation and its relation to the physicochemical parameters helps to reveal the history of the recharge process the decrease of d excess revealed the increase of evaporation tsujimura et al 2001 hadi et al 2016 also inferred that the d excess represents a mixture of groundwaters with various origin and history the decrease of d excess reflects the decrease in humidity and increase of arid conditions most of the samples irrespective of the aquifer had d excess fluctuating around zero value right through the ages except for the period of extreme climate changes the d excess showed conditions similar to the present day during 23 ky with more increase in humidity during ba interstadial and in holocene during the shift in itcz further negative d excess indicated the arid conditions with more evaporations during 15 20 ky bp 8 3 9 ky bp and 3 ky bp fig 9 wasson et al 1983 1984 recorded a deglaciation around 12 8 ky bp continued by a short period of aridity from 11 7 to 10 ky bp which was also witnessed by the increase in salinity almogi labin et al 1991 it is inferred that till lgm the d excess was predominantly positive and from lgm to present there has been a significant representation of negative values reflecting frequent periods of aridity hence the dfm samples recharged before lgm and during ba were inferred to be during the moist humid conditions this recharge might have been probably from nw different vapor source as inferred from the earlier discussions on δ18o and on the comparison with emmwl the samples of 15 20 ky bp were inferred to be recharged during arid conditions fig 9 this climatic signature was also reflected in the kga samples indicating evaporative less humid conditions of recharge the d excess values of the samples were generally evident of recharge conditions there were three different behaviors of kga and dfm samples observed fig 10 with respect to d excess such as higher d excess near zero and negative values the higher positive value with depleted δ18o would indicate the recharge in moist conditions and those with negative d excess with enriched δ18o indicating arid conditions it is interesting to note that most of the samples irrespective of the aquifers fell along the d excess value of zero this may lead to the inferences as follows the meteoric water line during the period of study might have had an equation of δd 8 δ18o for this region there was a significant evaporation of the precipitation prior to recharge the samples fell between 6 and 2 δ18o values and it was observed that the dfm had relatively higher values with depleted δ18o compared to kga along the d excess 0 line it may also be due to the variations in sst affecting the isotopic signatures of the evaporating water body the d excess value of zero indicates the process of sub cloud evaporation of rain drops indicating aridity during the time of precipitation and reflecting the prevalence similar conditions from late pleistocene it was also noted that there had been a shift in itcz characterizing the variation in monsoon in terms of space and pattern this shift has resulted in the precipitation of the evaporated vapor near the source and thus it might have also affected the isotopic signatures of δ18o and δd leading to the variations in the d excess it was also witnessed in the present day context that cold winter experienced in the northern hemisphere region could result in the weakening of the intensity of iom in the following summer thus affecting the isotopic signatures and d excess the inference on the paleoclimates from the δ18o and d excess are summarized in table 4 the paleoclimatic variations and their signatures on recharge has thus been reflected in the groundwater of both the aquifers table 5 5 6 shift in itcz the seasonal wind trajectories and the patterns of summer monsoon are mainly governed by the variations in solar radiation resulting from the melting of glaciers at elevated land masses and thereby exposing the land surface therefore it was deduced that the changes in the albedo affected the heat flow of the asian continent and thereby the duration and strength of monsoon over the arabian sea kutzbach and guetter 1986 barnett et al 1989 few studies have reported the paleo monsoonal changes in india and china kutzbach and street perrott 1985 prell and kutzbach 1987 yan and petit maire 1994 studied the paleoclimatic record of iom comparing sahara arabia india tibet and china the ancient trend in the atmospheric circulation was determined as tropospheric easterly jet which has a high pressure 100 300 hpa migrating from north china to north africa having been discerned near the exit south and entry of the monsoon north of the monsoon influencing the isotopic values according to moisture sources and temperature of recharge the asian monsoon revival since mid holocene changes in the spatial timings patterns and their variations after the glaciation periods could not be attributed due to astronomical forcing yan and petit maire 1994 the regional perspective of atmospheric circulation revealed that the change in temperature at greater spatial extent is more prominent than the variation in rainfall zhong wei et al 1994 circulation of atmospheric vapor rising from the equator towards the poles at a height of 10 15 km and descending near the tropics later returning to the equator along the surface is referred to as hadley cell the variation in atmospheric circulation patterns with respect to hadley cell from lgm was studied by dagostino et al 2017 considering the near surface meridional potential temperature the gradient subtropical stability and the tropical tropopause level it was brought out that the change in the temperature levels affect the hadley cell and his model was more appropriate for the northern hemisphere the influence of the sst on the shift of itcz is mainly governed by the cross equatorial temperature gradients shift of itcz was witnessed during mid holocene heinrich 1 and during lgm the freshwater release from the ice sheets to the deep ocean due to the heinrich events affect the salinity and thus the thermo haline circulation mcmanus et al 2004 the thermo haline circulation plays a key role in heat transfer to the north latitude resulting in cooler north atlantic so dry climatic conditions are witnessed in the northern hemisphere due to the southward shift of tropical rain belt deplazes et al 2013 the cross equatorial atmospheric heat transfer studies reveal that the attributed mean shift of itcz 5 to be local and that of 0 1 to be global mcgee et al 2014 this northward shift in global precipitation is also observed in the recent times due to variation in the heat transfer along the equatorial region from southern to northern hemisphere frierson et al 2013 donohoe 2016 ganachaud and wunsch 2003 this change in the sst may also be due to the volcanic events affecting the variation in amount of heat transfer from southern to northern hemisphere the global volcanism program gvp 2013 of smithsonian university records 1426 volcanic events during the holocene period 10ky and 1241 events during the pleistocene 2 6 million years to 10ky most of the volcanic eruptions with higher explosivity index fall along the east and south of the china resulting in the changes of variation in albedo affecting the tropospheric easterly jet few such holocene volcanic events were also recorded north of the peninsula karakhanian et al 2002 hamann et al 2010 and northwestern saudi arabia downs et al 2018 which would have affected the circulation pattern of the vapor source the eruptions results in the cooling of the troposphere and heating of the stratosphere lacis et al 1992 hence a relative cooling is noted in temperature of the region after the event this effect of cooling may last for 3 to 4 years colose et al 2016 thus this large scale impact of the volcanic eruptions on the climate change relates to the shift of itcz the eruptions mainly varied the period and the amount of rainfall which indirectly affected depleted the δ18o signals it is witnessed by the depleted signals of north westerlies during 10 15 ky of dfm fig 6 and in few samples of 5 10 ky in kga the shift in itcz during the mid holocene periods 6ky might have also been resulted due to this process affecting the tropospheric easterly jet from china weaker summer monsoons lesser rainfall and more trade winds in the northern hemisphere were observed during this period similar conditions also prevailed during the heinrich 1 event when the southern hemisphere had warm temperatures than the north shakun et al 2012 gibbons et al 2014 5 7 determination of the recharge zones bowen and wilkinson 2002 developed a method to calculate estimate the δ18o values for modern precipitation later this method was adopted for the records near the ocean 200 m jasechko 2016 adopted this method for a set of late pleistocene and late holocene data to determine the latitude of recharge using δ18o values 2 δ 18 o lh 0 006566 lat 2 0 2897 lat 7 5 3 δ 18 o lp 0 008467 lat 2 0 3828 lat 8 8 both the equations had a regression value of 0 66 and 0 65 respectively subsequently the equations were modified with the inclusion of elevation component as follows 4 δ 18 o lh 0 006566 lat 2 0 2897 lat 3 3 alt 7 5 5 δ 18 o lp 0 008467 lat 2 0 3828 lat 3 8 alt 8 8 the altitude correction for lh includes a value of 3 3 km and that of lp is 3 8 km there are limitations observed for this calculation as follows the calculation was based on assumption that there is no substantial mixing of young and old waters torgersen et al 2013 the seasonal variations of precipitation did not impact much on the δ18o variations with respect to lp and lh and those represented are assumed to be signatures of annual precipitations o 12 dansgaard oeschger events o heinrich events h2 h5 o capture of lgm o dryas period o all these changes are presented as an amalgamated value o it is assumed that there had been no major alterations that took place after the recharge although few such events were reported by cartwright et al 2012 and morrissey et al 2010 the latitude values were calculated based on the relationship for the late pleistocene waters developed by jasechko and taylor 2015 this results showed that most of the kga were recharged between 26on and 26 8on and that of the dammam aquifer was noted to be recharged in two different patches between 25 8on and 26 2on and 26 7on 27 4on appendix 10 since the latitudinal interval of recharge for the kga was very small it could be inferred to be a specific outcrop or along a surface water flow transacting the dammam aquifer as the latitude of recharge for the dammam aquifer is falling in north and south of kga fig 11 further those along the south have a negative d excess reflecting the impact of evaporation or arid conditions during the process of recharge the northernmost vapors were seen to be more depleted with higher d excess fig 9 considering the suitable geographical conditions extending sw from the study area it was found to match with 1 n of the calculated value since the equation derived by jaeschko 2016 is for relating the samples globally this slight latitudinal variation locally could be attributed to the region of recharge the recharge of kga during holocene covers a large area in the southern part extending from 24 5on to 26 5on appendix 11 latitudinal variations was considered and it was inferred that the recharge took place between 25 5on and 27 5on fig 12 and most of the samples showed arid conditions with few samples showing a humid nature the area of recharge was found to be greater than that of the pleistocene time as there was a shift of itcz toward northward and the impact of iom was also noted even up to the central part of the peninsula the humidity optimum was dated in arabian peninsula extending to nefud between 9 and 6 ky donner 1985 schulz and whitney 1986 this was also witnessed by the maximum growth of g ruber during 8 ky bp along the deposits of sapropel between 9 and 8 ky bp reflecting predominance of wet period rossignol strick et al 1982 the enriched δ18o in this may be due to the recharge from the paleo lakes prevailed in between these latitudes 6 conclusion the study has identified two principal sources the depleted northwesterly eastern mediterranean meteoric vapor and the enriched southwestern iom greater amount of rainfall and colder climates have resulted in the depleted isotopic signatures in groundwater during the early holocene and late pleistocene the kga was predominantly recharged during the holocene period signatures of itcz shift and the development of aridity during the late holocene periods were reflected in the groundwater further recharge during holocene has occurred between 25 5on and 27 5on latitudes and it matched with the outcrops of the kga the groundwater of dfm was identified to be recharged predominantly during pleistocene by north westerly source and relatively depleted than kga the groundwater recharged in the aquifer had the imprints of heinrich event bolling allerod events and variations during dryas it was determined to be recharged between 25 8on and 26 2on and 26 7on 27 4on latitudes during late pleistocene both greelandian and northgrippian stages are inferred to be initiated with a period of wetness followed by aridity the shift of itcz was triggered by the holocene volcanism the events with higher explosivity index along the southeast and west of china had influenced the troposhperic easterly jet regionally the extreme rain events sub cloud evaporation process and the colder periods during the late pleistocene and holocene were captured by the d excess values hence isotopes studies in groundwater at par with other techniques could serve as a significant tool in studying the paleoclimates even though there are few constraints further addition of more groundwater isotope data in the arabian peninsula and the integrated studies on paleo drainage system through remote sensing techniques will help to attain a more vivid picture on the paleoclimate and the recharge scenarios credit authorship contribution statement chidambaram sabarathinam writing original draft software funding
