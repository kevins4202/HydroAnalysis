5975,an understanding of the detailed mechanisms and processes of hydrochemical changes in regional groundwater flow systems in response to large earthquakes has been hindered because of a lack of spatiotemporal datasets to describe these changes to clarify these issues we documented hydrochemical changes observed during the 2016 mw 7 0 kumamoto crustal earthquake using a large amount of analytical records for an area of ca 945 km2 from 139 wells for 82 measured parameters spatiotemporal distribution patterns of these changes were characterized based on a factor notation calculated using a 10 year data trend our results suggest that alteration of hydrogeological properties i e seismic rupturing coseismic mountain water release and release of soil pore waters caused changes in hydrochemical signatures at the regional scale most prominently reflected in elevated dissolved si diluted cl and increased co2 and organic compounds contents other hydrochemical anomalies detected at the local scale were induced by deep fluid upwelling and liquefaction this study identified the combined mechanisms and processes that generate the overall water chemistry changes in active groundwater flow systems in kumamoto our results provide new insights into coseismic hydrochemical changes that could be applied to other aquifer systems and importantly the use of groundwater

either pre earthquake or post earthquake events e g hartmann 2006 pérez et al 2008 tsunogai and wakita 1995 skelton et al 2014 possible explanations for these coseismic hydrochemical changes include

references therein however the spatial distribution patterns of these hydrochemical changes in active groundwater flow systems including how spatially overlapping effects by the different processes result in overall hydrochemical signature changes are rarely described at watershed scales and thus entire systems are not well understood the overall objective of this study is therefore to provide a comprehensive model describing hydrochemical changes in response to large crustal earthquakes at the regional scale a high resolution well monitoring network has been developed in the kumamoto area fig 1 a of southern japan where the 2016 mw 7 0 kumamoto crustal earthquake occurred hosono et al 2019 using a large number of bio geo chemical datasets obtained from these wells as well as previous reports on coseismic hydrological alterations we describe how groundwater quality changes in response to a large crustal earthquake during the 35 min after the main shock newly recognized normal faulting fig 1b suizenji fault systems resulted in surface water drawdown into the crust to a level deeper than that of the aquifers and caused water level drops over the area except in the coastal plain fig s1 hosono et al 2019 one to two weeks after this initial drop water levels tended to rise to levels higher than the original levels in recharge areas and to recover in active flow areas fig s1 and see fig 1a for locations of each area these water level rises were possibly caused by an inflow of additional water sources from the aquifers of surrounding mountains as a result of coseismic permeability enhancement caused by new ruptures being created in mountainous areas fig 1b and s1 hosono et al 2019 vertical water mixing occurred in association with liquefaction predominantly in stagnant aquifer systems in the plain and at the coast and caused water levels to rise in these areas fig s1 hosono et al 2019 in active groundwater flow systems recharged by meteoric water dissolved materials are transported by water flows from multiple sources including rocks surface soils and contaminants the aforementioned coseismic hydrological changes and an understanding of geological and land use properties in the catchment are keys to understanding coseismic hydrochemical changes in kumamoto the specific aims of this study are to describe spatiotemporal hydrochemical changes after the 2016 kumamoto earthquake using records from high resolution well monitoring the same wells that monitor water levels and to explain the causes of these coseismic changes by adapting previously proposed hydrological models the results of these descriptions from different measurement parameters will be summarized and integrated into cross sectional maps to construct a comprehensive model which is the overall objective of this study the study is important for demonstrating how water chemistry changes at a regional scale in response to large crustal earthquakes and to demonstrate novel approaches that can be generally used to investigate these issues 2 study area the kumamoto groundwater area 945 km2 is located in central kyushu island southern japan fig 1a kumamoto city is the largest city in japan that derives all of its water supply from natural groundwater taniguchi et al 2019 for this reason the city has maintained an extensive network of high resolution water level and quality monitoring systems fig 1a aquifer systems in this area consist mainly of permeable volcanic pyroclastic deposits porous lavas and alluvial deposits there are two major aquifer systems which are separated by an impermeable aquitard lacustrine sediments with an unconfined aquifer ca 60 m deep and underlying confined aquifer ca 20 250 m described in hosono et al 2013 groundwater is recharged from the northern and eastern highlands then flows laterally south and westward and mostly discharges within 40 years as springs into lake ezu at the entrance of the plain area fig 1a hosono et al 2013 kagabu et al 2017 okumura et al 2018 ono et al 2013 taniguchi et al 2003 some stagnant groundwater remains in the plain and at the coast west of lake ezu where marine clay sediments 60 m thick were deposited during the last marine transgression relatively impermeable palaeozoic metasedimentary rocks and pliocene to quaternary volcanic rocks make up the hydrogeological basement of this area the 2016 kumamoto earthquake sequence started with a large foreshock of mw 6 2 at 21 26 jst on april 14th 2016 followed by the main shock of mw 7 0 at 01 25 jst on april 16th 2016 fig 1b and was the largest earthquake historically recorded in the kyushu region these seismic activities involved strike slip and normal displacements and the main shock revealed newly recognized post seismic rupture systems fig 1b fujiwara et al 2016 of these rupture systems newly formed fault systems suizenji faults fujiwara et al 2016 goto et al 2017 crosscut active groundwater flow systems fig 1a b and caused surface water to be drawn down into the crust to depths deeper than the aquifers hosono et al 2019 and led to an initial groundwater drop in these areas fig s1 other rupture systems crosscut the eastern mountain foot and kinpo mountain aquifers fig 1b and caused water to be released from mountain aquifers as a result of permeability enhancement this was followed by a subsequent water level recovery in discharge area and increases in recharge area fig s1 hosono et al 2019 water quality geochemical evolution and isotopic and microbiological characteristics of the original aquifer systems have been documented in previous works hossain 2016 hossain et al 2016a b hosono et al 2013 2014 zeng et al 2016 in addition high resolution ca every 2 month specific well monitoring n 12 research for major ion concentrations detected coseismic hydrochemical changes at five monitoring sites for confined aquifers and the changes continued for at least 2 years after the main shock kawagoshi et al 2018 the present paper provides additional insight into the spatial distribution changes in hydrochemical concentrations and their mechanisms in particular special emphasis is placed on the role of the formation of new ruptures in changing hydrochemical signatures this allows the increased migration of dissolved solids in groundwater across surface subsurface systems and increased reaction with new contact surfaces in addition coseismic mountain water release and vertical water exchange during liquefaction might cause hydrochemical changes this study examines the presence intensity and causes of these changes by considering all possible scenarios 3 materials and methods water quality data were collected from domestic reports from three different government offices kumamoto city kumamoto city waterworks and sewerage bureau and the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism all data from the first two offices were obtained from their websites http www city kumamoto jp and https www kumamoto waterworks jp respectively the data from the third office were obtained in person consequently data from 139 wells were obtained for the kumamoto groundwater area see table 1 for data and fig 1a for well locations all water samples were collected from observation or production wells well water was pumped out for about an hour before sampling to avoid collecting stagnant water from the well pipes measurement parameters and sampling duration varied depending on jurisdiction all raw data and parameter information for 82 parameters used in our analysis are provided in tables s1 and s2 respectively furthermore analytical devices and methods applied for each measurement for parameters showing coseismic changes for 29 parameters and the minimum concentration shown in the reports are listed in table s3 the concentrations were determined by different analytical companies in japan using instrumentation recommended in the analytical guidelines from the japanese ministry of health labour and welfare spatiotemporal changes in material concentrations before and after the main shock are expressed using factor notation fig 2 for three periods may july august november and january march absolute values were not compared for spatial coseismic change assessment some wells do not have data for various seasons and for some parameters tables s1 and s2 and thus spatiotemporal factor value mappings do not always show a coherent dataset we used the spatiotemporal maps for a discussion of the 2 year period after the occurrence of the main shock although all data used in this study were taken from government reports the results correspond well with specific well monitoring results from other laboratories kawagoshi et al 2018 we therefore assert that the datasets provided by the government offices are sufficiently accurate and are valuable for our discussion groundwater chemistry was relatively constant during the 10 years preceding the 2016 kumamoto earthquake except for some contaminants such as nitrates which showed an increasing trend over time in some wells hosono et al 2013 assuming a constant rate of change for each concentration during these 10 years and using a regression analysis fig 2 we obtained estimated concentrations in groundwater on a specific sampling day after the main shock for each parameter for each well the change factor was then calculated by dividing the measured concentration by the estimated concentration fig 2 a calculated change factor of 1 0 or 1 0 indicates whether the concentration increased or decreased respectively after the earthquake while the magnitude of the change is given by the factor s value the threshold between changed and unchanged was defined as twice the standard deviation for each well for the maximum variability of concentration in the past 10 years before the earthquake fig 2 these threshold criteria were applied to all concentration data after the earthquake for all wells in this regard if a measured concentration is greater within or lower than the threshold range the value was deemed to be increased unchanged or decreased after the earthquake and was expressed as factor values of 1 0 unchanged or 1 0 respectively these factor values were summarized table 1 and plotted on maps to discuss spatiotemporal coseismic hydrochemical changes we appreciate that other statistical tests such as the binomial test may provide accurate assessments of the coseismic changes skelton et al 2019 however the time resolution and sampling intervals of the obtained dataset were too varied depending on the data source and thus could not be used to perform such statistical assessments spatial patterns of coseismic hydrochemical changes were statistically assessed using self organizing maps som tool kohonen 1982 2001 and these results will be presented in separated paper 4 results and discussion we defined a well s water as changed if any of the repeated measurements recorded a factor value of 1 0 or 1 0 whereas we described it as unchanged if no records showed a factor value of 1 0 or 1 0 these assessments were applied for 2 years after the earthquake for a maximum of six sampling campaigns according to these criteria 29 of the 82 parameters measured showed coseismic changes table 1 significant changes were recognized for dissolved silica dsi free carbon dioxide co2 organic matter and chloride ions cl these concentrations changed after the main shock for 45 of the wells including 20 unconfined and 119 confined groundwater wells therefore the discussion of coseismic hydrochemical change focuses on these key chemical components the dataset obtained showed no well waters with concentrations that significantly approached the japanese standard limits for drinking purposes for any parameters during the 2 years after the earthquake the 2016 kumamoto earthquake did not result in a post seismic tsunami plausible hypotheses explaining the coseismic hydrochemical changes are discussed below using the various measured parameters 4 1 dilution chloride ions cl were used as a tracer in the study area to evaluate the occurrence of mixing of different waters after the main shock dissolved cl concentrations did not change in response to either redox changes or geochemical weathering because of their conservative nature in redox reactions and because there are no cl bearing minerals in aquifers except in the coastal areas where marine clay sediments are distributed over the surface 60 m thickness possible causes of elevated groundwater cl concentrations are mixing of new waters with a higher cl concentration which are of mainly four types including deep fluids tsunogai and wakita 1995 skelton et al 2014 hydrothermal waters hosono et al 2018 wang et al 2004 pore water in marine clays and surface contaminated water wells et al 2013 thus the groundwater cl concentration may increase if these waters are mixed and may decrease if more diluted waters are mixed a mapping of the factor values for cl in confined aquifers fig 3 generally displays a declining trend of cl concentration with time except for some localized increases anomalies this implies that the waters have been increasingly diluted by low concentration waters and this effect continued for at least 2 years after the earthquake in the coastal plain site a located in fig 1c and 3 high salinity waters were present prior to the earthquake but were diluted with low salinity groundwater after the earthquake fig 4 a similar trend is found for the unconfined aquifers however mixing with high salinity water is also present fig s3 it is difficult to explain the observed water mixing in terms of lateral flow enhancement in coastal stagnant aquifers in this area it is more likely that liquefaction caused increased water levels in response to an increase in hydraulic head pressures immediately after the main shock fig s1 hosono et al 2019 a similar mechanism was invoked to explain the observed post seismic water level rise in western taiwan during the 1999 chi chi earthquake wang et al 2005 thus in the present study changes in cl concentrations in the coastal plain are attributed to vertical water redistributions across sediment layers with different salinity gradients all other major ions so4 2 br ca2 mg2 na and k followed similar mixing trends another area of dilution is found in the northern recharge and groundwater flow areas and more sporadically in and east of the suizenji fault areas figs 3 and 4b in addition a similar dilution trend was observed from monitoring wells in the eastern recharge area kawagoshi et al 2018 in these areas water levels increased or recovered after initial water drops fig s1 because of coseismic mountain water release that occurred as a result of permeability enhancement hosono et al 2019 and the cl concentration is relatively low compared with downslope aquifer waters hossain 2016 these water level increases or recoveries were realized within 1 year and were sustained 2 years after the main shock fig s1 the observed water dilution corresponds well to that obtained in a previously proposed coseismic mountain water release model hosono et al 2019 the potential usefulness of the cl tracer in documenting coseismically enhanced mixing of waters from different aquifer systems has been reported previously e g manga and rowland 2009 electrical conductivity results for both aquifers figs s3 and s4 show similar decreasing patterns reflecting this dilution process however this effect is not clearly shown in other parameters in our analysis because multiple causes other than mixing of mountain waters can change their concentrations and or because their concentration ranges are almost indistinguishable between regional aquifers and surrounding mountain aquifers as explained later cl was the most useful parameter for evaluating coseismic water dilution processes such dilution effect can be reflected in other parameters f na k and ca2 when we assessed the data statistically using som and the results will be presented in separated paper the present study provides more detail on the effective use of cl tracers in documenting post seismic mountain water releases that cause subsequent water dilution in downslope aquifer systems this can occur in a setting where mountain water has a pristine hydrochemical signature and a lower cl concentration when compared with downstream water 4 2 deep fluid upwelling anomalous groundwater cl increases were most prominent in the northern flow area and near the earthquake epicenters figs 3 4c and d and s2 volcanic and magmatic activities are not known beneath these locations in addition marine clays are not distributed in these areas if leakage of sewage waters and or contaminated soil pore waters by agricultural activities were the main cause of the cl increase in groundwater in these areas the concentrations of major sewage and other anthropogenic components such as no3 no2 nh4 and po4 3 should also increase however in our analysis there were no coherent increases in any of these parameters therefore the contamination leakage hypothesis is unlikely although the increased leakage of sewage waters after the earthquake has been detected from an analysis of organic chemical compounds in the form of artificial sweeteners which are a sensible sewage mixing tracer ishii et al 2017 and from statistical analysis using som notably similar increased concentration patterns were detected for b and so4 2 in confined aquifers in these two locations figs s5 and s6 these components are highly concentrated in deep fluids in the study area and can be used to identify upwelling signals of these fluids hosono et al 2018 specific well monitoring surveys in these spots showed the same trends kawagoshi et al 2018 the location of a hydrochemical anomaly in the northern groundwater flow area coincides with the highest temperature 23 c gradient zone aist 2014 and water levels in deep boreholes 1000 m in depth increased by a few meters immediately after the main shock these observations support our hypothesis that this indicates deep fluid upwelling as identified elsewhere tsunogai and wakita 1995 skelton et al 2014 barberio et al 2017 the contribution of deep fluids appeared within a few months and continued for at least 2 years after the main shock figs 3 4c and d s5 and s6 this deep fluid upwelling occurred under crustal expansion hosono et al 2019 thus pressurized fluids in the crust deeper than 200 m total thickness of the aquifer systems ascend to shallower aquifers through structural breaks a similar mechanism was proposed to explain deep fluid upwelling in the aso caldera watershed hosono et al 2018 however we still do not know why the appearance of deep fluid upwelling tends to be delayed near the epicenters compared with that observed in the northern area figs 3 s5 and s6 this may be due to relatively large volumes of fresh groundwater in this downslope aquifer that mixed with the deep fluids and hence weakened the response of the upwelling signal when compared with that of the northern flow area observed anomalous increases in cl b and so4 2 figs 3 s5 and s6 occur at the same locations as increases in electrical conductivity figs s3 and s4 cl is one of the most effective parameters for identifying deep fluid upwelling after a crustal earthquake especially when used with other indicators such as b and so4 2 concentrations this finding corresponds to that in previous reports hosono et al 2018 nishio et al 2010 okuyama et al 2016 4 3 rock weathering coseismic enhancement of rock weathering andrén et al 2016 claesson et al 2004 2007 kita et al 1982 is thought to be triggered by the formation of new rock surfaces through cracking which subsequently increases water rock interactions the aquifer geology consists mainly of basaltic to rhyolitic volcanic rocks and alluvial deposits that originated from these rocks thus silicate minerals such as plagioclase olivine pyroxene and hornblende are the major rock forming minerals and the exposure of fresh surfaces could increase major cation ca2 mg2 na and k and hco3 alkalinity concentrations in groundwater by enhancing co2 mediated silicate mineral weathering dessert et al 2003 gaillardet et al 1999 however no systematic increasing trend in cation concentrations was found for any of these ions ca2 mg2 na and k table 1 in the 2 years after the earthquake except for wells in the coastal plains data not shown where water concentrations changed because of vertical water mixing by liquefaction as described previously in contrast to major cations alkalinity in confined aquifers showed an increasing trend in the northern recharge and groundwater flow areas after the main shock with factor values of mostly 1 25 fig s7 similarly but more significantly an increasing pattern was found for free co2 gas concentrations with factor values of up to 22 except near the epicenters where well waters showed a decreasing trend fig 5 two major possible causes that explain the increase in free co2 are contributions of gases from magmatic origins yamada et al 2011 and ecosystem recycled co2 in soils however the first cause can be eliminated because co2 concentrations near the epicenters decrease where deep fluid upwelling is expected thus the second cause is more plausible where co2 in unsaturated soils migrated and dissolved into groundwater thus increasing alkalinity which is directly proportional to pco2 this scenario does not contradict the previously proposed water mixing model and material transport as discussed below another possible cause of increased free co2 is degassing from dissolved co2 in groundwater triggered by seismic rupturing and shaking fujiwara et al 2016 fukuyama and suzuki 2016 goto et al 2017 or the generation of low pressure during crustal expansion hosono et al 2019 however these anomalies are distributed in recharge and flow areas but not near rupture systems fig 5 moreover it would be difficult to explain the simultaneous increase in alkalinity with this hypothesis the most pronounced coseismic concentration change in geogenic elements is an increase in dissolved silica dsi table 1 dsi concentrations increased with time over the study area with a factor value of 1 25 fig 6 concentrations of major cations ca2 mg2 na and k are in the same range in both aquifers and mountain waters spring waters in pre earthquake measurements hossain 2016 in contrast the dsi concentration in mountain waters 40 mg l 1 is generally smaller than that of aquifer waters 80 mg l 1 hossain 2016 suggesting that the observed dsi increase was not caused by a mixing of mountain waters previous laboratory experiments schrader et al 1969 and field observations kita et al 1982 wakita et al 1980 demonstrated that seismic cracking decomposes the si o bond of silicate minerals such physical decomposition of rocks dissolves sio2 into groundwater leaving other elements such as k na mg and ca in the solid phase observations on widely distributed structural deformations fujiwara et al 2016 and strong ground shaking fukuyama and suzuki 2016 support this scenario any other factors that could possibly lead to a dsi increase such as a change in ph were not observed over the study area the present study demonstrates coseismic dsi dissolution is controlled by physical mechanics and more rapid reaction compared with co2 mediated geochemical weathering reactions that causes dissolution of other minerals such as ca2 mg2 na k and other metals reactions that progress over a longer time scale ca a few decades in young volcanic fields ide et al 2018 kagabu et al 2017 post seismic increases in both co2 and dsi concentrations have rarely been reported in previous studies however these unique findings and the proposed hypotheses to explain the observed changes need to be further verified in future studies both experimentally and with more case studies in other fields in particular it is still difficult to answer why dsi continued increasing for 2 years after the earthquake fig 6 a laboratory experiment using rocks and groundwater from the same study area may provide insights to help understand the mechanisms at work in the field 4 4 material transport from surface to aquifers the other most strikingly changed parameter is organic matter table 1 the concentrations increased by a factor value of 17 within 3 months of the main shock in confined aquifers after this initial increase organic matter decreased to the original concentration levels or lower which were near the detection limits figs 7 and 8 as far as the authors know there are no previous reports of increased organic matter in regional groundwater flow systems as a result of seismic activities in the studied volcanic fan setting the major source of organic matter is surface soils but not aquifer geologies thus a sharply increased concentration in confined aquifers presents a locus of material transported from the surface to aquifers with downward flows we propose that the organic matter migrated with water drawdown through ruptures hosono et al 2019 or new pathways in the unsaturated zone mohr et al 2017 immediately after the main shock with time these organic materials were consumed by microbial respiration in aquifers to decrease their concentrations to original levels or lower figs 7 and 8 such signals are less obvious for unconfined aquifers table 1 probably because microbial decomposition of organic matter was complete before the first samples were taken after the main shock may july 2016 nitrate no3 concentrations might be useful as another indicator to evaluate the occurrence of material transport from the surface to deep aquifers because it is generally present in surface soils such as those in farmland hosono et al 2013 okumura et al 2018 but not in aquifer geologies this approach has rarely been tested in previous work interestingly kawagoshi et al 2018 reported statistically significant post seismic no3 concentration increases from two well locations at 100 and 150 m depths under farmlands in recharge areas thickness of unsaturated zone 30 m okumura et al 2018 although they have not mentioned mechanisms to cause these changes we suggest it s firm evidence showing nitrate transported with soil pore waters down to aquifers through preferential pathways triggered either by seismic vibration mohr et al 2017 or rupturing fujiwara et al 2016 however a clear geographical pattern of such no3 increases was not obtained from our dataset and neither were there any clear geographical patterns for increases in no2 and nh4 two reasons are suggested one is that the effect of dilution by the mixing of mountain waters with lower no3 concentration obscured any patterns and the other is that the changes were too small to be detected by our assessment consequently we suggest that organic matter rather than no3 is a more sensible index of material transport to confirm short term responses caused by the earthquake studied there are two specific locations that show increasing and decreasing no3 patterns after the main shock figs 9 and 10 a coseismic increase in no3 was found in urban areas both in our study site f in fig 1c 8 and 9 and in a recent report on two wells near this site kawagoshi et al 2018 exogenous microorganisms such as propionibacterium acnes were detected by clone analysis targeting the 16s rrna gene detailed results will be presented in a separate paper these microorganisms generally inhabit only surface environments such as rivers and sewer systems thus no3 and probably other contaminants were transported from surface waters in some urban areas in contrast a coseismic decrease in no3 was found in the northern groundwater flow area site g in figs 8 and 9 either dilution by mountain waters with lower concentrations or denitrification is a possible explanation for the observed coseismic no3 decline observed coseismic concentration changes in no3 seem not to have led to overall water quality deterioration in aquifer basins 2 years after the 2016 kumamoto earthquake however newly formed surface ruptures crosscut sewage networks in urban areas fig 1c and the effects of sewage leakage may appear with time unless the sewers are sealed continuous monitoring of water quality is recommended to address the issues discussed above 4 5 regional scale hydrochemical changes model the compilation of large hydrochemical datasets from administrative monitoring reports allowed us to characterize spatiotemporal changes in the regional quaternary volcanic aquifers in response to the 2016 mw 7 0 kumamoto crustal earthquake the analysis of these changing patterns using previously proposed coseismic hydrogeological change models enables the identification of hydrochemical change mechanisms at both the regional and local scales within the same watershed fig 10 we assumed that gases and solutes in unsaturated surface soils were transported into saturated aquifers with the initial drop in water levels and coseismic permeability increases led to a sharp increase in groundwater co2 gas and organic matter content by an order of magnitude higher than original levels except for stagnant groundwater in the coastal plain aquifer waters were largely diluted by the mixing of waters released from surrounding mountains and was monitored very effectively using cl concentrations the formation of ruptures and cracks decomposed si o bonds in the rock forming minerals which resulted in increased dissolved silica concentrations in aquifers mostly 1 2 times more concentrated than in pre earthquake measurements liquefaction particularly in the coastal plains caused vertical groundwater mixing across different salinity gradients localized anomalies of deep fluid upwelling were recognized using indicators such as cl b and so4 2 in localized areas with geothermal potential and near epicenters indications of a significant increase in sewage water leakage were not detected from present analysis except in a few potential locations that show slight increases in no3 during the 2 years after the earthquake the possibility of sewage leakages should be continuously examined because seismic ruptures crosscut sewage pipe networks under residential areas in general different types of hydrochemical changes and anomalies seem to broadly overlap within the recharge to discharge areas except at the coast fig 10 this indicates observed changes could be the result of a combination of more than two processes within the same area each effect can however be qualitatively distinguished using suitable tracers the identification of high intensity and localized anomalies was cross checked using multiple tracers for instance the mixing of saline water was confirmed by most of the major ions and the contribution of deep fluids was detected by several indicators such as cl so4 2 and b however not all processes could be clearly elucidated using multiple tracers the signals of non point source inputs of material such as surface soil pore waters were inconsistent in tracers such as co2 no3 and organic compounds at the site specific scale figs 5 7 and 9 there are several possible hypotheses that could explain these inconsistencies variations in the areal heterogeneity of each aquifer variations in diffusion and biochemical reaction rates among different materials and offsets between production and consumption in carbon and nitrogen cycles through the decomposition of organic compounds the proposed model and approaches could be useful for understanding systems in other aquifers however more case studies are required to understand entire systems at the global scale 5 conclusions the detailed mechanisms and processes of geochemical changes in response to the 2016 mw 7 0 kumamoto crustal earthquake were described in terms of regional groundwater flow systems by using a large amount of hydrochemical data from 139 wells of the 82 measured parameters 29 showed changed concentrations the biggest changes were for dissolved silica 76 of total wells free carbon dioxide 60 total organic compounds 48 and chloride 46 our results suggest that seismic rupturing triggered si o bond cleavage in rocks which resulted in silica dissolution in the study area in addition seismic structural breaks play an important role in the pathway of deep fluid upwelling at the localized scale for instance in the vicinity of earthquake epicenters materials are transported from the deep crust and also from surface soils these materials include organic matter and nitrate including gases i e co2 that infiltrate into aquifers and are transported from the recharge to the discharge areas the hydrochemistry of regional groundwater flow systems can be significantly altered by the mixing of mountain waters co seismically released by permeability enhancement which in the case of our study were most clearly detected by diluted cl concentrations in recharge areas near mountain feet our study demonstrates that the changes in groundwater chemistry of multiple parameters can be explained by related scenarios consisting of several different processes and a good understanding of coseismic hydrogeological change mechanisms at the regional scale findings insights and approaches from this study can serve as an important basis for understanding groundwater quality changes in response to large crustal earthquakes in active groundwater flow systems such as volcanic and sedimentary fan aquifers either in a

5975,an understanding of the detailed mechanisms and processes of hydrochemical changes in regional groundwater flow systems in response to large earthquakes has been hindered because of a lack of spatiotemporal datasets to describe these changes to clarify these issues we documented hydrochemical changes observed during the 2016 mw 7 0 kumamoto crustal earthquake using a large amount of analytical records for an area of ca 945 km2 from 139 wells for 82 measured parameters spatiotemporal distribution patterns of these changes were characterized based on a factor notation calculated using a 10 year data trend our results suggest that alteration of hydrogeological properties i e seismic rupturing coseismic mountain water release and release of soil pore waters caused changes in hydrochemical signatures at the regional scale most prominently reflected in elevated dissolved si diluted cl and increased co2 and organic compounds contents other hydrochemical anomalies detected at the local scale were induced by deep fluid upwelling and liquefaction this study identified the combined mechanisms and processes that generate the overall water chemistry changes in active groundwater flow systems in kumamoto our results provide new insights into coseismic hydrochemical changes that could be applied to other aquifer systems and importantly the use of groundwater

reports on coseismic hydrological alterations we describe how groundwater quality changes in response to a large crustal earthquake during the 35 min after the main shock newly recognized normal faulting fig 1b suizenji fault systems resulted in surface water drawdown into the crust to a level deeper than that of the aquifers and caused water level drops over the area except in the coastal plain fig s1 hosono et al 2019 one to two weeks after this initial drop water levels tended to rise to levels higher than the original levels in recharge areas and to recover in active flow areas fig s1 and see fig 1a for locations of each area these water level rises were possibly caused by an inflow of additional water sources from the aquifers of surrounding mountains as a result of coseismic permeability enhancement caused by new ruptures being created in mountainous areas fig 1b and s1 hosono et al 2019 vertical water mixing occurred in association with liquefaction predominantly in stagnant aquifer systems in the plain and at the coast and caused water levels to rise in these areas fig s1 hosono et al 2019 in active groundwater flow systems recharged by meteoric water dissolved materials are transported by water flows from multiple sources including rocks surface soils and contaminants the aforementioned coseismic hydrological changes and an understanding of geological and land use properties in the catchment are keys to understanding coseismic hydrochemical changes in kumamoto the specific aims of this study are to describe spatiotemporal hydrochemical changes after the 2016 kumamoto earthquake using records from high resolution well monitoring the same wells that monitor water levels and to explain the causes of these coseismic changes by adapting previously proposed hydrological models the results of these descriptions from different measurement parameters will be summarized and integrated into cross sectional maps to construct a comprehensive model which is the overall objective of this study the study is important for demonstrating how water chemistry changes at a regional scale in response to large crustal earthquakes and to demonstrate novel approaches that can be generally used to investigate these issues 2 study area the kumamoto groundwater area 945 km2 is located in central kyushu island southern japan fig 1a kumamoto city is the largest city in japan that derives all of its water supply from natural groundwater taniguchi et al 2019 for this reason the city has maintained an extensive network of high resolution water level and quality monitoring systems fig 1a aquifer systems in this area consist mainly of permeable volcanic pyroclastic deposits porous lavas and alluvial deposits there are two major aquifer systems which are separated by an impermeable aquitard lacustrine sediments with an unconfined aquifer ca 60 m deep and underlying confined aquifer ca 20 250 m described in hosono et al 2013 groundwater is recharged from the northern and eastern highlands then flows laterally south and westward and mostly discharges within 40 years as springs into lake ezu at the entrance of the plain area fig 1a hosono et al 2013 kagabu et al 2017 okumura et al 2018 ono et al 2013 taniguchi et al 2003 some stagnant groundwater remains in the plain and at the coast west of lake ezu where marine clay sediments 60 m thick were deposited during the last marine transgression relatively impermeable palaeozoic metasedimentary rocks and pliocene to quaternary volcanic rocks make up the hydrogeological basement of this area the 2016 kumamoto earthquake sequence started with a large foreshock of mw 6 2 at 21 26 jst on april 14th 2016 followed by the main shock of mw 7 0 at 01 25 jst on april 16th 2016 fig 1b and was the largest earthquake historically recorded in the kyushu region these seismic activities involved strike slip and normal displacements and the main shock revealed newly recognized post seismic rupture systems fig 1b fujiwara et al 2016 of these rupture systems newly formed fault systems suizenji faults fujiwara et al 2016 goto et al 2017 crosscut active groundwater flow systems fig 1a b and caused surface water to be drawn down into the crust to depths deeper than the aquifers hosono et al 2019 and led to an initial groundwater drop in these areas fig s1 other rupture systems crosscut the eastern mountain foot and kinpo mountain aquifers fig 1b and caused water to be released from mountain aquifers as a result of permeability enhancement this was followed by a subsequent water level recovery in discharge area and increases in recharge area fig s1 hosono et al 2019 water quality geochemical evolution and isotopic and microbiological characteristics of the original aquifer systems have been documented in previous works hossain 2016 hossain et al 2016a b hosono et al 2013 2014 zeng et al 2016 in addition high resolution ca every 2 month specific well monitoring n 12 research for major ion concentrations detected coseismic hydrochemical changes at five monitoring sites for confined aquifers and the changes continued for at least 2 years after the main shock kawagoshi et al 2018 the present paper provides additional insight into the spatial distribution changes in hydrochemical concentrations and their mechanisms in particular special emphasis is placed on the role of the formation of new ruptures in changing hydrochemical signatures this allows the increased migration of dissolved solids in groundwater across surface subsurface systems and increased reaction with new contact surfaces in addition coseismic mountain water release and vertical water exchange during liquefaction might cause hydrochemical changes this study examines the presence intensity and causes of these changes by considering all possible scenarios 3 materials and methods water quality data were collected from domestic reports from three different government offices kumamoto city kumamoto city waterworks and sewerage bureau and the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism all data from the first two offices were obtained from their websites http www city kumamoto jp and https www kumamoto waterworks jp respectively the data from the third office were obtained in person consequently data from 139 wells were obtained for the kumamoto groundwater area see table 1 for data and fig 1a for well locations all water samples were collected from observation or production wells well water was pumped out for about an hour before sampling to avoid collecting stagnant water from the well pipes measurement parameters and sampling duration varied depending on jurisdiction all raw data and parameter information for 82 parameters used in our analysis are provided in tables s1 and s2 respectively furthermore analytical devices and methods applied for each measurement for parameters showing coseismic changes for 29 parameters and the minimum concentration shown in the reports are listed in table s3 the concentrations were determined by different analytical companies in japan using instrumentation recommended in the analytical guidelines from the japanese ministry of health labour and welfare spatiotemporal changes in material concentrations before and after the main shock are expressed using factor notation fig 2 for three periods may july august november and january march absolute values were not compared for spatial coseismic change assessment some wells do not have data for various seasons and for some parameters tables s1 and s2 and thus spatiotemporal factor value mappings do not always show a coherent dataset we used the spatiotemporal maps for a discussion of the 2 year period after the occurrence of the main shock although all data used in this study were taken from government reports the results correspond well with specific well monitoring results from other laboratories kawagoshi et al 2018 we therefore assert that the datasets provided by the government offices are sufficiently accurate and are valuable for our discussion groundwater chemistry was relatively constant during the 10 years preceding the 2016 kumamoto earthquake except for some contaminants such as nitrates which showed an increasing trend over time in some wells hosono et al 2013 assuming a constant rate of change for each concentration during these 10 years and using a regression analysis fig 2 we obtained estimated concentrations in groundwater on a specific sampling day after the main shock for each parameter for each well the change factor was then calculated by dividing the measured concentration by the estimated concentration fig 2 a calculated change factor of 1 0 or 1 0 indicates whether the concentration increased or decreased respectively after the earthquake while the magnitude of the change is given by the factor s value the threshold between changed and unchanged was defined as twice the standard deviation for each well for the maximum variability of concentration in the past 10 years before the earthquake fig 2 these threshold criteria were applied to all concentration data after the earthquake for all wells in this regard if a measured concentration is greater within or lower than the threshold range the value was deemed to be increased unchanged or decreased after the earthquake and was expressed as factor values of 1 0 unchanged or 1 0 respectively these factor values were summarized table 1 and plotted on maps to discuss spatiotemporal coseismic hydrochemical changes we appreciate that other statistical tests such as the binomial test may provide accurate assessments of the coseismic changes skelton et al 2019 however the time resolution and sampling intervals of the obtained dataset were too varied depending on the data source and thus could not be used to perform such statistical assessments spatial patterns of coseismic hydrochemical changes were statistically assessed using self organizing maps som tool kohonen 1982 2001 and these results will be presented in separated paper 4 results and discussion we defined a well s water as changed if any of the repeated measurements recorded a factor value of 1 0 or 1 0 whereas we described it as unchanged if no records showed a factor value of 1 0 or 1 0 these assessments were applied for 2 years after the earthquake for a maximum of six sampling campaigns according to these criteria 29 of the 82 parameters measured showed coseismic changes table 1 significant changes were recognized for dissolved silica dsi free carbon dioxide co2 organic matter and chloride ions cl these concentrations changed after the main shock for 45 of the wells including 20 unconfined and 119 confined groundwater wells therefore the discussion of coseismic hydrochemical change focuses on these key chemical components the dataset obtained showed no well waters with concentrations that significantly approached the japanese standard limits for drinking purposes for any parameters during the 2 years after the earthquake the 2016 kumamoto earthquake did not result in a post seismic tsunami plausible hypotheses explaining the coseismic hydrochemical changes are discussed below using the various measured parameters 4 1 dilution chloride ions cl were used as a tracer in the study area to evaluate the occurrence of mixing of different waters after the main shock dissolved cl concentrations did not change in response to either redox changes or geochemical weathering because of their conservative nature in redox reactions and because there are no cl bearing minerals in aquifers except in the coastal areas where marine clay sediments are distributed over the surface 60 m thickness possible causes of elevated groundwater cl concentrations are mixing of new waters with a higher cl concentration which are of mainly four types including deep fluids tsunogai and wakita 1995 skelton et al 2014 hydrothermal waters hosono et al 2018 wang et al 2004 pore water in marine clays and surface contaminated water wells et al 2013 thus the groundwater cl concentration may increase if these waters are mixed and may decrease if more diluted waters are mixed a mapping of the factor values for cl in confined aquifers fig 3 generally displays a declining trend of cl concentration with time except for some localized increases anomalies this implies that the waters have been increasingly diluted by low concentration waters and this effect continued for at least 2 years after the earthquake in the coastal plain site a located in fig 1c and 3 high salinity waters were present prior to the earthquake but were diluted with low salinity groundwater after the earthquake fig 4 a similar trend is found for the unconfined aquifers however mixing with high salinity water is also present fig s3 it is difficult to explain the observed water mixing in terms of lateral flow enhancement in coastal stagnant aquifers in this area it is more likely that liquefaction caused increased water levels in response to an increase in hydraulic head pressures immediately after the main shock fig s1 hosono et al 2019 a similar mechanism was invoked to explain the observed post seismic water level rise in western taiwan during the 1999 chi chi earthquake wang et al 2005 thus in the present study changes in cl concentrations in the coastal plain are attributed to vertical water redistributions across sediment layers with different salinity gradients all other major ions so4 2 br ca2 mg2 na and k followed similar mixing trends another area of dilution is found in the northern recharge and groundwater flow areas and more sporadically in and east of the suizenji fault areas figs 3 and 4b in addition a similar dilution trend was observed from monitoring wells in the eastern recharge area kawagoshi et al 2018 in these areas water levels increased or recovered after initial water drops fig s1 because of coseismic mountain water release that occurred as a result of permeability enhancement hosono et al 2019 and the cl concentration is relatively low compared with downslope aquifer waters hossain 2016 these water level increases or recoveries were realized within 1 year and were sustained 2 years after the main shock fig s1 the observed water dilution corresponds well to that obtained in a previously proposed coseismic mountain water release model hosono et al 2019 the potential usefulness of the cl tracer in documenting coseismically enhanced mixing of waters from different aquifer systems has been reported previously e g manga and rowland 2009 electrical conductivity results for both aquifers figs s3 and s4 show similar decreasing patterns reflecting this dilution process however this effect is not clearly shown in other parameters in our analysis because multiple causes other than mixing of mountain waters can change their concentrations and or because their concentration ranges are almost indistinguishable between regional aquifers and surrounding mountain aquifers as explained later cl was the most useful parameter for evaluating coseismic water dilution processes such dilution effect can be reflected in other parameters f na k and ca2 when we assessed the data statistically using som and the results will be presented in separated paper the present study provides more detail on the effective use of cl tracers in documenting post seismic mountain water releases that cause subsequent water dilution in downslope aquifer systems this can occur in a setting where mountain water has a pristine hydrochemical signature and a lower cl concentration when compared with downstream water 4 2 deep fluid upwelling anomalous groundwater cl increases were most prominent in the northern flow area and near the earthquake epicenters figs 3 4c and d and s2 volcanic and magmatic activities are not known beneath these locations in addition marine clays are not distributed in these areas if leakage of sewage waters and or contaminated soil pore waters by agricultural activities were the main cause of the cl increase in groundwater in these areas the concentrations of major sewage and other anthropogenic components such as no3 no2 nh4 and po4 3 should also increase however in our analysis there were no coherent increases in any of these parameters therefore the contamination leakage hypothesis is unlikely although the increased leakage of sewage waters after the earthquake has been detected from an analysis of organic chemical compounds in the form of artificial sweeteners which are a sensible sewage mixing tracer ishii et al 2017 and from statistical analysis using som notably similar increased concentration patterns were detected for b and so4 2 in confined aquifers in these two locations figs s5 and s6 these components are highly concentrated in deep fluids in the study area and can be used to identify upwelling signals of these fluids hosono et al 2018 specific well monitoring surveys in these spots showed the same trends kawagoshi et al 2018 the location of a hydrochemical anomaly in the northern groundwater flow area coincides with the highest temperature 23 c gradient zone aist 2014 and water levels in deep boreholes 1000 m in depth increased by a few meters immediately after the main shock these observations support our hypothesis that this indicates deep fluid upwelling as identified elsewhere tsunogai and wakita 1995 skelton et al 2014 barberio et al 2017 the contribution of deep fluids appeared within a few months and continued for at least 2 years after the main shock figs 3 4c and d s5 and s6 this deep fluid upwelling occurred under crustal expansion hosono et al 2019 thus pressurized fluids in the crust deeper than 200 m total thickness of the aquifer systems ascend to shallower aquifers through structural breaks a similar mechanism was proposed to explain deep fluid upwelling in the aso caldera watershed hosono et al 2018 however we still do not know why the appearance of deep fluid upwelling tends to be delayed near the epicenters compared with that observed in the northern area figs 3 s5 and s6 this may be due to relatively large volumes of fresh groundwater in this downslope aquifer that mixed with the deep fluids and hence weakened the response of the upwelling signal when compared with that of the northern flow area observed anomalous increases in cl b and so4 2 figs 3 s5 and s6 occur at the same locations as increases in electrical conductivity figs s3 and s4 cl is one of the most effective parameters for identifying deep fluid upwelling after a crustal earthquake especially when used with other indicators such as b and so4 2 concentrations this finding corresponds to that in previous reports hosono et al 2018 nishio et al 2010 okuyama et al 2016 4 3 rock weathering coseismic enhancement of rock weathering andrén et al 2016 claesson et al 2004 2007 kita et al 1982 is thought to be triggered by the formation of new rock surfaces through cracking which subsequently increases water rock interactions the aquifer geology consists mainly of basaltic to rhyolitic volcanic rocks and alluvial deposits that originated from these rocks thus silicate minerals such as plagioclase olivine pyroxene and hornblende are the major rock forming minerals and the exposure of fresh surfaces could increase major cation ca2 mg2 na and k and hco3 alkalinity concentrations in groundwater by enhancing co2 mediated silicate mineral weathering dessert et al 2003 gaillardet et al 1999 however no systematic increasing trend in cation concentrations was found for any of these ions ca2 mg2 na and k table 1 in the 2 years after the earthquake except for wells in the coastal plains data not shown where water concentrations changed because of vertical water mixing by liquefaction as described previously in contrast to major cations alkalinity in confined aquifers showed an increasing trend in the northern recharge and groundwater flow areas after the main shock with factor values of mostly 1 25 fig s7 similarly but more significantly an increasing pattern was found for free co2 gas concentrations with factor values of up to 22 except near the epicenters where well waters showed a decreasing trend fig 5 two major possible causes that explain the increase in free co2 are contributions of gases from magmatic origins yamada et al 2011 and ecosystem recycled co2 in soils however the first cause can be eliminated because co2 concentrations near the epicenters decrease where deep fluid upwelling is expected thus the second cause is more plausible where co2 in unsaturated soils migrated and dissolved into groundwater thus increasing alkalinity which is directly proportional to pco2 this scenario does not contradict the previously proposed water mixing model and material transport as discussed below another possible cause of increased free co2 is degassing from dissolved co2 in groundwater triggered by seismic rupturing and shaking fujiwara et al 2016 fukuyama and suzuki 2016 goto et al 2017 or the generation of low pressure during crustal expansion hosono et al 2019 however these anomalies are distributed in recharge and flow areas but not near rupture systems fig 5 moreover it would be difficult to explain the simultaneous increase in alkalinity with this hypothesis the most pronounced coseismic concentration change in geogenic elements is an increase in dissolved silica dsi table 1 dsi concentrations increased with time over the study area with a factor value of 1 25 fig 6 concentrations of major cations ca2 mg2 na and k are in the same range in both aquifers and mountain waters spring waters in pre earthquake measurements hossain 2016 in contrast the dsi concentration in mountain waters 40 mg l 1 is generally smaller than that of aquifer waters 80 mg l 1 hossain 2016 suggesting that the observed dsi increase was not caused by a mixing of mountain waters previous laboratory experiments schrader et al 1969 and field observations kita et al 1982 wakita et al 1980 demonstrated that seismic cracking decomposes the si o bond of silicate minerals such physical decomposition of rocks dissolves sio2 into groundwater leaving other elements such as k na mg and ca in the solid phase observations on widely distributed structural deformations fujiwara et al 2016 and strong ground shaking fukuyama and suzuki 2016 support this scenario any other factors that could possibly lead to a dsi increase such as a change in ph were not observed over the study area the present study demonstrates coseismic dsi dissolution is controlled by physical mechanics and more rapid reaction compared with co2 mediated geochemical weathering reactions that causes dissolution of other minerals such as ca2 mg2 na k and other metals reactions that progress over a longer time scale ca a few decades in young volcanic fields ide et al 2018 kagabu et al 2017 post seismic increases in both co2 and dsi concentrations have rarely been reported in previous studies however these unique findings and the proposed hypotheses to explain the observed changes need to be further verified in future studies both experimentally and with more case studies in other fields in particular it is still difficult to answer why dsi continued increasing for 2 years after the earthquake fig 6 a laboratory experiment using rocks and groundwater from the same study area may provide insights to help understand the mechanisms at work in the field 4 4 material transport from surface to aquifers the other most strikingly changed parameter is organic matter table 1 the concentrations increased by a factor value of 17 within 3 months of the main shock in confined aquifers after this initial increase organic matter decreased to the original concentration levels or lower which were near the detection limits figs 7 and 8 as far as the authors know there are no previous reports of increased organic matter in regional groundwater flow systems as a result of seismic activities in the studied volcanic fan setting the major source of organic matter is surface soils but not aquifer geologies thus a sharply increased concentration in confined aquifers presents a locus of material transported from the surface to aquifers with downward flows we propose that the organic matter migrated with water drawdown through ruptures hosono et al 2019 or new pathways in the unsaturated zone mohr et al 2017 immediately after the main shock with time these organic materials were consumed by microbial respiration in aquifers to decrease their concentrations to original levels or lower figs 7 and 8 such signals are less obvious for unconfined aquifers table 1 probably because microbial decomposition of organic matter was complete before the first samples were taken after the main shock may july 2016 nitrate no3 concentrations might be useful as another indicator to evaluate the occurrence of material transport from the surface to deep aquifers because it is generally present in surface soils such as those in farmland hosono et al 2013 okumura et al 2018 but not in aquifer geologies this approach has rarely been tested in previous work interestingly kawagoshi et al 2018 reported statistically significant post seismic no3 concentration increases from two well locations at 100 and 150 m depths under farmlands in recharge areas thickness of unsaturated zone 30 m okumura et al 2018 although they have not mentioned mechanisms to cause these changes we suggest it s firm evidence showing nitrate transported with soil pore waters down to aquifers through preferential pathways triggered either by seismic vibration mohr et al 2017 or rupturing fujiwara et al 2016 however a clear geographical pattern of such no3 increases was not obtained from our dataset and neither were there any clear geographical patterns for increases in no2 and nh4 two reasons are suggested one is that the effect of dilution by the mixing of mountain waters with lower no3 concentration obscured any patterns and the other is that the changes were too small to be detected by our assessment consequently we suggest that organic matter rather than no3 is a more sensible index of material transport to confirm short term responses caused by the earthquake studied there are two specific locations that show increasing and decreasing no3 patterns after the main shock figs 9 and 10 a coseismic increase in no3 was found in urban areas both in our study site f in fig 1c 8 and 9 and in a recent report on two wells near this site kawagoshi et al 2018 exogenous microorganisms such as propionibacterium acnes were detected by clone analysis targeting the 16s rrna gene detailed results will be presented in a separate paper these microorganisms generally inhabit only surface environments such as rivers and sewer systems thus no3 and probably other contaminants were transported from surface waters in some urban areas in contrast a coseismic decrease in no3 was found in the northern groundwater flow area site g in figs 8 and 9 either dilution by mountain waters with lower concentrations or denitrification is a possible explanation for the observed coseismic no3 decline observed coseismic concentration changes in no3 seem not to have led to overall water quality deterioration in aquifer basins 2 years after the 2016 kumamoto earthquake however newly formed surface ruptures crosscut sewage networks in urban areas fig 1c and the effects of sewage leakage may appear with time unless the sewers are sealed continuous monitoring of water quality is recommended to address the issues discussed above 4 5 regional scale hydrochemical changes model the compilation of large hydrochemical datasets from administrative monitoring reports allowed us to characterize spatiotemporal changes in the regional quaternary volcanic aquifers in response to the 2016 mw 7 0 kumamoto crustal earthquake the analysis of these changing patterns using previously proposed coseismic hydrogeological change models enables the identification of hydrochemical change mechanisms at both the regional and local scales within the same watershed fig 10 we assumed that gases and solutes in unsaturated surface soils were transported into saturated aquifers with the initial drop in water levels and coseismic permeability increases led to a sharp increase in groundwater co2 gas and organic matter content by an order of magnitude higher than original levels except for stagnant groundwater in the coastal plain aquifer waters were largely diluted by the mixing of waters released from surrounding mountains and was monitored very effectively using cl concentrations the formation of ruptures and cracks decomposed si o bonds in the rock forming minerals which resulted in increased dissolved silica concentrations in aquifers mostly 1 2 times more concentrated than in pre earthquake measurements liquefaction particularly in the coastal plains caused vertical groundwater mixing across different salinity gradients localized anomalies of deep fluid upwelling were recognized using indicators such as cl b and so4 2 in localized areas with geothermal potential and near epicenters indications of a significant increase in sewage water leakage were not detected from present analysis except in a few potential locations that show slight increases in no3 during the 2 years after the earthquake the possibility of sewage leakages should be continuously examined because seismic ruptures crosscut sewage pipe networks under residential areas in general different types of hydrochemical changes and anomalies seem to broadly overlap within the recharge to discharge areas except at the coast fig 10 this indicates observed changes could be the result of a combination of more than two processes within the same area each effect can however be qualitatively distinguished using suitable tracers the identification of high intensity and localized anomalies was cross checked using multiple tracers for instance the mixing of saline water was confirmed by most of the major ions and the contribution of deep fluids was detected by several indicators such as cl so4 2 and b however not all processes could be clearly elucidated using multiple tracers the signals of non point source inputs of material such as surface soil pore waters were inconsistent in tracers such as co2 no3 and organic compounds at the site specific scale figs 5 7 and 9 there are several possible hypotheses that could explain these inconsistencies variations in the areal heterogeneity of each aquifer variations in diffusion and biochemical reaction rates among different materials and offsets between production and consumption in carbon and nitrogen cycles through the decomposition of organic compounds the proposed model and approaches could be useful for understanding systems in other aquifers however more case studies are required to understand entire systems at the global scale 5 conclusions the detailed mechanisms and processes of geochemical changes in response to the 2016 mw 7 0 kumamoto crustal earthquake were described in terms of regional groundwater flow systems by using a large amount of hydrochemical data from 139 wells of the 82 measured parameters 29 showed changed concentrations the biggest changes were for dissolved silica 76 of total wells free carbon dioxide 60 total organic compounds 48 and chloride 46 our results suggest that seismic rupturing triggered si o bond cleavage in rocks which resulted in silica dissolution in the study area in addition seismic structural breaks play an important role in the pathway of deep fluid upwelling at the localized scale for instance in the vicinity of earthquake epicenters materials are transported from the deep crust and also from surface soils these materials include organic matter and nitrate including gases i e co2 that infiltrate into aquifers and are transported from the recharge to the discharge areas the hydrochemistry of regional groundwater flow systems can be significantly altered by the mixing of mountain waters co seismically released by permeability enhancement which in the case of our study were most clearly detected by diluted cl concentrations in recharge areas near mountain feet our study demonstrates that the changes in groundwater chemistry of multiple parameters can be explained by related scenarios consisting of several different processes and a good understanding of coseismic hydrogeological change mechanisms at the regional scale findings insights and approaches from this study can serve as an important basis for understanding groundwater quality changes in response to large crustal earthquakes in active groundwater flow systems such as volcanic and sedimentary fan aquifers either in a

increases any type of production lamas and giacaglia 2013 lee and chang 2018 pottmaier et al 2013 this is corroborated by the fact that countries such as pakistan in 2010 had a high rate of population growth and had been facing high energy demand resulting in a loss of 2 5 of gdp and unemployment of approximately half a million people in various industrial sectors aized et al 2018 few decades the energy matrix considered only economic growth regardless of the impacts on scarce primary sources of energy production corroborating the aspects that contributed to the use of fossil fuels as a primary source of energy was the lower final cost for production and consumption as compared to those of renewable sources of energy with greater acceptance hamed and bressler 2019 helm and mier 2019 at present about 80 of consumption comes from fossil fuels as the primary form of energy evidencing the total dependence of the society in non renewable sources energy which also contribute to global

though hydroelectric power is considered as having lesser environmental impacts than the other sources its impacts must be considered since it is subject to climatic conditions representing a risk to the respective countries especially when extreme climatic events have become increasingly frequent and threatening jong 2018 lorenzon 2018 therefore the hydropower potential should be evaluated while considering its potential environmental and social impacts filho et al 2017 moretto et al 2012 and respecting the priority given to human consumption of water ruffato ferreira 2017 therefore it is important to perform a comprehensive survey on the target basin prior to the start of the construction phase of each hydroelectric project evaluating specific processes to determine potential sites for hydroelectric projects in a the basin serpoush et al 2017 the aspects that should be evaluated are the possible flooding area in the case of shps exclusive areas protected or infrastructure and the economic viability factor resulting from the balance between energy generation and implementation costs the rigidity of processes for the implementation of hydroelectric projects requires that the possible locations of implantation are more assertive considering the primary exclusionary variables for project implantation thereby making it possible to target resources for more specific studies

implementation of the projects bayazıt et al 2017 the use of gis has led to a consolidation of the evaluation and analysis of the existing hydroelectric potential for small streams and has proven useful for the development of several methodologies that can be used to calculate hydroelectric power potentials bayazıt et al 2017 the evaluations and analysis of locations for the implementation of shps are decisive with respect to the hydropower energy attainable since the production is mainly related to the turbine head and the corresponding flow in order to optimally use hydropower it is necessary to carry out an assessment of the water resources and the characteristics of the terrain these surveys are expensive and time consuming so a reliable evaluation of the resources poses a constraint in terms of successful planning kusre et al 2010 traditionally the evaluation of water resources has been carried out using historical flow data observed at the outlet of the watershed through fluviometric stations the limitation of this method is the regionalization of the data since the evaluation is carried out for each point disregarding the other regions of the watershed resulting in little information in projects dependent on water resources these disadvantages can be overcome by using more recent modeling parameters with the use of geotechnology it is possible to generate data in order to evaluate variables such as flow estimation and characteristics of the hydrological basin the objective of this study was to evaluate the availability of water resources and hydroelectric power potential of shps with and without dams considering restrictive variables such as flooded areas preservation areas slope infrastructure indigenous land consolidated area and other aspects that may make the project environmentally and technologically unviable 2 material and methods 2 1 parana 3 hydrographic basin the energy potential was assessed within the boundary of the paraná hydrographic basin 3 bp3 located in the western region of the state of paraná brazil containing 28 municipalities the region is characterized by no tillage systems aimed at the production of soybeans corn and wheat with some areas occupied by pastures the climate is classified as subtropical humid presenting hot summers relatively cold winters with precipitations that are concentrated during the year with means of precipitation and temperatures at 1850 mm and 22 c respectively miguel lenz et al 2019 see fig 1 the study area consists of areas essential for biodiversity conservation and maintenance of resources such as conservation units biodiversity corridors private heritage reserves and areas of relevant ecological interest silva 2018 such areas were included in the diagnosis and survey of potential areas for the installation of hydroelectric projects 2 2 application of geotechnology in order to estimate the hydropower potential of bp3 primary data obtained by the survey of all existing preservation areas hydrological data from nine stations locate in bp3 basin in western region of paraná with data taken every hour and the digital elevation model dem provided by the topodata project valeriano and rossetti 2008 were used the data was corrected for spurious depressions which consist of particular cells surrounded by other cells with higher values of elevation that do not guarantee the consistency of the surface flow and hence could not be used as input data for the generation of drainage directions and drainage networks zhu et al 2006 see fig 2 the hydropower potential of the region was estimated by a stage wise approach using the data of drainage direction and drainage networks the stages consisted of a river segmentation and obtaining the vertex b generation of contribution areas c morphometric characterization of the contribution areas and hydropower potential estimation d classification of potential points and e flooding to potential points 2 3 segmentation of rivers and obtaining vertices data obtained from drainage courses raster were converted to a vector form and segmented with maximum values of 450 m length due increment height 10 m in the slope calculation segment where was obtained a minimum slope 2 for this research later height values were obtained for each segment in the segment shapefile applying statistical function of qgis 3 0 since it allows importing the statistical information maximum and minimum heights of the dem pixels for each segment thus the data were organized in an attribute table to calculate the slope of the river stretch st by using eq 1 baena et al 2004 1 s t ampl d 100 where st is the slope in the stretch ampl is the difference of heights m d is the extension of the segment m potential points were chosen depending on slope values for the installation of shps the values of st lower than 2 were excluded since sections with st less than 2 require a higher height and consequently a larger area for power generation faria 2011 larentis 2010 zaidi and khan 2018 since the hydropower potential of rors is not related to the section the entire vertices were analyzed while also evaluating the difference of heights of the surrounding pixels with respect to the point analyzed a distance of 60 m was established around the point for height analysis for potential calculations of rors in order to obtain the difference of dimensions between two pixels 2 4 generation of contribution areas in order to carry out a detailed study of the contribution areas the drainage network of the paraná basin 3 was segmented into stretches with a maximum extension of 450 m this level of detail coupled with the detail level of the drainage network generated a large number of stretches for calculations it was necessary to establish a routine using python language so that the process of generating contribution areas could be performed in an automated manner the code uses qgis processing modules gdal and ogr libraries as well as grass software algorithms for generating contribution areas the entire process was performed through a loop on a table in comma separated values csv file format obtained by generating the vertices in the previous step the table had coordinate attributes x and y in the plane used as the location of the point of watershed outlet so that the algorithm r water outlet embedded in the python code could be executed thus generating a shapefile of the catchment areas of each point 2 5 morphometric characterization of catchment areas and estimation of hydropower potential the morphometric analysis of a contribution area helps in interpreting valuable information about the drainage flows of a basin allowing geohydrological understanding of its terrain asfaw and workineh 2019 a previous report kannan et al 2018 conducted a morphometric characterization of eight micro basins using gis techniques on a srtm model to determine aspects such as drainage density compaction coefficients declivity length of rivers and form factor that can help in planning watershed management in order to obtain the energy potential it was necessary to estimate the flow rate at each point of installation of generating units the process to obtain this flow consisted using parameters obtained through morphometric characterization as explanatory variables in a multiple regression model thus the multi polygon data generated in the previous process was input into the postgresql postgis database to perform the morphometric characterization calculations in order to subsidize the application in the model the morphometric characterization of each contribution area was generated by using an sql script which generated a new multi polygon file in the database containing the variable s area perimeter axial length sum of drains drainage density compactness index shape index shape factor and slope chandrashekar et al 2015 kumar rai et al 2017 subsequently using the principal components analysis it was found that two components explained 83 of the variables thereafter multiple regression model and their respective coefficients were established for flow estimation considering dry and rainy periods in bp3 see table 1 thus a multiple regression model for flow estimation were established from two main components generating a database to be use in the region for the calculation of the energy generation potential the database was created considering the dry period in bp3 basin which corresponds between march and august supporting the results reliable for energy security the coefficients for the flow estimation of the regression model for dry periods are presented in table 2 followed by eq 2 of the model 2 q x 2 c 2 x 5 c 5 where q is the estimated flow m3s 1 x is the representative variable for flow estimation and c is the multiple regression coefficient the flow at each point was estimated using the equation 2 with the results of morphometric characterization of the contribution areas also not only were the aspects of contribution area were considered as independent variables in the generation of a simple regression model for regionalization of flows but also all variables representative of the model were considered in order to subsidize the firm energy estimate in each analyzed point firm energy was obtained by considering the level of difference between variables in a given section using the difference between the estimated flow the estimated flow result of each point using multiple regression model and the ecological flow a flow to maintain good habitat quality to estimate the ecological flow the tennant methodology was used which assigns 10 of the average annual flow as sufficient for sustaining living conditions in precarious conditions 30 to maintain good habitat quality and 60 to 100 to promote excellent quality thereof karakoyun et al 2018 the value of 70 of the estimated flow rate was used for the energetic potential in order to consider the minimum aspects of environmental conditions for maintaining biota larentis 2010 the equation used to calculate the firm energy is represented by equation 3 3 p n q t h a 8 85 where pn is the firm energy kilowatts medians qt is the estimated flow m3s 1 considering reserve of 30 for ecological flow ha is the level difference in section plus incremental height 8 85 is the coefficient of efficiency the process to identify potential points was conducted using estimated flow and energy data the points were extracted from the database and prepared separately for potentials for rors up to 3 mw and shps 3 to 30 mw considering rors a buffer of 60 m under the point used to incorporate altimetry values greater than 0 and less than or equal to 3 mw of firm energy no intersection with layers of conservation units indigenous lands ecological corridors highways railways and transmission lines made available by the ministry of environment and land institute cartography and geology of parana shps the difference of level in the section analyzed analysis in sections with declivity above 2 incremental height for calculation of firm energy equal to 10 m potential above 3 mw and less than 30 mw no intersection with layers of conservation units indigenous lands ecological corridors highways railways and transmission lines provided by the ministry of environment and land institute cartography and geology of paraná before and after the generation of flooded areas 2 6 classification of potential points one of the elements that was used for filtering potential points was the slope factor but this factor was applied only to shps though the study also considered generation from rors it should be noted that in the case of shps this analysis was conducted in two parts the initial filtering of the points slope and exclusion factors and the generation of flood area also used as exclusion factor unlike the rors which have no wet area 2 7 flood areas for potential points in order to generate the flood areas of the potential points of construction of shps thus confirming its final feasibility of construction the r lake xy escobar villanueva et al 2019 module of the grass software was used which has a function of generating the coverage area from a predetermined height hence the sum of difference in heights obtained from the maximum and minimum values and the maximum incremental height of a dam for shp 10 m was used to obtain the estimated flooding area for each point similar to the generation of contribution area the execution of this process required considerable amount of time due to the dimension of the potential points existing in the parana basin 3 thus the process of automating the algorithm was achieved by using the python language embedded in qgis software after the generation of the areas they were subjected to new filtering analyzes to verify their intersections with excluding factors and to determine the potential points 3 results and discussion indonesia has about 80 of its population in rural areas with low access to the electricity grid and is considered representative of the country s poor with its energy matrix based on hydroelectric biomass wind and nuclear power hydroelectric energy corresponds to 75 gw and small hydroelectric projects represent about 500 mw purwanto and afifah 2016 in the democratic republic of congo remote areas and local water characteristics made it possible for the population to start developing shps that provide a sustainable and economically viable alternative that also helped promote community involvement in local solutions kenfack et al 2014 in india there are shps of up to 100 kw that are very important in remote and mountainous areas as they can be used on the streams near various properties to produce energy for areas with domestic commercial industrial and community needs bhatt et al 2016 setiawan 2015 used gis to evaluate hydropower potential considering the use of statistical methods and spatial data analysis identifying potential sites for the implantation of units up to 5 2 mw in these studies the remote sensing data and gis tools enabled the identification of potential hydroelectric dams there were 3899 points that were evaluated for the energy generation potential as shown in fig 3 which was obtained from the segmentation process of the rivers of bp3 performed with altimetric data the results obtained corroborated the assertion of zaidi and khan 2018 that the use of geotechnology reduces uncertainties by identifying suitable locations for the installation of cost effective hydroelectric plants the implementation of hydroelectric plants often faces pressures from institutions due to their impacts however shps use the natural flow of river water and are considered more economically viable and sustainable as they are not associated with deforestation and considerable flooding kumar sharma and thakur 2017 another aspect that contributes to the implementation of shps is the provision of electricity with lower taxes once the use of hydroelectricity is considered mature flexible and reliable a reduction in energy taxes would provide greater incentives to production improving profits increasing competitiveness and employment and bringing economic developing to the region adom et al 2018 shps generate energy as the water passes through a turbine most of these plants depend on the natural flow of the river to generate energy ferreira 2016 therefore the impact of climate change on the hydrological cycle will affect the entire system gaudard 2014 therefore water flow is one of the major determining parameters for the generation of energy hence in order to obtain conservative production potential values the coefficients referring to the dry period were used as the production of electricity may even cease when water levels may fall due to droughts or water extraction yildiz and vrugt 2019 the estimation of flow data was conducted through a multiple regression model obtained using principal component analysis where the kaiser criteria was used to define components with eigenvectors greater than 1 to be used as principal components to explain the variability of the data morton and altschul 2019 thus the significance of the application of the two component model was verified and the coefficients of the significant explanatory variables were used for estimating the flow see fig 4 and tables 3 4 and 5 from the 3899 points evaluated the são francisco river basin sub basin had the highest number of points 1548 and also presented the second highest average flow estimated among the 10 representative sub basins for the potential survey this sub basin has the são francisco small hydroelectric power plant which currently has an installed capacity of 14 mw a n e e l 2017 the arroio guaçu sub basin had the highest estimated flow 23 69 m3s 1 with 777 points for the evaluation of the hydroelectric potential and had an shp called moinho with an installed capacity of 3 7 mw a n e e l 2017 gis analyses have been used to locate potential shps using engineering criteria rojanamon et al 2009 in addition to engineering criteria the use of this tool through filters allows considering the environmental aspects considering the sensitive areas in the survey of potential points thus the filtration with respect to the sensitive areas resulted in a total of 3477 potential points with an estimated potential of rors potential between 0 and 3 mw for the main streams of the region fig 5 shows the regions with grouped potential and regions with the highest number of potential points with grouped energy generation capacities in order to define locations suitable for prospecting and field survey presenting the best possible option for deployment of generating units of this size through the diagnosis of potential hydroelectric power plant locations it is possible to visualize that considering sensitive areas as a limiting factor and potentials above 1 mw up to the limit for the implantation of these 3 mw units five sub basins can be considered as a priority presented in table 6 the filtering process in order to identify potential points of shps that is units with production potential of 3 to 30 mw considered among the 3899 points the exclusion factors of slopes lower than 2 the remaining 510 points were used for the calculation of firm energy where 70 of the estimated flow was considered reserving 30 for ecological flow the height of the section plus an incremental height of 10 m along with an efficiency conversion factor resulted in shortlisting of 66 preliminary layers to be used in the last phase of filtering which is the intersection of its flooded areas with the restrictive layers thus the 66 features after being subjected to an evaluation of possible interceptions resulted in 48 potential points grouped in intervals of generation potentials fig 6 as regions of interest with different generation capacities the 48 points were distributed under three sub basins arroio guaçu são francisco verdadeiro and são francisco falso as shown in fig 7 in order to achieve an even greater refinement in the points surveyed the areas of each flooded area were calculated thus allowing for point information showing the potential mw medians flooded area km2 and a factor of efficiency of each point considering these two variables as shown in fig 8 thus analyzing the results obtained from the processed points it was possible to establish the priority points for detailed studies considering their production efficiency based on data processed for shps the parana 3 basin presented a theoretical power generation potential of 229 67 mw kusre et al 2010 identified 107 sites in the umkhen basin located in northeastern india with a theoretical potential of 133 mw generated by micro units with capacity less than 50 mw bayazıt et al 2017 carried out a study in the central region of bilecik located in the marmara region turkey and found 85 shp points ranging from 100 to 500 kw h and 76 points with mini hydropower potentials ranging from 100 to 225 kw year loads greater than 50 mwh cannot be installed in this region another aspect to be analyzed from the information obtained from the processed data of potential points of shps consisted of the units already existing in bp3 thus corroborating the information generated by the model and installed power thus on verifying points 8 and 26 of the são francisco verdadeiro and arroio guaçu basins respectively an installed power of 14 and 3 7 mw was observed against a modeled power of 11 62 and 5 46 mw respectively 4 conclusions the provision of electricity to the population especially in remote areas allows the elevation of quality of life and availability of resources that are directly linked to technological development and energy production which are the factors that favor the economic and environmental growth manzano agugliaro et al 2017 assigns an important role to shps in meeting future energy needs with emphasis on developing countries that have large population without access to energy and demonstrates the effectiveness of hydroelectric units to legislators because the projects have a lower cost and environmental impact compared to those of the conventional electricity systems this study surveyed 3477 potential points for rors with potential up to 3 mw and 48 potential points for shps between 3 and 30 mw considering the restrictive aspects of installation in the region thus generating a database that allowed for the diagnosis of the study area thereby generating interest regarding the need for more detailed studies of points with high energy generation potential in the region with the use of geotechnology estimates of hydropower potential for rors and shp projects in the paraná basin 3 were established locating potential points in

5976,brazil s energy matrix is based on hydroelectric plants in the current scenario studies must be conducted to verify the possible environmental impacts and production viability in order to determine sites most suitable for installing hydroelectric units a process was developed to identify potential sites to install hydroelectric units using geotechnology considering morphometric analysis of watershed obtained using python scripts plpgsql and r this process enabled the generation of multiple regression models for flow estimates flooded areas and estimates of the hydropower potential of the region from the 3899 points analyzed 3477 points showed potential for run of river hydroelectricity generating plants production up to 3 mw and 48 points showed potential for small hydroelectric plants shps production between 3 mw and 30 mw the limiting factors were assessed by using the intersect geoprocessing tool where points that intersected with excluding factors such as environmental or infrastructure elements were excluded from the analysis in addition an efficiency coefficient was established for the shps by correlating potential and flooded areas demonstrating the best points for the implementation of shp and considering the potential impacts of the reservoir keywords geotechnology process automation gis flow estimation hydrographic basin hydroelectric

will approach 9 3 billion desa 2017 and that the corresponding energy required will need to be produced considering renewable and sustainable sources carvalho and sauer 2013 the consumption and availability of electricity can be considered as a thermometer on the social and economic development of a society since the industrial revolution electricity has been known as the propellant that increases any type of production lamas and giacaglia 2013 lee and chang 2018 pottmaier et al 2013 this is corroborated by the fact that countries such as pakistan in 2010 had a high rate of population growth and had been facing high energy demand resulting in a loss of 2 5 of gdp and unemployment of approximately half a million people in various industrial sectors aized et al 2018 few decades the energy matrix considered only economic growth regardless of the impacts on scarce primary sources of energy production corroborating the aspects that contributed to the use of fossil fuels as a primary source of energy was the lower final cost for production and consumption as compared to those of renewable sources of energy with greater acceptance hamed and bressler 2019 helm and mier 2019 at present about 80 of consumption comes from fossil fuels as the primary form of energy evidencing the total dependence of the society in non renewable sources energy which also contribute to global climate change harjanne and korhonen 2019 mohammadi and mehrpooya 2018 and the requirement of finding new generation sources and different network constructions in both developed and developing countries bayazıt et al 2017 hammid et al 2018 therefore the use of renewable sources has been considered as one of the key strategies for reducing the environmental impacts associated with the use of fossil fuels due the influence co2 emissions from the energy sector ferreira 2016 grigoriu et al 2018 khatiwada 2012 panić 2013 another problem it is the energy demand to supply the increase of

though several technologies are being used to generate energy looking at the growing energy demand it is essential that energy producers improve the accessibility of energy to the end user khan et al 2019 lee 2018 while environmental impacts such as climate change and atmospheric pollution are the drivers for a global energy transition with combinations of resource alternatives there is a need to develop technologies and formulate policies that can ease the availability and use of renewable sources gielen et al 2019 small hydroelectric power plants shps are among the leading sources of electricity dudhani et al 2006 and are a source of clean energy aggidis 2010 bayazıt et al 2017 dursun and gokcol 2011 mishra et al 2011 among the aspects that make it the top of the list are the characteristics of electrification of remote areas allowing the improvement of energy quality as well as improving socio economic conditions of these areas pottmaier et al 2013 shps are considered renewable due to the repeated use of water energy which due to the hydrological cycle gives this resource the reservoir renewal factor ferreira 2016 among the advantages of using this type of energy

generating the vertices in the previous step the table had coordinate attributes x and y in the plane used as the location of the point of watershed outlet so that the algorithm r water outlet embedded in the python code could be executed thus generating a shapefile of the catchment areas of each point 2 5 morphometric characterization of catchment areas and estimation of hydropower potential the morphometric analysis of a contribution area helps in interpreting valuable information about the drainage flows of a basin allowing geohydrological understanding of its terrain asfaw and workineh 2019 a previous report kannan et al 2018 conducted a morphometric characterization of eight micro basins using gis techniques on a srtm model to determine aspects such as drainage density compaction coefficients declivity length of rivers and form factor that can help in planning watershed management in order to obtain the energy potential it was necessary to estimate the flow rate at each point of installation of generating units the process to obtain this flow consisted using parameters obtained through morphometric characterization as explanatory variables in a multiple regression model thus the multi polygon data generated in the previous process was input into the postgresql postgis database to perform the morphometric characterization calculations in order to subsidize the application in the model the morphometric characterization of each contribution area was generated by using an sql script which generated a new multi polygon file in the database containing the variable s area perimeter axial length sum of drains drainage density compactness index shape index shape factor and slope chandrashekar et al 2015 kumar rai et al 2017 subsequently using the principal components analysis it was found that two components explained 83 of the variables thereafter multiple regression model and their respective coefficients were established for flow estimation considering dry and rainy periods in bp3 see table 1 thus a multiple regression model for flow estimation were established from two main components generating a database to be use in the region for the calculation of the energy generation potential the database was created considering the dry period in bp3 basin which corresponds between march and august supporting the results reliable for energy security the coefficients for the flow estimation of the regression model for dry periods are presented in table 2 followed by eq 2 of the model 2 q x 2 c 2 x 5 c 5 where q is the estimated flow m3s 1 x is the representative variable for flow estimation and c is the multiple regression coefficient the flow at each point was estimated using the equation 2 with the results of morphometric characterization of the contribution areas also not only were the aspects of contribution area were considered as independent variables in the generation of a simple regression model for regionalization of flows but also all variables representative of the model were considered in order to subsidize the firm energy estimate in each analyzed point firm energy was obtained by considering the level of difference between variables in a given section using the difference between the estimated flow the estimated flow result of each point using multiple regression model and the ecological flow a flow to maintain good habitat quality to estimate the ecological flow the tennant methodology was used which assigns 10 of the average annual flow as sufficient for sustaining living conditions in precarious conditions 30 to maintain good habitat quality and 60 to 100 to promote excellent quality thereof karakoyun et al 2018 the value of 70 of the estimated flow rate was used for the energetic potential in order to consider the minimum aspects of environmental conditions for maintaining biota larentis 2010 the equation used to calculate the firm energy is represented by equation 3 3 p n q t h a 8 85 where pn is the firm energy kilowatts medians qt is the estimated flow m3s 1 considering reserve of 30 for ecological flow ha is the level difference in section plus incremental height 8 85 is the coefficient of efficiency the process to identify potential points was conducted using estimated flow and energy data the points were extracted from the database and prepared separately for potentials for rors up to 3 mw and shps 3 to 30 mw considering rors a buffer of 60 m under the point used to incorporate altimetry values greater than 0 and less than or equal to 3 mw of firm energy no intersection with layers of conservation units indigenous lands ecological corridors highways railways and transmission lines made available by the ministry of environment and land institute cartography and geology of parana shps the difference of level in the section analyzed analysis in sections with declivity above 2 incremental height for calculation of firm energy equal to 10 m potential above 3 mw and less than 30 mw no intersection with layers of conservation units indigenous lands ecological corridors highways railways and transmission lines provided by the ministry of environment and land institute cartography and geology of paraná before and after the generation of flooded areas 2 6 classification of potential points one of the elements that was used for filtering potential points was the slope factor but this factor was applied only to shps though the study also considered generation from rors it should be noted that in the case of shps this analysis was conducted in two parts the initial filtering of the points slope and exclusion factors and the generation of flood area also used as exclusion factor unlike the rors which have no wet area 2 7 flood areas for potential points in order to generate the flood areas of the potential points of construction of shps thus confirming its final feasibility of construction the r lake xy escobar villanueva et al 2019 module of the grass software was used which has a function of generating the coverage area from a predetermined height hence the sum of difference in heights obtained from the maximum and minimum values and the maximum incremental height of a dam for shp 10 m was used to obtain the estimated flooding area for each point similar to the generation of contribution area the execution of this process required considerable amount of time due to the dimension of the potential points existing in the parana basin 3 thus the process of automating the algorithm was achieved by using the python language embedded in qgis software after the generation of the areas they were subjected to new filtering analyzes to verify their intersections with excluding factors and to determine the potential points 3 results and discussion indonesia has about 80 of its population in rural areas with low access to the electricity grid and is considered representative of the country s poor with its energy matrix based on hydroelectric biomass wind and nuclear power hydroelectric energy corresponds to 75 gw and small hydroelectric projects represent about 500 mw purwanto and afifah 2016 in the democratic republic of congo remote areas and local water characteristics made it possible for the population to start developing shps that provide a sustainable and economically viable alternative that also helped promote community involvement in local solutions kenfack et al 2014 in india there are shps of up to 100 kw that are very important in remote and mountainous areas as they can be used on the streams near various properties to produce energy for areas with domestic commercial industrial and community needs bhatt et al 2016 setiawan 2015 used gis to evaluate hydropower potential considering the use of statistical methods and spatial data analysis identifying potential sites for the implantation of units up to 5 2 mw in these studies the remote sensing data and gis tools enabled the identification of potential hydroelectric dams there were 3899 points that were evaluated for the energy generation potential as shown in fig 3 which was obtained from the segmentation process of the rivers of bp3 performed with altimetric data the results obtained corroborated the assertion of zaidi and khan 2018 that the use of geotechnology reduces uncertainties by identifying suitable locations for the installation of cost effective hydroelectric plants the implementation of hydroelectric plants often faces pressures from institutions due to their impacts however shps use the natural flow of river water and are considered more economically viable and sustainable as they are not associated with deforestation and considerable flooding kumar sharma and thakur 2017 another aspect that contributes to the implementation of shps is the provision of electricity with lower taxes once the use of hydroelectricity is considered mature flexible and reliable a reduction in energy taxes would provide greater incentives to production improving profits increasing competitiveness and employment and bringing economic developing to the region adom et al 2018 shps generate energy as the water passes through a turbine most of these plants depend on the natural flow of the river to generate energy ferreira 2016 therefore the impact of climate change on the hydrological cycle will affect the entire system gaudard 2014 therefore water flow is one of the major determining parameters for the generation of energy hence in order to obtain conservative production potential values the coefficients referring to the dry period were used as the production of electricity may even cease when water levels may fall due to droughts or water extraction yildiz and vrugt 2019 the estimation of flow data was conducted through a multiple regression model obtained using principal component analysis where the kaiser criteria was used to define components with eigenvectors greater than 1 to be used as principal components to explain the variability of the data morton and altschul 2019 thus the significance of the application of the two component model was verified and the coefficients of the significant explanatory variables were used for estimating the flow see fig 4 and tables 3 4 and 5 from the 3899 points evaluated the são francisco river basin sub basin had the highest number of points 1548 and also presented the second highest average flow estimated among the 10 representative sub basins for the potential survey this sub basin has the são francisco small hydroelectric power plant which currently has an installed capacity of 14 mw a n e e l 2017 the arroio guaçu sub basin had the highest estimated flow 23 69 m3s 1 with 777 points for the evaluation of the hydroelectric potential and had an shp called moinho with an installed capacity of 3 7 mw a n e e l 2017 gis analyses have been used to locate potential shps using engineering criteria rojanamon et al 2009 in addition to engineering criteria the use of this tool through filters allows considering the environmental aspects considering the sensitive areas in the survey of potential points thus the filtration with respect to the sensitive areas resulted in a total of 3477 potential points with an estimated potential of rors potential between 0 and 3 mw for the main streams of the region fig 5 shows the regions with grouped potential and regions with the highest number of potential points with grouped energy generation capacities in order to define locations suitable for prospecting and field survey presenting the best possible option for deployment of generating units of this size through the diagnosis of potential hydroelectric power plant locations it is possible to visualize that considering sensitive areas as a limiting factor and potentials above 1 mw up to the limit for the implantation of these 3 mw units five sub basins can be considered as a priority presented in table 6 the filtering process in order to identify potential points of shps that is units with production potential of 3 to 30 mw considered among the 3899 points the exclusion factors of slopes lower than 2 the remaining 510 points were used for the calculation of firm energy where 70 of the estimated flow was considered reserving 30 for ecological flow the height of the section plus an incremental height of 10 m along with an efficiency conversion factor resulted in shortlisting of 66 preliminary layers to be used in the last phase of filtering which is the intersection of its flooded areas with the restrictive layers thus the 66 features after being subjected to an evaluation of possible interceptions resulted in 48 potential points grouped in intervals of generation potentials fig 6 as regions of interest with different generation capacities the 48 points were distributed under three sub basins arroio guaçu são francisco verdadeiro and são francisco falso as shown in fig 7 in order to achieve an even greater refinement in the points surveyed the areas of each flooded area were calculated thus allowing for point information showing the potential mw medians flooded area km2 and a factor of efficiency of each point considering these two variables as shown in fig 8 thus analyzing the results obtained from the processed points it was possible to establish the priority points for detailed studies considering their production efficiency based on data processed for shps the parana 3 basin presented a theoretical power generation potential of 229 67 mw kusre et al 2010 identified 107 sites in the umkhen basin located in northeastern india with a theoretical potential of 133 mw generated by micro units with capacity less than 50 mw bayazıt et al 2017 carried out a study in the central region of bilecik located in the marmara region turkey and found 85 shp points ranging from 100 to 500 kw h and 76 points with mini hydropower potentials ranging from 100 to 225 kw year loads greater than 50 mwh cannot be installed in this region another aspect to be analyzed from the information obtained from the processed data of potential points of shps consisted of the units already existing in bp3 thus corroborating the information generated by the model and installed power thus on verifying points 8 and 26 of the são francisco verdadeiro and arroio guaçu basins respectively an installed power of 14 and 3 7 mw was observed against a modeled power of 11 62 and 5 46 mw respectively 4 conclusions the provision of electricity to the population especially in remote areas allows the elevation of quality of life and availability of resources that are directly linked to technological development and energy production which are the factors that favor the economic and environmental growth manzano agugliaro et al 2017 assigns an important role to shps in meeting future energy needs with emphasis on developing countries that have large population without access to energy and demonstrates the effectiveness of hydroelectric units to legislators because the projects have a lower cost and environmental impact compared to those of the conventional electricity systems this study surveyed 3477 potential points for rors with potential up to 3 mw and 48 potential points for shps between 3 and 30 mw considering the restrictive aspects of installation in the region thus generating a database that allowed for the diagnosis of the study area thereby generating interest regarding the need for more detailed studies of points with high energy generation potential in the region with the use of geotechnology estimates of hydropower potential for rors and shp projects in the paraná basin 3 were established locating potential points in

5977,this study attempted to develop a point surface collaborative inversion psci method for the estimation of regional surface soil moisture ssm using a generalized regression neural network grnn trained on sparse ground based measurements specifically grnn was employed to establish a nonlinear relationship between ground based measurements from sparse network stations snss and passive microwave observations from the soil moisture active passive smap satellite in the continental u s for april 2015 to march 2018 more importantly the extended triple collocation etc technique was applied to address the scale mismatch issue resulting from the small spatial support of ground based measurements whereby individual snss reliability at the smap coarse footprint scale could be determined before fed into grnn the 10 fold cross validation results showed that the grnn model trained on reliable snss obtained a satisfactory performance the cross validated r and unbiased rmse values were 0 88 and 0 050 cm3 cm 3 respectively which outperformed the back propagation neural network bpnn and the other grnn model trained on all snss furthermore temporal and spatial comparisons between the psci based ssm retrievals and other ssm datasets indicated the former agreed the best with ground measurements both in time and space suggesting the proposed psci method had shown great potential in estimating reliable regional ssm climate records keywords soil moisture data fusion grnn microwave remote sensing smap triple collocation 1 introduction soil moisture is a key climate variable in the global water cycle budget and influences the partitioning of water and energy fluxes between the terrestrial surface and the atmosphere entekhabi et al 1996 an improved observational understanding of soil moisture will therefore contribute to better monitoring of natural hazards such as drought trenberth and guillemot 1995 and flooding viterbo and betts 1999 and give us a better idea of the plant growth williams and albertson 2004 crop yield rosenzweig et al 2002 future climate change seneviratne et al 2010 etc microwave remote sensing provides a unique opportunity to estimate regional global scale surface soil moisture ssm hereinafter with satisfactory temporal coverage thanks to the all weather and all time sensing ability of microwave electromagnetic waves njoku and entekhabi 1996 wigneron et al 1998 in particular various microwave sensors onboard satellites including both passive e g the advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system amsr e onboard the aqua satellite and its successor amsr 2 onboard the global change observation mission for water gcom w satellite and active e g the advanced scatterometer ascat onboard the series of meteorological operational metop satellites have been intensively exploited to estimate ssm in the past four decades nevertheless the first dedicated ssm mission soil moisture and ocean salinity smos was not launched until 2009 by the european space agency esa then followed the soil moisture active passive smap the second and the most recent ssm dedicated mission launched by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa in 2015 entekhabi et al 2010a kerr et al 2010 by carrying the optimal l band instruments for sensing the moisture content for the top 5 cm depth of soil i e ssm these two missions are devoted to producing long term and global ssm products with the accuracy requirement of 0 04 cm3 cm 3 volumetric soil moisture unbiased root mean square error ubrmse entekhabi et al 2010a kerr et al 2016 traditionally the methodology used to produce the official smos and smap ssm products is through the inversion of radiative transfer models rtms kerr et al 2012 o neill et al 2015 the rtm describes the thermal emission from the terrestrial surface linking surface soil moisture to satellite brightness temperature observations however this emission process is affected by a large number of interacting factors e g soil texture surface roughness topography temperature and vegetation coverage the nonlinearity of this process also poses technical difficulties in quantifying the complex physical relationships hence in order to minimize the uncertainties and enhance the retrieval accuracy from remote sensing data artificial neural networks anns have been widely employed for implementing the soil moisture retrieval algorithms over the past two decades aires et al 2005 chai et al 2009 kolassa et al 2013 2016 2018 rodriguez fernandez et al 2015 santi et al 2016 anns present several advantages over rtm inversions including the potential in mapping any kind of input output relationship without an explicit parameterization of physical relationships the ability to handle numerous data from nonlinear systems and the flexibility in combining information from different sources in general ann based algorithms for the retrieval of large scale ssm are implemented through using global land surface model lsm simulations as references to train anns given lsms are able to provide soil moisture estimates at the desired temporal and spatial resolution bierkens et al 2015 several studies have utilized this approach to retrieve ssm at global scale from either passive or active instruments or a combination of the two aires et al 2005 jiménez et al 2013 kolassa et al 2013 recently the global retrieval of ssm for both smos and smap using anns are accomplished by rodriguez fernandez et al 2015 and kolassa et al 2018 taking the well known european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf model and the goddard earth observing system version 5 geos 5 model as references to train the algorithms respectively in addition there are also studies focusing on using anns to test the a priori merging of active and passive instruments such as ascat and amsr e kolassa et al 2016 2017 it was found that such synergy strategy could give much better results than the a posteriori merging of the individual retrievals from each sensor however the problem to train an ann with lsm simulations is that every lsm is affected by significant uncertainties due to the errors of model parameter estimates since soil processes are extremely difficult to parameterize vereecken et al 2016 hence ssm retrievals using lsm simulations as references are prone to suffering from uncertainties too and should be treated with caution in contrast high accuracy ground based soil moisture can be measured directly using in situ devices inserted into the soil at various depths although a great number of large scale 1002 km2 soil moisture networks vinnikov et al 1999 have been set up over the globe in the last few decades they are primarily served for the calibration validation of satellite ssm products as the site distribution is too sparse to produce soil moisture maps at regional to global scales then arises the question is there any possibility to use ground based measurements instead of lsm simulations as references to train an ann for the large scale ssm retrieval to our knowledge few studies have investigated the potential of training an ann with ground based measurements for the regional global retrieval of ssm for instance rodríguez fernández et al 2017 preliminarily used ground based measurements from three sparse soil moisture networks to train an ann for the continental scale retrieval of ssm from smos observations in north america in addition xu et al 2018 proposed a multi source data fusion method based on the generalized regression neural network they showed that it is effective to use this approach for the quality improvement of smap retrievals by training the smap level 3 radiometer ssm product with ground based measurements from five sparse networks in the western continental u s however these studies didn t try to address the spatial scale mismatch issue the biggest problem to train a neural network with ground based measurements resulting from the spatial representation difference between the point support 1 m2 of in situ probes and large footprint tens of km2 of microwave remote sensing sensors certainly this can add huge uncertainty to the training process of neural networks that takes satellite observations as input and ground based measurements as references solving the spatial scale mismatch issue between in situ and remotely sensed data remains a major challenge in response to this problem previous studies crow et al 2012 famiglietti et al 2008 have been earlier characterized the behavior of ssm variability across spatial scales and analyzed the upscaling errors from the sparse ground based measurements for the validation of the coarse resolution satellite based ssm products the triple collocation tc technique stoffelen 1998 was found more appropriate as an upscaling approach capable of compensating for the impact of random measurement error on ground based measurements after comparing it with other sophisticated ssm upscaling strategies such as the time stability approach and the block kriging algorithm crow et al 2012 furthermore chen et al 2017 first applied the extended version of tc etc method mccoll et al 2014 to assess the spatial representativeness of the sparse ground based measurements within the satellite footprint for the validation of the smap level 2 radiometer ssm product another point worth noting is that in most of the above publications that use anns to retrieve large scale ssm the back propagation neural network bpnn configuration is proposed however in spite of the popular utilization of bpnn as shown by these studies it has several limitations such as slow convergence and easily being trapped by a local minimum instead of finding the global minimum error surface yu 1992 in addition bpnn needs too much human manipulation as to the determination of the number of hidden layers and neurons an alternative to bpnn that avoids above weakness is the generalized regression neural network grnn grnn is basically an associative memory feed forward type of ann al mahasneh et al 2018 which possesses many advantages the network is able to learn from the training data by one pass and does not require an iterative procedure there is only one free parameter called the spread parameter in the network grnn estimation is always able to converge to a global solution numerous studies have demonstrated the superiority of grnn over bpnn cigizoglu and alp 2006 del rosario martinez blanco et al 2016 konate et al 2015 li et al 2017b xu et al 2018 this makes grnn one of the most popular networks in environmental monitoring from remote sensing data such as evapotranspiration modeling kişi 2006 fine particulate matter pm2 5 estimation li et al 2017b forest cover estimation boyd et al 2002 solar radiation derivation şenkal 2010 ssm retrieval ozerdem et al 2017 xu et al 2018 etc inspired by these facts above in this study we develop a novel point surface collaborative inversion psci method for estimating regional ssm from smap brightness temperature tb observations and other auxiliary data using ground based measurements from sparse network stations snss as references to train grnn in the continental u s for april 2015 to march 2018 to address the scale mismatch issue the etc technique is applied to select reliable snss before the grnn training thereby the established tb ssm relationship can become more representative the best trained grnn model is then implemented through the proposed psci process to produce regional ssm maps the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 summarized the characteristics of conus and datasets used for the development of the proposed psci method as well as for the construction of the etc triplet section 3 describes the etc method for the selection of reliable snss and the psci procedure for ssm estimation based on grnn section 4 demonstrates the results of the selected reliable snss using etc the performance of the grnn model validated through the 10 fold cross validation technique and the spatial and temporal evaluation results of the psci based ssm retrievals section 5 provides a summary and puts forward an outlook for future developments 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area of our research is the continental u s conus the conus which borders both the north atlantic and north pacific oceans and is bordered by canada and mexico has a varied topography the eastern regions consist of hills and low mountains while the central interior is a vast plain called the great plains region and the west has high rugged mountain ranges there are three major mountain ranges in conus that run north to south the appalachian mountains located in the east the rocky mountains in the central west and the sierra nevada cascade mountains in the west interspersed throughout are the great lakes in the northeast the mississippi river in the midwest the great salt lake in the west and the grand canyon in the southwest like its topography the climate of conus also varies depending on location it is considered mostly temperate but is tropical in the southeastern regions e g florida semiarid in the plains west of the mississippi river and arid in the great basin of the southwest the pacific northwest is one of the wettest parts of conus and is densely forested the rocky mountains sierra nevada cascades have typical highland climates and are also heavily forested there are several reasons why we chose conus as the study area to begin with large scale and long term soil moisture networks such as the soil climate analysis network scan and the u s climate reference network uscrn are spread across the whole conus fig 1 hence enough ground samples that overlap with satellite based data sets can be obtained to perform the subsequent collaborative inversion process in addition all soil moisture sites are evenly distributed in this region though a relatively higher density appears in the rugged west moreover operational soil moisture networks using new ground measurement technologies namely the cosmic ray soil moisture observing system cosmos network and the pbo h2o network that can provide larger spatial support of soil moisture measurements than typical point measurements derived from in situ devices are also deployed in this area such measurements are also supposed to weaken the scale mismatch issue resulting from the small spatial support of sparse ground based measurements to a certain degree 2 2 smap brightness temperature tb observations launched on 31 january 2015 the smap mission is operated by nasa and is equipped with both a radiometer passive 1 41 ghz and a high resolution radar active 1 26 ghz dedicated to measuring ssm at l band with a fixed incidence angle of 40 a revisit time of 3 days at the equator and 6 00 a m descending 6 00p m ascending local equatorial overpass times entekhabi et al 2010a although the smap radar has failed since 7 july 2015 chan et al 2016 the smap radiometer remains to operate as planned this l band radiometer observes the earth on four different channels horizontal h and vertical v polarization as well as the 3rd and 4th stokes parameter the first two channels are the primary science channels that are directly sensitive to ssm while the 3rd and 4th stokes parameters are used to help detect the radio frequency interference piepmeier et al 2014 the smap level 3 global daily brightness temperature tb product spl3tb version 5 o neill et al 2018 which is resampled to a global cylindrical 36 km equal area scalable earth grid version 2 easev2 brodzik et al 2012 was used in this study for the estimation of ssm the observed tb has been adjusted for the presence of water bodies and corrected for atmospheric and reflected sky radiation contributions from smap level 1c tb observations de lannoy et al 2015 we utilized tb observations at both h and v polarizations only from the 6 00 a m descending overpass for the reason that vertical profiles of soil and canopy temperatures are expected to be more uniform during early morning overpasses than during other times of the day basharinov and shutko 1975 note the spl3tb product is actually provided within the smap level 3 radiometer ssm product introduced below 2 3 surface soil moisture ssm datasets 2 3 1 satellite based ssm retrievals from smap the smap level 3 radiometer global daily 36 km easev2 grid soil moisture spl3smp version 5 which is a composite of level 2 half orbit soil moisture over one day is available since 31 march 2015 o neill et al 2018 in fact the retrieval of ssm from smap tb observations occurs in the level 2 processing which currently uses the v pol single channel algorithm sca v as the baseline retrieval algorithm chan et al 2016 zeng et al 2016 developed on the basis of the well known physical tau omega model o neill et al 2015 wigneron et al 1995 the spl3smp product was downloaded for the 31 march 2015 to 30 march 2018 period through the nasa national snow and ice data center distributed active archive center nsidc daac https nsidc org data spl3smp we only made use of ssm retrievals from the 6 00 a m descending overpass for the same reason as aforementioned spl3tb in addition only data pixels that are recommended for retrieval based on the smap quality flag o neill et al 2015 were used 2 3 2 ground based ssm measurements from sparse network sites snss the ground based ssm measurements used as references for the subsequent collaborative inversion process are from eight soil moisture networks distributed across conus the cosmos network zreda et al 2008 2012 the interactive roaring fork observation network iron osenga et al 2019 the pbo h2o network larson et al 2008b the real time in situ soil monitoring for agriculture risma network ojo et al 2015 the scan network schaefer et al 2007 the snowpack telemetry snotel network leavesley et al 2008 the soil moisture sensing controller and optimal estimator soilscape network moghaddam et al 2010 2016 and the uscrn network bell et al 2013 all these networks are made up of sparse network sites snss defined as the site that typically provides just one single point measurement within a satellite footprint chan et al 2016 chen et al 2017 colliander et al 2017 thus resulting in the scale mismatch issue it is worth noticing that measurements from cosmos and pbo h2o are derived based on new ssm measuring technologies which can significantly extend the spatial support of point scale in situ observations the cosmos network utilizes the so called cosmic ray moisture probe a stationary instrument that measures cosmic ray neutrons in the air whose intensity is inversely related to ssm to integrates and produces area average ssm over a footprint with a horizontal radius of 500 m desilets et al 2010 on the other hand the pbo h2o network employs the existing geodetic global position system gps equipment which has been found capable to derive roughly 1000 m2 ssm based on its nearly linear relationship with respect to the phase offset caused by the received multipath signals reflected from the land surface larson et al 2010 2008a nevertheless the footprint made by such technologies is insignificant compared to that sensed through microwave remote sensing tens of km2 thus the scale mismatch issue being unavoidable and demanding to be accounted for a total of 921 snss ssm data from aforementioned eight networks for the 31 march 2015 to 30 march 2018 period were downloaded through the international soil moisture network ismn website portal https ismn geo tuwien ac at en an well known international cooperation in the soil moisture community aiming to establish and maintain a global in situ soil moisture database dorigo et al 2011 fig 1 shows the spatial distribution of the snss in the study area and table 1 summaries the characteristics of each network only the shallowest measurements representing the moisture content of the topsoil i e ssm were considered trying to be consistent with the sensing depth 5 cm of the l band satellite it is worth noticing that sampling depth can be different among various in situ sensors for example cosmos network measures ssm within the 0 8 cm topsoil layer which is several centimeters deeper than the typical penetration depth of the l band satellite data 0 5 cm while pbo h2o network measures the identical depth of ssm to that of the l band satellite data most of the other networks measure ssm at 5 cm additionally ssm measurements that are not with good quality based on the ismn quality flag dorigo et al 2013 were masked out the time series of ground based ssm measurements from each sns are recorded at one hour intervals except for the pbo h2o network which provides only one ssm estimate for each day recorded at 12 00 utc for the hourly ssm time series only measurements that are closest to the smap 6 00 a m local equatorial overpass time using a 3 hour window for each day was taken to generate a daily time record a least of 30 daily measurements during the study time period was required for each site 2 3 3 model based ssm simulations from era interim era interim is a model based dataset released by ecmwf showing the results of a global climate reanalysis from 1979 to date and continuing to be updated in near real time dee et al 2011 it uses the tiled ecmwf scheme for surface exchange over land h tessel land surface model viterbo et al 1999 viterbo and beljaars 1995 to

addition we applied quality control to the model based ssm simulations by using the upper layer 0 7 cm soil temperature from era interim to identify times and grids where the soil temperature is below 1 c these data were deemed not feasible to generate ssm and were masked out kolassa et al 2018 2 4 auxiliary data in addition to tb observations we take advantage of another two datasets as auxiliary input to our model they are also required as auxiliary data in the smap soil moisture retrieval algorithm which include 1 surface soil temperatures ts hereinafter from the nasa s geos 5 land modeling system utilized to determine the soil surface emissivity from tb observations and 2 vegetation water contents vwc hereinafter based on an empirical relationship with respect to the normalized difference vegetation index from modis used to correct the vegetation effects for a detailed description of the two datasets readers can refer to the smap level 2 3 soil moisture passive algorithm theoretical basis document o neill et al 2015 like the spl3tb ts and vwc are also provided within the spl3smp product and have already been posted on the same 36 km easev2 grid as smap ssm note that we excluded ts values that are below 1 and vwc values that are higher than 5 kg m2 because the soil moisture retrieval is not feasible under such conditions o neill et al 2015 3 methodology 3 1 extended triple collocation etc technique for the selection of reliable snss in order to address the scale mismatch issue resulting from the small spatial support of sparse ground based measurements which can add huge uncertainty to the subsequent collaborative inversion process we turned to the triple collocation tc technique stoffelen 1998 tc is an analyzing tool for estimating the unknown random error variances of three collocated datasets of the same geophysical variable without treating any one dataset as perfectly observed truth gruber et al 2016 the basic assumptions of tc are 1 the triplet each are linearly related to the unknown truth 2 the error statistics are stable and do not change over time 3 the errors of the triplet are mutually independent of each other and 4 are independent of the true value as well according to the first assumption the collocated datasets xi can be related to the true state t via an affine error model 1 x i β i α i t ε i where β and α refer to the additive and multiplicative bias constants respectively ε is the mean zero additive error and the subscript i stands for the three collocated datasets of the same geophysical variable the objective of tc is to find a solution that individually estimates the variance of each εi in eq 1 based on the above assumptions to this end it is required to choose one dataset from the triplet as a reference and rescale the other two into the same reference data space apparently this will result in a dependency of the error variance estimates on the climatology of the scaling reference draper et al 2013 in order to address this issue mccoll et al 2014 proposed the extended triple collocation etc method which is based on exactly the same assumptions as the original tc and derives an additional performance metric the correlation coefficient of xi with respect to t as formulated below lei et al 2015 2 r etc t x i sign cov x i x j cov x i x k cov x i x i cov x j x k where the sign of retc is corrected up by assuming to be always positive in this study we applied the etc method to determine the reliability of individual sns observations in terms of their spatial representativeness over the spl3smp footprint scale i e 36 km easev2 grid following the idea of chen et al 2017 first we constructed the ssm triplet from satellite based retrievals i e smap ground based measurements i e sns and model based simulations i e era interim provided that they belong to different types of measuring systems and none of them are dependent on one another then the retc t sns can be derived based on eq 2 which indicates the relation between the sparse in situ measurements and the unknown truth within the 36 km satellite footprint scale i e it determines the fraction of footprint scale ssm dynamics captured by point scale observations at individual snss an experimental threshold of 0 7 for retc t sns was set above which the snss could be deemed as reliable this threshold was chosen after testing a series of thresholds ranging from 0 4 to 0 9 with an interval of 0 1 which will be discussed in the discussion section see section 4 4 besides a minimum threshold of 100 triplets was set to avoid sample impoverishment in addition there also exists the representation difference problem of penetration depths among different ssm datasets see section 2 3 and among various in situ sensors see table 1 draper et al 2013 had demonstrated that this would have only a marginal impact on the etc derived correlation coefficient 3 2 point surface collaborative inversion psci method for ssm estimation 3 2 1 generalized regression neural network grnn algorithm the grnn is a one pass learning algorithm first introduced by specht 1991 the network features fast learning that does not require an iterative procedure it is a powerful tool for regression approximation fitting and prediction problems assume a vector random variable x and a scalar random variable y are input and output variables respectively and can be expressed as follows 3 x x 1 x 2 x p 4 y y 1 y 2 y n t where p is the dimension of x and n is the number of observations assuming x i and yi i 1 2 n are sample values of x and y respectively the regression of y on an input value x can then be estimated by grnn as below 5 y x i 1 n y i k x x i i 1 n k x x i 6 k x x i exp d i 2 2 σ 2 d i 2 x x i t x x i where k stands for the gaussian kernel and di is the euclidean distance between x and x i last σ is called the spread parameter which is the only unknown parameter in the network and needs optimization see section 4 2 1 this free parameter affects the level of fitness in grnn architecture the larger the spread the smoother the function approximation the architecture of grnn presented in fig 2 contains four basic layers an input layer a pattern layer a summation layer and an output layer the input layer consists of p neurons where p is the dimension of the vector variable x here p 7 in our study it is completely connected to the patter layer and provides the input measurement x directly to the pattern units the pattern layer has n nodes where n is the number of training samples and each pattern unit is assigned with a sample vector x i in the training data in each node the euclidean distance between the input vector x and the assigned vector x i is first calculated and then fed into the gaussian kernel based on eq 6 the pattern unit outputs are sent to the summation units the summation layer has two types of processing units one is called the numerator part the other is the denominator part the input to the numerator unit is the sum of the pattern layer outputs each weighted by an observed output scalar yi corresponding to x i in the training samples while the input to the denominator unit is the sum of the pattern unit outputs at last the output layer has only one neuron which receives the two outputs from the summation units and divides the numerator part by the denominator part eq 5 to produce an estimate for y given x it can be seen from above that grnn memorizes every unique pattern in the training samples this is why it is a single pass learning network and does not require any back propagation algorithm in this study the input signals include seven parameters spl3tb observations at both h and v polarizations tbh tbv surface soil temperatures ts from geos 5 vegetation water contents vwc based on modis and coincident time month and location latitude and longitude of each sns the output signal is ssm in fact the essential function of grnn is to determine a non linear relationship between ssm and the primary input tb observations i e tbh and tbv as tb is directly related to ssm here ts and vwc data are also taken as auxiliary input fed into grnn in order to add contributive information to the tb ssm relationship besides coincident month latitude and longitude are used to account for the seasonal variability and spatial heterogeneity of ssm such practice has been commonly carried out in several previous studies li et al 2017b wu et al 2012 yao and lu 2014 3 2 2 procedures of the proposed psci method for ssm estimation the entire workflow of the methodology in this study is depicted in fig 3 to begin with etc method was applied to the triplet constructed from satellite ground and model based ssm to identify reliable snss then tb ts and vwc datasets were spatially and temporally matched using ground based measurements only from reliable snss as references to generate an input output training data set to be specific the site specific ssm data were collocated with the 36 km easev2 grid covering the site if one grid corresponded more than one sites then measurements from these sites were averaged afterward the generated input output training data set was fed into the grnn by taking the reliable snss ssm as references to train the network for the 31 march 2015 to 30 march 2018 period once trained the model s performance was evaluated using cross validation technique to identify the best one by tuning the spread parameter of grnn to an optimum value finally the best trained grnn model was applied to the input datasets for the whole study area and the whole period to produce maps of psci based ssm retrievals 3 3 model evaluation the 10 fold cross validation cv technique rodriguez et al 2010 is chosen to test the model s predictive power this technique is basically a resampling procedure often used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited data sample li et al 2017a b ma et al 2014 to begin with all data samples i e ssm measurements from reliable snss in this study are randomly shuffled and averagely divided into ten groups next each unique group is taken as a hold out or test data set while the remaining nine groups are taken as a training data set to fit the model then repeat fitting a model on the training set and evaluating it on the test set for every group at last evaluation scores from all ten rounds will be summarized and averaged to show how accurately the predictive model performs the results could also tell whether the model is over fitted i e the model performs better on the training set than on the test set four classic statistical metrics in the soil moisture community were adopted to give a quantitative assessment of the model performance i e the pearson correlation coefficient r unitless the root mean square error rmse cm3 cm 3 the bias cm3 cm 3 and unbiased rmse ubrmse cm3 cm 3 detailed descriptions of these indicators are provided in entekhabi et al 2010b 4 results and discussion 4 1 selection of reliable snss the number of reliable and unreliable snss for each soil moisture network at the threshold of 0 7 for the etc derived correlation coefficient is summarized in table 2 in general just 372 are considered reliable accounting for 40 of 921 snss in total to be specific both cosmos and iron remain no site which is more surprising for cosmos since it measures larger spatial support of ssm than typical point scale in situ observations perhaps this is because there exist quite a few cosmos measurements whose qualities are not good based on the ismn quality flags thus being masked out in our research that is to say not enough cosmos measurements overlap with other ssm datasets at the threshold of 100 triplets for the etc implementation for iron this phenomenon is also blamed to the poor qualities of its measurements as well as its relatively short data available period august 2012 to january 2017 see table 1 with respect the study period march 2015 to march 2018 in contrast pbo h2o the other network apart from cosmos providing large spatial support ground based measurements remains more than half of its sites which demonstrated the promising utility of applying these new ground measurement technologies in the soil moisture community the risma network kept the biggest proportion 83 of snss only one site considered unreliable whereas the snotel network left the largest number of reliable snss though only accounting for 28 of its sites the distribution of the selected reliable snss based on the etc derived correlation coefficient in excess of 0 7 from each soil moisture network is presented in fig 4 it appears from the figure that the number of reliable snss is able to cover most of conus with many clustering in the western part however there are few or nearly no reliable snss in the northeastern states of conus as well as in the southeast coast which may be due to the existence of the appalachian mountains along with the small amount of snss in the east see fig 1 in addition it makes sense that the sites neighboring the sea or lakes are mostly screened since the retrieval of satellite based ssm may be suspectable or unsuccessful due to the presence of significant water bodies within the satellite sensing footprint 4 2 assessment of the grnn model 4 2 1 model settings as mentioned in section 3 2 1 the spread parameter is the only unknown parameter in the grnn architecture therefore its optimum value requires to be identified prior to the psci process for ssm estimation this parameter affects the level of fitness in grnn architecture large values of the spread parameter tend to force the estimation to be smooth while lower values provide a closer approximation to the sample values specht 1991 in general the spread parameter must be greater than 0 and can usually range from 0 01 to 1 with good results del rosario martinez blanco et al 2016 here the 10 fold cv technique is utilized to select an appropriate value for the spread parameter a series of the spread parameter values ranging from 0 001 to 1 with the interval of 0 001 were tested to give the cross validated performance of the grnn model additionally in order to demonstrate the effect of using etc to address the scale mismatch issue two grnn models were chosen for comparison one is the grnn trained on only reliable snss the other is the one trained on all snss in the study area i e without etc implementation the variations of cv derived ubrmse statistics against the spread parameter of the two models are depicted in fig 5 it can be seen that the minimum ubrmse for these two grnn models both appear at the spread value of 0 011 besides it is apparent that the performance of the grnn trained on reliable snss is much better than the one trained on all snss which suggests the added value of the etc implementation for the selection of reliable snss to sum up the spread parameter is set as 0 011 for each model 4 2 2 algorithm for comparison in order to give a comprehensive analysis of the grnn model used in this study the popular back propagation neural network bpnn as mentioned in the introduction section was also chosen for comparison here a three layer fully connected feedforward architecture was constructed with one single hidden layer of the tangent sigmoid transfer function a classical back propagation training algorithm rumelhart et al 1995 and a levenberg marquardt approach levenberg 1944 marquardt 1963 input and output parameters of bpnn are identical with those in grnn employed in this study likewise two bpnn models that are trained on reliable and all snss respectively were taken into consideration according to previous works gardner and dorling 1998 li et al 2017b reich et al 1999 xu et al 2018 the optimum number of neurons in the hidden layer can be determined based on the range from 2 n μ to 2n 1 where n and μ are the number of neurons in the input and output layer therefore by testing a series of hidden layer neurons ranging from 6 to 16 15 neurons which performed the best using 10 fold cv not shown were chosen for the bpnn model trained on reliable snss while for the one trained on all snss 16 neurons were selected 4 2 3 overall performance of models both grnn and bpnn models were implemented through the same evaluation process using the 10 fold cv and their obtained performances are summarized in table 3 note in the table the model fitting results are from the best fitting model over the 10 rounds of the 10 fold cv while the cross validation results are the 10 round combined from the table it shows that grnn obtains much better performance than bpnn with cross validated r and ubrmse values improved by 0 13 0 08 cm3 cm 3 and 0 021 0 013 cm3 cm 3 for the model trained on all reliable snss respectively when comparing between the results using all and only reliable snss measurements the models trained on reliable snss significantly outperform those trained on all snss indicating the added value of the etc implementation for the selection of reliable snss additionally all cv derived biases are close to zero demonstrating the unbiased estimation of the models further fig 6 shows the scatter plots of model fitting and cross validation results for the grnn model trained on reliable snss from model fitting to cross validation r score drops by 0 09 from 0 97 to 0 88 which demonstrates that slight over fitting is presented in the proposed model however with the highest cross validated r 0 88 and lowest cross validated ubrmse 0 050 cm3 cm 3 the grnn model trained on reliable snss outperforms the other models therefore despite its slight over fitting the grnn model trained on reliable snss with the spread parameter of 0 011 is considered as the best trained model and is selected for the subsequent process 4 2 4 the predictive power of grnn over each sns network in order to give a comprehensive assessment of the predictive power of the grnn model the evaluation metrics between ssm estimates using the best trained grnn model hereinafter psci ssm for short and ground based measurements were calculated over each sns including both reliable and unreliable sites for comparison spl3smp is also chosen to compute its metrics against ground based measurements over each sns the spatial distribution of the calculated r and ubrmse for individual snss are depicted in fig 7 and fig 8 respectively in both figures the redder the points the better the evaluation metrics generally the number of red points for both r and ubrmse against ground based measurements has increased a lot for psci ssm with regard to spl3smp according to the statistics the number of sites with an r value greater than 0 70 is increased from 372 to 484 whereas the number of sites with ubrmse score smaller than 0 04 cm3 cm 3 is more than doubled from 141 to 346 out of the total 921 snss from a spatial point of view for spl3smp high r values in excess of 0 70 are mainly clustered in the northwestern part of conus and sparsely scattered in the mid to mid east while for psci ssm there are more red points gathering in the mid to western regions and high r values over 0 90 are further improved additionally the majority of ubrmse values for spl3smp is at the intermediate level 0 040 to 0 080 cm3 cm 3 while for psci ssm a great number of ubrmse values less than 0 040 cm3 cm 3 appear the above consequences indicate a generally satisfactory predictive power of the grnn model however it is also worth noticing that in the northeastern states and along the southeast coast both r and ubrmse against ground based measurements obtain little improvement for psci ssm with respect to spl3smp which is supposed to have something to do with the lack of reliable snss in these regions see fig 4 this suggests a further refinement of our approach regarding a flexible selection of reliable snss in the regions with a limited quantity of ground stations further the quantitative evaluation metrics over each sns were averaged on the basis of individual soil moisture networks for psci ssm and spl3smp respectively in order to get a general idea of the predictive power of grnn over each network table 4 and fig 9 note that the mean values were only computed when a site has a p value 0 05 it can be seen from table 4 and fig 9 that psci ssm outperforms the spl3smp over most of the soil moisture networks specifically psci ssm obtains higher r values than spl3smp over six soil moisture networks out of the total eight networks except for iron and uscrn however the r differences over iron and uscrn are very small only 0 04 and 0 05 for each respectively the most significant difference for r is observed over cosmos where the mean r value has increased by 0 26 for psci ssm with regard to spl3smp as for the mean rmse all networks have experienced a decline from spl3smp to psci ssm with the biggest decrease obtained over soilscape from 0 087 cm3 cm 3 to 0 064 cm3 cm 3 likewise ubrmse scores of psci ssm outperforms spl3smp over six networks all these results suggest that the grnn model can generally predict accurate ssm estimates 4 2 5 evaluation of the psci based ssm retrievals based on the above results the best trained grnn model is applied to the spl3tb observations and other auxiliary input for the whole study area and the whole study period thereby maps of ssm retrievals based on the proposed psci method are generated fig 10 displays the annual mean ssm map of the year 2017 for psci ssm in comparison with the aforementioned ssm triplet the spl3smp product era interim simulations and ground based measurements note the ground based ssm measurements are from all snss and used as the benchmark fig 10 d in general all three surface products i e psci ssm spl3smp and era interim show low ssm in the west with an increase toward the east which agrees with the topography across conus as described in section 2 1 the west is more arid than the east among them is psci ssm that reveals the most similar spatial pattern with ground based ssm than both spl3smp and era interim besides areas neighboring the sea or lakes generally have high ssm however spl3smp shows extremely high ssm at the regions adjacent to water bodies indicating these retrievals are questionable or of bad quality due to the presence of water bodies within the 36 km satellite footprint additionally era interim displays a too smooth spatial pattern in general which is difficult to capture the spatial variations of ssm the two issues of spl3smp and era interim are overcome in psci ssm suggesting our proposed psci method performs comparatively well in space furthermore in order to deepen our understanding of the temporal variations of our psci ssm product coincident time series from all ssm datasets except for era interim for brevity were inter compared for each common 36 km easev2 grid four examples of such grids are illustrated in fig 11 note that the non recommended retrievals in the spl3smp product are also displayed for a more comprehensive comparison from the figure a generally better agreement in temporal variations can be seen between psci ssm and site specific ssm time series than spl3smp the absolute values of psci ssm are much closer to site specific time series than spl3smp on one hand unrecommended retrievals in spl3smp time series e g fig 11 c and d are profoundly corrected in psci ssm on the other hand the recommended retrievals in spl3smp are also modified in psci ssm time series to more approximate the ssm values of the site specific time series moreover sharp rises in ssm time series usually following precipitation or irrigation events are precisely captured by psci ssm for most situations more importantly while over and under estimation do exist in psci ssm time series the biases are small compared to spl3smp all these findings above suggest that our proposed psci approach can produce commendably accurate ssm retrievals whose spatial and temporal patterns are more consistent with ground based measurements than the official smap level 3 radiometer ssm product 5 discussion as mentioned in section 1 the inspiration for this work is to replace the widely use of uncertain lsm simulations as training references with high accuracy ground based measurements therefore it is necessary to compare these two different datasets by taking them as references to train the networks respectively here the grnn model trained on model ssm simulations from regridded 36 km easev2 era interim was used to run the psci process for the same study area and the same study period as previous sections a spread parameter of 0 01 was set which gave the best model performance this model was then compared to the previous grnn model trained on reliable snss to be fair only model simulations that correspond with 36 km easev2 grids covering the reliable snss were taken into consideration a ground based comparison between ssm estimates using grnn trained on era interim model simulations hereinafter era psci ssm for short and those using grnn trained on reliable snss measurements hereinafter sns psci ssm for short which is identical to the psci ssm in previous sections was drawn to evaluate the models predictive power over each network table 5 and fig 12 note that the averaged metrics were only computed when a site has a p value 0 05 from table 5 and fig 12 mean r scores against ground based measurements for sns psci ssm are better than era psci ssm over all eight networks the biggest improvement of r is obtained in cosmos increasing from 0 38 for era psci ssm to 0 75 for sns psci ssm in terms of the mean rsme all networks except for the iron network experience a decline from era psci ssm to sns psci ssm a similar result can be seen for the mean ubrmse values besides the mean biases for sns psci ssm are much more satisfactory over most networks as compared to era psci ssm these results suggest that it is more appropriate to use reliable ground based measurements instead of model simulations to train the networks another important issue to be discussed is the choice of the thresholds for the etc derived correlation coefficient between in situ measurements and the unknown truth within the 36 km easev2 grid i e retc t sns in eq 2 which is supposed to affect the selection of reliable snss and the subsequent psci process here a series of thresholds ranging from 0 4 to 0 9 with the interval of 0 1 were tested for each threshold the selected reliable snss measurements were fed into grnn and ran the psci process to generate psci ssm then ubrmse scores between respective psci ssm and ground based measurements were calculated over each sns and further averaged to obtain one site average ubrmse for brevity the number of reliable snss and site average ubrmse scores based on each threshold are illustrated in fig 13 it is apparent that with the increase of the thresholds the number of reliable snss decreases and the higher the threshold the greater the decline whereas the site average ubrmse presents a general trend of decreasing first and then increasing these findings indicate that selecting reliable snss using etc does help address the scale mismatch issue but higher thresholds do not always lead to better performance of the generated psci ssm this makes sense since a small amount of reliable snss measurements resulting from high thresholds may not establish a representative tb ssm relationship the minimum site average ubrmse is achieved at the threshold of 0 7 which explains why this threshold was used in previous sections 6 conclusions this paper proposed the so called psci method for the estimation of high quality regional ssm in conus for the april 2015 to march 2018 period the main ideology behind this method is using a grnn to establish a nonlinear relationship between smap tb observations and auxiliary data and reliable snss ssm measurements the reliable snss are determined based on the etc derived correlation coefficient in excess of 0 7 in order to address the scale mismatch issue resulting from small spatial support of ground based measurements the model evaluation results based on the 10 fold cv technique showed that grnn gave much better performance compared to bpnn and that the grnn model trained on reliable snss outperformed the other grnn model trained on all snss suggesting the added value of the etc technique the obtained quantitative indicators for the best trained grnn model were fairly good the cross validated r and ubrmse values were 0 88 and 0 050 cm3 cm 3 respectively demonstrating our methodology was able to accurately describe the tb ssm relationship the further temporal and spatial analysis of the retrieved psci ssm product in comparison with spl3smp and era interim revealed our psci ssm held the most stable and reasonable estimation and could well capture the spatio temporal variations of ssm in addition the ground based comparisons between psci ssm and spl3smp era psci ssm over each sns network showed psci ssm was more consistent with ground based measurements to conclude the psci method proposed in this study has shown great potential in estimating reliable regional ssm records from satellite observations using the etc technique and grnn model trained on reliable ground based measurements the ideology of our work may extend to ssm retrievals from other satellite missions such as ascat and smos and apply in other geographical regions in the world future work will focus on a more appropriate selection of reliable snss including a variable threshold for the etc derived correlation coefficient according to the number of snss in different regions other indicators to identify individual snss reliability and new technologies such as the inverse footprint method orlowsky and seneviratne 2014 for determining the representativeness of in situ sites the incorporation of more advanced deep learning techniques may also be taken into consideration to replace grnn

5977,this study attempted to develop a point surface collaborative inversion psci method for the estimation of regional surface soil moisture ssm using a generalized regression neural network grnn trained on sparse ground based measurements specifically grnn was employed to establish a nonlinear relationship between ground based measurements from sparse network stations snss and passive microwave observations from the soil moisture active passive smap satellite in the continental u s for april 2015 to march 2018 more importantly the extended triple collocation etc technique was applied to address the scale mismatch issue resulting from the small spatial support of ground based measurements whereby individual snss reliability at the smap coarse footprint scale could be determined before fed into grnn the 10 fold cross validation results showed that the grnn model trained on reliable snss obtained a satisfactory performance the cross validated r and unbiased rmse values were 0 88 and 0 050 cm3 cm 3 respectively which outperformed the back propagation neural network bpnn and the other grnn model trained on all snss furthermore temporal and spatial comparisons between the psci based ssm retrievals and other ssm datasets indicated the former agreed the best with ground measurements both in time and space suggesting the proposed psci method had shown great potential in estimating reliable regional ssm climate records keywords soil moisture data fusion grnn microwave remote sensing smap triple collocation 1 introduction soil moisture is a key climate variable in the global water cycle budget and influences the partitioning of water and energy fluxes between the terrestrial surface and the atmosphere entekhabi et al 1996 an improved observational understanding of soil moisture will therefore contribute to better monitoring of natural hazards such as drought trenberth and guillemot 1995 and flooding viterbo and betts 1999 and give us a better idea of the plant growth williams and albertson 2004 crop yield rosenzweig et al 2002 future climate change seneviratne et al 2010 etc microwave remote sensing provides a unique opportunity to estimate regional global scale surface soil moisture ssm hereinafter with satisfactory temporal coverage thanks to the all weather and all time sensing ability of microwave electromagnetic waves njoku and entekhabi 1996 wigneron et al 1998 in particular various microwave sensors onboard satellites including both passive e g the advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system amsr e onboard the aqua satellite and its successor amsr 2 onboard the global change observation mission for water gcom w satellite and active e g the advanced scatterometer ascat onboard the series of meteorological operational metop satellites have been intensively exploited to estimate ssm in the past four decades nevertheless the first dedicated ssm mission soil moisture and ocean salinity smos was not launched until 2009 by the european space agency esa then followed the soil moisture active passive smap the second and the most recent ssm dedicated mission launched by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa in 2015 entekhabi et al 2010a kerr et al 2010 by carrying the optimal l band instruments for sensing the moisture content for the top 5 cm depth of soil i e ssm these two missions are devoted to producing long term and global ssm products with the accuracy requirement of 0 04 cm3 cm 3 volumetric soil moisture unbiased root mean square error ubrmse entekhabi et al 2010a kerr et al 2016 traditionally the methodology used to produce the official smos and smap ssm products is through the inversion of radiative transfer models rtms kerr et al 2012 o neill et al 2015 the rtm describes the thermal emission from the terrestrial surface linking surface soil moisture to satellite brightness temperature observations however this emission process is affected by a large number of interacting factors e g soil texture surface roughness topography temperature and vegetation coverage the nonlinearity of this process also poses technical difficulties in quantifying the complex physical relationships hence in order to minimize the uncertainties and enhance the retrieval accuracy from remote sensing data artificial neural networks anns have been widely employed for implementing the soil moisture retrieval algorithms over the past two decades aires et al 2005 chai et al 2009 kolassa et al 2013 2016 2018 rodriguez fernandez et al 2015 santi et al 2016 anns present several advantages over rtm inversions including the potential in mapping any kind of input output relationship without an explicit parameterization of physical relationships the ability to handle numerous data from nonlinear systems and the flexibility in combining information from different sources in general ann based algorithms for the retrieval of large scale ssm are implemented through using global land surface model lsm simulations as references to train anns given lsms are able to provide soil moisture estimates at the desired temporal and spatial resolution bierkens et al 2015 several studies have utilized this approach to retrieve ssm at global scale from either passive or active instruments or a combination of the two aires et al 2005 jiménez et al 2013 kolassa et al 2013 recently the global retrieval of ssm for both smos and smap using anns are accomplished by rodriguez fernandez et al 2015 and kolassa et al 2018 taking the well known european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf model and the goddard earth observing system version 5 geos 5 model as references to train the algorithms respectively in addition there are also studies focusing on using anns to test the a priori merging of active and passive instruments such as ascat and amsr e kolassa et al 2016 2017 it was found that such synergy strategy could give much better results than the a posteriori merging of the individual retrievals from each sensor however the problem to train an ann with lsm simulations is that every lsm is affected by significant uncertainties due to the errors of model parameter estimates since soil processes are extremely difficult to parameterize vereecken et al 2016 hence ssm retrievals using lsm simulations as references are prone to suffering from uncertainties too and should be treated with caution in contrast high accuracy ground based soil moisture can be measured directly using in situ devices inserted into the soil at various depths although a great number of large scale 1002 km2 soil moisture networks vinnikov et al 1999 have been set up over the globe in the last few decades they are primarily served for the calibration validation of satellite ssm products as the site distribution is too sparse to produce soil moisture maps at regional to global scales then arises the question is there any possibility to use ground based measurements instead of lsm simulations as references to train an ann for the large scale ssm retrieval to our knowledge few studies have investigated the potential of training an ann with ground based measurements for the regional global retrieval of ssm for instance rodríguez fernández et al 2017 preliminarily used ground based measurements from three sparse soil moisture networks to train an ann for the continental scale retrieval of ssm from smos observations in north america in addition xu et al 2018 proposed a multi source data fusion method based on the generalized regression neural network they showed that it is effective to use this approach for the quality improvement of smap retrievals by training the smap level 3 radiometer ssm product with ground based measurements from five sparse networks in the western continental u s however these studies didn t try to address the spatial scale mismatch issue the biggest problem to train a neural network with ground based measurements resulting from the spatial representation difference between the point support 1 m2 of in situ probes and large footprint tens of km2 of microwave remote sensing sensors certainly this can add huge uncertainty to the training process of neural networks that takes satellite observations as input and ground based measurements as references solving the spatial scale mismatch issue between in situ and remotely sensed data remains a major challenge in response to this problem previous studies crow et al 2012 famiglietti et al 2008 have been earlier characterized the behavior of ssm variability across spatial scales and analyzed the upscaling errors from the sparse ground based measurements for the validation of the coarse resolution satellite based ssm products the triple collocation tc technique stoffelen 1998 was found more appropriate as an upscaling approach capable of compensating for the impact of random measurement error on ground based measurements after comparing it with other sophisticated ssm upscaling strategies such as the time stability approach and the block kriging algorithm crow et al 2012 furthermore chen et al 2017 first applied the extended version of tc etc method mccoll et al 2014 to assess the spatial representativeness of the sparse ground based measurements within the satellite footprint for the validation of the smap level 2 radiometer ssm product another point worth noting is that in most of the above publications that use anns to retrieve large scale ssm the back propagation neural network bpnn configuration is proposed however in spite of the popular utilization of bpnn as shown by these studies it has several limitations such as slow convergence and easily being trapped by a local minimum instead of finding the global minimum error surface yu 1992 in addition bpnn needs too much human manipulation as to the determination of the number of hidden layers and neurons an alternative to bpnn that avoids above weakness is the generalized regression neural network grnn grnn is basically an associative memory feed forward type of ann al mahasneh et al 2018 which possesses many advantages the network is able to learn from the training data by one pass and does not require an iterative procedure there is only one free parameter called the spread parameter in the network grnn estimation is always able to converge to a global solution numerous studies have demonstrated the superiority of grnn over bpnn cigizoglu and alp 2006 del rosario martinez blanco et al 2016 konate et al 2015 li et al 2017b xu et al 2018 this makes grnn one of the most popular networks in environmental monitoring from remote sensing data such as evapotranspiration modeling kişi 2006 fine particulate matter pm2 5 estimation li et al 2017b forest cover estimation boyd et al 2002 solar radiation derivation şenkal 2010 ssm retrieval ozerdem et al 2017 xu et al 2018 etc inspired by these facts above in this study we develop a novel point surface collaborative inversion psci method for estimating regional ssm from smap brightness temperature tb observations and other auxiliary data using ground based measurements from sparse network stations snss as references to train grnn in the continental u s for april 2015 to march 2018 to address the scale mismatch issue the etc technique is applied to select reliable snss before the grnn training thereby the established tb ssm relationship can become more representative the best trained grnn model is then implemented through the proposed psci process to produce regional ssm maps the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 summarized the characteristics of conus and datasets used for the development of the proposed psci method as well as for the construction of the etc triplet section 3 describes the etc method for the selection of reliable snss and the psci procedure for ssm estimation based on grnn section 4 demonstrates the results of the selected reliable snss using etc the performance of the grnn model validated through the 10 fold cross validation technique and the spatial and temporal evaluation results of the psci based ssm retrievals section 5 provides a summary and puts forward an outlook for future developments 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area of our research is the continental u s conus the conus which borders both the north atlantic and north pacific oceans and is bordered by canada and mexico has a varied topography the eastern regions consist of hills and low mountains while the central interior is a vast plain called the great plains region and the west has high rugged mountain ranges there are three major mountain ranges in conus that run north to south the appalachian mountains located in the east the rocky mountains in the central west and the sierra nevada cascade mountains in the west interspersed throughout are the great lakes in the northeast the mississippi river in the midwest the great salt lake in the west and the grand canyon in the southwest like its topography the climate of conus also varies depending on location it is considered mostly temperate but is tropical in the southeastern regions e g florida semiarid in the plains west of the mississippi river and arid in the great basin of the southwest the pacific northwest is one of the wettest parts of conus and is densely forested the rocky mountains sierra nevada cascades have typical highland climates and are also heavily forested there are several reasons why we chose conus as the study area to begin with large scale and long term soil moisture networks such as the soil climate analysis network scan and the u s climate reference network uscrn are spread across the whole conus fig 1 hence enough ground samples that overlap with satellite based data sets can be obtained to perform the subsequent collaborative inversion process in addition all soil moisture sites are evenly distributed in this region though a relatively higher density appears in the rugged west moreover operational soil moisture networks using new ground measurement technologies namely the cosmic ray soil moisture observing system cosmos network and the pbo h2o network that can provide larger spatial support of soil moisture measurements than typical point measurements derived from in situ devices are also deployed in this area such measurements are also supposed to weaken the scale mismatch issue resulting from the small spatial support of sparse ground based measurements to a certain degree 2 2 smap brightness temperature tb observations launched on 31 january 2015 the smap mission is operated by nasa and is equipped with both a radiometer passive 1 41 ghz and a high resolution radar active 1 26 ghz dedicated to measuring ssm at l band with a fixed incidence angle of 40 a revisit time of 3 days at the equator and 6 00 a m descending 6 00p m ascending local equatorial overpass times entekhabi et al 2010a although the smap radar has failed since 7 july 2015 chan et al 2016 the smap radiometer remains to operate as planned this l band radiometer observes the earth on four different channels horizontal h and vertical v polarization as well as the 3rd and 4th stokes parameter the first two channels are the primary science channels that are directly sensitive to ssm while the 3rd and 4th stokes parameters are used to help detect the radio frequency interference piepmeier et al 2014 the smap level 3 global daily brightness temperature tb product spl3tb version 5 o neill et al 2018 which is resampled to a global cylindrical 36 km equal area scalable earth grid version 2 easev2 brodzik et al 2012 was used in this study for the estimation of ssm the observed tb has been adjusted for the presence of water bodies and corrected for atmospheric and reflected sky radiation contributions from smap level 1c tb observations de lannoy et al 2015 we utilized tb observations at both h and v polarizations only from the 6 00 a m descending overpass for the reason that vertical profiles of soil and canopy temperatures are expected to be more uniform during early morning overpasses than during other times of the day basharinov and shutko 1975 note the spl3tb product is actually provided within the smap level 3 radiometer ssm product introduced below 2 3 surface soil moisture ssm datasets 2 3 1 satellite based ssm retrievals from smap the smap level 3 radiometer global daily 36 km easev2 grid soil moisture spl3smp version 5 which is a composite of level 2 half orbit soil moisture over one day is available since 31 march 2015 o neill et al 2018 in fact the retrieval of ssm from smap tb observations occurs in the level 2 processing which currently uses the v pol single channel algorithm sca v as the baseline retrieval algorithm chan et al 2016 zeng et al 2016 developed on the basis of the well known physical tau omega model o neill et al 2015 wigneron et al 1995 the spl3smp product was downloaded for the 31 march 2015 to 30 march 2018 period through the nasa national snow and ice data center distributed active archive center nsidc daac https nsidc org data spl3smp we only made use of ssm retrievals from the 6 00 a m descending overpass for the same reason as aforementioned spl3tb in addition only data pixels that are recommended for retrieval based on the smap quality flag o neill et al 2015 were used 2 3 2 ground based ssm measurements from sparse network sites snss the ground based ssm measurements used as references for the subsequent collaborative inversion process are from eight soil moisture networks distributed across conus the cosmos network zreda et al 2008 2012 the interactive roaring fork observation network iron osenga et al 2019 the pbo h2o network larson et al 2008b the real time in situ soil monitoring for agriculture risma network ojo et al 2015 the scan network schaefer et al 2007 the snowpack telemetry snotel network leavesley et al 2008 the soil moisture sensing controller and optimal estimator soilscape network moghaddam et al 2010 2016 and the uscrn network bell et al 2013 all these networks are made up of sparse network sites snss defined as the site that typically provides just one single point measurement within a satellite footprint chan et al 2016 chen et al 2017 colliander et al 2017 thus resulting in the scale mismatch issue it is worth noticing that measurements from cosmos and pbo h2o are derived based on new ssm measuring technologies which can significantly extend the spatial support of point scale in situ observations the cosmos network utilizes the so called cosmic ray moisture probe a stationary instrument that measures cosmic ray neutrons in the air whose intensity is inversely related to ssm to integrates and produces area average ssm over a footprint with a horizontal radius of 500 m desilets et al 2010 on the other hand the pbo h2o network employs the existing geodetic global position system gps equipment which has been found capable to derive roughly 1000 m2 ssm based on its nearly linear relationship with respect to the phase offset caused by the received multipath signals reflected from the land surface larson et al 2010 2008a nevertheless the footprint made by such technologies is insignificant compared to that sensed through microwave remote sensing tens of km2 thus the scale mismatch issue being unavoidable and demanding to be accounted for a total of 921 snss ssm data from aforementioned eight networks for the 31 march 2015 to 30 march 2018 period were downloaded through the international soil moisture network ismn website portal https ismn geo tuwien ac at en an well known international cooperation in the soil moisture community aiming to establish and maintain a global in situ soil moisture database dorigo et al 2011 fig 1 shows the spatial distribution of the snss in the study area and table 1 summaries the characteristics of each network only the shallowest measurements representing the moisture content of the topsoil i e ssm were considered trying to be consistent with the sensing depth 5 cm of the l band satellite it is worth noticing that sampling depth can be different among various in situ sensors for example cosmos network measures ssm within the 0 8 cm topsoil layer which is several centimeters deeper than the typical penetration depth of the l band satellite data 0 5 cm while pbo h2o network measures the identical depth of ssm to that of the l band satellite data most of the other networks measure ssm at 5 cm additionally ssm measurements that are not with good quality based on the ismn quality flag dorigo et al 2013 were masked out the time series of ground based ssm measurements from each sns are recorded at one hour intervals except for the pbo h2o network which provides only one ssm estimate for each day recorded at 12 00 utc for the hourly ssm time series only measurements that are closest to the smap 6 00 a m local equatorial overpass time using a 3 hour window for each day was taken to generate a daily time record a least of 30 daily measurements during the study time period was required for each site 2 3 3 model based ssm simulations from era interim era interim is a model based dataset released by ecmwf showing the results of a global climate reanalysis from 1979 to date and continuing to be updated in near real time dee et al 2011 it uses the tiled ecmwf scheme for surface exchange over land h tessel land surface model viterbo et al 1999 viterbo and beljaars 1995 to solve for a variety of parameters including a four layer soil profile 0 7 7 28 28 100 and 100 289 cm provided every 6 h 0 00 6 00 12 00 and 18 00 utc berrisford et al 2011 the data are archived and can be freely accessed at the ecmwf website portal https apps ecmwf int datasets data interim full daily here only the upper layer 0 7 cm soil moisture provided on a regular 0 25 spatial resolution was used simulations at each point of time 0 00 6 00 12 00 and 18 00 utc were aggregated to a daily average they were further regridded to 36 km easev2 grids to be consistent with smap data in addition we applied quality control to the model based ssm simulations by using the upper layer 0 7 cm soil temperature from era interim to identify times and grids where the soil temperature is below 1 c these data were deemed not feasible to generate ssm and were masked out kolassa et al 2018 2 4 auxiliary data in addition to tb observations we take advantage of another two datasets as auxiliary input to our model they are also required as auxiliary data in the smap soil moisture retrieval algorithm which include 1 surface soil temperatures ts hereinafter from the nasa s geos 5 land modeling system utilized to determine the soil surface emissivity from tb observations and 2 vegetation water contents vwc hereinafter based on an empirical relationship with respect to the normalized difference vegetation index from modis used to correct the vegetation effects for a detailed description of the two datasets readers can refer to the smap level 2 3 soil moisture passive algorithm theoretical basis document o neill et al 2015 like the spl3tb ts and vwc are also provided within the spl3smp product and have already been posted on the same 36 km easev2 grid as smap ssm note that we excluded ts values that are below 1 and vwc values that are higher than 5 kg m2 because the soil moisture retrieval is not feasible under such conditions o neill et al 2015 3 methodology 3 1 extended triple collocation etc technique for the selection of reliable snss in order to address the scale mismatch issue resulting from the small spatial support of sparse ground based measurements which can add huge uncertainty to the subsequent collaborative inversion process we turned to the triple collocation tc technique stoffelen 1998 tc is an analyzing tool for estimating the unknown random error variances of three collocated datasets of the same geophysical variable without treating any one dataset as perfectly observed truth gruber et al 2016 the basic assumptions of tc are 1 the triplet each are linearly related to the unknown truth 2 the error statistics are stable and do not change over time 3 the errors of the triplet are mutually independent of each other and 4 are independent of the true value as well according to the first assumption the collocated datasets xi can be related to the true state t via an affine error model 1 x i β i α i t ε i where β and α refer to the additive and multiplicative bias constants respectively ε is the mean zero additive error and the subscript i stands for the three collocated datasets of the same geophysical variable the objective of tc is to find a solution that individually estimates the variance of each εi in eq 1 based on the above assumptions to this end it is required to choose one dataset from the triplet as a reference and rescale the other two into the same reference data space apparently this will result in a dependency of the error variance estimates on the climatology of the scaling reference draper et al 2013 in order to address this issue mccoll et al 2014 proposed the extended triple collocation etc method which is based on exactly the same assumptions as the original tc and derives an additional performance metric the correlation coefficient of xi with respect to t as formulated below lei et al 2015 2 r etc t x i sign cov x i x j cov x i x k cov x i x i cov x j x k where the sign of retc is corrected up by assuming to be always positive in this study we applied the etc method to determine the reliability of individual sns observations in terms of their spatial representativeness over the spl3smp footprint scale i e 36 km easev2 grid following the idea of chen et al 2017 first we constructed the ssm triplet from satellite based retrievals i e smap ground based measurements i e sns and model based simulations i e era interim provided that they belong to different types of measuring systems and none of them are dependent on one another then the retc t sns can be derived based on eq 2 which indicates the relation between the sparse in situ measurements and the unknown truth within the 36 km satellite footprint scale i e it determines the fraction of footprint scale ssm dynamics captured by point scale observations at individual snss an experimental threshold of 0 7 for retc t sns was set above which the snss could be deemed as reliable this threshold was chosen after testing a series of thresholds ranging from 0 4 to 0 9 with an interval of 0 1 which will be discussed in the discussion section see section 4 4 besides a minimum threshold of 100 triplets was set to avoid sample impoverishment in addition there also exists the representation difference problem of penetration depths among different ssm datasets see section 2 3 and among various in situ sensors see table 1 draper et al 2013 had demonstrated that this would have only a marginal impact on the etc derived correlation coefficient 3 2 point surface collaborative inversion psci method for ssm estimation 3 2 1 generalized regression neural network grnn algorithm the grnn is a one pass learning algorithm first introduced by specht 1991 the network features fast learning that does not require an iterative procedure it is a powerful tool for regression approximation fitting and prediction problems assume a vector random variable x and a scalar random variable y are input and output variables respectively and can be expressed as follows 3 x x 1 x 2 x p 4 y y 1 y 2 y n t where p is the dimension of x and n is the number of observations assuming x i and yi i 1 2 n are sample values of x and y respectively the regression of y on an input value x can then be estimated by grnn as below 5 y x i 1 n y i k x x i i 1 n k x x i 6 k x x i exp d i 2 2 σ 2 d i 2 x x i t x x i where k stands for the gaussian kernel and di is the euclidean distance between x and x i last σ is called the spread parameter which is the only unknown parameter in the network and needs optimization see section 4 2 1 this free parameter affects the level of fitness in grnn architecture the larger the spread the smoother the function approximation the architecture of grnn presented in fig 2 contains four basic layers an input layer a pattern layer a summation layer and an output layer the input layer consists of p neurons where p is the dimension of the vector variable x here p 7 in our study it is completely connected to the patter layer and provides the input measurement x directly to the pattern units the pattern layer has n nodes where n is the number of training samples and each pattern unit is assigned with a sample vector x i in the training data in each node the euclidean distance between the input vector x and the assigned vector x i is first calculated and then fed into the gaussian kernel based on eq 6 the pattern unit outputs are sent to the summation units the summation layer has two types of processing units one is called the numerator part the other is the denominator part the input to the numerator unit is the sum of the pattern layer outputs each weighted by an observed output scalar yi corresponding to x i in the training samples while the input to the denominator unit is the sum of the pattern unit outputs at last the output layer has only one neuron which receives the two outputs from the summation units and divides the numerator part by the denominator part eq 5 to produce an estimate for y given x it can be seen from above that grnn memorizes every unique pattern in the training samples this is why it is a single pass learning network and does not require any back propagation algorithm in this study the input signals include seven parameters spl3tb observations at both h and v polarizations tbh tbv surface soil temperatures ts from geos 5 vegetation water contents vwc based on modis and coincident time month and location latitude and longitude of each sns the output signal is ssm in fact the essential function of grnn is to determine a non linear relationship between ssm and the primary input tb observations i e tbh and tbv as tb is directly related to ssm here ts and vwc data are also taken as auxiliary input fed into grnn in order to add contributive information to the tb ssm relationship besides coincident month latitude and longitude are used to account for the seasonal variability and spatial heterogeneity of ssm such practice has been commonly carried out in several previous studies li et al 2017b wu et al 2012 yao and lu 2014 3 2 2 procedures of the proposed psci method for ssm estimation the entire workflow of the methodology in this study is depicted in fig 3 to begin with etc method was applied to the triplet constructed from satellite ground and model based ssm to identify reliable snss then tb ts and vwc datasets were spatially and temporally matched using ground based measurements only from reliable snss as references to generate an input output training data set to be specific the site specific ssm data were collocated with the 36 km easev2 grid covering the site if one grid corresponded more than one sites then measurements from these sites were averaged afterward the generated input output training data set was fed into the grnn by taking the reliable snss ssm as references to train the network for the 31 march 2015 to 30 march 2018 period once trained the model s performance was evaluated using cross validation technique to identify the best one by tuning the spread parameter of grnn to an optimum value finally the best trained grnn model was applied to the input datasets for the whole study area and the whole period to produce maps of psci based ssm retrievals 3 3 model evaluation the 10 fold cross validation cv technique rodriguez et al 2010 is chosen to test the model s predictive power this technique is basically a resampling procedure often used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited data sample li et al 2017a b ma et al 2014 to begin with all data samples i e ssm measurements from reliable snss in this study are randomly shuffled and averagely divided into ten groups next each unique group is taken as a hold out or test data set while the remaining nine groups are taken as a training data set to fit the model then repeat fitting a model on the training set and evaluating it on the test set for every group at last evaluation scores from all ten rounds will be summarized and averaged to show how accurately the predictive model performs the results could also tell whether the model is over fitted i e the model performs better on the training set than on the test set four classic statistical metrics in the soil moisture community were adopted to give a quantitative assessment of the model performance i e the pearson correlation coefficient r unitless the root mean square error rmse cm3 cm 3 the bias cm3 cm 3 and unbiased rmse ubrmse cm3 cm 3 detailed descriptions of these indicators are provided in entekhabi et al 2010b 4 results and discussion 4 1 selection of reliable snss the number of reliable and unreliable snss for each soil moisture network at the threshold of 0 7 for the etc derived correlation coefficient is summarized in table 2 in general just 372 are considered reliable accounting for 40 of 921 snss in total to be specific both cosmos and iron remain no site which is more surprising for cosmos since it measures larger spatial support of ssm than typical point scale in situ observations perhaps this is because there exist quite a few cosmos measurements whose qualities are not good based on the ismn quality flags thus being masked out in our research that is to say not enough cosmos measurements overlap with other ssm datasets at the threshold of 100 triplets for the etc implementation for iron this phenomenon is also blamed to the poor qualities of its measurements as well as its relatively short data available period august 2012 to january 2017 see table 1 with respect the study period march 2015 to march 2018 in contrast pbo h2o the other network apart from cosmos providing large spatial support ground based measurements remains more than half of its sites which demonstrated the promising utility of applying these new ground measurement technologies in the soil moisture community the risma network kept the biggest proportion 83 of snss only one site considered unreliable whereas the snotel network left the largest number of reliable snss though only accounting for 28 of its sites the distribution of the selected reliable snss based on the etc derived correlation coefficient in excess of 0 7 from each soil moisture network is presented in fig 4 it appears from the figure that the number of reliable snss is able to cover most of conus with many clustering in the western part however there are few or nearly no reliable snss in the northeastern states of conus as well as in the southeast coast which may be due to the existence of the appalachian mountains along with the small amount of snss in the east see fig 1 in addition it makes sense that the sites neighboring the sea or lakes are mostly screened since the retrieval of satellite based ssm may be suspectable or unsuccessful due to the presence of significant water bodies within the satellite sensing footprint 4 2 assessment of the grnn model 4 2 1 model settings as mentioned in section 3 2 1 the spread parameter is the only unknown parameter in the grnn architecture therefore its optimum value requires to be identified prior to the psci process for ssm estimation this parameter affects the level of fitness in grnn architecture large values of the spread parameter tend to force the estimation to be smooth while lower values provide a closer approximation to the sample values specht 1991 in general the spread parameter must be greater than 0 and can usually range from 0 01 to 1 with good results del rosario martinez blanco et al 2016 here the 10 fold cv technique is utilized to select an appropriate value for the spread parameter a series of the spread parameter values ranging from 0 001 to 1 with the interval of 0 001 were tested to give the cross validated performance of the grnn model additionally in order to demonstrate the effect of using etc to address the scale mismatch issue two grnn models were chosen for comparison one is the grnn trained on only reliable snss the other is the one trained on all snss in the study area i e without etc implementation the variations of cv derived ubrmse statistics against the spread parameter of the two models are depicted in fig 5 it can be seen that the minimum ubrmse for these two grnn models both appear at the spread value of 0 011 besides it is apparent that the performance of the grnn trained on reliable snss is much better than the one trained on all snss which suggests the added value of the etc implementation for the selection of reliable snss to sum up the spread parameter is set as 0 011 for each model 4 2 2 algorithm for comparison in order to give a comprehensive analysis of the grnn model used in this study the popular back propagation neural network bpnn as mentioned in the introduction section was also chosen for comparison here a three layer fully connected feedforward architecture was constructed with one single hidden layer of the tangent sigmoid transfer function a classical back propagation training algorithm rumelhart et al 1995 and a levenberg marquardt approach levenberg 1944 marquardt 1963 input and output parameters of bpnn are identical with those in grnn employed in this study likewise two bpnn models that are trained on reliable and all snss respectively were taken into consideration according to previous works gardner and dorling 1998 li et al 2017b reich et al 1999 xu et al 2018 the optimum number of neurons in the hidden layer can be determined based on the range from 2 n μ to 2n 1 where n and μ are the number of neurons in the input and output layer therefore by testing a series of hidden layer neurons ranging from 6 to 16 15 neurons which performed the best using 10 fold cv not shown were chosen for the bpnn model trained on reliable snss while for the one trained on all snss 16 neurons were selected 4 2 3 overall performance of models both grnn and bpnn models were implemented through the same evaluation process using the 10 fold cv and their obtained performances are summarized in table 3 note in the table the model fitting results are from the best fitting model over the 10 rounds of the 10 fold cv while the cross validation results are the 10 round combined from the table it shows that grnn obtains much better performance than bpnn with cross validated r and ubrmse values improved by 0 13 0 08 cm3 cm 3 and 0 021 0 013 cm3 cm 3 for the model trained on all reliable snss respectively when comparing between the results using all and only reliable snss measurements the models trained on reliable snss significantly outperform those trained on all snss indicating the added value of the etc implementation for the selection of reliable snss additionally all cv derived biases are close to zero demonstrating the unbiased estimation of the models further fig 6 shows the scatter plots of model fitting and cross validation results for the grnn model trained on reliable snss from model fitting to cross validation r score drops by 0 09 from 0 97 to 0 88 which demonstrates that slight over fitting is presented in the proposed model however with the highest cross validated r 0 88 and lowest cross validated ubrmse 0 050 cm3 cm 3 the grnn model trained on reliable snss outperforms the other models therefore despite its slight over fitting the grnn model trained on reliable snss with the spread parameter of 0 011 is considered as the best trained model and is selected for the subsequent process 4 2 4 the predictive power of grnn over each sns network in order to give a comprehensive assessment of the predictive power of the grnn model the evaluation metrics between ssm estimates using the best trained grnn model hereinafter psci ssm for short and ground based measurements were calculated over each sns including both reliable and unreliable sites for comparison spl3smp is also chosen to compute its metrics against ground based measurements over each sns the spatial distribution of the calculated r and ubrmse for individual snss are depicted in fig 7 and fig 8 respectively in both figures the redder the points the better the evaluation metrics generally the number of red points for both r and ubrmse against ground based measurements has increased a lot for psci ssm with regard to spl3smp according to the statistics the number of sites with an r value greater than 0 70 is increased from 372 to 484 whereas the number of sites with ubrmse score smaller than 0 04 cm3 cm 3 is more than doubled from 141 to 346 out of the total 921 snss from a spatial point of view for spl3smp high r values in excess of 0 70 are mainly clustered in the northwestern part of conus and sparsely scattered in the mid to mid east while for psci ssm there are more red points gathering in the mid to western regions and high r values over 0 90 are further improved additionally the majority of ubrmse values for spl3smp is at the intermediate level 0 040 to 0 080 cm3 cm 3 while for psci ssm a great number of ubrmse values less than 0 040 cm3 cm 3 appear the above consequences indicate a generally satisfactory predictive power of the grnn model however it is also worth noticing that in the northeastern states and along the southeast coast both r and ubrmse against ground based measurements obtain little improvement for psci ssm with respect to spl3smp which is supposed to have something to do with the lack of reliable snss in these regions see fig 4 this suggests a further refinement of our approach regarding a flexible selection of reliable snss in the regions with a limited quantity of ground stations further the quantitative evaluation metrics over each sns were averaged on the basis of individual soil moisture networks for psci ssm and spl3smp respectively in order to get a general idea of the predictive power of grnn over each network table 4 and fig 9 note that the mean values were only computed when a site has a p value 0 05 it can be seen from table 4 and fig 9 that psci ssm outperforms the spl3smp over most of the soil moisture networks specifically psci ssm obtains higher r values than spl3smp over six soil moisture networks out of the total eight networks except for iron and uscrn however the r differences over iron and uscrn are very small only 0 04 and 0 05 for each respectively the most significant difference for r is observed over cosmos where the mean r value has increased by 0 26 for psci ssm with regard to spl3smp as for the mean rmse all networks have experienced a decline from spl3smp to psci ssm with the biggest decrease obtained over soilscape from 0 087 cm3 cm 3 to 0 064 cm3 cm 3 likewise ubrmse scores of psci ssm outperforms spl3smp over six networks all these results suggest that the grnn model can generally predict accurate ssm estimates 4 2 5 evaluation of the psci based ssm retrievals based on the above results the best trained grnn model is applied to the spl3tb observations and other auxiliary input for the whole study area and the whole study period thereby maps of ssm retrievals based on the proposed psci method are generated fig 10 displays the annual mean ssm map of the year 2017 for psci ssm in comparison with the aforementioned ssm triplet the spl3smp product era interim simulations and ground based measurements note the ground based ssm measurements are from all snss and used as the benchmark fig 10 d in general all three surface products i e psci ssm spl3smp and era interim show low ssm in the west with an increase toward the east which agrees with the topography across conus as described in section 2 1 the west is more arid than the east among them is psci ssm that reveals the most similar spatial pattern with ground based ssm than both spl3smp and era interim besides areas neighboring the sea or lakes generally have high ssm however spl3smp shows extremely high ssm at the regions adjacent to water bodies indicating these retrievals are questionable or of bad quality due to the presence of water bodies within the 36 km satellite footprint additionally era interim displays a too smooth spatial pattern in general which is difficult to capture the spatial variations of ssm the two issues of spl3smp and era interim are overcome in psci ssm suggesting our proposed psci method performs comparatively well in space furthermore in order to deepen our understanding of the temporal variations of our psci ssm product coincident time series from all ssm datasets except for era interim for brevity were inter compared for each common 36 km easev2 grid four examples of such grids are illustrated in fig 11 note that the non recommended retrievals in the spl3smp product are also displayed for a more comprehensive comparison from the figure a generally better agreement in temporal variations can be seen between psci ssm and site specific ssm time series than spl3smp the absolute values of psci ssm are much closer to site specific time series than spl3smp on one hand unrecommended retrievals in spl3smp time series e g fig 11 c and d are profoundly corrected in psci ssm on the other hand the recommended retrievals in spl3smp are also modified in psci ssm time series to more approximate the ssm values of the site specific time series moreover sharp rises in ssm time series usually following precipitation or irrigation events are precisely captured by psci ssm for most situations more importantly while over and under estimation do exist in psci ssm time series the biases are small compared to spl3smp all these findings above suggest that our proposed psci approach can produce commendably accurate ssm retrievals whose spatial and temporal patterns are more consistent with ground based measurements than the official smap level 3 radiometer ssm product 5 discussion as mentioned in section 1 the inspiration for this work is to replace the widely use of uncertain lsm simulations as training references with high accuracy ground based measurements therefore it is necessary to compare these two different datasets by taking them as references to train the networks respectively here the grnn model trained on model ssm simulations from regridded 36 km easev2 era interim was used to run the psci process for the same study area and the same study period as previous sections a spread parameter of 0 01 was set which gave the best model performance this model was then compared to the previous grnn model trained on reliable snss to be fair only model simulations that correspond with 36 km easev2 grids covering the reliable snss were taken into consideration a ground based comparison between ssm estimates using grnn trained on era interim model simulations hereinafter era psci ssm for short and those using grnn trained on reliable snss measurements hereinafter sns psci ssm for short which is identical to the psci ssm in previous sections was drawn to evaluate the models predictive power over each network table 5 and fig 12 note that the averaged metrics were only computed when a site has a p value 0 05 from table 5 and fig 12 mean r scores against ground based measurements for sns psci ssm are better than era psci ssm over all eight networks the biggest improvement of r is obtained in cosmos increasing from 0 38 for era psci ssm to 0 75 for sns psci ssm in terms of the mean rsme all networks except for the iron network experience a decline from era psci ssm to sns psci ssm a similar result can be seen for the mean ubrmse values besides the mean biases for sns psci ssm are much more satisfactory over most networks as compared to era psci ssm these results suggest that it is more appropriate to use reliable ground based measurements instead of model simulations to train the networks another important issue to be discussed is the choice of the thresholds for the etc derived correlation coefficient between in situ measurements and the unknown truth within the 36 km easev2 grid i e retc t sns in eq 2 which is supposed to affect the selection of reliable snss and the subsequent psci process here a series of thresholds ranging from 0 4 to 0 9 with the interval of 0 1 were tested for each threshold the selected reliable snss measurements were fed into grnn and ran the psci process to generate psci ssm then ubrmse scores between respective psci ssm and ground based measurements were calculated over each sns and further averaged to obtain one site average ubrmse for brevity the number of reliable snss and site average ubrmse scores based on each threshold are illustrated in fig 13 it is apparent that with the increase of the thresholds the number of reliable snss decreases and the higher the threshold the greater the decline whereas the site average ubrmse presents a general trend of decreasing first and then increasing these findings indicate that selecting reliable snss using etc does help address the scale mismatch issue but higher thresholds do not always lead to better performance of the generated psci ssm this makes sense since a small amount of reliable snss measurements resulting from high thresholds may not establish a representative tb ssm relationship the minimum site average ubrmse is achieved at the threshold of 0 7 which explains why this threshold was used in previous sections 6 conclusions this paper proposed the so called psci method for the estimation of high quality regional ssm in conus for the april 2015 to march 2018 period the main ideology behind this method is using a grnn to establish a nonlinear relationship between smap tb observations and auxiliary data and reliable snss ssm measurements the reliable snss are determined based on the etc derived correlation coefficient in excess of 0 7 in order to address the scale mismatch issue resulting from small spatial support of ground based measurements the model evaluation results based on the 10 fold cv technique showed that grnn gave much better performance compared to bpnn and that the grnn model trained on reliable snss outperformed the other grnn model trained on all snss suggesting the added value of the etc technique the obtained quantitative indicators for the best trained grnn model were fairly good the cross validated r and ubrmse values were 0 88 and 0 050 cm3 cm 3 respectively demonstrating our methodology was able to accurately describe the tb ssm relationship the further temporal and spatial analysis of the retrieved psci ssm product in comparison with spl3smp and era interim revealed our psci ssm held the most stable and reasonable estimation and could well capture the spatio temporal variations of ssm in addition the ground based comparisons between psci ssm and spl3smp era psci ssm over each sns network showed psci ssm was more consistent with ground based measurements to conclude the psci method proposed in this study has shown great potential in estimating reliable regional ssm records from satellite observations using the etc technique and grnn model trained on reliable ground based measurements the ideology of our work may extend to ssm retrievals from other satellite missions such as ascat and smos and apply in other geographical regions in the world future work will focus on a more appropriate selection of reliable snss including a variable threshold for the etc derived correlation coefficient according to the number of snss in different regions other indicators to identify individual snss reliability and new technologies such as the inverse footprint method orlowsky and seneviratne 2014 for determining the representativeness of in situ sites the incorporation of more advanced deep learning techniques may also be taken into consideration to replace grnn

5978,the underlying uncertainties in the prediction of freshwater evolutions in some regions can be induced by several unmitigated human actions multi scale climatic drivers and dynamic physical processes these factors have enduring hydro ecological effects on the environments and combine to limit our understanding of large scale hydrological processes and impacts of climate on water availability considering the fact that several hydrogeological perturbations and disturbances have been reported during the last decade in south america sa a further assessment of continental land water storage is therefore warranted in this study a two step regularization approach that combined the jade joint approximate diagonalisation of eigen matrices algorithm and plsr partial least squares regression was employed to assess grace gravity recovery and climate experiment terrestrial water storage tws over sa based on the bartlett s statistics significant independent patterns of sst sea surface temperature anomalies from the pacific and atlantic oceans were used in the plsr scheme to model the temporal evolutions of tws 2002 2017 over twelve prominent river basins in sa from the jade rotation of tws over sa strong inter annual changes in tws observed over the amazon basin and within its floodplain corridors were identified the unabated mass loss in patagonia ice field caused by warming of the climate and other grace hydrological signals were also retrieved from the jade scheme the rainfall tws relationship is considerably strong r 0 80 at 0 2 months lag in much of tropical sa including the amazon basin and highlights the influence of climate variability in the region medium r 0 40 and moderately strong r 0 60 rainfall tws relationship were also found to be significant α 0 05 but with up to 4 months lag and more in some basins during the 2010 2017 period estimated tws trends α 0 05 showed a considerable fall in orinoco 38 48 7 90 mm yr and sao francisco 30 84 4 17 while the strongest rise was found in uruguay 28 28 3 49 mm yr as the rainfall tws relationship is not statistically significant α 0 05 in some areas the spatial distribution of trends in tws and rainfall especially in some arid regions which are inconsistent confirm possible impacts resulting from complex hydrogeological processes and or anthropogenic influence further in the modelling of tws time series using the jade plsr scheme several validation skill metrics e g r 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency confirm the considerable agreements between predicted and observed tws in the amazon r 2 0 95 orinoco r 2 0 94 tocantins r 2 0 91 and chobut r 2 0 88 however grace hydrological signals in some regions are somewhat complex given the relatively higher uncertainties in the multivariate models employed in this study keywords rainfall sea surface temperature amazon basin partial least square regression enso climate variability 1 introduction the knowledge of global freshwater response to critical stressors e g human abstraction and climate is an emerging aspect of freshwater science that is significant to model the influence of threats to water and food security rodell et al 2018 vorosmarty et al 2010 however the underlying uncertainties in the prediction of freshwater evolutions in some regions can be induced by non climatic factors e g earthquakes land subsidence and unmitigated human actions e g rodell et al 2018 famiglietti 2014 han et al 2010 chen et al 2007b within the context of dynamic earth processes south america for instance is a hub of frequent considerable crustal and lithospheric deformations seismicity and geo hazards see e g ruiz and madariaga 2018 ferreira et al 2018 montecino et al 2017b montecino et al 2017a jaramillo et al 2017 vigny et al 2011 han et al 2010 lomnitz 2004 these geodetic disturbances and the composite influence of climate and physical processes could have implications on surface mass variations and the acceleration of the water cycle in the light of the aforementioned perturbations on surface hydrology time variable geophysical signals observed by the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace tapley et al 2004 are expected to be driven not only by climate oscillations and key processes of inter annual variability e g ni et al 2018 ndehedehe et al 2018 ndehedehe et al 2017 dong et al 2015

2014 chen et al 2007b this assumption is anchored on the fact that apart from the redistribution in continental water storage other dynamic processes such as gravitational tide in the solid earth post glacial rebound and variations in antarctic and greenland ice volumes cause significant changes in the earth s gravity e g swenson and wahr 2002 wahr et al 1998 whereas a plethora of scientific reports on freshwater dynamics are mostly focused on climate variability related changes e g rodell et al 2018 anyah et al 2018 reager et al 2014 thomas et al 2014 linage et al 2013 phillips et al 2012 very little attention is paid to improving our understanding of the possible contributions of non climatic factors especially those not related to groundwater abstraction for regions with frequent repeat cycles of such factors freshwater dynamics is expected to be poorly understood hence predicting freshwater systems at regional or continental scales require large scale assessment of tws terrestrial water storage variations and an understanding of prominent drivers of surface hydrology while this knowledge will lay the foundation for an efficient modelling framework for water resources limited ground observations and the lack of a suitable modelling approach to characterize key hydrological metrics however are some important constraints to such assessments further the proliferation of dams and surface water developments for hydropower agriculture and other relevant applications are gradually emerging as considerable drivers of tws in africa such impacts have been reported for the lake volta and victoria see ndehedehe et al 2017b moore and williams 2014 ahmed et al 2014 while the global expansion of dams and hydro power stations are welcomed initiatives that could significantly boost global hydroelectricity capacity zarfl et al 2015 they are also expected however to have considerable impact on hydrological changes as is the case in lake volta see ndehedehe et al 2017b ndehedehe 2019 or over the amazon basin where dam constructions are impacting on the ecosystems by modifying vital flood pulses 1 https news mongabay com 2018 01 study amazon dams are disrupting ecologically vital flood pulses 1 since the advent of grace quantitative estimates of monthly changes in tws soil moisture groundwater surface water wetlands etc have been recovered across the globe because of its spatial resolution 90 000 km2 the dynamics in multi layered land water storage can be measured at global or regional scales with an accuracy of 15 mm expressed in terms of equivalent water height famiglietti and rodell 2013 apparently the preponderance of grace hydrological studies in south america sa figs 1 a and b focused on some sections of the amazon basin see e g tourian et al 2018 linage et al 2013 de linage et al 2014 frappart et al 2013a frappart et al 2012 frappart et al 2011a alsdorf et al 2010 kim et al 2009 han et al 2009 however the validation of regional mass solutions of grace level 1 data and the estimates of tws over sa based on constrained least squares method have been reported frappart et al 2013 ramillien et al 2012 considering the complex hydrogeological structures of sa fig 1a these studies emphasize the need to further assess the inter annual variations of land water storage and the representation of dynamic processes in time variable gravity observations given that sa accounts for nearly one fifth of global continental freshwater discharge e g linage et al 2013 a continent wide assessment of grace derived tws has become necessary not only to improve our contemporary understanding of large scale hydrological processes but to support the tracking and modelling of freshwater dynamics in the region consequently to improve our understanding of the spatial and temporal variations of extended grace derived tws 2002 2017 over sa this study localises grace hydrological signals by rotating it towards statistical independence using the joint approximate diagonalisation of eigen matrices jade algorithm e g ndehedehe et al 2016b ziehe 2005 cardoso and souloumiac 1993 cardoso 1999 common 1994 cardoso 1991 given the lack of sufficient groundwater monitoring bores in many regions of the world the jade algorithm could be used to identify strong hydrological signals induced by droughts or even characterize groundwater variations from grace tws without using apriori information for the first time a partial least squares regression plsr model is combined with jade rotation and multi linear regression to model grace tws over sa the specific aims of this study are to i assess localised spatial and temporal variations of grace derived tws over sa through the rotation of prefiltered grace hydrological signals ii assess inter annual variations in tws in relation to precipitation and iii predict temporal evolutions of grace derived tws over 12 prominent river basins in sa to achieve this localised sea surface temperature sst anomalies were used as input in a plsr model the assumption here is that strong ocean land atmosphere interaction and the nearby oceans produce the systems that regulates precipitation for most tropical systems one key aspect of the hydrological cycle that shows an increasing acceleration is precipitation unprecedented anomalies in precipitation are expected to have considerable impacts on continental tws variations in general this is the case given the widely reported influence and the feedback mechanism of anomalous warming of the surrounding oceans on inter annual rainfall variations e g zou et al 2018 ndehedehe et al 2018 odekunle and eludoyin 2008 nicholson 2013 fontaine and bigot 1993 so the plsr model uncertainties in the simulation of tws based on leading sst modes from the pacific and atlantic oceans are assessed in relation to observed continent wide and basin scale long terms trends in tws and rainfall more details on the methodological development and applications are highlighted in section 3 2 data 2 1 global precipitation climatology centre precipitation the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc schneider et al 2014 based precipitation data provides monthly grids of global land surface precipitation the 0 5 0 5 gpcc data used in this study to examine tws rainfall relationship was downloaded from the gpcc data portal www ftp dwd de pub data gpcc html downloadgate html and covers the period between 2002 and 2017 the data is one of the most reliable observational reference precipitation product derived from gauge observations across the globe and has been widely used in several hydro climatic studies agutu et al 2017 andam akorful et al 2017 2 2 land water storage assessment using grace mascons gravity recovery and climate experiment derived tws is now one of the most vital tools in hydrological research specifically in monitoring sub surface water storage aquifer system processes and evaluating groundwater resources see e g castellazzi et al 2016 ndehedehe et al 2017b famiglietti et al 2015 swenson and wahr 2007 the applications of grace data in hydrology research globally is growing and well documented humphrey et al 2016 wouters et al 2014and the references therein and is only summarised here in this study the grace mass concentration solutions mascons which solves for monthly gravity field variations in terms of 40 962 geodesic grid tiles over the earth save et al 2016 were used for estimating land water storage over sa the mascon blocks were down sampled to a spatial resolution of 0 5 by 0 5 in order to facilitate the regional averaging whereas the re sampled cells i e 0 5 by 0 5 is still limited to the nominal resolution of grace which is about 300 km the csr mascon approach is based on two step process using an intermediate solution in a first step for deriving a time variable regularization matrices for estimating the mascon solution in a last step which allows the development of a time variable regularization purely based on grace data this regularization prevents the signal leakage into the oceans save et al 2016 the constrained regional water mass solutions used over south america showed they offer a reliable geographical location of hydrological structures frappart et al 2013 apparently these pre processed grace products simplify the use of grace tws observations for several hydrological and water resources applications more details regarding the derivation of the mascon solutions and its performance metrics have been documented by watkins et al 2015 the mascon data 2002 2017 was accessed from the csr data portal http www2 csr utexas edu grace rl05 mascons html in its release 05 rl05 the use of grace mascons is gradually emerging in global freshwater analyses and offer the opportunity to implement geophysical constraints with ease which in turn help to filter out noise from the level 2 grace data e g wiese et al 2016 apart from not requiring rigourous pre processing protocols such as destriping and smoothing it has been argued that the mascon solutions provide similar results consistent with other global grace products e g awange et al 2011 river basin estimates of tws values tws were recovered from the global mascon solutions by using the area weighted average approach i e the approximated area of the basin region as e g ndehedehe et al 2017b 1 tws t 1 a i 1 n tws ϕ i λ i t a i where n is the number of cells within the basin a i is the area of each cell i a is the total area of the basin and ϕ i and λ i are the corresponding latitudes and longitudes of the center of each grid cell respectively 2 3 sea surface temperature anomalies the sea surface temperature sst data monthly means from 2002 to 2017 used in this study is the noaa s optimum interpolation sst v2 and was downloaded from noaa s portal https www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded data noaa oisst v2 html the influence of sst anomalies on land water storage in tropical regions have been reported e g linage et al 2013 de linage et al 2014 ndehedehe et al 2018 so significant modes of localised sst variability from the atlantic and pacific oceans were used as predictors in the partial least square regression model section 3 3 except in cases of human water management e g water transfers sst is a key predictor of rainfall and water availability because de linage et al 2014 identified several studies that showed evidence of the interactions between sst and intertropical convergence zone which resulted in the severe droughts of 2005 and 2010 in the central and western amazon 3 methods 3 1 pre orthogonalization of terrestrial water storage the pre orthogonalization i e pre filtering of terrestrial water storage tws was achieved using the principal component analysis pca ndehedehe et al 2016a jolliffe 2002 a scree plot analysis and the bartlett s test statistics martinez and martinez 2005 snedecor and cochran 1989 were employed to identify the statistically significant orthogonal modes of variability from the pca scheme before the decomposition of tws over sa these test statistics ensured that only the significant orthogonal modes necessary to explain the non random variations in tws at 95 confidence level were used as inputs the filtering of tws using this method is given as e g ndehedehe et al 2016a 2 x t k 1 n a k p k where a k t are the temporal variations also called expansion coefficients or sometimes standardised scores and p k are the corresponding spatial maps empirical orthogonal functions eof loadings the leading orthogonal modes of tws a combination of the temporal and spatial patterns retained for further rotation are the first few pairs obtained from this technique each expansion coefficients represents a fraction of the total variation that is proportional to the amount of covariance in time explained by each eigenvector eof 3 2 decomposition of tws using the joint approximate diagonalisation of eigen matrices the jade joint approximate diagonalisation of eigen matrices technique is a generic algorithm for blind source separation e g cardoso and souloumiac 1993 cardoso 1999 common 1994 cardoso 1991 there are several formulations of the jade algorithm based on three cost functions e g ziehe 2005 however on grounds of numerical and computational efficiency the approach in this study was based on the joint diagonalization of the fourth order cumulant matrices as formulated and implemented by cardoso 1999 and cardoso and souloumiac 1993 after the pre orthogonalization of tws using the pca tool which yielded significant orthogonal modes of tws the fourth order cumulant matrices were then estimated these cumulants provide the suitable matrices to be diagonalized before a rotation towards statistical independence in this study the jade algorithm fully detailed in previous studies e g ziehe 2005 cardoso 1999 cardoso and souloumiac 1993 was used to rotate the pca regularised data matrix x i e eqn 2 through a contrast optimization by the joint diagonalization approach the rotated cumulant matrices resulted in well localised spatial maps m and temporal patterns a as e g ndehedehe et al 2016b 3 x tws x y t am where x y are pixel locations t is the monthly time step a is also known as independent components which is unit less since it has been normalised using its standard deviation while the corresponding spatial patterns m have been scaled using the normalised independent components i e a note that sst anomalies over the pacific and atlantic oceans were also subjected to the jade process before use in the partial least squares regression plsr model although one could argue that working with basin wise analysis of tws in the continent is rather easy the jade technique is employed to support the localisation both spatial and temporal of grace hydrological signals that could be masked by other leading signals resulting from strong rainfall seasonality and surface flow from other hydrological regions typical of the amazon floodplain so the jade analysis is essential to unpack hydrological elements signals in this region which are largely characterized by rainfall changes in floodplain rivers and complex hydrological processes this method was efficient in the volta basin where the lake volta shows strong gravitational signatures in the grace observations the jade rotation facilitated an understanding of the pseudo increase in tws over the volta basin caused by water impoundment of the lake at the akosombo dam despite more than a decade decline in observed rainfall ndehedehe et al 2017b through an innovative combination of this method with partial least squares regression section 3 3 1 this study attempts to provide further understanding related to both climate and non climatic processes that provide constraints on freshwater availability in south america furthermore the linear rates trends in observed time series of estimated tws over each river basin were estimated using the sen s slope sen 1968 estimator since it is robust and resistant to outliers sen slope s i is the median overall values of the whole data and is estimated as 4 s k median p j p i j i for 1 i j n where p j and p i represents data values at time j and i j i respectively while n is the number of observations in the time series to assess the significance of observed trends the null hypothesis of no trend h 0 was tested at α 0 05 using the man kendall s test mann 1945 kendall 1970 as one of our key objective here is to also assess tws rainfall relationship the spatial distribution of trends in tws with rainfall was examined to understand hydrological processes of the region 3 3 parameter estimation techniques 3 3 1 partial least squares regression model the partial least squares regression plsr model is a double barrel multivariate tool as it combines features from pca and mlra multi linear regression analysis as opposed to these multivariate techniques plsr is a better choice for analysing high dimensional data because of its robustness and adaptability e g chen et al 2018 de jong 1993 plsr looks for latent vectors which performs a simultaneous decomposition of independent variable x and response variable y e g lewis beck et al 2003 wold et al 2001 these plsr components are so determined to maximize the covariance between the two variables whilst complying with certain orthogonality and normalization constraints de jong 1993 in a simple formulation of the plsr model e g chen et al 2018 the data elements x i x i 1 x i 2 x i 3 x ip r p i 1 2 3 n with n as the observation samples and y i y i 1 y i 2 y i 3 y iq r q i 1 2 3 n where n is the corresponding dependent samples then the independent variable x x 1 x 2 x 3 x n r n p and the response variable y y 1 y 2 y 3 y n r n q the centered i e removing the mean data matrices x and y are decomposed as e g chen et al 2018 wold et al 2001 5 x n p t n 1 p p 1 e n p y n q u n 1 q q 1 f n q where t and u are latent vectors for the n observations p and q are the loading vectors while e and f are the residual matrices plsr model maximizes the squared covariance between the latent vectors t and u and obtains the projection vectors w and h as t x w and u y h lewis beck et al 2003 mentioned other ways of choosing the latent vectors and highlighted the iterative process of finding the latent vectors until x becomes a null matrix if a linear association exist between t and u e g chen et al 2018 wold et al 2001 de jong 1993 eq 5 above can be updated as 6 x tp e y tq f and through a least square solution p x t t t 1 and q y t t t 1 can be solved the regression between x and y results in c projection vectors and a set of weights w w 1 w 2 w 3 w c the latent components or factor scores can be obtained as chen et al 2018 de jong 1993 t t 1 t 2 t 3 t c while the loading matrices are formulated as p p 1 p 2 p 3 p c and q q 1 q 2 q 3 q c if eqn 6 is rewritten as 7 x tp e y tq f then from 8 t xw e y xwq f the final standard plsr relation between the predictor data matrix x sst and response y tws variables is 9 y x β f where β w q is the plsr coefficients after this multivariate calibration the modelling of tws for each river basin tws rb over south america is subsequently obtained as 10 tws rb β sst localisedmodes y res the predicted tws series were compared with the observed using several validation metrics and statistical index of model performance i e nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse refined index of agreement ia coefficient of determination r 2 and root mean square error rmse statistical details about the modified ia and the nse coefficients are available for interested readers e g willmott et al 2012 nash and sutcliffe 1970 further the jargue bera statistical normality test jarque and bera 1980 is an additional skill metric that was employed to validate the plsr model output by evaluating the normality of the computed residuals i e those obtained from the retrieved plsr components at the 95 confidence level and is computed as 11 jb n 6 s 2 k 3 2 4 where jb denotes jarque bera statistic n is the sample size s is the sample skewness and k is the sample kurtosis the jargue bera test is similar to the lagrange multiplier test and is preferred for large data sets given the unreliability of other normality tests when the sample size is large the test matches the skewness and kurtosis of data to examine if it matches a normal distribution of data be it errors in a regression model or time series data the significance of the probability values at 95 confidence level was determined by comparing the jargue bera test statistics with the critical value for the test if jarque bera is large then normality is rejected at α 0 05 3 3 2 multi linear regression analysis to explore the relationship between tws changes and precipitation patterns over sa multi linear regression analysis mlra was used to model the trends and harmonic components of tws mean annual and semi annual amplitudes of grace derived tws and precipitation time series this was achieved through the parameterizations of these components as reported in previous studies e g ndehedehe et al 2017 rieser et al 2010 trends and harmonic components in the data y i j at time t were parameterised using the mlra as e g rieser et al 2010 12 y i j t ξ 0 ξ 1 t i i max ξ 2 i cos i ω t ξ 2 i 1 sin i ω t ε t where the least square estimated coefficients ξ 0 is an offset ξ 1 linear trend and ξ 2 i and ξ 2 i 1 represent the periodic components in the data the annual amplitude of the data is captured when the period t of the angular frequency ω 2 π t is 12 months with the coefficients ξ 2 and ξ 3 along with their corresponding trigonometric base functions i e cos ω t and sin ω t representing the annual component the coefficients ξ 4 and ξ 5 represent the semi annual component while ε is the error term which is assumed to be normally distributed root mean square errors and coefficients of determination r 2 were employed to assess the skill of mlra in modelling tws and rainfall over south america 4 results 4 1 rotation of terrestrial water storage using higher order statistical algorithms other higher order statistical decomposition algorithms which uses the fixed point iteration scheme have been employed in filtering satellite gravity signals frappart et al 2011b frappart et al 2010 contrary to these algorithms the jade technique exploits the fourth order cumulants of the data matrix based on remote properties that include non stationarity spectral non flatness and non gaussianity e g ndehedehe et al 2016b ziehe 2005 cardoso 1999 common 1994 because of the statistical and numerical efficiency of the jade approach in solving the optimisation problem e g ziehe 2005 cardoso and souloumiac 1993 eight significant independent and well localised spatio temporal patterns will be interchangeably designated as regions of tws were recovered over south america sa these patterns highlights considerable inter annual variability and regional grace hydrological signals over the continent fig 2 the surface water dynamics of the amazon basin and much of brazil dominate the independent patterns of tws in sa tws 1 and tws 2 figs 2 and 3 and together account for approximately 60 of the total variability region one is localised over the amazon floodplain cf figs 2 and 3 and the exchange of water fluxes within this domain is somewhat complex apart from the indication that the highest proportion of stored water on the amazon floodplain comes from the mainstem river alsdorf et al 2010 also found that the mainstem discharge was higher compared to the sum of annual water storage and that drained from the amazon floodplain although variations in surface waters represent a considerable component of tws as observed by grace e g frappart et al 2011a kim et al 2009 han et al 2009 the strong exchange of fluxes within the floodplain corridors explains why the dominant patterns of tws over sa is observed over the amazon floodplain tws 1 figs 2 and 3 this is consistent with the results of frappart et al 2013 who found the strongest spatial loadings of tws along the solimões amazon corridor and includes the south of the amazonian and the negro basins in regions three and four tws 3 and tws 4 figs 2 and 3 observed grace hydrological signals are annual variations with probable contributions from multi scale climate oscillations e g el ninõ southern oscillation enso related teleconnections some studies found the connections between enso and inter annual tws variations in these regions e g ni et al 2018 linage et al 2013 phillips et al 2012 by further exploring the interplay between enso teleconnections and grace hydrological signals for regions three northern brazil and four venezuela we also found strong evidence that suggests climate teleconnection driven influence on tws dynamics but it is not clear which hydrological stores or component of grace tws e g surface water soil moisture aquifer etc provides this response to climate the grace hydrological signal in region five tws 5 figs 2 and 3 is the melting of the patagonia ice field consistent with this study different methods which includes forward modeling approach have been employed to highlight the continued mass loss in patagonia rodell et al 2018 willis et al 2012 chen et al 2007a this extensive and unabated mass loss in patagonia ice field tws 5 fig 3 is caused by the warming of the climate system and being the second largest ice body in the southern hemisphere grace is a viable tool for the continued monitoring of the impact of rising temperature on ice fields note that similar to the jade algorithm estimated negative trends observed over the patagonia ice field using the sen s slope and multi linear regression model are consistent sections 4 2 1 and 4 3 2 region six tws 6 figs 2 and 3 highlights amplitudes of tws in the chile region but with most parts falling within argentina while region seven tws 7 figs 2 and 3 depicts multi annual variations in tws over south brazil and the neighbouring central argentina with a weak opposite phase in north east brazil having experienced repeated earthquakes deformations and other forms of natural disturbances e g ruiz and madariaga 2018 jaramillo et al 2017 vigny et al 2011 lomnitz 2004 the geophysical signals in chile and the neighbouring argentina is expected to be dominated and driven by natural and climatic elements the temporal pattern tws 6 fig 3 associated with this signal in the chile argentina regions tws 6 fig 2 show a falling amplitude between 2005 and 2011 while the period after 2011 shows a rising trend consistent with the results in section 4 3 note that region 6 tws 6 fig 2 also indicates relatively strong opposite tws anomalies in the central amazon basin area and could be related to floodplain and wetland water storage gain between 2005 and 2010 i e when jointly interpreted from the corresponding temporal patterns tws 6 fig 3 and again coincides with numerical results in section 4 3 the argument here is that elevation of the flood plains of amazon basin low elevation areas less than 200 m above mean sea level coincides with the unique features of tws for region 6 e g the region with the most freshwater fig 1 as depicted in its spatial patterns tws 6 fig 2 that is the spatial patterns with positive loadings in chile and environ tws 6 fig 2 are interpreted as wet conditions or gain in surface mass if multiplied with its corresponding positive amplitudes in fig 3 similarly the spatial patterns with negative loadings in fig 2 amazon region are interpreted as wet conditions or rise in surface mass if multiplied with its corresponding negative amplitudes tws 6 fig 3 the low elevation areas of the amazon and the strong annual fluctuations tws 6 fig 3 suggests that it appears to be a rather permanent wetland water storage induced by rainfall seasonality cf fig 1 as opposed to the high elevation areas of chile greater than 3500 m above mean sea level which shows annual fluctuations in tws it can be argued that elevation plays a role in the amazon flood plain wetland water storage notably this amazon signal region 6 is different from regions 1 and 2 where river storage exchange of fluxes between tributaries including vertical movement of shallow groundwater could be major drivers of grace derived tws variations along the amazon corridor regarding the spatial patterns in region 7 tws 7 fig 2 the strongest signals with opposite phase occur within southern brazil the corresponding time series tws 7 fig 3 show relatively strong negative anomalies in 2004 and 2009 before the strong rise that occurred after 2010 the peak negative anomalies in 2004 and 2009 appear to coincide with severe droughts in the region especially the summer drought of 2004 2005 as highlighted further in section 4 2 1 the short term trends in tws and rainfall during this period around this region 2012 2017 show consistency between 2012 and 2014 but with small dissimilarity during the 2010 2012 period and can be explored further in future studies that focus on this region region eight tws 8 figs 2 and 3 is the grace hydrological signal native to north east brazil e g sun et al 2016 the declining trend in tws during the 2011 2015 period and the strongest negative anomaly observed between 2014 and 2015 tws 8 fig 3 coincide with the widely reported super extreme droughts that ravaged most eastern sections of brazil during the same period especially 2015 e g ferreira et al 2018 zou et al 2018 getirana 2016 this prolonged drought which occurred in much of north east brazil during most of the 2010 2013 period resulting in considerable declines in tws tws 8 fig 3 triggered the need to improve drought related policy and management strategies at various levels of government in brazil see gutierrez et al 2014 owing to limited annual rainfall north east brazil is generally a water deficit region and depends on surface water from the amazon basin for irrigation and hydropower generation the sao francisco river basin in brazil depends on water transfers between river basins moreover the national water agency of brazil reported in 2015 that 79 of total water withdrawn was for irrigated agriculture hence grace is a viable hydrological tool to support the monitoring of hydrological drought and its impacts on water availability and human abstraction see ferreira et al 2018 4 2 assessing inter annual variations and changes in tws in this section results for the region specific twelve river basins estimates of linear rates in tws are highlighted these river basins are among the well known global river basins add to this time series of tws grids are compared to those of rainfall over sa based on cross correlograms 4 2 1 recent changes in tws in south american river basins observed temporal variations in the 15 year grace derived tws over 12 river basins are marked with strong fluctuations with an estimated linear rate of 11 29 1 71 mm yr sao francisco showed the strongest fall while parana indicated the strongest rise 6 88 1 13 mm yr in tws during the 2002 2017 period fig 4 the summary of mann kendall s test statistics for all significant α 0 05 linear trends observed in the 12 river basins for the two periods 2002 2017 and 2010 2017 analysed are highlighted in table 1 considering the estimated linear rates between 2010 and 2017 the strongest decline 38 48 7 90 mm yr in tws was found in orinoco while uruguay showed a considerable increase in tws 28 28 3 49 mm yr unlike other basins fig 4 and table 1 during the same period 2010 2017 significant increase in tws were also observed in parana 17 92 3 44 mm yr rio colorado 23 99 2 60 mm yr negro 13 0 3 27 mm yr and rio salado 25 17 2 78 mm yr while sao francisco 30 84 4 17 and parnaiba 24 42 4 95 indicated relatively strong negative trends in tws fig 4 and table 1 the spatial distribution of trends in tws and precipitation over south america suggest complex hydrological structures and processes for instance the long term declines in tws over chile argentina regions and melting of the patagonia ice field are inconsistent with rainfall figs 5 a and d this is because the factors driving the hydrology of these areas are beyond rainfall recall that these signals coincide with the spatial and temporal patterns in regions five and six tws 5 and tws 6 figs 2 and 3 and further highlights the effectiveness of the jade rotation in localizing geophysical signals further the analyses of short term trends 2010 2012 and 2012 2014 also highlights the remarkable difference in recent changes in tws in relation to rainfall such inconsistencies are mostly observed over venezuela brazil and argentina figs 5b c and e f however the tws trends in northeast brazil between 2012 and 2014 are consistent with those of rainfall figs 5e and f whereas tws in some regions in sa respond to changes in rainfall and climatic conditions as is the case in north east and southern brazil figs 5b c and e f the complex hydrogeological structures in some areas may trigger interesting hydrological processes to understands this processes the grid based tws rainfall association and phase lags during the entire period are explored in the next section by implementing a cross correlation 4 2 2 grace tws vs rainfall to explore the tws rainfall relationship cross correlation between detrended series of grace tws and gpcc rainfall was analysed from water budget equation tws changes in time in other words observed changes in tws balances precipitation minus evaporation and runoff figure 6 shows the lags presented as colored surface at which the two series present the maximum correlation coefficients presented as contour lines overall rainfall rates lead tws in approximately zero to three months for almost all of sa with correlation coefficient ranging from approximately 0 60 to 0 80 fig 6 for example considering the physiographic regions of sa the brazilian highlands the amazon rainforest and the gran chaco regions spreads across eastern bolivia western paraguay northern argentina and sections of brazil all indicate relatively high correlations with rainfall leading tws moreover the lianos and guiana highlands both at northern sa and the andes mountains apart from the portion that surrounds the altiplano and atacama desert present good phase agreement with high correlation coefficients while this shows good feedback of tws on rainfall for almost all sa the relationship between tws and rainfall during the period is statistically not significant at the 95 confidence interval however there are exceptions in the regions below latitude 16 which are arid regions characterized by relatively low precipitation rates fig 1b the chile coastline and the patagonia are regions where correlations are modest ranging from 0 40 to 0 60 and rainfall generally leads tws with a phase greater than four months fig 6 there are also some hydrological hot spots regions below latitude 16 with tws leading rainfall with a phase of 12 months but with high correlation only for the lake titicaca region cf fig 1 and 6 but around the patagonian region and chobut colorado and salgado basins correlation coefficients between the series are low r 0 40 indicating that the key driver of variations in tws is beyond rainfall for example the pampas of argentina approximately between latitudes 40 s to 32 s and longitudes 56 w to 64 w is characterized by annual precipitations of 500 1000 mm fig 1b tws shows relatively low annual peaks with a negative linear trends of 5 to 15 mm yr of mass loss this could be attributed to changes in the land use due to the crop rotations or natural vegetation which might decrease groundwater recharge and thus decrease tws storages e g kroes et al 2019 this is particularly true for patagonia since it is characteristically a dry climate as shown in region 6 figs 2 and fig 3 the patagonia ice fields are undergoing a contemporary melting and retreating of glacial ice and is consistent with previous studies e g willis et al 2012 chen et al 2007a the andean plateau altiplano presents a phase lead greater than twelve months for rainfall relative to tws series and includes part of the pampas region furthermore part of the pampas region southern also shows a phase lead of about 12 months tws lags rainfall in both cases we found that correlation coefficients were low mostly between around 0 10 and 0 20 and insignificant 4 3 modelling tws using parameter estimation techniques 4 3 1 partial least square regression prediction of river basin tws overall the temporal variations of tws are well predicted for most of the river basins fig 7 and show reasonable residuals and considerable association with observed tws based on three validation metrics used figs 8 a b in terms of the performance of plsr model time series of tws in the amazon orinoco tocantins and chobut basins were well predicted and showed optimum skills based on these validation metrics r 2 ia and nse these basins indicated r 2 ia and nse coefficients above 0 83 fig 8b but with chobut having the least residual and rmse fig 8a however rio colorado rio salado uruguay sao francisco and parnaiba indicated relatively higher tws residuals and rmses figs 7 and 8a the uncertainties i e residuals and rmses in predicted time series of tws in these locations were also reflected in their observed validation metrics with rio colorado showing the lowest r 2 0 49 ia 0 66 and nse 0 49 fig 8b the obvious poor performance of the plsr model in rio colorado rio salado and sao francisco fig 8a and b gives credence to the argument of the perceived contributions of non climatic elements to observed inter annual variations in tws especially for the basins located in brazil e g sao francisco uruguay and argentina the tws rainfall relationship as was highlighted in section 4 2 2 indicated poor association with considerable phase lags in most catchments this may not be unconnected with human water management as getirana 2016 for example found considerable correlations of monthly time series of twsa and ground based water storage observations with most reservoirs within southeastern brazil given the observed residuals and the index of agreement figs 7 and 8a it seems the predictability of tws based on hydro climatic variables could be challenging in some river basins of sa as indicated in fig 6 some of these regions andean plateau pampas etc showed low correlation values ranging from 0 00 to 0 20 and with more than 12 months in phase lag between 4 3 2 multi linear regression of tws grids in this section the results of simulated tws and rainfall grids over sa using the mlra technique are highlighted the mean annual amplitudes of rainfall observed over the amazon basin area is consistent with tws figs 9 a and f while the trends and mean semi annual amplitudes of tws show significant disparity and does not completely mimic the modelled patterns of rainfall figs 9b c and g h as opposed to rainfall the only spot with considerable semi annual signal is in the brazil section of the amazon basin figs 9b and g the dissimilarity in trends tws and rainfall especially those observed in brazil and argentina figs 9c and h confirm the complex geophysical processes in the continent as highlighted in previous sections overall the root mean square error rmse is relatively low over the arid regions of sa for rainfall and tws but somewhat higher for tws in the central amazon basin figs 9d and i such relatively high uncertainties may result from the influence of important processes of inter annual variability e g pacific decadal oscillation or the complex properties of the amazon floodplain as it relates to exchange of fluxes and water storage e g alsdorf et al 2010 however the coefficient of determination r 2 suggest the model predicts variations in tws and rainfall quite well with r 2 values ranging from 1 00 to 0 80 figs 9e and j except for r 2 values i e tws over patagonia figs 9e the regions that are poorly simulated in the two products are generally found below latitude 20 figs 9e and j the low r 2 values in tws for example could imply strong interactions with non climatic factors and or the multi linear regression model is not suitable for those locations overall the modelling of tws and rainfall over the amazon basin show a good fit and suggest it can be predicted quite well this is justified by the result in section 4 2 2 where the tws rainfall relationship around the brazilian highlands and much of the amazon rainforest is relatively high with rainfall leading tws but the plenitude of observed r 2 ranging from 0 to 0 30 in some regions of the continent could imply the predominant influence of other hydrological drivers e g natural disturbances and perturbations of multi scale global climate signals the influence of the latter on tws in tropical sa has been reported e g linage et al 2013 while the contributions of the former to changes in tws in the chile argentina regions have been affirmed in some studies e g rodell et al 2018 han et al 2010 5 discussion 5 1 assessing drivers of land water storage global climate is changing the impacts of such changes which have been attributed to rising anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases amongst other things are evident in natural systems and acceleration of the water cycle be it at regional or global scales the rise in global sea levels long term declines in rainfall and tws and increased frequency in flood and drought events e g rodell et al 2018 spinoni et al 2014 nka et al 2015 boening et al 2012 paeth et al 2012 van der molen et al 2011 sheffield and wood 2008 across the globe are some apparent indices of a changing global climate as with other regions whose tws variations and discharge are largely rainfall dependent e g ndehedehe 2019 ndehedehe et al 2016a phillips et al 2012 conway et al 2009 land water storage dynamics includes river discharge and surface runoff in sa are arguably driven by changes in climate and other key processes of inter annual variability such as enso e g linage et al 2013 de linage et al 2014 frappart et al 2013a frappart et al 2013 incessant extreme drought events in south america for instance have been linked to large scale variations in the tropical oceans pacific and atlantic this was recently echoed by erfanian et al 2017 who also found significant relationship between unparalleled drought events in south america and extreme anomalies in sst of the nearby oceans whereas inter annual changes in rainfall over tropical ecosystems are significantly modulated by the tropical oceans ndehedehe et al 2018 odekunle and eludoyin 2008 semazzi et al 1988 nicholson 2013 our results in section 4 1 confirm that these drought episodes have considerable impacts on tws this is true for brazil where the observed decline in tws between 2012 and 2015 tws 8 figs 2 3 and 5 coincided with the extreme drought that ravaged brazil during the period e g ferreira et al 2018 apart from the continued mass loss in patagonia tws 5 figs 2 and 3 caused by climate warming the observed tws rainfall relationship section 4 2 also highlights the importance of climate variability in observed variations in tws over most sub regions of sa within the context of tws response to climate variability induced rainfall there are indications however that some hydrological signals are not unconnected with non climatic influence in practical geodetic concepts as it relates to mass redistributions caused by changes in gravity fields chile tws 6 figs 2 and 3 is one of the most complex hydrological regions in sa ferreira et al 2019 because of its hydro geodetic characteristics and geophysical formation the chilean region and environ for example are vulnerable to vertical deformations seismicity and earthquakes see e g montecino et al 2017b montecino et al 2017a jaramillo et al 2017 some of these geodetic perturbations and disturbances as also found in other regions e g chen et al 2007b have enduring hydro ecological effects on the environments e g jaramillo et al 2017 hydrologically they leave behind extraneous geophysical signals that become available as an integral part of observed hydrological changes in such regions these signals complicate our understanding of land water storage drivers for example in the chile earthquake of 27 february 2010 han et al 2010 found a gravity anomaly of 5 μ gal with a spatial scale of 500 km east of the epicenter after the earthquake if we consider the relation between water storage change δ h in meters and gravitational attraction due to the water mass δ g tws m s2 as δ g tws 4 2 s y δ h the change in gravity due to the maule event of 5 10 8 m s2 would be equivalent to an apparent change in tws of about 39 mm considering s y the specific yield dimensionless equals 0 3 correcting the impacts of this gravity shift on the overall surface mass changes around the region is a complex geodetic problem and this was not address in this study since it is a localized effect since the inception of grace there have been at least four earthquakes e g 2010 mw 8 8 2014 mw 8 2 2015 mw 8 3 and 2016 mw 7 6 and other geodetic disturbances e g tsunamis and volcanism in chile e g ruiz and madariaga 2018 jaramillo et al 2017 montecino et al 2017b montecino et al 2017a vigny et al 2011 chen et al 2007a while han et al 2010 found strong gravity shift after the 2010 chile earthquake which affected gravity anomalies in argentina the observed tws trend in central argentina was partly attributed to this magnitude 8 8 earthquake in addition to natural drivers such as rainfall rodell et al 2018 it is obvious that the grace hydrological time series in fig 3 are mostly dominated by strong inter annual variations but when the trends annual and semi annual amplitudes of tws were isolated using a multi linear regression parameterisation region 6 tws 6 fig 3 showed a considerable rise in tws after 2011 when it was statistically decomposed not shown this rise in tws could be artificial jumps in surface mass variations related to post seismic deformations or coseismic jump in the geoid montecino et al 2017a based on the plsr model tws in sao francisco rio colorado and rio salado showed less association with climatic parameters this association results probably from a combined influence of human water management practices and other complex environmental conditions and processes mentioned earlier for instance in the sao francisco river basin in south america for example about 44 million people depend on water transfers between river basins further the national water agency of brazil reported in 2015 that 79 of total water withdrawn was for irrigated agriculture this kind of footprints and perhaps those caused by geodetic perturbations could leave behind surface mass variations that can be misconstrued or interpreted as those induced by rainfall seasonality also water limited regions in brazil mostly coincide with semi arid areas and those with fractured aquifers were there is heavy reliance on surface waters ana 2017 the linear trend observed in water limited basins such as sao francisco 30 84 4 17 mm yr between 2010 and 2017 in brazil shows a considerable fall table 1 and could result in a rise in water demand especially in the light of unprecedented changes in rainfall with a total of 19 361 man made reservoirs as at 2016 brazil apparently shows increased dependence on surface water resources for irrigation and hydropower with sao francisco being one of the major hotspots for surface water consumption ana 2017 hence this obvious anthropogenic footprint in the region is expected to impact the prediction of tws variations 5 2 predicting land water storage for an optimal prediction of tws response or dependent variables over each river basin a two step regularization approach that combined jade method and plsr was employed fourteen independent components of sst anomalies i e seven independent components each from the pacific and atlantic oceans i e independent variables obtained from the combined pca cumulant decomposition were used in the plsr model to predict tws a subset of the latent variables based on nine plsr components were retrieved and used to develop a prediction model the observed plsr model uncertainties fig 8 in the simulation of river basin tws using the leading independent sst modes from the pacific and atlantic oceans for some regions e g amazon orinoco tocantins etc suggest the considerable role of climate variability in long term changes in river basin tws however the plsr model was somewhat less effective in other river basins rio salado sao francisco rio colorado and uruguay given their modest skills r 2 ia and nse fig 8b and relatively high rsmes not shown the jarque bera statistical test for these basins p 0 5 0 1 0 2 0 5 0 39 for sao francisco rio colorado uruguay and rio salado respectively indicated the model s estimated residuals were not normally distributed as their probability values were greater than the 0 05 confidence level the modest predictive capacity of tws using climate components as exhibited by the plsr scheme in these basins merely imply that tws are significantly driven by non climatic factors as we have unpacked in previous sections the increasing dynamics in global tws owing to the combined influence of climate and other stressors restricts other conventional models e g least squares in predictive frameworks although it bears some similarity to principal component analysis i e in terms of seeking a hyperplane that maximizes the variance of the input variable preisendorfer 1988 one key advantage of the plsr model is that it mitigates the effect of multi collinearity e g biswas and kundu 2018 lewis beck et al 2003 wold et al 2001 by ensuring that only significant components relevant to the response variable are retained for the regression although the orthogonality of the principal components apparently also solves this multi collinearity problem the choice of an optimum subset of predictors however remains a key issue e g lewis beck et al 2003 wold et al 2001 the plsr scheme addresses this problem thus making it more suitable in the forecast of hydrological quantities such as grace derived tws this innate potential of the plsr model is what we have explored in this study for the prediction of river basin tws in south america for the first time and complements existing frameworks of other statistical predictive models deployed recently for routine analysis and modelling of climatic variables ndehedehe et al 2019 krepper et al 2018 biswas and kundu 2018 considering the low r 2 values in modelled tws optimising the multi linear regression model for improved freshwater prediction could imply an expansion of the independent variables unlike other regions where variations in rivers lakes and floodplains do not contribute to observed changes in grace tws getirana et al 2017 tws over the amazon basin is considerably driven mostly by its surface waters rivers and estuaries along the floodplain the dominant patterns of tws observed over the amazon basin in this study aligns with an earlier report by kim et al 2009 who found that river storage and sub surface flow accounted for about 73 of tws variations in amazon as opposed to the amazon region significant large scale alteration of hydrological processes resulting from multiple strings of human activities e g surface water developments and water diversion in other large watersheds are well known drivers of surface water hydrology e g ndehedehe et al 2019 wada et al 2017 hence independent variables e g river discharge and evapotranspiration are critical water budget quantities expected to improve freshwater prediction for the amazon basin in addition to accounting for climate teleconnection driven rainfall however accounting for human induced influence e g surface water developments and increased water abstraction in predictive models is challenging and may require advance statistical approaches for instance in the light of the observed strong gravimetric contributions of lake volta to grace derived tws over the volta basin a weighted least squares formulation of global spherical harmonic analysis was integrated with a fourth order cumulant statistics to isolate non climatic hydrological time series of surface water storage see ndehedehe et al 2017b by recovering this surface water contributions caused by human water management strategies tws over the volta basin can be predicted more accurately research problems that seek to quantify the impacts of anthropogenic contributions on regional or continental hydrology are new innovative directions that will support predictive frameworks and effective characterisation of key hydrologic metrics 6 conclusion the knowledge of global freshwater response to critical stressors e g human water abstraction is crucial to improving predictive frameworks that support water governance and management schemes hence an innovative approach that combined jade joint approximate diagonalisation of eigen matrices algorithm and partial least square regression was employed in this study to assess grace derived terrestrial water storage tws over south america sa the temporal evolutions of tws over prominent river basins in the continent was also predicted using independent patterns of sea surface temperature sst anomalies of the nearby oceans the conclusions from this study are summarised as follows 1 grace hydrological signals within the amazon basin and much of brazil dominate the independent patterns of tws in sa and together account for approximately 60 of the total variability the strong exchange of fluxes within the floodplain corridors of the amazon and the influence of climate modes explain why strong spatial patterns of tws is observed over the amazon basin and the entire tropical sa amongst other geophysical signals identified the jade rotation of tws over sa isolated the extensive and unabated mass loss in patagonia ice field caused by the warming of the climate system still on the jade rotation of tws we noted that the grace hydrological signals native to north east brazil are largely associated with extreme hydro climatic events droughts 2 having experienced repeated earthquakes seismicity deformations and other forms of natural disturbances the geophysical signals in chile and the neighbouring argentina are expected to be dominated and driven by both dynamical physical processes and climatic elements because of this complex hydro geodetic structure and geophysical formation interpreting grace hydrological signals in these regions is challenging and requires caution 3 estimated tws trends α 0 05 in the twelve river basins in sa for the 2010 2017 period indicates orinoco had the strongest fall 38 48 7 90 mm yr in tws while uruguay showed a considerable rise 28 28 3 49 mm yr unlike other basins during this same period 2010 2017 relatively strong increase in tws was also observed in rio colorado 23 99 2 60 mm yr and rio salado 25 17 2 78 mm yr while sao francisco 30 84 4 17 and parnaiba 24 42 4 95 indicated relatively strong negative trends in tws generally the grid based comparisons of rainfall and tws trends over some areas of sa are inconsistent and suggests that the hydrological drivers of these regions e g patagonia brazil argentina and venezuela are beyond rainfall 4 overall rainfall leads tws in approximately one to three months in much of sa with maximum correlation coefficients r ranging from approximately 0 6 to 0 8 especially around brazil and the amazon basin tws in some regions however show low and modest correlations with rainfall in these hydrological regions rainfall leads tws with a phase lag ranging from 2 4 months and indicate that apart from rainfall other key drivers of variations in tws exists since for example such regions are typically characterised by a dry climate similar conclusion applies to some hot spots in the semi arid north east brazil where the tws rainfall association is poor and not significant during the period 5 based on several skill metrics and the jarque bera statistical test for the plsr model output tws in sao francisco rio colorado and rio salado showed less association with climatic parameters this association could be the result of a combined influence of human water management practices and other complex environmental conditions and processes the roles of reservoir storage and dams on surface hydrology for example in sao francisco where water abstraction for irrigation is nearly 80 require further investigation considering the low r 2 values and uncertainties in modelled tws over sa in some hydrological regions optimising the multi linear regression model for improved freshwater prediction could imply an expansion of the independent variables

5978,the underlying uncertainties in the prediction of freshwater evolutions in some regions can be induced by several unmitigated human actions multi scale climatic drivers and dynamic physical processes these factors have enduring hydro ecological effects on the environments and combine to limit our understanding of large scale hydrological processes and impacts of climate on water availability considering the fact that several hydrogeological perturbations and disturbances have been reported during the last decade in south america sa a further assessment of continental land water storage is therefore warranted in this study a two step regularization approach that combined the jade joint approximate diagonalisation of eigen matrices algorithm and plsr partial least

rodell et al 2018 vorosmarty et al 2010 however the underlying uncertainties in the prediction of freshwater evolutions in some regions can be induced by non climatic factors e g earthquakes land subsidence and unmitigated human actions e g rodell et al 2018 famiglietti 2014 han et al 2010 chen et al 2007b within the context of dynamic earth processes south america for instance is a hub of frequent considerable crustal and lithospheric deformations seismicity and geo hazards see e g ruiz and madariaga 2018 ferreira et al 2018 montecino et al 2017b montecino et al 2017a jaramillo et al 2017 vigny et al 2011 han et al 2010 lomnitz 2004 these geodetic disturbances and the composite influence of climate and physical processes could have implications on surface mass variations and the acceleration of the water cycle in the light of the aforementioned perturbations on surface hydrology time variable geophysical signals observed by the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace tapley et al 2004 are expected to be driven not only by climate oscillations and key processes of inter annual variability e g ni et al 2018 ndehedehe et al 2018 ndehedehe et al 2017 dong et al 2015 linage et al 2013 phillips et al 2012 but natural and other non climatic elements e g human water abstraction and deformations e g rodell et al 2018 chen et al 2016 castellazzi et al 2016 famiglietti 2014 chen et al 2007b this assumption is anchored on the fact that apart from the redistribution in continental water storage other dynamic processes such as gravitational tide in the solid earth post glacial rebound and variations in antarctic and greenland ice volumes cause significant changes in the earth s gravity e g swenson and wahr 2002 wahr et al 1998 whereas a plethora of scientific reports on freshwater dynamics are mostly focused on climate variability related changes e g rodell et al 2018 anyah et al 2018 reager et al 2014 thomas et al 2014 linage et al 2013 phillips et al 2012 very little attention is paid to improving our understanding of the possible contributions of non climatic factors especially those not related to groundwater abstraction for regions with frequent repeat cycles of such factors freshwater dynamics is expected to be poorly understood hence predicting freshwater systems at regional or continental scales require large scale assessment of tws terrestrial water storage variations and an understanding of prominent drivers of surface hydrology while this knowledge will lay the foundation for an efficient modelling framework for water resources limited ground observations and the lack of a suitable modelling approach to characterize key hydrological metrics however are some important constraints to such assessments further the proliferation of dams and surface water developments for hydropower agriculture and other relevant applications are gradually emerging as considerable drivers of tws in africa such impacts have been reported for the lake volta and victoria see ndehedehe et al 2017b moore and williams 2014 ahmed et al 2014 while the global expansion of dams and hydro power stations are welcomed initiatives that could significantly boost global hydroelectricity capacity zarfl et al 2015 they are also expected however to have considerable impact on hydrological changes as is the case in lake volta see ndehedehe et al 2017b ndehedehe 2019 or over the amazon basin where dam constructions are impacting on the ecosystems by modifying vital flood pulses 1 https news mongabay com 2018 01 study amazon dams are disrupting ecologically vital flood pulses 1 since the advent of grace quantitative estimates of monthly changes in tws soil moisture groundwater surface water wetlands etc have been recovered across the globe because of its spatial resolution 90 000 km2 the dynamics in multi layered land water storage can be measured at global or regional scales with an accuracy of 15 mm expressed in terms of equivalent water height famiglietti and rodell 2013 apparently the preponderance of grace hydrological studies in south america sa figs 1 a and b focused on some sections of the amazon basin see e g tourian et al 2018 linage et al 2013 de linage et al 2014 frappart et al 2013a frappart et al 2012 frappart et al 2011a alsdorf et al 2010 kim et al 2009 han et al 2009 however the validation of regional mass solutions of grace level 1 data and the estimates of tws over sa based on constrained least squares method have been reported frappart et al 2013 ramillien et al 2012 considering the complex hydrogeological structures of sa fig 1a these studies emphasize the need to further assess the inter annual variations of land water storage and the representation of dynamic processes in time variable gravity observations given that sa accounts for nearly one fifth of global continental freshwater discharge e g linage et al 2013 a continent wide assessment of grace derived tws has become necessary not only to improve our contemporary understanding of large scale hydrological processes but to support the tracking and modelling of freshwater dynamics in the region consequently to improve our understanding of the spatial and temporal variations of extended grace derived tws 2002 2017 over sa this study localises grace hydrological signals by rotating it towards statistical independence using the joint approximate diagonalisation of eigen matrices jade algorithm e g ndehedehe et al 2016b ziehe 2005 cardoso and souloumiac 1993 cardoso 1999 common 1994 cardoso 1991 given the lack of sufficient groundwater monitoring bores in many regions of the world the jade algorithm could be used to identify strong hydrological signals induced by droughts or even characterize groundwater variations from grace tws without using apriori information for the first time a partial least squares regression plsr model is combined with jade rotation and multi linear regression to model grace tws over sa the specific aims of this study are to i assess localised spatial and temporal variations of grace derived tws over sa through the rotation of prefiltered grace hydrological signals ii assess inter annual variations in tws in relation to precipitation and iii predict temporal evolutions of grace derived tws over 12 prominent river basins in sa to achieve this localised sea surface temperature sst anomalies were used as input in a plsr model the assumption here is that strong ocean land atmosphere interaction and the nearby oceans produce the systems that regulates precipitation for most tropical systems one key aspect of the hydrological cycle that shows an increasing acceleration is precipitation unprecedented anomalies in precipitation are expected to have considerable impacts on continental tws variations in general this is the case given the widely reported influence and the feedback mechanism of anomalous warming of the surrounding oceans on inter annual rainfall variations e g zou et al 2018 ndehedehe et al 2018 odekunle and eludoyin 2008 nicholson 2013 fontaine and bigot 1993 so the plsr model uncertainties in the simulation of tws based on leading sst modes from the pacific and atlantic oceans are assessed in relation to observed continent wide and basin scale long terms trends in tws and rainfall more details on the methodological development and applications are highlighted in section 3 2 data 2 1 global precipitation climatology centre precipitation the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc schneider et al 2014 based precipitation data provides monthly grids of global land surface precipitation the 0 5 0 5 gpcc data used in this study to examine tws rainfall relationship was downloaded from the gpcc data portal www ftp dwd de pub data gpcc html downloadgate html and covers the period between 2002 and 2017 the data is one of the most reliable observational reference precipitation product derived from gauge observations across the globe and has been widely used in several hydro climatic studies agutu et al 2017 andam akorful et al 2017 2 2 land water storage assessment using grace mascons gravity recovery and climate experiment derived tws is now one of the most vital tools in hydrological research specifically in monitoring sub surface water storage aquifer system processes and evaluating groundwater resources see e g castellazzi et al 2016 ndehedehe et al 2017b famiglietti et al 2015 swenson and wahr 2007 the applications of grace data in hydrology research globally is growing and well documented humphrey et al 2016 wouters et al 2014and the references therein and is only summarised here in this study the grace mass concentration solutions mascons which solves for monthly gravity field variations in terms of 40 962 geodesic grid tiles over the earth save et al 2016 were used for estimating land water storage over sa the mascon blocks were down sampled to a spatial resolution of 0 5 by 0 5 in order to facilitate the regional averaging whereas the re sampled cells i e 0 5 by 0 5 is still limited to the nominal resolution of grace which is about 300 km the csr mascon approach is based on two step process using an intermediate solution in a first step for deriving a time variable regularization matrices for estimating the mascon solution in a last step which allows the development of a time variable regularization purely based on grace data this regularization prevents the signal leakage into the oceans save et al 2016 the constrained regional water mass solutions used over south america showed they offer a reliable geographical location of hydrological structures frappart et al 2013 apparently these pre processed grace products simplify the use of grace tws observations for several hydrological and water resources applications more details regarding the derivation of the mascon solutions and its performance metrics have been documented by watkins et al 2015 the mascon data 2002 2017 was accessed from the csr data portal http www2 csr utexas edu grace rl05 mascons html in its release 05 rl05 the use of grace mascons is gradually emerging in global freshwater analyses and offer the opportunity to implement geophysical constraints with ease which in turn help to filter out noise from the level 2 grace data e g wiese et al 2016 apart from not requiring rigourous pre processing protocols such as destriping and smoothing it has been argued that the mascon solutions provide similar results consistent with other global grace products e g awange et al 2011 river basin estimates of tws values tws were recovered from the global mascon solutions by using the area weighted average approach i e the approximated area of the basin region as e g ndehedehe et al 2017b 1 tws t 1 a i 1 n tws ϕ i λ i t a i where n is the number of cells within the basin a i is the area of each cell i a is the total area of the basin and ϕ i and λ i are the corresponding latitudes and longitudes of the center of each grid cell respectively 2 3 sea surface temperature anomalies the sea surface temperature sst data monthly means from 2002 to 2017 used in this study is the noaa s optimum interpolation sst v2 and was downloaded from noaa s portal https www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded data noaa oisst v2 html the influence of sst anomalies on land water storage in tropical regions have been reported e g linage et al 2013 de linage et al 2014 ndehedehe et al 2018 so significant modes of localised sst variability from the atlantic and pacific oceans were used as predictors in the partial least square regression model section 3 3 except in cases of human water management e g water transfers sst is a key predictor of rainfall and water availability because de linage et al 2014 identified several studies that showed evidence of the interactions between sst and intertropical convergence zone which resulted in the severe droughts of 2005 and 2010 in the central and western amazon 3 methods 3 1 pre orthogonalization of terrestrial water storage the pre orthogonalization i e pre filtering of terrestrial water storage tws was achieved using the principal component analysis pca ndehedehe et al 2016a jolliffe 2002 a scree plot analysis and the bartlett s test statistics martinez and martinez 2005 snedecor and cochran 1989 were employed to identify the statistically significant orthogonal modes of variability from the pca scheme before the decomposition of tws over sa these test statistics ensured that only the significant orthogonal modes necessary to explain the non random variations in tws at 95 confidence level were used as inputs the filtering of tws using this method is given as e g ndehedehe et al 2016a 2 x t k 1 n a k p k where a k t are the temporal variations also called expansion coefficients or sometimes standardised scores and p k are the corresponding spatial maps empirical orthogonal functions eof loadings the leading orthogonal modes of tws a combination of the temporal and spatial patterns retained for further rotation are the first few pairs obtained from this technique each expansion coefficients represents a fraction of the total variation that is proportional to the amount of covariance in time explained by each eigenvector eof 3 2 decomposition of tws using the joint approximate diagonalisation of eigen matrices the jade joint approximate diagonalisation of eigen matrices technique is a generic algorithm for blind source separation e g cardoso and souloumiac 1993 cardoso 1999 common 1994 cardoso 1991 there are several formulations of the jade algorithm based on three cost functions e g ziehe 2005 however on grounds of numerical and computational efficiency the approach in this study was based on the joint diagonalization of the fourth order cumulant matrices as formulated and implemented by cardoso 1999 and cardoso and souloumiac 1993 after the pre orthogonalization of tws using the pca tool which yielded significant orthogonal modes of tws the fourth order cumulant matrices were then estimated these cumulants provide the suitable matrices to be diagonalized before a rotation towards statistical independence in this study the jade algorithm fully detailed in previous studies e g ziehe 2005 cardoso 1999 cardoso and souloumiac 1993 was used to rotate the pca regularised data matrix x i e eqn 2 through a contrast optimization by the joint diagonalization approach the rotated cumulant matrices resulted in well localised spatial maps m and temporal patterns a as e g ndehedehe et al 2016b 3 x tws x y t am where x y are pixel locations t is the monthly time step a is also known as independent components which is unit less since it has been normalised using its standard deviation while the corresponding spatial patterns m have been scaled using the normalised independent components i e a note that sst anomalies over the pacific and atlantic oceans were also subjected to the jade process before use in the partial least squares regression plsr model although one could argue that working with basin wise analysis of tws in the continent is rather easy the jade technique is employed to support the localisation both spatial and temporal of grace hydrological signals that could be masked by other leading signals resulting from strong rainfall seasonality and surface flow from other hydrological regions typical of the amazon floodplain so the jade analysis is essential to unpack hydrological elements signals in this region which are largely characterized by rainfall changes in floodplain rivers and complex hydrological processes this method was efficient in the volta basin where the lake volta shows strong gravitational signatures in the grace observations the jade rotation facilitated an understanding of the pseudo increase in tws over the volta basin caused by water impoundment of the lake at the akosombo dam despite more than a decade decline in observed rainfall ndehedehe et al 2017b through an innovative combination of this method with partial least squares regression section 3 3 1 this study attempts to provide further understanding related to both climate and non climatic processes that provide constraints on freshwater availability in south america furthermore the linear rates trends in observed time series of estimated tws over each river basin were estimated using the sen s slope sen 1968 estimator since it is robust and resistant to outliers sen slope s i is the median overall values of the whole data and is estimated as 4 s k median p j p i j i for 1 i j n where p j and p i represents data values at time j and i j i respectively while n is the number of observations in the time series to assess the significance of observed trends the null hypothesis of no trend h 0 was tested at α 0 05 using the man kendall s test mann 1945 kendall 1970 as one of our key objective here is to also assess tws rainfall relationship the spatial distribution of trends in tws with rainfall was examined to understand hydrological processes of the region 3 3 parameter estimation techniques 3 3 1 partial least squares regression model the partial least squares regression plsr model is a double barrel multivariate tool as it combines features from pca and mlra multi linear regression analysis as opposed to these multivariate techniques plsr is a better choice for analysing high dimensional data because of its robustness and adaptability e g chen et al 2018 de jong 1993 plsr looks for latent vectors which performs a simultaneous decomposition of independent variable x and response variable y e g lewis beck et al 2003 wold et al 2001 these plsr components are so determined to maximize the covariance between the two variables whilst complying with certain orthogonality and normalization constraints de jong 1993 in a simple formulation of the plsr model e g chen et al 2018 the data elements x i x i 1 x i 2 x i 3 x ip r p i 1 2 3 n with n as the observation samples and y i y i 1 y i 2 y i 3 y iq r q i 1 2 3 n where n is the corresponding dependent samples then the independent variable x x 1 x 2 x 3 x n r n p and the response variable y y 1 y 2 y 3 y n r n q the centered i e removing the mean data matrices x and y are decomposed as e g chen et al 2018 wold et al 2001 5 x n p t n 1 p p 1 e n p y n q u n 1 q q 1 f n q where t and u are latent vectors for the n observations p and q are the loading vectors while e and f are the residual matrices plsr model maximizes the squared covariance between the latent vectors t and u and obtains the projection vectors w and h as t x w and u y h lewis beck et al 2003 mentioned other ways of choosing the latent vectors and highlighted the iterative process of finding the latent vectors until x becomes a null matrix if a linear association exist between t and u e g chen et al 2018 wold et al 2001 de jong 1993 eq 5 above can be updated as 6 x tp e y tq f and through a least square solution p x t t t 1 and q y t t t 1 can be solved the regression between x and y results in c projection vectors and a set of weights w w 1 w 2 w 3 w c the latent components or factor scores can be obtained as chen et al 2018 de jong 1993 t t 1 t 2 t 3 t c while the loading matrices are formulated as p p 1 p 2 p 3 p c and q q 1 q 2 q 3 q c if eqn 6 is rewritten as 7 x tp e y tq f then from 8 t xw e y xwq f the final standard plsr relation between the predictor data matrix x sst and response y tws variables is 9 y x β f where β w q is the plsr coefficients after this multivariate calibration the modelling of tws for each river basin tws rb over south america is subsequently obtained as 10 tws rb β sst localisedmodes y res the predicted tws series were compared with the observed using several validation metrics and statistical index of model performance i e nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse refined index of agreement ia coefficient of determination r 2 and root mean square error rmse statistical details about the modified ia and the nse coefficients are available for interested readers e g willmott et al 2012 nash and sutcliffe 1970 further the jargue bera statistical normality test jarque and bera 1980 is an additional skill metric that was employed to validate the plsr model output by evaluating the normality of the computed residuals i e those obtained from the retrieved plsr components at the 95 confidence level and is computed as 11 jb n 6 s 2 k 3 2 4 where jb denotes jarque bera statistic n is the sample size s is the sample skewness and k is the sample kurtosis the jargue bera test is similar to the lagrange multiplier test and is preferred for large data sets given the unreliability of other normality tests when the sample size is large the test matches the skewness and kurtosis of data to examine if it matches a normal distribution of data be it errors in a regression model or time series data the significance of the probability values at 95 confidence level was determined by comparing the jargue bera test statistics with the critical value for the test if jarque bera is large then normality is rejected at α 0 05 3 3 2 multi linear regression analysis to explore the relationship between tws changes and precipitation patterns over sa multi linear regression analysis mlra was used to model the trends and harmonic components of tws mean annual and semi annual amplitudes of grace derived tws and precipitation time series this was achieved through the parameterizations of these components as reported in previous studies e g ndehedehe et al 2017 rieser et al 2010 trends and harmonic components in the data y i j at time t were parameterised using the mlra as e g rieser et al 2010 12 y i j t ξ 0 ξ 1 t i i max ξ 2 i cos i ω t ξ 2 i 1 sin i ω t ε t where the least square estimated coefficients ξ 0 is an offset ξ 1 linear trend and ξ 2 i and ξ 2 i 1 represent the periodic components in the data the annual amplitude of the data is captured when the period t of the angular frequency ω 2 π t is 12 months with the coefficients ξ 2 and ξ 3 along with their corresponding trigonometric base functions i e cos ω t and sin ω t representing the annual component the coefficients ξ 4 and ξ 5 represent the semi annual component while ε is the error term which is assumed to be normally distributed root mean square errors and coefficients of determination r 2 were employed to assess the skill of mlra in modelling tws and rainfall over south america 4 results 4 1 rotation of terrestrial water storage using higher order statistical algorithms other higher order statistical decomposition algorithms which uses the fixed point iteration scheme have been employed in filtering satellite gravity signals frappart et al 2011b frappart et al 2010 contrary to these algorithms the jade technique exploits the fourth order cumulants of the data matrix based on remote properties that include non stationarity spectral non flatness and non gaussianity e g ndehedehe et al 2016b ziehe 2005 cardoso 1999 common 1994 because of the statistical and numerical efficiency of the jade approach in solving the optimisation problem e g ziehe 2005 cardoso and souloumiac 1993 eight significant independent and well localised spatio temporal patterns will be interchangeably designated as regions of tws were recovered over south america sa these patterns highlights considerable inter annual variability and regional grace hydrological signals over the continent fig 2 the surface water dynamics of the amazon basin and much of brazil dominate the independent patterns of tws in sa tws 1 and tws 2 figs 2 and 3 and together account for approximately 60 of the total variability region one is localised over the amazon floodplain cf figs 2 and 3 and the exchange of water fluxes within this domain is somewhat complex apart from the indication that the highest proportion of stored water on the amazon floodplain comes from the mainstem river alsdorf et al 2010 also found that the mainstem discharge was higher compared to the sum of annual water storage and that drained from the amazon floodplain although variations in surface waters represent a considerable component of tws as observed by grace e g frappart et al 2011a kim et al 2009 han et al 2009 the strong exchange of fluxes within the floodplain corridors explains why the dominant patterns of tws over sa is observed over the amazon floodplain tws 1 figs 2 and 3 this is consistent with the results of frappart et al 2013 who found the strongest spatial loadings of tws along the solimões amazon corridor and includes the south of the amazonian and the negro basins in regions three and four tws 3 and tws 4 figs 2 and 3 observed grace hydrological signals are annual variations with probable contributions from multi scale climate oscillations e g el ninõ southern oscillation enso related teleconnections some studies found the connections between enso and inter annual tws variations in these regions e g ni et al 2018 linage et al 2013 phillips et al 2012 by further exploring the interplay between enso teleconnections and grace hydrological signals for regions three northern brazil and four venezuela we also found strong evidence that suggests climate teleconnection driven influence on tws dynamics but it is not clear which hydrological stores or component of grace tws e g surface water soil moisture aquifer etc provides this response to climate the grace hydrological signal in region five tws 5 figs 2 and 3 is the melting of the patagonia ice field consistent with this study different methods which includes forward modeling approach have been employed to highlight the continued mass loss in patagonia rodell et al 2018 willis et al 2012 chen et al 2007a this extensive and unabated mass loss in patagonia ice field tws 5 fig 3 is caused by the warming of the climate system and being the second largest ice body in the southern hemisphere grace is a viable tool for the continued monitoring of the impact of rising temperature on ice fields note that similar to the jade algorithm estimated negative trends observed over the patagonia ice field using the sen s slope and multi linear regression model are consistent sections 4 2 1 and 4 3 2 region six tws 6 figs 2 and 3 highlights amplitudes of tws in the chile region but with most parts falling within argentina while region seven tws 7 figs 2 and 3 depicts multi annual variations in tws over south brazil and the neighbouring central argentina with a weak opposite phase in north east brazil having experienced repeated earthquakes deformations and other forms of natural disturbances e g ruiz and madariaga 2018 jaramillo et al 2017 vigny et al 2011 lomnitz 2004 the geophysical signals in chile and the neighbouring argentina is expected to be dominated and driven by natural and climatic elements the temporal pattern tws 6 fig 3 associated with this signal in the chile argentina regions tws 6 fig 2 show a falling amplitude between 2005 and 2011 while the period after 2011 shows a rising trend consistent with the results in section 4 3 note that region 6 tws 6 fig 2 also indicates relatively strong opposite tws anomalies in the central amazon basin area and could be related to floodplain and wetland water storage gain between 2005 and 2010 i e when jointly interpreted from the corresponding temporal patterns tws 6 fig 3 and again coincides with numerical results in section 4 3 the argument here is that elevation of the flood plains of amazon basin low elevation areas less than 200 m above mean sea level coincides with the unique features of tws for region 6 e g the region with the most freshwater fig 1 as depicted in its spatial patterns tws 6 fig 2 that is the spatial patterns with positive loadings in chile and environ tws 6 fig 2 are interpreted as wet conditions or gain in surface mass if multiplied with its corresponding positive amplitudes in fig 3 similarly the spatial patterns with negative loadings in fig 2 amazon region are interpreted as wet conditions or rise in surface mass if multiplied with its corresponding negative amplitudes tws 6 fig 3 the low elevation areas of the amazon and the strong annual fluctuations tws 6 fig 3 suggests that it appears to be a rather permanent wetland water storage induced by rainfall seasonality cf fig 1 as opposed to the high elevation areas of chile greater than 3500 m above mean sea level which shows annual fluctuations in tws it can be argued that elevation plays a role in the amazon flood plain wetland water storage notably this amazon signal region 6 is different from regions 1 and 2 where river storage exchange of fluxes between tributaries including vertical movement of shallow groundwater could be major drivers of grace derived tws variations along the amazon corridor regarding the spatial patterns in region 7 tws 7 fig 2 the strongest signals with opposite phase occur within southern brazil the corresponding time series tws 7 fig 3 show relatively strong negative anomalies in 2004 and 2009 before the strong rise that occurred after 2010 the peak negative anomalies in 2004 and 2009 appear to coincide with severe droughts in the region especially the summer drought of 2004 2005 as highlighted further in section 4 2 1 the short term trends in tws and rainfall during this period around this region 2012 2017 show consistency between 2012 and 2014 but with small dissimilarity during the 2010 2012 period and can be explored further in future studies that focus on this region region eight tws 8 figs 2 and 3 is the grace hydrological signal native to north east brazil e g sun et al 2016 the declining trend in tws during the 2011 2015 period and the strongest negative anomaly observed between 2014 and 2015 tws 8 fig 3 coincide with the widely reported super extreme droughts that ravaged most eastern sections of brazil during the same period especially 2015 e g ferreira et al 2018 zou et al 2018 getirana 2016 this prolonged drought which occurred in much of north east brazil during most of the 2010 2013 period resulting in considerable declines in tws tws 8 fig 3 triggered the need to improve drought related policy and management strategies at various levels of government in brazil see gutierrez et al 2014 owing to limited annual rainfall north east brazil is generally a water deficit region and depends on surface water from the amazon basin for irrigation and hydropower generation the sao francisco river basin in brazil depends on water transfers between river basins moreover the national water agency of brazil reported in 2015 that 79 of total water withdrawn was for irrigated agriculture hence grace is a viable hydrological tool to support the monitoring of hydrological drought and its impacts on water availability and human abstraction see ferreira et al 2018 4 2 assessing inter annual variations and changes in tws in this section results for the region specific twelve river basins estimates of linear rates in tws are highlighted these river basins are among the well known global river basins add to this time series of tws grids are compared to those of rainfall over sa based on cross correlograms 4 2 1 recent changes in tws in south american river basins observed temporal variations in the 15 year grace derived tws over 12 river basins are marked with strong fluctuations with an estimated linear rate of 11 29 1 71 mm yr sao francisco showed the strongest fall while parana indicated the strongest rise 6 88 1 13 mm yr in tws during the 2002 2017 period fig 4 the summary of mann kendall s test statistics for all significant α 0 05 linear trends observed in the 12 river basins for the two periods 2002 2017 and 2010 2017 analysed are highlighted in table 1 considering the estimated linear rates between 2010 and 2017 the strongest decline 38 48 7 90 mm yr in tws was found in orinoco while uruguay showed a considerable increase in tws 28 28 3 49 mm yr unlike other basins fig 4 and table 1 during the same period 2010 2017 significant increase in tws were also observed in parana 17 92 3 44 mm yr rio colorado 23 99 2 60 mm yr negro 13 0 3 27 mm yr and rio salado 25 17 2 78 mm yr while sao francisco 30 84 4 17 and parnaiba 24 42 4 95 indicated relatively strong negative trends in tws fig 4 and table 1 the spatial distribution of trends in tws and precipitation over south america suggest complex hydrological structures and processes for instance the long term declines in tws over chile argentina regions and melting of the patagonia ice field are inconsistent with rainfall figs 5 a and d this is because the factors driving the hydrology of these areas are beyond rainfall recall that these signals coincide with the spatial and temporal patterns in regions five and six tws 5 and tws 6 figs 2 and 3 and further highlights the effectiveness of the jade rotation in localizing geophysical signals further the analyses of short term trends 2010 2012 and 2012 2014 also highlights the remarkable difference in recent changes in tws in relation to rainfall such inconsistencies are mostly observed over venezuela brazil and argentina figs 5b c and e f however the tws trends in northeast brazil between 2012 and 2014 are consistent with those of rainfall figs 5e and f whereas tws in some regions in sa respond to changes in rainfall and climatic conditions as is the case in north east and southern brazil figs 5b c and e f the complex hydrogeological structures in some areas may trigger interesting hydrological processes to understands this processes the grid based tws rainfall association and phase lags during the entire period are explored in the next section by implementing a cross correlation 4 2 2 grace tws vs rainfall to explore the tws rainfall relationship cross correlation between detrended series of grace tws and gpcc rainfall was analysed from water budget equation tws changes in time in other words observed changes in tws balances precipitation minus evaporation and runoff figure 6 shows the lags presented as colored surface at which the two series present the maximum correlation coefficients presented as contour lines overall rainfall rates lead tws in approximately zero to three months for almost all of sa with correlation coefficient ranging from approximately 0 60 to 0 80 fig 6 for example considering the physiographic regions of sa the brazilian highlands the amazon rainforest and the gran chaco regions spreads across eastern bolivia western paraguay northern argentina and sections of brazil all indicate relatively high correlations with rainfall leading tws moreover the lianos and guiana highlands both at northern sa and the andes mountains apart from the portion that surrounds the altiplano and atacama desert present good phase agreement with high correlation coefficients while this shows good feedback of tws on rainfall for almost all sa the relationship between tws and rainfall during the period is statistically not significant at the 95 confidence interval however there are exceptions in the regions below latitude 16 which are arid regions characterized by relatively low precipitation rates fig 1b the chile coastline and the patagonia are regions where correlations are modest ranging from 0 40 to 0 60 and rainfall generally leads tws with a phase greater than four months fig 6 there are also some hydrological hot spots regions below latitude 16 with tws leading rainfall with a phase of 12 months but with high correlation only for the lake titicaca region cf fig 1 and 6 but around the patagonian region and chobut colorado and salgado basins correlation coefficients between the series are low r 0 40 indicating that the key driver of variations in tws is beyond rainfall for example the pampas of argentina approximately between latitudes 40 s to 32 s and longitudes 56 w to 64 w is characterized by annual precipitations of 500 1000 mm fig 1b tws shows relatively low annual peaks with a negative linear trends of 5 to 15 mm yr of mass loss this could be attributed to changes in the land use due to the crop rotations or natural vegetation which might decrease groundwater recharge and thus decrease tws storages e g kroes et al 2019 this is particularly true for patagonia since it is characteristically a dry climate as shown in region 6 figs 2 and fig 3 the patagonia ice fields are undergoing a contemporary melting and retreating of glacial ice and is consistent with previous studies e g willis et al 2012 chen et al 2007a the andean plateau altiplano presents a phase lead greater than twelve months for rainfall relative to tws series and includes part of the pampas region furthermore part of the pampas region southern also shows a phase lead of about 12 months tws lags rainfall in both cases we found that correlation coefficients were low mostly between around 0 10 and 0 20 and insignificant 4 3 modelling tws using parameter estimation techniques 4 3 1 partial least square regression prediction of river basin tws overall the temporal variations of tws are well predicted for most of the river basins fig 7 and show reasonable residuals and considerable association with observed tws based on three validation metrics used figs 8 a b in terms of the performance of plsr model time series of tws in the amazon orinoco tocantins and chobut basins were well predicted and showed optimum skills based on these validation metrics r 2 ia and nse these basins indicated r 2 ia and nse coefficients above 0 83 fig 8b but with chobut having the least residual and rmse fig 8a however rio colorado rio salado uruguay sao francisco and parnaiba indicated relatively higher tws residuals and rmses figs 7 and 8a the uncertainties i e residuals and rmses in predicted time series of tws in these locations were also reflected in their observed validation metrics with rio colorado showing the lowest r 2 0 49 ia 0 66 and nse 0 49 fig 8b the obvious poor performance of the plsr model in rio colorado rio salado and sao francisco fig 8a and b gives credence to the argument of the perceived contributions of non climatic elements to observed inter annual variations in tws especially for the basins located in brazil e g sao francisco uruguay and argentina the tws rainfall relationship as was highlighted in section 4 2 2 indicated poor association with considerable phase lags in most catchments this may not be unconnected with human water management as getirana 2016 for example found considerable correlations of monthly time series of twsa and ground based water storage observations with most reservoirs within southeastern brazil given the observed residuals and the index of agreement figs 7 and 8a it seems the predictability of tws based on hydro climatic variables could be challenging in some river basins of sa as indicated in fig 6 some of these regions andean plateau pampas etc showed low correlation values ranging from 0 00 to 0 20 and with more than 12 months in phase lag between 4 3 2 multi linear regression of tws grids in this section the results of simulated tws and rainfall grids over sa using the mlra technique are highlighted the mean annual amplitudes of rainfall observed over the amazon basin area is consistent with tws figs 9 a and f while the trends and mean semi annual amplitudes of tws show significant disparity and does not completely mimic the modelled patterns of rainfall figs 9b c and g h as opposed to rainfall the only spot with considerable semi annual signal is in the brazil section of the amazon basin figs 9b and g the dissimilarity in trends tws and rainfall especially those observed in brazil and argentina figs 9c and h confirm the complex geophysical processes in the continent as highlighted in previous sections overall the root mean square error rmse is relatively low over the arid regions of sa for rainfall and tws but somewhat higher for tws in the central amazon basin figs 9d and i such relatively high uncertainties may result from the influence of important processes of inter annual variability e g pacific decadal oscillation or the complex properties of the amazon floodplain as it relates to exchange of fluxes and water storage e g alsdorf et al 2010 however the coefficient of determination r 2 suggest the model predicts variations in tws and rainfall quite well with r 2 values ranging from 1 00 to 0 80 figs 9e and j except for r 2 values i e tws over patagonia figs 9e the regions that are poorly simulated in the two products are generally found below latitude 20 figs 9e and j the low r 2 values in tws for example could imply strong interactions with non climatic factors and or the multi linear regression model is not suitable for those locations overall the modelling of tws and rainfall over the amazon basin show a good fit and suggest it can be predicted quite well this is justified by the result in section 4 2 2 where the tws rainfall relationship around the brazilian highlands and much of the amazon rainforest is relatively high with rainfall leading tws but the plenitude of observed r 2 ranging from 0 to 0 30 in some regions of the continent could imply the predominant influence of other hydrological drivers e g natural disturbances and perturbations of multi scale global climate signals the influence of the latter on tws in tropical sa has been reported e g linage et al 2013 while the contributions of the former to changes in tws in the chile argentina regions have been affirmed in some studies e g rodell et al 2018 han et al 2010 5 discussion 5 1 assessing drivers of land water storage global climate is changing the impacts of such changes which have been attributed to rising anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases amongst other things are evident in natural systems and acceleration of the water cycle be it at regional or global scales the rise in global sea levels long term declines in rainfall and tws and increased frequency in flood and drought events e g rodell et al 2018 spinoni et al 2014 nka et al 2015 boening et al 2012 paeth et al 2012 van der molen et al 2011 sheffield and wood 2008 across the globe are some apparent indices of a changing global climate as with other regions whose tws variations and discharge are largely rainfall dependent e g ndehedehe 2019 ndehedehe et al 2016a phillips et al 2012 conway et al 2009 land water storage dynamics includes river discharge and surface runoff in sa are arguably driven by changes in climate and other key processes of inter annual variability such as enso e g linage et al 2013 de linage et al 2014 frappart et al 2013a frappart et al 2013 incessant extreme drought events in south america for instance have been linked to large scale variations in the tropical oceans pacific and atlantic this was recently echoed by erfanian et al 2017 who also found significant relationship between unparalleled drought events in south america and extreme anomalies in sst of the nearby oceans whereas inter annual changes in rainfall over tropical ecosystems are significantly modulated by the tropical oceans ndehedehe et al 2018 odekunle and eludoyin 2008 semazzi et al 1988 nicholson 2013 our results in section 4 1 confirm that these drought episodes have considerable impacts on tws this is true for brazil where the observed decline in tws between 2012 and 2015 tws 8 figs 2 3 and 5 coincided with the extreme drought that ravaged brazil during the period e g ferreira et al 2018 apart from the continued mass loss in patagonia tws 5 figs 2 and 3 caused by climate warming the observed tws rainfall relationship section 4 2 also highlights the importance of climate variability in observed variations in tws over most sub regions of sa within the context of tws response to climate variability induced rainfall there are indications however that some hydrological signals are not unconnected with non climatic influence in practical geodetic concepts as it relates to mass redistributions caused by changes in gravity fields chile tws 6 figs 2 and 3 is one of the most complex hydrological regions in sa ferreira et al 2019 because of its hydro geodetic characteristics and geophysical formation the chilean region and environ for example are vulnerable to vertical deformations seismicity and earthquakes see e g montecino et al 2017b montecino et al 2017a jaramillo et al 2017 some of these geodetic perturbations and disturbances as also found in other regions e g chen et al 2007b have enduring hydro ecological effects on the environments e g jaramillo et al 2017 hydrologically they leave behind extraneous geophysical signals that become available as an integral part of observed hydrological changes in such regions these signals complicate our understanding of land water storage drivers for example in the chile earthquake of 27 february 2010 han et al 2010 found a gravity anomaly of 5 μ gal with a spatial scale of 500 km east of the epicenter after the earthquake if we consider the relation between water storage change δ h in meters and gravitational attraction due to the water mass δ g tws m s2 as δ g tws 4 2 s y δ h the change in gravity due to the maule event of 5 10 8 m s2 would be equivalent to an apparent change in tws of about 39 mm considering s y the specific yield dimensionless equals 0 3 correcting the impacts of this gravity shift on the overall surface mass changes around the region is a complex geodetic problem and this was not address in this study since it is a localized effect since the inception of grace there have been at least four earthquakes e g 2010 mw 8 8 2014 mw 8 2 2015 mw 8 3 and 2016 mw 7 6 and other geodetic disturbances e g tsunamis and volcanism in chile e g ruiz and madariaga 2018 jaramillo et al 2017 montecino et al 2017b montecino et al 2017a vigny et al 2011 chen et al 2007a while han et al 2010 found strong gravity shift after the 2010 chile earthquake which affected gravity anomalies in argentina the observed tws trend in central argentina was partly attributed to this magnitude 8 8 earthquake in addition to natural drivers such as rainfall rodell et al 2018 it is obvious that the grace hydrological time series in fig 3 are mostly dominated by strong inter annual variations but when the trends annual and semi annual amplitudes of tws were isolated using a multi linear regression parameterisation region 6 tws 6 fig 3 showed a considerable rise in tws after 2011 when it was statistically decomposed not shown this rise in tws could be artificial jumps in surface mass variations related to post seismic deformations or coseismic jump in the geoid montecino et al 2017a based on the plsr model tws in sao francisco rio colorado and rio salado showed less association with climatic parameters this association results probably from a combined influence of human water management practices and other complex environmental conditions and processes mentioned earlier for instance in the sao francisco river basin in south america for example about 44 million people depend on water transfers between river basins further the national water agency of brazil reported in 2015 that 79 of total water withdrawn was for irrigated agriculture this kind of footprints and perhaps those caused by geodetic perturbations could leave behind surface mass variations that can be misconstrued or interpreted as those induced by rainfall seasonality also water limited regions in brazil mostly coincide with semi arid areas and those with fractured aquifers were there is heavy reliance on surface waters ana 2017 the linear trend observed in water limited basins such as sao francisco 30 84 4 17 mm yr between 2010 and 2017 in brazil shows a considerable fall table 1 and could result in a rise in water demand especially in the light of unprecedented changes in rainfall with a total of 19 361 man made reservoirs as at 2016 brazil apparently shows increased dependence on surface water resources for irrigation and hydropower with sao francisco being one of the major hotspots for surface water consumption ana 2017 hence this obvious anthropogenic footprint in the region is expected to impact the prediction of tws variations 5 2 predicting land water storage for an optimal prediction of tws response or dependent variables over each river basin a two step regularization approach that combined jade method and plsr was employed fourteen independent components of sst anomalies i e seven independent components each from the pacific and atlantic oceans i e independent variables obtained from the combined pca cumulant decomposition were used in the plsr model to predict tws a subset of the latent variables based on nine plsr components were retrieved and used to develop a prediction model the observed plsr model uncertainties fig 8 in the simulation of river basin tws using the leading independent sst modes from the pacific and atlantic oceans for some regions e g amazon orinoco tocantins etc suggest the considerable role of climate variability in long term changes in river basin tws however the plsr model was somewhat less effective in other river basins rio salado sao francisco rio colorado and uruguay given their modest skills r 2 ia and nse fig 8b and relatively high rsmes not shown the jarque bera statistical test for these basins p 0 5 0 1 0 2 0 5 0 39 for sao francisco rio colorado uruguay and rio salado respectively indicated the model s estimated residuals were not normally distributed as their probability values were greater than the 0 05 confidence level the modest predictive capacity of tws using climate components as exhibited by the plsr scheme in these basins merely imply that tws are significantly driven by non climatic factors as we have unpacked in previous sections the increasing dynamics in global tws owing to the combined influence of climate and other stressors restricts other conventional models e g least squares in predictive frameworks although it bears some similarity to principal component analysis i e in terms of seeking a hyperplane that maximizes the variance of the input variable preisendorfer 1988 one key advantage of the plsr model is that it mitigates the effect of multi collinearity e g biswas and kundu 2018 lewis beck et al 2003 wold et al 2001 by ensuring that only significant components relevant to the response variable are retained for the regression although the orthogonality of the principal components apparently also solves this multi collinearity problem the choice of an optimum subset of predictors however remains a key issue e g lewis beck et al 2003 wold et al 2001 the plsr scheme addresses this problem thus making it more suitable in the forecast of hydrological quantities such as grace derived tws this innate potential of the plsr model is what we have explored in this study for the prediction of river basin tws in south america for the first time and complements existing frameworks of other statistical predictive models deployed recently for routine analysis and modelling of climatic variables ndehedehe et al 2019 krepper et al 2018 biswas and kundu 2018 considering the low r 2 values in modelled tws optimising the multi linear regression model for improved freshwater prediction could imply an expansion of the independent variables unlike other regions where variations in rivers lakes and floodplains do not contribute to observed changes in grace tws getirana et al 2017 tws over the amazon basin is considerably driven mostly by its surface waters rivers and estuaries along the floodplain the dominant patterns of tws observed over the amazon basin in this study aligns with an earlier report by kim et al 2009 who found that river storage and sub surface flow accounted for about 73 of tws variations in amazon as opposed to the amazon region significant large scale alteration of hydrological processes resulting from multiple strings of human activities e g surface water developments and water diversion in other large watersheds are well known drivers of surface water hydrology e g ndehedehe et al 2019 wada et al 2017 hence independent variables e g river discharge and evapotranspiration are critical water budget quantities expected to improve freshwater prediction for the amazon basin in addition to accounting for climate teleconnection driven rainfall however accounting for human induced influence e g surface water developments and increased water abstraction in predictive models is challenging and may require advance statistical approaches for instance in the light of the observed strong gravimetric contributions of lake volta to grace derived tws over the volta basin a weighted least squares formulation of global spherical harmonic analysis was integrated with a fourth order cumulant statistics to isolate non climatic hydrological time series of surface water storage see ndehedehe et al 2017b by recovering this surface water contributions caused by human water management strategies tws over the volta basin can be predicted more accurately research problems that seek to quantify the impacts of anthropogenic contributions on regional or continental hydrology are new innovative directions that will support predictive frameworks and effective characterisation of key hydrologic metrics 6 conclusion the knowledge of global freshwater response to critical stressors e g human water abstraction is crucial to improving predictive frameworks that support water governance and management schemes hence an innovative approach that combined jade joint approximate diagonalisation of eigen matrices algorithm and partial least square regression was employed in this study to assess grace derived terrestrial water storage tws over south america sa the temporal evolutions of tws over prominent river basins in the continent was also predicted using independent patterns of sea surface temperature sst anomalies of the nearby oceans the conclusions from this study are summarised as follows 1 grace hydrological signals within the amazon basin and much of brazil dominate the independent patterns of tws in sa and together account for approximately 60 of the total variability the strong exchange of fluxes within the floodplain corridors of the amazon and the influence of climate modes explain why strong spatial patterns of tws is observed over the amazon basin and the entire tropical sa amongst other geophysical signals identified the jade rotation of tws over sa isolated the extensive and unabated mass loss in patagonia ice field caused by the warming of the climate system still on the jade rotation of tws we noted that the grace hydrological signals native to north east brazil are largely associated with extreme hydro climatic events droughts 2 having experienced repeated earthquakes seismicity deformations and other forms of natural disturbances the geophysical signals in chile and the neighbouring argentina are expected to be dominated and driven by both dynamical physical processes and climatic elements because of this complex hydro geodetic structure and geophysical formation interpreting grace hydrological signals in these regions is challenging and requires caution 3 estimated tws trends α 0 05 in the twelve river basins in sa for the 2010 2017 period indicates orinoco had the strongest fall 38 48 7 90 mm yr in tws while uruguay showed a considerable rise 28 28 3 49 mm yr unlike other basins during this same period 2010 2017 relatively strong increase in tws was also observed in rio colorado 23 99 2 60 mm yr and rio salado 25 17 2 78 mm yr while sao francisco 30 84 4 17 and parnaiba 24 42 4 95 indicated relatively strong negative trends in tws generally the grid based comparisons of rainfall and tws trends over some areas of sa are inconsistent and suggests that the hydrological drivers of these regions e g patagonia brazil argentina and venezuela are beyond rainfall 4 overall rainfall leads tws in approximately one to three months in much of sa with maximum correlation coefficients r ranging from approximately 0 6 to 0 8 especially around brazil and the amazon basin tws in some regions however show low and modest correlations with rainfall in these hydrological regions rainfall leads tws with a phase lag ranging from 2 4 months and indicate that apart from rainfall other key drivers of variations in tws exists since for example such regions are typically characterised by a dry climate similar conclusion applies to some hot spots in the semi arid north east brazil where the tws rainfall association is poor and not significant during the period 5 based on several skill metrics and the jarque bera statistical test for the plsr model output tws in sao francisco rio colorado and rio salado showed less association with climatic parameters this association could be the result of a combined influence of human water management practices and other complex environmental conditions and processes the roles of reservoir storage and dams on surface hydrology for example in sao francisco where water abstraction for irrigation is nearly 80 require further investigation considering the low r 2 values and uncertainties in modelled tws over sa in some hydrological regions optimising the multi linear regression model for improved freshwater prediction could imply an expansion of the independent variables

5979,a mobile immobile model mim of reactive solute transport for an injection well was investigated in a radial two zone confined aquifer system made up of the aquifer formation zone and the wellbore skin zone evolving from mud invasion or extensive well development fundamental transport processes such as advection radial dispersion first order reaction linear sorption and first order mass transfer between the mobile and immobile domains were considered the laplace transform and numerical inverse laplace methods were used to solve the model while the skin effect on the spatial concentration distribution as well as breakthrough curves btcs were analyzed the results indicate that a larger dispersivity or smaller effective porosity in the skin zone result in higher values of btcs at the early injection stage lower values at the late stage and higher peak values of btcs however an abrupt change for the spatial concentration distribution was observed at the interface of the skin and aquifer formation zones due to the dispersivity change in the skin zone it was also found that a larger mass transfer coefficient of the skin zone results in smaller values of btcs at the early injection stage but higher at the late stage the general conclusion is that the possible impacts of skin on radial solute transport are significant and should be taken into consideration in tracer injection tests keywords radial solute transport skin effects injection well mobile immobile model 1 introduction mathematical models based on the advection dispersion equation ade have been broadly used to investigate subsurface solute transport phenomena for at least five decades ogata and banks 1961 grisak and pickens 1981 you and zhan 2013 over the years several numerical models have been developed to solve complex issues such as flow transiency biogeochemical processes and heterogeneous transport problems singh and chatterjee 2016 wang et al 2017 lu et al 2018 xie et al 2019 however they are also limited due to the numerical challenges such as numerical dispersion artificial oscillation for eulerian approaches particularly mass balance violation for lagrangian approaches particularly and convergence issue analytical models on the other hand despite having several limitations and usually premised on simplified assumptions are still popular for elucidating solute transport mechanisms or processes verification of numerical models and parametric inversion lai et al 2016 li et al 2018 radial solute transport for an injection or extraction well that fully penetrates a homogeneously confined aquifer with a uniform thickness may be the simplest case in a non uniform flow field where analytical solutions can be obtained easily using integral technique the modified bessel functions and laplace transform technique ogata 1958 tang and babu 1979 moench and ogata 1981 wang and zhan 2013 sharifi haddad et al 2014 wang et al 2018 for instance ogata 1958 obtained an analytical solution of radial solute transport for an injection well using a complex integral technique but the solution was an integral form and difficult to evaluate tang and babu 1979 derived the complete solution for radial transport problems using modified bessel functions later moench and ogata 1981 used laplace transform technique to derive the semi analytical solution of radial transport in terms of airy functions and conducted the inverse transformation using the stehfest method stehfest 1970 thereafter laplace transform technique was used extensively for the investigation of radial transport problems for instance chen et al 2002 obtained a semi analytical solution for solute transport with a radial distance dependent velocity and dispersion coefficient using a laplace transform power series ltps technique in a radially convergent flow field in addition wang and zhan 2013 solved the coupled governing equations of radial reactive solute transport in an aquifer aquitard system considering the aquitard advection with the laplace transform and the finite cosine fourier transform method it is important to note that most of the previous analytical studies on radial solute transport are based on an important assumption for the ade that is fickian dispersion behavior the ade was found to work very well in relatively homogeneous aquifers such as the borden site in canada thorbjarnarson and mackay 1994 however in heterogeneous porous media it has been difficult to interpret accurately the anomalous transport which led to the so called non fickian phenomena such as multiple peaks and enhanced tails berkowitz et al 2000 leij et al 2012 a primary reason of anomalous transport is preferential flow paths which contribute little to all pore volume but significant to the mass flux making a portion of the solute migrate into the predominant stagnant regions of the flow regions the mobile immobile mim model presented by van genuchten and wierenga 1976 has been widely used to investigate these types of anomalous transport such as early arrival and long tail of the breakthrough curves btcs considering the solute exchange between mobile and immobile domains in heterogeneous porous media the results of griffioen et al 1998 pang and close 1999 and gao et al 2009 2010 showed that the mim model can better fit btcs in heterogeneous porous media than ade some analytical studies have been investigated with the mim model in push pull divergent convergent flow tracer tests le borgne and gouze 2008 zhou et al 2017 chen et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 studied the transport processes for a filled single fracture matrix system in radial flows using a mobile immobile approach and the results showed that the mobile immobile porosity ratios had significant impacts on the btcs chen et al 2017 found that first order rate limited mass transfer model for single well push pull swpp tracer tests can produce long tailed btcs in the above mentioned studies skin effects near a pumping well are usually neglected for radial solute transport it has been acknowledged that the small area of anomalous hydrogeological properties around the well screen may be called the skin zone barker and herbert 1982 houben 2015 porosity dispersivity and permeability in the region may change due to the intrusion of drilling mud or extensive well development novakowski 1989 yeh et al 2003 chen et al 2012 the radius of skin generally extends from a few millimeters to several meters barker and herbert 1982 huang et al 2015 resulting in a composite aquifer system houben et al 2016 also showed the data of the typology thickness composition and hydraulic properties of wellbore skin by sampling from excavated dewatering wells and abandoned water wells highlighting that several types of wellbore skins micro cracks and particle straining existed in a wellbore skin layer the skin can be classified into two general types i e a positive skin and negative skin if the skin zone has a lower permeability than that of the aquifer formation zone due to mud invasion the skin is defined as a positive skin park and zhan 2002 wen et al 2011 however if the skin zone has a higher permeability because of extensive well development and substantial spalling of the borehole it can be considered as negative skin chen and chang 2002 yeh et al 2003 such a skin either positive or negative will inevitably alter the effective porosity dispersivity and permeability around the test well which can be called skin effects hence such an effect must be taken into consideration for interpreting push pull divergent convergent flow in tracer tests therefore some hydrogeologists have paid close attention to the impacts of the skin zone on radial solute transport chen et al 2012 hsieh and yeh 2014 li et al 2019 chen et al 2012 developed an analytical solution for solute transport in a radial two zone confined aquifer where they investigated the impacts of the dispersivity on spatial concentration distributions in the skin zone similarly hsieh and yeh 2014 derived semi analytical approximate solutions for radial solute transport in a two zone confined aquifer system considering a third type robin condition based on the study of chen et al 2012 unfortunately they neglected the variation of the effective porosity in the skin zone li et al 2019 developed a numerical model of single well push pull swpp tracer tests in a radial two zone confined aquifer system accounting for different skin properties effective porosity dispersivity and thickness and types uniform skin or non uniform skin showing that the effective porosity and dispersivity have significant influences on the btcs consequently it is also meaningful to investigate the impacts of effective porosity of the skin zone on push pull divergent convergent flow tracer tests although the impacts of skin have been considered in radial solute transport models the impacts of effective porosity in the skin zone on btcs have been neglected especially for analytical solutions of radial solute transport in addition the use of ade has been frequently questioned by several of the aforementioned cases the mobile immobile solute mass transfer should therefore be introduced into the model of radial solute transport to better describe solute transport in a radial two zone confined aquifer hence the objective of this study is to develop a new mobile immobile model for radial reactive solute transport with steady flow in a two zone confined aquifer which has hitherto not been reported yet fundamental transport processes in the skin and aquifer formation zones are considered in the model including advection dispersion first order reaction linear sorption and first order mass transfer between the mobile and immobile domains firstly we will develop the semi analytical solutions of radial solute transport using the laplace transform which will be verified by the numerical solutions based on finite element comsol multiphysics secondly the impacts of effective porosity dispersivities and thickness in the skin zone on spatial concentration distribution and btcs will be analyzed thirdly we compare our solution with different radial solute transport models finally the impacts of the mobile immobile porosity ratios and the mobile immobile solute mass transfer rates will be assessed 2 conceptual and mathematical models to illustrate the effects of skin on the radial solute transport a reactive solute is used in the model a confined aquifer is assumed to be unbounded laterally with a uniform thickness b a cylindrical coordinate system is established with the origin at the center of the injection well which has a finite radius rw and a screen that fully penetrates the aquifer in addition the skin zone and outer aquifer are assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic thus two zones are defined in the radial direction first the skin zone which is located around the injection well and has a thickness of r 1 rw where r 1is the radius of patchy zone and rw is the well radius the second zone is known as the aquifer formation zone illustrated in fig 1 in the model the following assumptions are applied in both the skin and aquifer formation zones the liquid phase of porous medium includes mobile flowing and immobile stagnant regions the advection dispersion transport is restricted to the mobile liquid region and the solute exchange between these two liquid regions can be described as a first order mass transfer process the solute adsorption by the solid phase is described with a linear isotherm and a first order reaction is considered as well the mobile and immobile domains could have different retardation factors parker and valocchi 1986 zhou et al 2017 and different reaction rates gao et al 2010 based on the above conceptual description the mobile immobile model mim of a reactive solute under radial steady state flow in the skin zone can be described as 1 θ 1 m r 1 m c 1 m t θ 1 i m r 1 i m c 1 i m t θ 1 m 1 r r r d 1 c 1 m r θ 1 m v 1 c 1 m r θ 1 m r 1 m λ 1 m c 1 m r w r r 1 2 θ 1 i m r 1 i m c 1 i m t ω 1 c 1 m c 1 i m θ 1 i m

calculated as r2m 1 ρ2km θm and r2im 1 ρ2kim θim where ρ is the bulk density m l3 k is the equilibrium distribution coefficient l3m 1 d is the radial dispersion coefficient l2 t which is velocity dependent depicted in the skin and aquifer formation zones respectively as 5 d 1 α 1 v 1 d 0 and 6 d 2 α 2 v 2 d 0 where α 1 and α 2 are the radial dispersivity in the skin and aquifer formation zones respectively l v 1 and v 2 are the pore velocity in the radial direction for the skin and aquifer formation zones respectively l t d 0 is the effective molecular diffusion coefficient l2 t which is usually much smaller than αv and can be ignored therefore the radial dispersion coefficients in the skin and aquifer formation zones are simplified as d 1 α 1 v 1 and d 2 α 2 v 2 respectively the flow of injection well is assumed to be steady state thus the groundwater flow velocities in the skin and aquifer formation zones can be expressed as 7 v 1 q 2 π θ 1 m b r r w r r 1 t 0 and 8 v 2 q 2 π θ 2

detailed procedure for solving the constant concentration in the laplace domain is presented in appendix a 3 2 2 case 2 pulse type boundary condition the initial for the pulse type release of solutes is the same as case 1 except the difference in the boundary condition from eq 36 it can be noted that the general solutions for this case were obtained by the same methods given in the case 1 hence the solutions of c 1 m d and c 2 m d considering pulse type boundary condition in the laplace domain can be expressed as 44 c 1 m d eq 42 t t 0 1 exp s τ 0 e q 42 t t 0 and 45 c 2 m d eq 43 t t 0 1 exp s τ 0 e q 43 t t 0 3 2 3 case 3 instantaneous release of solutes the initial for the instantaneous release of solutes is the same as cases 1 and 2 except the difference in the boundary condition from eq 37 it can be noted that the general solutions for case 3 were obtained by the same methods given in cases 1 and 2 the solutions of c 1 m d and c 2 m d factoring instantaneous release of solutes in the laplace domain can be expressed as 46 c 1 m d ms v r r w e q 42 and 47 c 2 m d ms v r r w e q 43 the solutions of the constant source the pulse source and the instantaneous source in the laplace domain in the two zone confined aquifer system are listed in table 1 the solutions are hereinafter called the mims solution s represents skin effect which means the solutions for the solute transport with skin effect considering a mobile immobile model mim if ω 1 ω 2 0 and k 1 im k 2 im 0 this solution is equivalent to the ades solution which means that the mobile porosity is equal to the total porosity when all the pore spaces are well connected with negligible immobile porosity and the ades can also be regarded as the solution for solute transport with skin effect using an advection dispersion equation ade in addition the ades solution will transform into ade solution and the mims solution will transform into mim solution without skin effect when r 1 rw it is notable that the solutions listed above are obtained in laplace domain which can be inversed into analytical solutions in the real time domain by applying analytical or numerical inversion techniques it seems that it is impossible to inverse the laplace transform solutions in this study analytically alternatively the numerical inverse laplace method will be introduced to obtain semi analytical solutions in the real time domain in this study the stehfest method stehfest 1970 is used to do such calculation 3 3 verification of the solutions to check the accuracy of our analytical model a numerical model of the solute transport in the two zone confined aquifer system factoring constant concentration condition is developed using finite element comsol multiphysics this model considering a special case yields a benchmark solution to verify our ades solution as shown in fig 2 a radial two dimensional 2 d steady state groundwater flow model was developed using finite element comsol multiphysics the radius of the model region was set to be 20 m and the well has a radius of 0 1 m the aquifer thickness is 5 m while the model domain was discretized into 6314 elements the simulated time span of tracer injection was 2 h the other parameters are given as qinj 2 5 m3 h α 1 0 5 m 1 0 m 2 m α 2 1 m θ 1 0 2 and θ 2 0 3 respectively c 0 at r rw was set as 1 0 mol m3 the results in fig 3 show that our semi analytical solution agrees very well with the numerical solution highlighting its reliability for the following analysis the default values of the parameters are listed in table 2 4 results and discussion in this section ades and mims solutions are used to illustrate the impacts of the skin zone on the radial solute transport process where the case of pulse type boundary condition is considered as an example in the following analysis for the ades solution we assume the mobile porosity i e effective porosity is equal to the total porosity when all the pore spaces are well connected with negligible immobile porosity hence the parameters are set as θ 1 θ 1m and θ 2 θ 1m respectively in addition for the sake of simplicity the sorption and reaction of solute were not considered under this simplification the values of k 1 m k 1 im k 2 m k 2 im λ 1 m λ 1 im λ 2 m and λ 2 im are equal to 0 and the above default values of the parameters are considered in the following sections 4 1 effects of dispersivities and porosities of skin on the radial solute transport firstly we analyze the impacts of dispersivities and effective porosities in the skin zone on the radial solute transport using the ades solution figs 4a and b show the concentration distribution curves at tinj 3 h and the btcs observed at r 2 m with different dispersivities in the skin zone the parameters are given as r 1 0 8 m θ 1 θ 2 0 3 α 2 0 5 m α 1 0 1 m 0 5 m and 2 5 m respectively hence the dimensionless parameters calculated in eq 16 are k 2 1 k 1 0 2 1 and 5 respectively k 1 1 represents α 1 α 2 while k 1 1 represents α 1 α 2 note that the case of k 1 1 and k 2 1 represents the case without the skin zone the other parameters are the same as those listed in table 2 as shown in fig 4a at the same distance a smaller dispersivity in the skin zone results in a shorter transport distance of concentration peak value at a specific time tinj 3 h and it can also be observed that a larger dispersivity in the skin zone leads to a lower concentration near the well and a higher concentration in the area far away from the well in addition the slopes of the concentration curves are significantly different at the interface between the skin and aquifer formation zones and it is obvious that a smaller dispersivity in the skin zone leads to steeper concentration curves in the skin zone fig 4b shows the btcs observed at r 2 m with different dispersivities in the skin zone indicating that a larger dispersivity in the skin zone results in a higher concentration at the early injection stage but a lower concentration at the late stage furthermore a larger dispersivity in the skin zone results in a higher peak value of btcs while a smaller dispersivity in the skin zone results in a longer tail of solute transport this is because a larger dispersivity in the skin zone contributes to faster tracer transport through hydrodynamic dispersion which leads to a lower concentration distribution near the well and higher values of btcs at the early stage after the pulse type injection therefore the variation in dispersivity around the test well can result in significant impacts on the concentration distribution and the btcs in a tracer injection test figs 5a and b show the concentration distribution curves at tinj 3 h and the btcs observed at r 2 m with different effective porosities the parameters are given as r 1 0 8 m α 1 α 2 0 5 m θ 2 0 3 θ 1 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 hence the dimensionless parameters calculated in eq 16 are k 1 1 k 2 3 5 1 and 3 respectively k 2 1 represents θ 1 θ 2 while k 2 1 represents θ 1 θ 2 as illustrated in fig 5a at same distance it is notable that a larger effective porosity in the skin zone result in a shorter transport distance of concentration peak value at a specific time tinj 3 h and it can also be observed that a larger effective porosity in the skin zone leads to a higher concentration near the well but a lower concentration away from the well and conversely the case a smaller effective porosity similarly we can also note the variation in effective porosity in the skin zone does not change the slopes of the concentration curve at the interface between the skin and aquifer formation zones which is different from the impacts of dispersivity indicated by fig 4a fig 5b shows the btcs with different effective porosities in the skin zone at r 2 m indicating that a larger effective porosity of skin zone results in a lower concentration at the early injection stage and a higher concentration at the late stage it is also noteworthy that a smaller effective porosity in the skin zone results in a larger peak value of the btcs while a larger one results in a longer tail of solute transport this is because a larger k 2 means a smaller effective porosity in the skin zone comparably from eq 7 variation of θ 1 means a different pore flow velocity in the skin zone therefore a smaller effective porosity results in a faster solute transport process and vice versa in the skin zone which generally results in a lower concentration distribution near the well and higher values of btcs at the early stage after the pulse type injection 4 2 effects of skin thickness on radial solute transport in this section we analyze the impacts of skin thickness on the radial solute transport using the ades solution figs 6a and b show the concentration distribution curves at tinj 3 h and the btcs observed at r 2 m with different skin thicknesses the parameters are given as r 1 0 4 m 0 8 m θ 1 0 1 0 3 0 5 θ 2 0 3 α 2 0 5 m α 1 0 25 m 0 5 m and 1 m respectively hence the dimensionless parameters are k 1 0 5 1 2 k 2 3 1 and 3 5 respectively clearly the discrepancy between the curve of k 1 2 k 2 3 r 1 0 8 and that of k 1 0 5 k 2 3 5 r 1 0 8 is larger than the discrepancy between the curve of k 1 2 k 2 3 r 1 0 4 and that of k 1 0 5 k 2 3 5 r 1 0 4 which means that a larger skin thickness strengthens the influence of dispersivity and porosity on the radial solute transport consequently a larger skin thickness results in a larger transport distance of concentration peak value fig 6b shows the btcs with different skin thicknesses at r 2 m indicating that a larger skin thickness results in a higher concentration at the early injection stage but a lower concentration at the late stage in the cases of k 1 2 and k 2 3 correspondingly larger skin thickness leads to a larger peak value of btcs with a shorter tail of solute transport however it is conversely true for the case where k 1 0 5 and k 2 3 5 where a larger skin thickness results in a lower concentration at the early injection stage but a higher concentration at the late stage and lower peak values with longer tails of btcs this is because a larger r 1 strengthens the influence of the skin on radial solute transport resulting in a greater change in btc shapes 4 3 comparisons between mim and ade with skin effect as mentioned above the wellbore skin has a significant effect on concentration distribution curves and btcs using advection dispersion equation ade however the use of ade has been questioned by many hydrogeologists in recent years because this law cannot adequately account for anomalous transport in heterogeneous porous media as stated earlier therefore we investigate the characteristics of radial solute transport using the mims solution in this section fig 7 shows the concentration distribution curves in the mobile and immobile domains at tinj 3 h with different dispersivities and mobile porosities of the skin zone the parameters of the mims solution are given as θ 1m 0 1 0 3 0 5 θ 1im 0 1 θ 2m 0 3 θ 2im 0 1 α 2 0 5 m α 1 0 25 m 0 5 m and 1 m respectively hence the dimensionless parameters are k 1 0 5 1 2 k 2 3 1 and 3 5 and the immobile mobile ratios are β 2 1 3 β 1 1 5 1 3 and 1 respectively the results indicate that dispersivities and mobile porosities in the skin zone for mims have significant effects on the concentration distribution curves in the mobile domain the explanation is similar to that for figs 4 and 5 in addition it can be observed that the solute transfer into the immobile region from the mobile region at a large distance and the solute transfer between the mobile and immobile regions reach equilibrium in the middle resulting in the concentration being equal in the two regions fig 7 conversely the solute transfer into the mobile region from the immobile region near the injection well results in a long tail phenomenon of solute transport in further highlight the differences between the different transport models figs 8a and 8b show the concentration distribution curves at tinj 3 h and the btcs observed at r 2 m with different radial transport models the parameters of the mims solution are given as r 1 0 8 m θ 1m 0 5 θ 1im 0 1 θ 2m 0 3 θ 2im 0 1 α 1 0 25 m α 2 0 5 m and ω 1 ω 2 0 05 h respectively hence the dimensionless parameters are k 1 0 5 k 2 3 5 β 1 1 5 and β 2 1 3 respectively for the cases of ade no skin and ades we assume that mobile porosity or effective porosity is equal to the total porosity i e θ 1 θ 1m 0 5 θ 2 θ 2m 0 3 firstly contrasting between the ade and mim fig 8a shows that the peak value of mim is lower than that of the ade because the mim separates the liquid regime into mobile and immobile regions with the solute transfer between the two regions secondly the comparison between the mim and mims results shows evidently fig 8a that the skin leads to a higher concentration near the well while lower concentration is observed further away from the well thirdly the concentration curve of the ades solution has a higher peak value compared to that of the mims fig 8a this suggests that the solute transfer between these two regions of skin has a more significant impact on spatial concentration distribution fig 8b shows the btcs observed at r 2 m with different radial transport models indicating that the btcs of ade has the highest peak value while the btcs of the mims solution has the lowest peak value therefore the skin zone and the solute transfer between the mobile and immobile domains can result in reduction in peak values of btcs conversely the btcs of the mims solution have the longest tail of solute transport while the btcs of ade have the shortest tail of solute transport this is due to the facts that a smaller dispersivity or a larger porosity can result in lower peak values but longer tails of btcs and also mim separates the liquid regime into mobile and immobile domains with the solute transfer between these two domains therefore in practice the impacts of the skin properties effective porosity and dispersivity and mass transfer around an injection well should not be neglected for tracer injection tests 4 4 effects of the mobile immobile ratios and transfer coefficients on radial solute transport to further illustrate the salient effects of the solute transfer between the mobile and immobile regions on the solute transport in the skin zone an example is used to analyze the btcs of the mobile domain using the mims model the parameters of the mims model are given as r 1 1 m α 1 0 25 m α 2 0 5 m θ 2m 0 3 θ 2im 0 1 and ω 1 ω 2 0 05 h respectively in addition for the computations involving different mobile immobile ratios θ 1m and θ 1im will change accordingly with the constraint of θ 1m θ 1im 0 4 hence the immobile mobile ratios β 1 1 3 and 7 respectively and a special case an extreme case where there is no immobile domain in the skin zone where θ 1m 0 4 θ 1im 0 is also considered in this study as a reference a sampling point of r 2 m is picked in the aquifer formation zone for the discussion of btcs it is worthwhile to note that some related studies used fixed dispersivities α 1 and α 2 dronfield and silliman 1993 zhou et al 2017 to analyze the transport process as shown in eq 5 the relationship between d 1 and α 1 can be simplified as d 1 α 1 v 1 α 1 q 2πrbθ 1m while neglecting the molecular diffusion coefficient in fig 9 the btcs in radial flow are plotted with different mobile immobile ratios β 1 in the case of constant dispersivity and total porosity it is obvious that the btcs are moderately sensitive to the β 1 in the skin zone and a smaller β 1 means a smaller mobile porosity in the skin zone the results also show that a smaller mobile porosity in the skin zone for the mims model leads to a higher concentration at the early injection stage but a lower concentration at the late stage the same effects of mobile porosity on the btcs can be found for the ades model as shown in fig 5b in addition it is notable that a smaller mobile porosity in the skin zone for the mims model results in a lower peak value of btcs while that of the ades model results in a higher peak value of btcs this highlights the different characteristics between the transports of the ades and mims models which can be elaborated as follows firstly a smaller mobile porosity of the skin zone means a faster pore velocity according to eq 7 resulting in a faster solute transport in the skin zone therefore the btcs of the ades and mims models have higher concentrations at the early injection stage secondly from time scale calculation the mass transfer for mims model does not have enough time to reach equilibrium at the early injection stage therefore the btcs of the mims model have higher concentrations at the early injection stage however at the late injection stage the mass transfer for the mims model has enough time to reach equilibrium therefore a smaller β 1 means a larger immobile domain which also signifies that a larger percentage of mass can be transferred to the immobile domain resulting in lower values of the btcs at the late injection stage in addition the mass transfer coefficient has a significant influence on the solute transport in the mobile domain several investigations have shown that the mass transfer coefficient is dependent on the pore velocity retardation coefficient and particle size brusseau 1992 harmon et al 1992 maraqa 2001 abgaze and sharma 2015 considering that the skin and aquifer formation zones have different pore velocity retardation coefficient and particle size due to the drilling mud or extensive well development the skin zone has different mass transfer coefficient from the aquifer formation zone additionally we analyze the impacts of the mass transfer coefficient of the skin zone on the btcs as shown in fig 10 the parameters used are given as follows r 1 1 m α 1 0 25 m α 2 0 5 m θ 1m 0 4 θ 1im 0 1 θ 2m 0 3 θ 2im 0 1 ω 2 0 05 h ω 1 0 04 h 0 02 h and 0 1 h it is obvious that a larger ω 1 results in lower values of btcs at the early injection stage but higher values at the late stage and lower peak values of btcs in fig 10 this is because a larger ω 1 means a larger percentage of mass transferred to the immobile domain resulting in lower values of btcs at the early injection stage and lower peak values of btcs 5 summary and conclusions this study presents a mobile immobile model for radially reactive solute transport in a two zone confined aquifer based on the model of chen et al 2012 the mathematical models are solved based on airy functions using a laplace transform technique and subsequently the semi analytical solution in the real time space was generated by a numerical inverse laplace method using the stehfest method the validity of the semi analytical solution for a special case ades was validated and proven to be robust and accurate by the numerical solution based on finite element comsol multiphysics besides the mims solution can be used to elucidate the impacts of skin properties effective porosity dispersivity and thickness solute mass transfer between mobile and immobile domains as well as effects of different boundary conditions on spatial concentration distributions and btcs based on the above study the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the dispersivity of the skin zone has significant impacts on the spatial concentration distributions and the btcs in a two zone confined aquifer system based on the ades model a larger dispersivity in the skin zone leads to a lower concentration near the well and a higher concentration away from the well for the spatial concentration distributions whereas a smaller dispersivity results in steeper concentration curves in the skin zone in addition a larger dispersivity in the skin zone results in higher values of btcs at the early injection stage lower values at the late stage and higher peak values of btcs 2 the effective porosities in the skin zone have significant effects on the concentration distribution curves where a larger effective porosity results in a higher concentration near the well and a lower concentration away from the well furthermore the variation in porosity in the skin zone does not change the slopes of the concentration curves at the interface between the skin and aquifer formation zones which has a remarkably different performance from the changes observed in dispersivity again larger effective porosity in the skin zone results in lower values of the btcs at the early injection stage but generates higher values at the late stage 3 the mims solution has the lowest peak values of the btcs meaning that the skin effect and the solute transfer between the mobile and immobile regions can result in the decrease of peak values of btcs where a larger mass transfer coefficient results in lower values of the btcs at the early injection stage also higher values are observed at the late stage with lower peak values of btcs notably a smaller mobile porosity in the skin zone leads to a higher concentration at the early injection stage but a lower concentration at the late stage with constant total porosity resulting in lower peak values of the btcs due to the solute transfer between mobile and immobile regions 4 the general conclusion is that the possible impacts of skin zone on the injection tests are significant and should be taken into consideration especially for the mobile porosity similarly a potential application of this study is the interpretation of tracer tests conducted using an injection well or heat trace tests in view of the similarity of the solute and heat transport in the subsurface declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

5979,a mobile immobile model mim of reactive solute transport for an injection well was investigated in a radial two zone confined aquifer system made up of the aquifer formation zone and the wellbore skin zone evolving from mud invasion or extensive well development fundamental transport processes such as advection radial dispersion first order reaction linear sorption and first order mass transfer between the mobile and immobile domains were considered the laplace transform and numerical inverse laplace methods were used to solve the model while the skin effect on the spatial concentration distribution as well as breakthrough curves btcs were analyzed the results indicate that a larger dispersivity or smaller effective porosity in the skin zone result in higher values of btcs at the early injection stage lower values at the late stage and higher peak values of btcs however an abrupt change for the spatial concentration distribution was observed at the interface of the skin and aquifer formation zones due to the dispersivity change in the skin zone it was also found that a larger mass transfer coefficient of the skin zone results in smaller values of btcs at the early injection stage but higher at the late stage the general conclusion is that the possible impacts of skin on radial solute transport are significant and should be taken into consideration in tracer injection tests keywords radial solute transport skin effects injection well mobile immobile model 1 introduction mathematical models based on the advection dispersion equation ade have been broadly used to investigate subsurface solute transport phenomena for at least five decades ogata and banks 1961 grisak and pickens 1981 you and zhan 2013 over the years several numerical models have been developed to solve complex issues such as flow transiency biogeochemical processes and heterogeneous transport problems singh and chatterjee 2016 wang et al 2017 lu et al 2018 xie et al 2019 however they are also limited due to the numerical challenges such as numerical dispersion artificial oscillation for eulerian approaches particularly mass balance violation for lagrangian approaches particularly and convergence issue analytical models on the other hand despite having several limitations and usually premised on simplified assumptions are still popular for elucidating solute transport mechanisms or processes verification of numerical models and parametric inversion lai et al 2016 li et al 2018 radial solute transport for an injection or extraction well that fully penetrates a homogeneously confined aquifer with a uniform thickness may be the simplest case in a non uniform flow field where analytical solutions can be obtained easily using integral technique the modified bessel functions and laplace transform technique ogata 1958 tang and babu 1979 moench and ogata 1981 wang and zhan 2013 sharifi haddad et al 2014 wang et al 2018 for instance ogata 1958 obtained an analytical solution of radial solute transport for an injection well using a complex integral technique but the solution was an integral form and difficult to evaluate tang and babu 1979 derived the complete solution for radial transport problems using modified bessel functions later moench and ogata 1981 used laplace transform technique to derive the semi analytical solution of radial transport in terms of airy functions and conducted the inverse transformation using the stehfest method stehfest 1970 thereafter laplace transform technique was used extensively for the investigation of radial transport problems for instance chen et al 2002 obtained a semi analytical solution for solute transport with a radial distance dependent velocity and dispersion coefficient using a laplace transform power series ltps technique in a radially convergent flow field in addition wang and zhan 2013 solved the coupled governing equations of radial reactive solute transport in an aquifer aquitard system considering the aquitard advection with the laplace transform and the finite cosine fourier transform method it is important to note that most of the previous analytical studies on radial solute transport are based on an important assumption for the ade that is fickian dispersion behavior the ade was found to work very well in relatively homogeneous aquifers such as the borden site in canada thorbjarnarson and mackay 1994 however in heterogeneous porous media it has been difficult to interpret accurately the anomalous transport which led to the so called non fickian phenomena such as multiple peaks and enhanced tails berkowitz et al 2000 leij et al 2012 a primary reason of anomalous transport is preferential flow paths which contribute little to all pore volume but significant to the mass flux making a portion of the solute migrate into the predominant stagnant regions of the flow regions the mobile immobile mim model presented by van genuchten and wierenga 1976 has been widely used to investigate these types of anomalous transport such as early arrival and long tail of the breakthrough curves btcs considering the solute exchange between mobile and immobile domains in heterogeneous porous media the results of griffioen et al 1998 pang and close 1999 and gao et al 2009 2010 showed that the mim model can better fit btcs in heterogeneous porous media than ade some analytical studies have been investigated with the mim model in push pull divergent convergent flow tracer tests le borgne and gouze 2008 zhou et al 2017 chen et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 studied the transport processes for a filled single fracture matrix system in radial flows using a mobile immobile approach and the results showed that the mobile immobile porosity ratios had significant impacts on the btcs chen et al 2017 found that first order rate limited mass transfer model for single well push pull swpp tracer tests can produce long tailed btcs in the above mentioned studies skin effects near a pumping well are usually neglected for radial solute transport it has been acknowledged that the small area of anomalous hydrogeological properties around the well screen may be called the skin zone barker and herbert 1982 houben 2015 porosity dispersivity and permeability in the region may change due to the intrusion of drilling mud or extensive well development novakowski 1989 yeh et al 2003 chen et al 2012 the radius of skin generally extends from a few millimeters to several meters barker and herbert 1982 huang et al 2015 resulting in a composite aquifer system houben et al 2016 also showed the data of the typology thickness composition and hydraulic properties of wellbore skin by sampling from excavated dewatering wells and abandoned water wells highlighting that several types of wellbore skins micro cracks and particle straining existed in a wellbore skin layer the skin can be classified into two general types i e a positive skin and negative skin if the skin zone has a lower permeability than that of the aquifer formation zone due to mud invasion the skin is defined as a positive skin park and zhan 2002 wen et al 2011 however if the skin zone has a higher permeability because of extensive well development and substantial spalling of the borehole it can be considered as negative skin chen and chang 2002 yeh et al 2003 such a skin either positive or negative will inevitably alter the effective porosity dispersivity and permeability around the test well which can be called skin effects hence such an effect must be taken into consideration for interpreting push pull divergent convergent flow in tracer tests therefore some hydrogeologists have paid close attention to the impacts of the skin zone on radial solute transport chen et al 2012 hsieh and yeh 2014 li et al 2019 chen et al 2012 developed an analytical solution for solute transport in a radial two zone confined aquifer where they investigated the impacts of the dispersivity on spatial concentration distributions in the skin zone similarly hsieh and yeh 2014 derived semi analytical approximate solutions for radial solute transport in a two zone confined aquifer system considering a third type robin condition based on the study of chen et al 2012 unfortunately they neglected the variation of the effective porosity in the skin zone li et al 2019 developed a numerical model of single well push pull swpp tracer tests in a radial two zone confined aquifer system accounting for different skin properties effective porosity dispersivity and thickness and types uniform skin or non uniform skin showing that the effective porosity and dispersivity have significant influences on the btcs consequently it is also meaningful to investigate the impacts of effective porosity of the skin zone on push pull divergent convergent flow tracer tests although the impacts of skin have been considered in radial solute transport models the impacts of effective porosity in the skin zone on btcs have been neglected especially for analytical solutions of radial solute transport in addition the use of ade has been frequently questioned by several of the aforementioned cases the mobile immobile solute mass transfer should therefore be introduced into the model of radial solute transport to better describe solute transport in a radial two zone confined aquifer hence the objective of this study is to develop a new mobile immobile model for radial reactive solute transport with steady flow in a two zone confined aquifer which has hitherto not been reported yet fundamental transport processes in the skin and aquifer formation zones are considered in the model including advection dispersion first order reaction linear sorption and first order mass transfer between the mobile and immobile domains firstly we will develop the semi analytical solutions of radial solute transport using the laplace transform which will be verified by the numerical solutions based on finite element comsol multiphysics secondly the impacts of effective porosity dispersivities and thickness in the skin zone on spatial concentration distribution and btcs will be analyzed thirdly we compare our solution with different radial solute transport models finally the impacts of the mobile immobile porosity ratios and the mobile immobile solute mass transfer rates will be assessed 2 conceptual and mathematical models to illustrate the effects of skin on the radial solute transport a reactive solute is used in the model a confined aquifer is assumed to be unbounded laterally with a uniform thickness b a cylindrical coordinate system is established with the origin at the center of the injection well which has a finite radius rw and a screen that fully penetrates the aquifer in addition the skin zone and outer aquifer are assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic thus two zones are defined in the radial direction first the skin zone which is located around the injection well and has a thickness of r 1 rw where r 1is the radius of patchy zone and rw is the well radius the second zone is known as the aquifer formation zone illustrated in fig 1 in the model the following assumptions are applied in both the skin and aquifer formation zones the liquid phase of porous medium includes mobile flowing and immobile stagnant regions the advection dispersion transport is restricted to the mobile liquid region and the solute exchange between these two liquid regions can be described as a first order mass transfer process the solute adsorption by the solid phase is described with a linear isotherm and a first order reaction is considered as well the mobile and immobile domains could have different retardation factors parker and valocchi 1986 zhou et al 2017 and different reaction rates gao et al 2010 based on the above conceptual description the mobile immobile model mim of a reactive solute under radial steady state flow in the skin zone can be described as 1 θ 1 m r 1 m c 1 m t θ 1 i m r 1 i m c 1 i m t θ 1 m 1 r r r d 1 c 1 m r θ 1 m v 1 c 1 m r θ 1 m r 1 m λ 1 m c 1 m r w r r 1 2 θ 1 i m r 1 i m c 1 i m t ω 1 c 1 m c 1 i m θ 1 i m

calculated as r2m 1 ρ2km θm and r2im 1 ρ2kim θim where ρ is the bulk density m l3 k is the equilibrium distribution coefficient l3m 1 d is the radial dispersion coefficient l2 t which is velocity dependent depicted in the skin and aquifer formation zones respectively as 5 d 1 α 1 v 1 d 0 and 6 d 2 α 2 v 2 d 0 where α 1 and α 2 are the radial dispersivity in the skin and aquifer formation zones respectively l v 1 and v 2 are the pore velocity in the radial direction for the skin and aquifer formation zones respectively l t d 0 is the effective molecular diffusion coefficient l2 t which is usually much smaller than αv and can be ignored therefore the radial dispersion coefficients in the skin and aquifer formation zones are simplified as d 1 α 1 v 1 and d 2 α 2 v 2 respectively the flow of injection well is assumed to be steady state thus the groundwater flow velocities in the skin and aquifer formation zones can be expressed as 7 v 1 q 2 π θ 1 m b r r w r r 1 t 0 and 8 v 2 q 2 π θ 2

expressed as 13 c 1 m r w t c 0 t 0 where c 0 is constant source concentration the second boundary condition is pulse type boundary condition 14 c 1 m r w t c 0 t t 0 0 t t 0 where t0 is the duration of injection t the third boundary condition is instantaneous solute input condition 15 c 1 m r w t m δ t v r r w t 0 where m is the total amount of mass added to a unit area m l2 δ t is the dirac

detailed procedure for solving the constant concentration in the laplace domain is presented in appendix a 3 2 2 case 2 pulse type boundary condition the initial for the pulse type release of solutes is the same as case 1 except the difference in the boundary condition from eq 36 it can be noted that the general solutions for this case were obtained by the same methods given in the case 1 hence the solutions of c 1 m d and c 2 m d considering pulse type boundary condition in the laplace domain can be expressed as 44 c 1 m d eq 42 t t 0 1 exp s τ 0 e q 42 t t 0 and 45 c 2 m d eq 43 t t 0 1 exp s τ 0 e q 43 t t 0 3 2 3 case 3 instantaneous release of solutes the initial for the instantaneous release of solutes is the same as cases 1 and 2 except the difference in the boundary condition from eq 37 it can be noted that the general solutions for case 3 were obtained by the same methods given in cases 1 and 2 the solutions of c 1 m d and c 2 m d factoring instantaneous release of solutes in the laplace domain can be expressed as 46 c 1 m d ms v r r w e q 42 and 47 c 2 m d ms v r r w e q 43 the solutions of the constant source the pulse source and the instantaneous source in the laplace domain in the two zone confined aquifer system are listed in table 1 the solutions are hereinafter called the mims solution s represents skin effect which means the solutions for the solute transport with skin effect considering a mobile immobile model mim if ω 1 ω 2 0 and k 1 im k 2 im 0 this solution is equivalent to the ades solution which means that the mobile porosity is equal to the total porosity when all the pore spaces are well connected with negligible immobile porosity and the ades can also be regarded as the solution for solute transport with skin effect using an advection dispersion equation ade in addition the ades solution will transform into ade solution and the mims solution will transform into mim solution without skin effect when r 1 rw it is notable that the solutions listed above are obtained in laplace domain which can be inversed into analytical solutions in the real time domain by applying analytical or numerical inversion techniques it seems that it is impossible to inverse the laplace transform solutions in this study analytically alternatively the numerical inverse laplace method will be introduced to obtain semi analytical solutions in the real time domain in this study the stehfest method stehfest 1970 is used to do such calculation 3 3 verification of the solutions to check the accuracy of our analytical model a numerical model of the solute transport in the two zone confined aquifer system factoring constant concentration condition is developed using finite element comsol multiphysics this model considering a special case yields a benchmark solution to verify our ades solution as shown in fig 2 a radial two dimensional 2 d steady state groundwater flow model was developed using finite element comsol multiphysics the radius of the model region was set to be 20 m and the well has a radius of 0 1 m the aquifer thickness is 5 m while the model domain was discretized into 6314 elements the simulated time span of tracer injection was 2 h the other parameters are given as qinj 2 5 m3 h α 1 0 5 m 1 0 m 2 m α 2 1 m θ 1 0 2 and θ 2 0 3 respectively c 0 at r rw was set as 1 0 mol m3 the results in fig 3 show that our semi analytical solution agrees very well with the numerical solution highlighting its reliability for the following analysis the default values of the parameters are listed in table 2 4 results and discussion in this section ades and mims solutions are used to illustrate the impacts of the skin zone on the radial solute transport process where the case of pulse type boundary condition is considered as an example in the following analysis for the ades solution we assume the mobile porosity i e effective porosity is equal to the total porosity when all the pore spaces are well connected with negligible immobile porosity hence the parameters are set as θ 1 θ 1m and θ 2 θ 1m respectively in addition for the sake of simplicity the sorption and reaction of solute were not considered under this simplification the values of k 1 m k 1 im k 2 m k 2 im λ 1 m λ 1 im λ 2 m and λ 2 im are equal to 0 and the above default values of the parameters are considered in the following sections 4 1 effects of dispersivities and porosities of skin on the radial solute transport firstly we analyze the impacts of dispersivities and effective porosities in the skin zone on the radial solute transport using the ades solution figs 4a and b show the concentration distribution curves at tinj 3 h and the btcs observed at r 2 m with different dispersivities in the skin zone the parameters are given as r 1 0 8 m θ 1 θ 2 0 3 α 2 0 5 m α 1 0 1 m 0 5 m and 2 5 m respectively hence the dimensionless parameters calculated in eq 16 are k 2 1 k 1 0 2 1 and 5 respectively k 1 1 represents α 1 α 2 while k 1 1 represents α 1 α 2 note that the case of k 1 1 and k 2 1 represents the case without the skin zone the other parameters are the same as those listed in table 2 as shown in fig 4a at the same distance a smaller dispersivity in the skin zone results in a shorter transport distance of concentration peak value at a specific time tinj 3 h and it can also be observed that a larger dispersivity in the skin zone leads to a lower concentration near the well and a higher concentration in the area far away from the well in addition the slopes of the concentration curves are significantly different at the interface between the skin and aquifer formation zones and it is obvious that a smaller dispersivity in the skin zone leads to steeper concentration curves in the skin zone fig 4b shows the btcs observed at r 2 m with different dispersivities in the skin zone indicating that a larger dispersivity in the skin zone results in a higher concentration at the early injection stage but a lower concentration at the late stage furthermore a larger dispersivity in the skin zone results in a higher peak value of btcs while a smaller dispersivity in the skin zone results in a longer tail of solute transport this is because a larger dispersivity in the skin zone contributes to faster tracer transport through hydrodynamic dispersion which leads to a lower concentration distribution near the well and higher values of btcs at the early stage after the pulse type injection therefore the variation in dispersivity around the test well can result in significant impacts on the concentration distribution and the btcs in a tracer injection test figs 5a and b show the concentration distribution curves at tinj 3 h and the btcs observed at r 2 m with different effective porosities the parameters are given as r 1 0 8 m α 1 α 2 0 5 m θ 2 0 3 θ 1 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 hence the dimensionless parameters calculated in eq 16 are k 1 1 k 2 3 5 1 and 3 respectively k 2 1 represents θ 1 θ 2 while k 2 1 represents θ 1 θ 2 as illustrated in fig 5a at same distance it is notable that a larger effective porosity in the skin zone result in a shorter transport distance of concentration peak value at a specific time tinj 3 h and it can also be observed that a larger effective porosity in the skin zone leads to a higher concentration near the well but a lower concentration away from the well and conversely the case a smaller effective porosity similarly we can also note the variation in effective porosity in the skin zone does not change the slopes of the concentration curve at the interface between the skin and aquifer formation zones which is different from the impacts of dispersivity indicated by fig 4a fig 5b shows the btcs with different effective porosities in the skin zone at r 2 m indicating that a larger effective porosity of skin zone results in a lower concentration at the early injection stage and a higher concentration at the late stage it is also noteworthy that a smaller effective porosity in the skin zone results in a larger peak value of the btcs while a larger one results in a longer tail of solute transport this is because a larger k 2 means a smaller effective porosity in the skin zone comparably from eq 7 variation of θ 1 means a different pore flow velocity in the skin zone therefore a smaller effective porosity results in a faster solute transport process and vice versa in the skin zone which generally results in a lower concentration distribution near the well and higher values of btcs at the early stage after the pulse type injection 4 2 effects of skin thickness on radial solute transport in this section we analyze the impacts of skin thickness on the radial solute transport using the ades solution figs 6a and b show the concentration distribution curves at tinj 3 h and the btcs observed at r 2 m with different skin thicknesses the parameters are given as r 1 0 4 m 0 8 m θ 1 0 1 0 3 0 5 θ 2 0 3 α 2 0 5 m α 1 0 25 m 0 5 m and 1 m respectively hence the dimensionless parameters are k 1 0 5 1 2 k 2 3 1 and 3 5 respectively clearly the discrepancy between the curve of k 1 2 k 2 3 r 1 0 8 and that of k 1 0 5 k 2 3 5 r 1 0 8 is larger than the discrepancy between the curve of k 1 2 k 2 3 r 1 0 4 and that of k 1 0 5 k 2 3 5 r 1 0 4 which means that a larger skin thickness strengthens the influence of dispersivity and porosity on the radial solute transport consequently a larger skin thickness results in a larger transport distance of concentration peak value fig 6b shows the btcs with different skin thicknesses at r 2 m indicating that a larger skin thickness results in a higher concentration at the early injection stage but a lower concentration at the late stage in the cases of k 1 2 and k 2 3 correspondingly larger skin thickness leads to a larger peak value of btcs with a shorter tail of solute transport however it is conversely true for the case where k 1 0 5 and k 2 3 5 where a larger skin thickness results in a lower concentration at the early injection stage but a higher concentration at the late stage and lower peak values with longer tails of btcs this is because a larger r 1 strengthens the influence of the skin on radial solute transport resulting in a greater change in btc shapes 4 3 comparisons between mim and ade with skin effect as mentioned above the wellbore skin has a significant effect on concentration distribution curves and btcs using advection dispersion equation ade however the use of ade has been questioned by many hydrogeologists in recent years because this law cannot adequately account for anomalous transport in heterogeneous porous media as stated earlier therefore we investigate the characteristics of radial solute transport using the mims solution in this section fig 7 shows the concentration distribution curves in the mobile and immobile domains at tinj 3 h with different dispersivities and mobile porosities of the skin zone the parameters of the mims solution are given as θ 1m 0 1 0 3 0 5 θ 1im 0 1 θ 2m 0 3 θ 2im 0 1 α 2 0 5 m α 1 0 25 m 0 5 m and 1 m respectively hence the dimensionless parameters are k 1 0 5 1 2 k 2 3 1 and 3 5 and the immobile mobile ratios are β 2 1 3 β 1 1 5 1 3 and 1 respectively the results indicate that dispersivities and mobile porosities in the skin zone for mims have significant effects on the concentration distribution curves in the mobile domain the explanation is similar to that for figs 4 and 5 in addition it can be observed that the solute transfer into the immobile region from the mobile region at a large distance and the solute transfer between the mobile and immobile regions reach equilibrium in the middle resulting in the concentration being equal in the two regions fig 7 conversely the solute transfer into the mobile region from the immobile region near the injection well results in a long tail phenomenon of solute transport in further highlight the differences between the different transport models figs 8a and 8b show the concentration distribution curves at tinj 3 h and the btcs observed at r 2 m with different radial transport models the parameters of the mims solution are given as r 1 0 8 m θ 1m 0 5 θ 1im 0 1 θ 2m 0 3 θ 2im 0 1 α 1 0 25 m α 2 0 5 m and ω 1 ω 2 0 05 h respectively hence the dimensionless parameters are k 1 0 5 k 2 3 5 β 1 1 5 and β 2 1 3 respectively for the cases of ade no skin and ades we assume that mobile porosity or effective porosity is equal to the total porosity i e θ 1 θ 1m 0 5 θ 2 θ 2m 0 3 firstly contrasting between the ade and mim fig 8a shows that the peak value of mim is lower than that of the ade because the mim separates the liquid regime into mobile and immobile regions with the solute transfer between the two regions secondly the comparison between the mim and mims results shows evidently fig 8a that the skin leads to a higher concentration near the well while lower concentration is observed further away from the well thirdly the concentration curve of the ades solution has a higher peak value compared to that of the mims fig 8a this suggests that the solute transfer between these two regions of skin has a more significant impact on spatial concentration distribution fig 8b shows the btcs observed at r 2 m with different radial transport models indicating that the btcs of ade has the highest peak value while the btcs of the mims solution has the lowest peak value therefore the skin zone and the solute transfer between the mobile and immobile domains can result in reduction in peak values of btcs conversely the btcs of the mims solution have the longest tail of solute transport while the btcs of ade have the shortest tail of solute transport this is due to the facts that a smaller dispersivity or a larger porosity can result in lower peak values but longer tails of btcs and also mim separates the liquid regime into mobile and immobile domains with the solute transfer between these two domains therefore in practice the impacts of the skin properties effective porosity and dispersivity and mass transfer around an injection well should not be neglected for tracer injection tests 4 4 effects of the mobile immobile ratios and transfer coefficients on radial solute transport to further illustrate the salient effects of the solute transfer between the mobile and immobile regions on the solute transport in the skin zone an example is used to analyze the btcs of the mobile domain using the mims model the parameters of the mims model are given as r 1 1 m α 1 0 25 m α 2 0 5 m θ 2m 0 3 θ 2im 0 1 and ω 1 ω 2 0 05 h respectively in addition for the computations involving different mobile immobile ratios θ 1m and θ 1im will change accordingly with the constraint of θ 1m θ 1im 0 4 hence the immobile mobile ratios β 1 1 3 and 7 respectively and a special case an extreme case where there is no immobile domain in the skin zone where θ 1m 0 4 θ 1im 0 is also considered in this study as a reference a sampling point of r 2 m is picked in the aquifer formation zone for the discussion of btcs it is worthwhile to note that some related studies used fixed dispersivities α 1 and α 2 dronfield and silliman 1993 zhou et al 2017 to analyze the transport process as shown in eq 5 the relationship between d 1 and α 1 can be simplified as d 1 α 1 v 1 α 1 q 2πrbθ 1m while neglecting the molecular diffusion coefficient in fig 9 the btcs in radial flow are plotted with different mobile immobile ratios β 1 in the case of constant dispersivity and total porosity it is obvious that the btcs are moderately sensitive to the β 1 in the skin zone and a smaller β 1 means a smaller mobile porosity in the skin zone the results also show that a smaller mobile porosity in the skin zone for the mims model leads to a higher concentration at the early injection stage but a lower concentration at the late stage the same effects of mobile porosity on the btcs can be found for the ades model as shown in fig 5b in addition it is notable that a smaller mobile porosity in the skin zone for the mims model results in a lower peak value of btcs while that of the ades model results in a higher peak value of btcs this highlights the different characteristics between the transports of the ades and mims models which can be elaborated as follows firstly a smaller mobile porosity of the skin zone means a faster pore velocity according to eq 7 resulting in a faster solute transport in the skin zone therefore the btcs of the ades and mims models have higher concentrations at the early injection stage secondly from time scale calculation the mass transfer for mims model does not have enough time to reach equilibrium at the early injection stage therefore the btcs of the mims model have higher concentrations at the early injection stage however at the late injection stage the mass transfer for the mims model has enough time to reach equilibrium therefore a smaller β 1 means a larger immobile domain which also signifies that a larger percentage of mass can be transferred to the immobile domain resulting in lower values of the btcs at the late injection stage in addition the mass transfer coefficient has a significant influence on the solute transport in the mobile domain several investigations have shown that the mass transfer coefficient is dependent on the pore velocity retardation coefficient and particle size brusseau 1992 harmon et al 1992 maraqa 2001 abgaze and sharma 2015 considering that the skin and aquifer formation zones have different pore velocity retardation coefficient and particle size due to the drilling mud or extensive well development the skin zone has different mass transfer coefficient from the aquifer formation zone additionally we analyze the impacts of the mass transfer coefficient of the skin zone on the btcs as shown in fig 10 the parameters used are given as follows r 1 1 m α 1 0 25 m α 2 0 5 m θ 1m 0 4 θ 1im 0 1 θ 2m 0 3 θ 2im 0 1 ω 2 0 05 h ω 1 0 04 h 0 02 h and 0 1 h it is obvious that a larger ω 1 results in lower values of btcs at the early injection stage but higher values at the late stage and lower peak values of btcs in fig 10 this is because a larger ω 1 means a larger percentage of mass transferred to the immobile domain resulting in lower values of btcs at the early injection stage and lower peak values of btcs 5 summary and conclusions this study presents a mobile immobile model for radially reactive solute transport in a two zone confined aquifer based on the model of chen et al 2012 the mathematical models are solved based on airy functions using a laplace transform technique and subsequently the semi analytical solution in the real time space was generated by a numerical inverse laplace method using the stehfest method the validity of the semi analytical solution for a special case ades was validated and proven to be robust and accurate by the numerical solution based on finite element comsol multiphysics besides the mims solution can be used to elucidate the impacts of skin properties effective porosity dispersivity and thickness solute mass transfer between mobile and immobile domains as well as effects of different boundary conditions on spatial concentration distributions and btcs based on the above study the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the dispersivity of the skin zone has significant impacts on the spatial concentration distributions and the btcs in a two zone confined aquifer system based on the ades model a larger dispersivity in the skin zone leads to a lower concentration near the well and a higher concentration away from the well for the spatial concentration distributions whereas a smaller dispersivity results in steeper concentration curves in the skin zone in addition a larger dispersivity in the skin zone results in higher values of btcs at the early injection stage lower values at the late stage and higher peak values of btcs 2 the effective porosities in the skin zone have significant effects on the concentration distribution curves where a larger effective porosity results in a higher concentration near the well and a lower concentration away from the well furthermore the variation in porosity in the skin zone does not change the slopes of the concentration curves at the interface between the skin and aquifer formation zones which has a remarkably different performance from the changes observed in dispersivity again larger effective porosity in the skin zone results in lower values of the btcs at the early injection stage but generates higher values at the late stage 3 the mims solution has the lowest peak values of the btcs meaning that the skin effect and the solute transfer between the mobile and immobile regions can result in the decrease of peak values of btcs where a larger mass transfer coefficient results in lower values of the btcs at the early injection stage also higher values are observed at the late stage with lower peak values of btcs notably a smaller mobile porosity in the skin zone leads to a higher concentration at the early injection stage but a lower concentration at the late stage with constant total porosity resulting in lower peak values of the btcs due to the solute transfer between mobile and immobile regions 4 the general conclusion is that the possible impacts of skin zone on the injection tests are significant and should be taken into consideration especially for the mobile porosity similarly a potential application of this study is the interpretation of tracer tests conducted using an injection well or heat trace tests in view of the similarity
